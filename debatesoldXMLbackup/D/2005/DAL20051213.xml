      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Reflecting the consideration at the European Council during discussions on the draft treaty and <Col N="322"/>conscious of the evolved change in our society, the Government considered that it would be of value to institute an open, transparent and regular dialogue with churches and non-confessional organisations. Accordingly, my Department initiated contact with many churches and faith communities to explore how such a dialogue might be established and what its scope might be. The Government has proposed that the dialogue process be structured on the following basis.</P>
        <P>An annual bilateral meeting should take place with each representative body, at which the State would be led by a member of the Government &mdash; this responsibility would be shared between Ministers &mdash; and should include senior officials from appropriate Departments identified in the discussions to prepare the agenda. An annual reception should be held for all participants in the dialogue which would be addressed by the Taoiseach or another member of the Government and to which as many members of the Government as possible would be invited. An ongoing channel of communication should be maintained at official level with the Government, with a view to improving awareness and engagement. Consultation on the implementation of these arrangements has been taking place at official level. I expect the dialogue will formally commence at Government level in the new year. The churches and faith communities make an important contribution to the life of this country, not least through the participation of church representatives and church-based organisations, for example in the National Forum on Europe and through social partnership. In keeping with the nature of dialogue, I do not expect any immediate conclusions. I envisage an open-ended process that would, in principle, be capable of addressing any matter of mutual interest or concern. I am concerned, however, that this new channel should not displace the existing and ongoing consultation and dialogue between churches and church-based organisations and the various civil authorities in matters of their functional responsibilities.</P>
        <P>Any future structured dialogue which might be put in place will, of course, have to be open, inclusive and transparent and fully in accordance with the provisions of Article 44 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, which guarantees freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>More than a year has elapsed since the Minister for Foreign Affairs made this announcement. Will the Taoiseach explain the delay in getting it underway? Will he say something further about the structure? Did he say it would be led by one Minister or that Ministers will take it in turn and what type of format will it follow?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with his backbench colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell, that there should be a clearer separation between church and State? Will he comment in particular in that con<Col N="323"/>text on last Sunday&rsquo;s opinion poll which showed that half the people favour the Government reviewing the Catholic Church&rsquo;s participation in first-level education in the fashion it does?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will recall that this was to be part of the European constitutional provisions. Unfortunately the constitution did not go ahead because of the defeats in the early summer in the Netherlands and France, so that matter is in abeyance. Notwithstanding that, we engaged in dialogue and reached agreement, having consulted with all the churches and all the faith groups. There is a long list, if anyone wants me to go through them. That process was concluded by the end of June. We then suggested to them how we might best deal with this matter and bring it forward. The basis agreed is half-yearly meetings. Responsibility is to be shared by Ministers so the same Minister will not have to interface with different churches or faith groups. It will probably depend on the Minister and the officials as to what the issues will be.</P>
        <P>Most importantly, all the churches and faith groups have their own agendas on which they like to continue to deal with Departments, and they do so on a regular basis as regards health, education, equality and other issues. As far as I am concerned the separation of church and State exists. It is well documented and practised and it works well. On the education issue, the churches have already said they are looking at this because of the declining numbers available to carry out these roles, and it is a matter of how that will pan out. From my own perspective I trust this will not roll out too quickly because we will be at a huge loss without them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to put a specific point to the Taoiseach, as to whether, for example, he intends to discuss the Ferns Report with the Catholic Church. In that context and in the light of Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s explicit criticisms of the indemnity deal, will he take her advice on board and review that deal and its terms, which exposes the taxpayer to what the Comptroller and Auditor General has estimated will be close to &euro;1,000 million while capping the liability of the religious congregations concerned? In light of Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s remarks, is the Taoiseach minded to review that deal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not see an issue. I would consider an issue like that in so far as there is the normal dialogue between church and State, but in this case there is also a legal question and the legal process is involved. In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, there is no proposal before Government to review the arrangement on the compensation to those hurt people who were affected. The State was responsible for these institutions because the State sent people to them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="324"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question, there are approximately 3,000 primary schools in the ownership of the church in the Republic and approximately 32 diocesan colleges and there are problems with a number of these. One does not wish to deny the contribution made to education over the years by the church but given the decline in vocations and the problems to which this gives rise, will the ownership of schools be a central issue for discussions with the Catholic Church and, to a lesser extent, the Church of Ireland? Will the matter of the need for a significant increase in the number of multidenominational schools also be discussed, given the growth in interest in such schools in various parts of the country? I am sure the Taoiseach has been lobbied on this issue. Will these topics be central to the discussions with the churches?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in my reply to Deputy Rabbitte, those issues are dealt with in the normal course of discussions between the churches and Departments, in this case, the Department of Education and Science. This issue will need to be discussed and debated with the churches.</P>
        <P>A number of new religions are now being practised in our country because we have a large immigrant population, including workers from the new EU states. The issue of education also arises and those discussions are being carried on separately by the Department of Education and Science. The management of schools is an issue which the churches have raised because of their declining population. This is a problem which arises not only in education but also in health and other areas where the churches have given the State excellent service over the generations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that it is one year since the announcement of this proposal for Government and inter-faith dialogue, will the Taoiseach indicate the number of submissions received to date? Is it his intention to publish those submissions? He has stated on previous occasions that meetings to date with various church bodies have taken place on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. He also stated it has been the practice that church leaders call annually or biannually to the Department of the Taoiseach. Am I correct in assuming there is some basis for dialogue between the churches and Government? Will the Taoiseach indicate the number of different church representatives who have visited his Department on an annual or biannual basis? The total of 170 faith groups would keep him very busy if he were to meet them individually on an annual or biannual basis. When will the proposal be brought to fruition?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of questions in that. The proposal is being brought to fruition. The Government signed off on it in June and made the churches aware of the proposals, and they made some response. The churches have <Col N="325"/>an arrangement &mdash; traditionally, the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, Presbyterians and Methodists, and in the past few years the Jewish community &mdash; where if there is an issue regarding their schools, health, home or institution in which they are involved, they go to the relevant Department about it, as would anybody else. When I say it is an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement, that is what happens, they are as entitled to do that as anybody else, particularly when they manage those institutions and the issue affects their people. Those issues would occur in normal circumstances.</P>
        <P>What was envisaged in the Constitution and what happens in other countries is more extended in that the churches have an opportunity to attend concordats. This is done formally in a number of European countries. The French are the latest to do this, but they are following a large number of other countries. We have looked at that model and our view is we should follow it.</P>
        <P>What normally happens &mdash; this has happened in my time and previously &mdash; is that the Archbishop of Dublin traditionally calls to the Taoiseach of the day at Christmas time for a short visit. The Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, now John Neill, would perhaps call in on some of his issues once a year. More recently, the Islamic Foundation of Ireland and some of the other churches invite the Taoiseach. My Department has dialogue with all of them in so far as they are all now involved in the national day of commemoration.</P>
        <P>The main sources with whom we have had discussions &mdash; this is not a complete list &mdash; and who have been involved in this process over the past 12 months or so are the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, the Religious Society of Friends, the Salvation Army, the Unitarian Church, the Lutheran Church of Ireland, the Moravian Church, the Baptist Church, the Orthodox Church, which includes the Coptic, Greek, Romanian and Russian churches, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Jehovah Witnesses, the Jewish community, the Islamic Foundation of Ireland, the Baha&rsquo;i Faith, the Buddhist centres, the Association of Irish Humanists and a number of other smaller churches representing the new communities, totalling a large number. The process is an inclusive one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach publish his submission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think there is anything secret in it. It will probably be published, but I am not sure of the date. All this has happened in discussions with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Taoiseach was explaining his close links with senior officers of the Catholic Church in Ireland, he referred <Col N="326"/>approvingly to the central role that officers of the church play in the education system. While respecting the full right of all to their beliefs and their full freedom to practise various religions, why should a fundamental institution of the State such as education be invested in the church, rather than being democratically organised and managed? Why should so much control over primary education, for example, be given to the local bishop, any more than he should be in charge of the local diocese&rsquo;s road safety campaign or the filling of potholes in the diocese, which is another important function of State or local authority? In this society, which has so many churches, which the Taoiseach just listed, and many people who do not affiliate to any church, should the management of all the educational institutions of the State now be moved to the democratic control of parents, teachers, Government and students?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are going outside the scope of these five questions. A general question is fine but the detailed ones might be better dealt with in another manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Potholes would be a bit much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The potholes are merely&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is quite valid and I ask the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a parable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first point, I will engage with all churches, whether they are Catholic, Protestant, Educate Together, Muslim or any other group&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Educate Together is not a church.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No. In terms of education I am speaking of any group that provides education to children &mdash; it does not matter which one. I am the politician who has dealt most with such groups since they first started up in this country, as Deputy Burton knows.</P>
        <P>On the other issue raised, I have no difficulty with people holding alternative views or with their not being members of any church. It is entirely healthy in a democratic society to show public respect for the various institutions and structures that give meaning to the lives of citizens. It is right that all our main religious traditions, of whatever denomination, be reflected in acts of public significance, such as our ceremonies for the national day of commemoration. It is right that we be involved with them. I go to a host of different events. I recently celebrated with the Jewish community and celebrated the end of Ramadan with the Islamic community. I was in the mosque in Clonskeagh and the synagogue in the south of the city.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="327"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach was abstemious during November anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct. Deputy Joe Higgins asked for my view, which I will give. I totally respect his view and he has just said he respects mine. An empty secularism that denies the importance of religious belief and practice may, in the wrong circumstances, give rise to an oppressive public culture. Fortunately, we have a political and civic culture here that holds no institution above the law and respects the place of religious belief and practice. In the great tradition of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, we have proper separation of church and State and we avoid confessional politics. This is how I view the issue and I do not join in saying that anything to do with religion is a bad thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept that dialogue with churches, including some of the new faiths represented in this country &mdash; I welcome the list the Taoiseach gave us in an earlier reply &mdash; allows for engagement with the new communities represented in Ireland regarding their experiences, concerns over immigration and asylum-seeking difficulties? Does he recognise the analogy between the experience of Irish emigrants in the past and that of the new communities in the State in that churches play a central role in creating the fabric of community away from emigrants&rsquo; home bases? Does he accept that in this dialogue, which I support, he would do well to listen to and learn from those who are working with our new neighbours and brothers and sisters of colour in Ireland regarding their direct experiences of our legislative and organised approach to their particular needs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the answer to those questions. On the idea of the constitutional amendment, we made a decision earlier in the year, in spite of the fact that the draft constitution was defeated in some countries and is in abeyance at this stage. The idea was that the legitimate role of all of the churches and faith communities in public life would be acknowledged and that the participatory principle regarding civil society and recognition of social dialogue in the treaty would make the provisions for dialogue with the churches entirely popular and welcome. The idea was that whatever issues were of concern to any of the churches or faith communities, they would be able to raise these at least annually and on other occasions when they would meet Government and senior civil servants.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt about this process, as I know from what has happened already and the changes that are taking place within a number of churches that have been established in this city and other cities. People are beginning to understand the issues raised by the churches. Only good can come of this because people will come to recognise each other&rsquo;s positions. The members of these <Col N="328"/>communities live in this country now. Dialogue will help us to form a common basis from which to move forward. This will give religious leaders and faith communities an opportunity to represent the views of their members in this country. It is a good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Taoiseach met Pope Benedict XVI, did he discuss the dialogue between the Government and the churches, and the faith within the different churches?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I did. I explained to the Pope that we were continuing with our position on the constitution. Needless to say, he was very seized of what was happening at European level because the church was deeply involved in discussions in that regard.</P>
        <P>This proposal moved on from a period when some countries would not recognise the concept of Christianity or God in the preamble to the constitution. While the Deputy knows where I stood on that issue, it was not an issue on which we were going to get agreement so I did not pursue it. However, during the negotiations, when it was my responsibility, we achieved unanimous agreement among all groups with regard to this dialogue, which many of the countries involved already have.</P>
        <P>We are behind many countries in this regard. Our position on engaging with the churches has not been as good as that of other countries. After all that has been done through the years, we should try to catch up with secular countries like France and others that perhaps respect their churches more than we do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to understand the distinction between the kind of business the Taoiseach would normally raise with the churches and what will be encompassed by this dialogue. Many of the churches would give a high primacy to issues of war and peace, for example. Are these the kind of issues the Taoiseach would envisage discussing with the churches? Many of the churches have voiced serious disquiet about the practice of rendition, as the United States Government calls it, and the suspected use of Shannon for transferring prisoners who might later be subjected to torture. Does the Taoiseach envisage himself discussing with the faith communities their concerns about a major issue like that, which would not be regarded as the routine stuff he might discuss with the churches in the normal way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am curious as to why the Taoiseach must use the loaded term &ldquo;empty&rdquo; when he refers to secularism. Secularism means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="329"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach why he chose a deliberately loaded term to denigrate those who have a different view, in order to justify his view on relations between the church and State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already explained it. I said that an empty secularism which denies the importance of religious belief and practice is not good and can create difficulties.</P>
        <P>In terms of development and international issues, when churches wish to put forward their views this would be a good source of dialogue. Some churches are very involved, and the dean of the diplomatic corps here is the papal nuncio. He is involved in issues of the United Nations and had an active role in international relations. Some other churches may not be as involved, and this would provide an opportunity for them. All of the churches and other organisations are involved in developmental issues involving NGOs such as Tr&oacute;caire and other organisations. The Islamic community and the Association of Irish Humanists may also want to share views. International issues can be raised in such a format.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has stated he does not see the Ferns Report as the kind of issue he would raise in the contemplated dialogue here. Has he discussed the Ferns Report with the Catholic Church in particular?</P>

	<P>With regard to Question No. 6, I have had no contacts with the US Administration since the question was last asked.</P><Col N="331"/>
        <P>I continue to make contact with all the political parties in Northern Ireland. Most recently, I met the SDLP on 5 December. Before that I met Sinn F&eacute;in on 1 December. At both meetings we discussed the way forward, the restoration of devolved government and other matters of current interest. I met Prime Minister Blair on 9 December in London. Our discussions focused on European issues, but we took the opportunity to discuss the current position in Northern Ireland also.</P>
        <P>We must inject new momentum into the process in the new year. We have reflected on how this might be done and on the issues that remain to be addressed. I have advised the House on several occasions that the Government would, in the appropriate circumstances, address the so-called &ldquo;on-the-run&rdquo; issue. The two governments&rsquo; intentions regarding this issue were referred to as far back as July 2001 in Weston Park. For a number of reasons, it was not possible to advance the issue in the intervening period, but both governments have now published their proposals on the matter and the approach envisaged in our respective jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>I was not aware of the specific provisions in the legislation in the UK until immediately prior to its publication. I have said before in the House that it is a matter for each jurisdiction to bring forward proposals to deal with the issue within our own legislative or constitutional frameworks. I have received correspondence from the SDLP on this issue, which was also discussed at our meeting on 5 December. I am fully aware of the SDLP&rsquo;s concern, and I have explained the Government&rsquo;s position on this to the party representatives.</P>
        <P>I last met the US envoy Mitchell Reiss when he visited Dublin on 12 September last. I have answered several questions on that since. We had a wide-ranging discussion about the political situation and the prospects for progress in the coming months. I last visited the United States between 13 September and 16 September. However, I was in New York on United Nations business and it did not involve any formal contact with the US Administration on Northern Ireland or any other issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did not give an adequate answer to Questions Nos. 6, 12 and 13. If his only answer is that he has not had contact with the US Administration, I ask him if he will agree that the lack of contact is extraordinary. Only a few days ago the President of the United States agreed that at least 30,000 Iraqis have been killed since he invaded their country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise out of these questions. The Deputy will have to find another way to raise the matter. Several Deputies are offering to speak.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="332"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to ask why the Taoiseach has not been in contact with the US Administration. Three years ago that administration was in overdrive saying there were weapons of mass destruction which necessitated an invasion of Iraq. The Taoiseach said he believed it and the Government swallowed this claim which turned out to be a lie. When we last spoke about this several months ago, I asked the Taoiseach would he ask the US Government to explain why it had mislead him. Has he done so?</P>
        <P>There is deep unease throughout Europe and among many in the United States about the CIA policy of kidnapping so-called suspects and torturing them on behalf of the US Government. In view of this, and the sighting of planes involved in the process at Shannon, does the Taoiseach agree that contacts at the highest levels are necessary?</P>
        <P>Given that he was told a lie about the weapons of mass destruction, what credence should he give to the US Secretary of State&rsquo;s denials that this so-called policy of rendition involves the use of Irish facilities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have reported to the House on the issues in which I have been involved with the American Administration this year. There are no other issues.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs answered questions on this subject. He has had numerous meetings with the administration on which he has reported to the House. The EU Presidency has worked on several of the issues raised by the Deputy and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has reported on those issues.</P>
        <P>On 8 November the United Nations agreed unanimously to acknowledge the work undertaken in Iraq by the international peacekeeping force. In answer to the question, I had no contacts. It is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has made regular contacts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When I raised the issue of the so-called &ldquo;on-the-runs&rdquo; with the Taoiseach two weeks ago he responded to the effect that the proposed deal for people on the run came from the Good Friday Agreement and the arrangements to deal with that had been in the public domain since the talks in Weston Park. Both of these perceptions are wrong. The Good Friday Agreement made no reference whatsoever to those who are on the run and the issue of irrevocable pardons for them was never mentioned, either at or after the meeting at Weston Park.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that a presidential pardon has never been granted in this country to a person who has not been convicted of a crime? Does the Taoiseach accept that he proposes to use a constitutional provision in a way that was never contemplated previously? Does he intend to discuss with Opposition parties a better way to proceed to deal with this matter? It is necessary to deal with this issue but not in the way the Taoiseach proposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Good Friday Agreement dealt with how prisoners would be released. From that time, the issues of on-the-runs was in the public domain. At Weston Park in 2001, we agreed to bring forward the scheme when progress was made on other issues. At that stage, an enormous amount of debate surrounded the issue. The issue has been in the public domain for the last four and a half years. The scheme as outlined was not as it was only announced two weeks ago. If Members or others have suggestions to make on the issue, the Government will examine them. While I have not seen any yet, over the Christmas and new year we will look at some because it will be some months before we will deal with the cases.</P>
        <P>As I outlined to Deputy Kenny two weeks ago, the Government is satisfied on the basis of work done to date that pre-trial pardons cannot be granted in cases, even if legislation is introduced on this issue. Under the Constitution, there are great difficulties in adopting another approach to the one for which we opted. That is based on legal advice. If another idea for dealing with the issue is raised, it will be looked at. The power of pardon cannot be delegated under the Constitution as it is vested solely in the President and exercised on the advice of the Government. The Government has been advised that the constitutional provisions for dealing with the trial of offences would stand in the way of setting up the type of tribunal for which the UK opted.</P>
        <P>I accept some people, as a matter of principle, are opposed to addressing the issue. If it is accepted the matter must be dealt with, we believe the proposed way is the most passive way of dealing with the small number of cases that are likely to arise. If there are other suggestions, the Government is prepared to examine them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="334"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Accepting the matter must be dealt with, I have already suggested to the Taoiseach that these persons, small in number, should present themselves to a court, declare their guilt, have the conviction put against them and then be released on revocable licence. It would provide some consolation and closure to the families and loved ones of victims who were murdered or blown up. It also allows the Executive to deal with the issue and not draw the Presidency into a matter that could be constitutionally dubious. Two weeks ago, the Taoiseach told the House he would send on the Attorney General&rsquo;s legal advice on the matter to the Opposition leaders. As we have yet to receive it, I ask him again to send it on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach accept much greater consultation is needed before moving on the sensitive issue of on-the-runs and exemptions of security force members from trials? Other countries have developed merits around truth and reconciliation commissions, such as the truth for amnesty formula in South Africa, all of which have worked well. Have these been referred to in his discussions on the issue? Will the Taoiseach consult not just the parties in the North but also the Opposition parties in the South before proceeding on what is potentially a damaging issue if not dealt with sensitively?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Ceann Comhairle say that he has no role in the ordering of parliamentary questions. I submit, in any event, that questions on Northern Ireland are one of the few substantive areas where Opposition Members may question the Taoiseach. Otherwise, we are back to e-Cabinet projects, the communications unit and housekeeping matters that could be dealt with by Deputy Callely or someone. Despite this, somebody has bundled in a question on the United States, Question No. 6, with the questions on Northern Ireland. I suggest this is sharp practice because serious matters must be teased out with the Taoiseach. Deputy Kenny has raised one such matter, the on-the-runs. Whoever did this is guilty of sharp practice because the clock has been ticking and the time for questions on Northern Ireland in this term has expired, but we have not even touched the surface of the issues. This is not acceptable, regardless of who is behind it, and I am not suggesting, Sir, that you had anything to do with it.</P>
        <P>I have a suggestion to make to the Taoiseach on another matter. When the most powerful country in the world goes to war on the basis of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and it is then established conclusively that no such weapons exist and Ireland was sucked into the coalition of the willing, what, other than a lie, does one call this and what does the rest of the world call it?</P>
        <P>In respect of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remark that he was invited to express his view on the Peter Hain <Col N="335"/>on-the-runs legislation for clarification purposes only, has the Government made its view known on the legislation? Will he indicate what is the Government&rsquo;s disposition on restorative justice which, for example, is being established under a given structure in Northern Ireland? In so far as I know, a number of these committees have former prominent paramilitaries dictating the pace and thus controlling the communities they controlled in a previous guise, prior to commissioning and so on. This will not be confined to one side of the community. Is it not the case that the system will operate on both sides of the community? Is it not the case that demands are already being made that we follow suit and establish committees for restorative justice down here, which will, in some people&rsquo;s minds, have the same implications?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Taoiseach please note that Question No. 13 in my name on contacts with the Government of the United States has nothing to do with the other questions in the group relating to the North and the peace process? Time restrains me but the Taoiseach must be conscious that a case arising from the so-called Stormontgate affair was withdrawn last week by the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions and the three men who had been facing charges have been deemed to be innocent of them. Does the Taoiseach recall that the political institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement were brought down as a result of those charges and the public presence of the PSNI at the Sinn F&eacute;in offices in Stormont at the time? Does he accept that the carrying out of that raid and the subsequent trial by media created a serious situation, from which we have all been trying to rebuild since, with all the difficulties of which the Taoiseach is aware?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that it is imperative in light of this development that he put it to the British Prime Minister that he has a responsibility, collectively with the Taoiseach, to ensure we will not face similar contrived circumstances on the re-establishment of the institutions, designed and carried out by those who hold only ill will towards the outworking of the Good Friday Agreement and the potential of a real peace process on and between these islands?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the Deputies&rsquo; questions relating to Nos. 6 and 12 together.</P>
        <P>When I go to the United States in March each year there is a more complete agenda within which I deal with a number of issues, but I do not deal with the United States on any of the other issues during the course of the year. That is why my officials would, correctly, have put these questions together. I totally defend them having regard to any insinuation that they did anything wrong. If I had been there on a separate mission, that would be a different matter. However, they were correct in how they handled this. The <Col N="336"/>answer to Questions. Nos. 6, 12 and 13 is that I had no contacts with the US administration since I last answered the question. There are no supplementaries because I did not have any discussions with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In fact, there are many questions the Taoiseach should have asked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs did. There is no point in my doing everybody else&rsquo;s job.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy had any contact with them himself?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I might finish up in one of the gulags or in Angola.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A few weeks ago, I told Deputy Kenny that I would give him the contents of a note I had and I will do so. It was not the constitutional advice of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sargent referred to the idea of a truth and reconciliation commission. As he knows, I have supported that for some years in some format, although I never prescribed that it should be on the South African model. There are so many people who have been victims from whatever perspective and who feel their cases have not been dealt with. As time goes on, if anything, it gets more difficult for those people, so I have never ruled out the establishment of such a commission. On a number of occasions, I tried to engage people concerning some model, but not necessarily the South African model to which the Deputy referred. There are many other models. This will continue because the one thing I have learned about victims is that their pain and hurt never ceases, so we need some way of dealing with it. As I said before, however, there has not been much support for that initiative in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the issue of restorative justice committees. I have made it clear a number of times, and I am glad to restate it, that the only way this can operate properly is with policing, otherwise it would open up all kinds of difficulties, some of which the Deputy mentioned. Restorative justice committees must be part of policing. There are currently 19 such committees in the North &mdash; 14 on the republican-Nationalist side and five on the Unionist-loyalist side. The five on the Unionist-loyalist side have an association with policing, while the others do not. Therein lies a danger, so restorative justice can only really be dealt with in the context of policing. I restate that position.</P>
        <P>The issue that has become known as &ldquo;Stormont-gate&rdquo; brought down the institutions in the North. As I have said outside the House, it was on the basis that there was evidence that justified all these actions, which created many difficulties for many of us. Unfortunately, I have not had a <Col N="337"/>chance to read all the files on this matter yet, but as we have seen, this has all gone now and there is no follow-on. It means we all went through a great deal of suffering for something that at the end of the day did not seem to add up on examination.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>if he has estimated the impact of a one per cent increase in interest rates on business and on personal repayments; if this will fall disproportionately on recently formed families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[39233/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, there is a broad range of factors that determine the effect of changes in interest rates on individual loan repayments. These include, for example, the outstanding loan amount, whether the lending rate is fixed or variable, the length of time over which the increase takes place, the pass-through of interest rate changes to lending rates, the repayment term and the specific nature of the financial product involved. My Department, having consulted the Central Bank, has concluded that, as detailed information relating to all these factors is not available, an accurate estimate of the figure requested by the Deputy cannot be constructed.</P>
        <P>In reviewing the broad impact of any projected increases in interest rates on households and businesses, account must also be taken of private sector savings levels as any increase in interest rates will obviously have beneficial effects for savers. In addition, in assessing the overall financial position of both businesses and consumers following interest rate changes, it is too narrow an approach to consider the level of indebtedness in isolation from the asset side of the private sector&rsquo;s balance sheet. A high proportion of household indebtedness in Ireland relates to borrowing for house purchase which, in turn, creates an asset for households. In the same way, borrowing by the business sector underpins high investment levels <Col N="338"/>and the creation of business assets yielding future income.</P>
        <P>As far as the position of recently-formed families is concerned, the Central Bank&rsquo;s recently published <i>Financial Stability Report </i>concludes that fundamental factors, such as increasing employment and incomes, low inflation and interest rates, have underpinned the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy. The maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic performance and, in particular, its strong income and employment growth, provides a positive and supportive economic environment within which households can successfully manage their finances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister concerned about the rate of growth in indebtedness? The latest figures show that in the past 12 months alone, private sector indebtedness went up by &euro;55 billion. That is more than the Minister spent in his entire budget this year. The rate of private sector borrowing is now 190% of GNP. In commenting on the past, the Minister has often said that when public sector borrowing was 120% of GNP we were in a precarious situation. What is the Minister&rsquo;s response to the Central Bank when it says that the most worrying aspect of private sector indebtedness patterns is the accelerating speed at with debt is increasing in the context of an already high level of indebtedness? Is the Minister aware that our private sector indebtedness is now the highest in Europe? It is almost double the European average. Does he agree that even a 1% increase in interest rates would wipe out all the benefits of concessions in the budget and elsewhere? Half of our mortgage lending has occurred in the past 24 months. Does that not mean that many young couples have entered into debt commitments that are quite precarious for them against a current background of rising interest rates?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>While current levels of credit growth could become a cause for concern were they to continue, I do not believe current levels of indebtedness represent a danger to the economy. In fact, it is to be expected that consumers would seek to make use of historically low interest rate levels. It is also a fact that Ireland has traditionally had low levels of personal debt in comparison to other EU countries. I should also point out that credit has an essential role to play in any functioning economy, allowing households to smooth consumption over time if disposable income is subject to shocks.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that while personal liabilities have increased these are backed by real assets. In this context a major element of outstanding indebtedness is accounted for by residential mortgages. Demand for residential mortgages is underpinned by a number of factors, including strong new housing output, growth in the economy, the accompanying pick-up in <Col N="339"/>employment creation, the increase in household formation, significant net immigration, lower public sector indebtedness which facilitated easier fiscal conditions, and the decline in average inflation over several years.</P>
        <P>At an individual level, it is important that borrowers act sensibly. I agree with the Central Bank which recently reiterated the importance of prudent behaviour both by borrowers and lenders. The possibility that interest rates may rise over the medium term with obvious implications for the burden of repayments, should be kept firmly in mind. Insofar as the banking sector is concerned, the Central Bank in its recent <i>Financial Stability Review</i> concluded that the Irish banking system is in a good state of health and is reasonably well placed to cope with any adverse short or medium-term developments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is just reading out a prepared answer. The Central Bank said there were three major threats to us. One is a decline in the construction industry and another is the rapid growth in our private sector indebtedness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It also remarks that, in the past, where countries got into trouble, it was through very intense, debt-driven property booms, stating that it was a concern. At what point do the three threats of declining exports, rising indebtedness and risks in the construction industry cause concern, and when must a Minister for Finance produce a policy response? We ought to be planning to deal with this issue, which is now a serious concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow the Minister a brief final reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that I am reading my replies testifies to the accuracy with which I have anticipated the supplementaries. This is for information and not to allow the Deputy to joust with me regarding interest rates. It is about putting on the record the facts of the situation, and I have quoted from Central Bank reports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said that we had low indebtedness, and I quoted figures to him showing that we are by far the worst in Europe.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="340"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already done so. Economic prospects for the Irish economy, despite the Deputy&rsquo;s best efforts to suggest otherwise, remain very positive, notwithstanding the increased uncertaintly evident in the international economy.</P>

	<P>Let us move on to Question No. 50.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I might answer quickly. There is broad consensus among commentators that the Irish economy is set to continue to perform strongly, expanding close to its growth potential both this year and next. Over the medium term, the economy is expected to grow at almost double the rate forecast for the eurozone overall. The pace at which new housing output adjusts downwards to long-term, sustainable levels is an important risk for the economy, and new housing completions are projected to decline by 2.5% next year and 5% in 2007 and 2008. That will be offset by investment in other building and construction, including a significant increase in spending on the public capital programme. That is the level of economic activity that we predict, and we therefore anticipate a soft landing. We envisage that the issue will be dealt with in a planned way over a period owing to demographic, employment and other factors that differ greatly from those in other European economies and this means that housing output is justified.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of figures showing that fewer than one in nine civil servants wish to move with their jobs under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, his plans to review or adjust the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[39249/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to change the scale or scope of the decentralisation programme. There have been approximately 10,600 applications for decentralisation so far. New applications are being received every week. For the past 14 months since the closing of the priority application period in September 2004, an average of 100 new applications have been received every month. I have no reason to believe that the rate of application will lessen as the central applications facility, CAF, remains open and continues to accept further new applications.</P>
        <P>Using the statistic that few civil servants are moving with their posts is not accurate. It assumes that no one will move between Civil Service organisations. A career in the Civil Service for most people will encompass service in several Departments and different posts within those Departments. Many Civil Service organisations have a formally agreed mobility policy whereby people move post every five years or so.</P><Col N="341"/>
        <P>Many civil servants have already transferred across Departments to decentralising posts in advance of transfers out of Dublin over the coming years. To date, more than 900 of the 7,200 civil servants are in place, over 30% of whom are in middle management and higher level grades.</P>
        <P>To give the Deputy an example of how well the transfer system within Civil Service organisations works, I remind her of the information given by the Revenue Commissioners to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service last year. The Revenue Commissioners set up decentralised offices with 900 staff in the mid-west in the early 1990s. At the time, 10% to 12% of staff in the Collector General&rsquo;s office opted to relocate. If staff who were employed in other Revenue posts are included, that figure increases to 25%. As a result, 75% of decentralising staff were new to the Revenue organisation. The Revenue Commissioners looked on that as an opportunity to examine its internal efficiency. As a result of that exercise, significant improvements were made to processes, systems and work practices which were implemented in the course of decentralisation.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, the Collector General&rsquo;s office was decentralised without loss of efficiency or effectiveness, and it has risen to all the business challenges that have emerged in the past decade. I expect that Revenue&rsquo;s experience can be replicated in the current decentralisation process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have any concerns, particularly regarding specialist agencies due to decentralise? I wish to mention two specifically, the first being the Development Co-operation Ireland division of the Department of Foreign Affairs. According to documentation released to me under the Freedom of Information Act 1997, no senior diplomats serving in that section and no senior specialists in foreign aid are willing to decentralise to Limerick. One must remember that they must also move regularly to take up posts in the rest of the world as Department of Foreign Affairs employees. Does the Minister share the fears expressed in the risk assessment regarding that section that the decentralisation process as planned, particularly by the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will be &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo;, to quote the paper? This comes at a time, next year and the year after, when the Government is increasing development aid spending by &euro;100 million per annum. The total will rise to approximately &euro;600 million next year and continue to rise every year after.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S information shows that six people out of 400 from that organisation&rsquo;s headquarters, many of whom are highly trained specialists, are willing to move. The Labour Party seeks a review of the implementation process. Is the Minister concerned enough to examine areas where there are significant problems regarding damage to the <Col N="342"/>public service and to carry out an appropriate review?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, the central applications facility has received approximately 10,600 applications. The breakdown between city and country is approximately 50-50. The latest progress report from the decentralisation implementation group, which is charged with advancing this Government initiative, came to us at the end of June 2005. We hope that, by the end of next year or early 2007, up to 1,000 staff will be <i>in situ</i> in decentralised locations. There are already 900 sitting behind desks in preparation and training for the move they will make. It is hoped beyond that, despite the challenges, to move another 2,000 by the end of 2007, giving a total of up to 3,000. That is the most recent progress report of the decentralisation implementation group. There are issues regarding the general service. We have had a successful culture of decentralisation before in the public service and we can draw on that experience and proceed fairly well.</P>
        <P>There are three other broad areas that must be addressed. Regarding information and communications technology, particularly in the Revenue, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Agriculture and Food, there is the question of analysing current applications and working with management and trade unions on proposals to fill shortfalls. That issue is ongoing as we continue with the simpler aspect of the task, namely, transferring general service people to decentralised locations, as was done in smaller-scale initiatives in the past.</P>
        <P>Engagement with the trade unions is taking place regarding professional and technical staff, such as engineers, quantity surveyors in the Office of Public Works and environmental experts whom the Deputy mentioned regarding development co-operation. That will be a more difficult situation than with the general service, but we must sit down and work through the issues with professional and technical staff to see how we might proceed.</P>
        <P>A third issue concerns the State-sponsored bodies where there has been less of a culture of relocation hitherto. People from the line Departments, the agencies and the trade unions have met to see how we might be able to introduce initiatives to ameliorate that situation. In that general context, we hope that the voluntary initiative will have put up to 3,000 people in place by the end of 2007. We must work through the issues with various categories where specific questions arise because of the traditional culture and background of the organisation or the fact that it was not involved in previous initiatives, and decide how to proceed with them. That is the position, and the progress report from the decentralisation implementation group at the end of June is the latest full assessment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="343"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have an economic or financial assessment of the cost of so many significant sections or semi-State bodies with specific expertise refusing to move, given the Taoiseach&rsquo;s guarantee that decentralisation is voluntary and that people may stay in Dublin? Unless a review takes place, are we not heading for a repeat of the Cahirciveen situation regarding the Legal Aid Board where essentially there is a headquarters in Dublin and another in Cahirciveen? Interestingly, in the recent decentralisation moves, all the staff in Cahirciveen asked to be transferred to Killarney as part of their response to decentralisation. Will the Minister cost the impact of that in terms of the loss of effectiveness in the public service? In the case of development co-operation, as the Minister is aware people have to agree to transfer every three to five years to an overseas posting for up to four years on average, yet we are asking families in that situation to be trilocated, so to speak, to Dublin, Limerick and overseas.</P>

Previous coalition Governments, in which Fine Gael and Labour were involved, halted the decentralisation programmes and then cancelled them. When we returned to office in 1987 we reactivated them with great success. Far from compromising the effectiveness of the service, it has been a very good innovation within the service.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Different countries make different choices on this matter. We choose for good reasons not to index the bands and credits and to deal with each budget with a clean slate, as it were. In this way, the Government can make unconstrained choices in determining priorities in taxation and spending and have the resources to address these appropriately. That is the essence of what government is about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister will agree that there are a number of workers who appear to be in a permanent state of confusion regarding their pay. They are earning much more money yet they are still no better off. They are constantly playing catch-up and never appear to gain any benefit from increases in pay. I am sure the Minister will agree that this is due to hidden costs, one of which is indexation. The Minister referred in his reply to other countries making different choices but Ireland should examine the way the United Kingdom operates. Its tax bands are indexed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister examine the position of our near neighbour regarding the benefits of the indexation order of 1987 for workers in the UK? Will he agree that order was brought in for good reason in a time of high inflation? Will he agree also that in 2002, one in <Col N="345"/>four workers were in the top rate of tax but now one in three workers are in the top rate of tax? That represents an extra 160,000 people, although 40,000 of those are new jobs. Will the Minister agree also that a promise was made under Sustaining Progress that only one in five people would be in the top tax bracket and 80% would be in the lower bracket but that now 66% are in the lower tax bracket, which is unfair?</P>
        <P>Will he agree also that the consumer price index is 8% higher now than it was in 2002 yet the threshold for the higher tax rate rose only by 5%, in addition to the fact that wages are increasing, driving people more quickly into the higher tax bracket? I am sure the Minister will agree that people are no sooner out of the higher tax bracket when they are driven back into it again. Does he agree that people are put into a higher tax bracket at a relatively low wage base and that they must sit back and watch millionaires use schemes to avoid paying tax?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with what the Deputy said. Irish earnings and employment levels have increased significantly since 1997.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have acknowledged that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is illustrated by the 56% increase in the average industrial wage over that period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about indexation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that. Changes to the income tax regime since 1997 mean that the average tax rate has been reduced at all income levels. For example, after last week&rsquo;s budget, the average tax rate for a single person on the average industrial wage will be 15% compared with 27% in 1997. In this regard, the position is that a single PAYE worker on the average industrial wage has seen their after tax income increase by approximately 44% in real terms since 1997, of which approximately half is due to tax reductions. There has been a 44% real increase in take-home pay for those on the average industrial wage.</P>
        <P>Another factor which can influence people&rsquo;s repayment capacity in terms of their commitments is that mortgage interest rates are at historically low levels of 3.3% to 3.65%, down significantly from the rates of 7.1% to 8.85% prevailing in 1997. The prospect of interest rates going higher over the medium term should be kept firmly in mind by borrowers in terms of continuing commitments.</P>
        <P>When the Deputy mentioned the number of people, he omitted to take account of the fact that we have taken another 340,000 people on lower incomes out of the tax net. It was one in four when we came into office and it is one in three now. When we examine the structure of our income tax reforms and the move to a tax credit system rather than maintaining a tax allowance <Col N="346"/>system, the Deputy will realise it is a much more difficult proposition to talk about taking people off the top rate in that respect when the tax credits assist people at the lower end, which is a far more socially progressive measure from an income tax point of view. That was the case at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knew that at the time he made the commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The other point I would make to the Deputy is that the historical problem with paying income tax was how quickly one paid at the top rate. Before we came into office, a person paid 48% tax after the first &euro;19,400 in earnings. That person now has to earn &euro;32,000 before he or she starts paying the top rate, which is reduced by six points to 42%. If the Deputy can find any government in Europe or any predecessor government in this State that was able to do that much that quickly, I will consider his membership of my party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

	<P>In 2002, one in four people were in the top rate of tax. Today, the figure is one in three. There was a promise that we would work towards a figure of one in five. Will the Minister not agree we are heading in the wrong direction in terms of top tax bands?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should remember that an additional 500,000 people are at work. That is the litmus test of people&rsquo;s satisfaction. I am sure the Deputy knows from visiting his clinics at weekends &mdash; it is a nice, competitive constituency &mdash; how well this measure is being received.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The expected surplus in tax revenues in 2005 was recently estimated at &euro;1.8 billion or 4.8%. At the end of November total tax revenues were &euro;36,879 million, which was &euro;1,722 million or 4.9% ahead of profile. The receipts include &euro;489 million from the main special investigations of the Revenue Commissioners, which was &euro;294 million higher than expected for the period. Excluding the impact of these one-off receipts, taxes were 4.1% above profile.</P>
        <P>The main excesses were on VAT, stamp duty, capital gains tax and excise. This is due to strong growth in the domestic economy and, in part<Col N="347"/>icular, in personal consumption expenditure, the volume growth in which is currently estimated at 5.3% for this year. The continued buoyancy of the property market is also a contributory factor in tax revenues being ahead of target. Income tax, excluding the impact of one-off receipts from Revenue&rsquo;s special investigations, was broadly on target, while corporation tax was close to &euro;300 million below profile.</P>
        <P>The methodology for forecasting tax revenues generally is based on forecasts of the level and composition of economic activity, which is determined by many factors and is subject to both national and international shocks. Forecasting economic activity, on which forecasts of tax revenues are largely based, is not, therefore, an exact science. Tax forecasts can also be influenced by factors and considerations other than the general level of economic activity.</P>
        <P>One main reason we are receiving more in tax than we had forecast is that our tax and economic policies have put more money into the pockets of taxpayers who are spending and investing this extra money as they see fit. This extra spending and investment yields extra taxes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>How could the Minister get it so wrong? How could estimates for tax returns have been so far off target in recent years? In 2004, there was a projected rise of &euro;1.6 billion in extra tax take but the actual tax take turned out to be &euro;4 billion. The Minister was off target by 140%. The expected increase in 2005 was &euro;1.8 billion and, as the Minister just mentioned, the actual figure will be approximately &euro;3.7 billion. How did the Minister end up being 100% off target?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am thankful that I am off target in a positive sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister explained the formula he used to calculate the figure, which is obviously not working. He should go back to the drawing board. In 2003, it was forecast that capital taxes would fall by 23%, a figure of &euro;604 million, but they rose by &euro;1.2 billion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>This occurred because our economy was so successful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2004, it was forecast that there would be an increase of &euro;25 million in capital taxes but the actual increase was &euro;1 billion. How far off target will the Minister&rsquo;s estimates for 2006 be? Will he revise them at this stage? This additional tax take is coming from families and businesses which are obviously paying more tax than they need to for this country to survive. The average tax take from a family has increased from &euro;28,000 in 2002 to a projected figure of &euro;37,500 for 2006. Given these overruns, it is obvious the Minister should be doing a better job <Col N="348"/>and putting more tax back into the pockets of families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have this opportunity to deal with the bogus statistic that Fine Gael has been parroting for some time. It takes the total tax take, divides it by the number of households and then states that the burden of taxation has increased, which is nonsense. Every individual in the tax system has paid less tax in terms of average tax taken on income after this and previous budgets. Nobody in the tax system has lost out in this regard. Fine Gael&rsquo;s suggestion that everyone loses out flies in the face of reality.</P>
        <P>Corporation, businesses and excise taxes, VAT, stamp duty and capital gains tax have all increased due to the level of economic activity. When one examines the components of growth, one can see that domestic demand has increased. A total of 90,000 more people are working, of which 71,000 hold full-time jobs. One would expect Fine Gael to welcome such a development. This is the litmus test of the success of our policies. If, on the basis of a total tax take of &euro;36,000 million or &euro;37,000 million, one&rsquo;s projections are off target by 2%, it is a relatively large figure. I will happily accept criticism from the Opposition over the fact that our economy is so successful that we have record numbers of people at work and more people providing greater tax revenues for the Exchequer, on the basis of a reduced average tax take for workers.</P>

	<P>The Minister appears to forget that, when someone fills his or her car with &euro;40 of petrol, he or she is making a present of &euro;25 to the Minister. These are real people with real families and real households. He forgets that when a person buys a new car costing &euro;22,000, he or she makes a present of &euro;8,500 to the Minister. He also forgets that when a young couple buys a house costing &euro;300,000, they make a present of &euro;100,000 to the Minister.</P>

	<P>These are real people and real families paying real taxes. Business people who pay tax also belong to households and families. The number of households is increasing substantially. I acknowledge and welcome the fact the number of people at work is also increasing. However, there has been a gross underestimate of the tax take in recent years. This estimate should be closer to the actual figure and, in that context, the extra tax could be passed on to families, individuals and households, rather wasted.</P>

        <Quest>if his Department have received representations from the US authorities regarding the tax status of US companies operating in this jurisdiction; his views on the descriptions of this country in sections of the US media as a tax haven; his response to these descriptions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have received no such representations. Furthermore, Ireland cannot be regarded as a tax haven. We have a comprehensive taxation system covering income, capital and indirect taxes. In addition, Ireland has 44 tax treaties in place, a system of full exchange of information and proper regulation of activities to the highest standards.</P><Col N="350"/>
        <P>Finally, I again emphasise that companies locate here for a variety of reasons and, in this regard, Ireland offers many advantages to US investors such as access to the European Union, a well-educated workforce, political stability and an enterprise-friendly administration.</P>

      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister share the IDA&rsquo;s view that over-aggressive use of Ireland with regard to tax planning by multinationals could adversely affect our capacity to attract inward foreign investment, particularly jobs related to the knowledge economy? Does he share the views of the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland that the description of Ireland as a tax haven is a misrepresentation and potentially damaging to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a preferred location for investment? The Minister spoke about tax returns a moment ago. Is he aware that if one strips out the US multinationals and transfer pricing on intellectual property, corporation tax undershot, rather than overshot, the estimates for performance last year? We have yet to receive an explanation for this. This is a very serious issue with regard to the positioning of Ireland as a knowledge economy. Does the Minister agree that US multinationals are locating the purchase of intellectual property rights in this economy, but we are not creating jobs commensurate with those rights? In fact, many of the 91,000 jobs about which the Minister spoke are low paid, minimum wage jobs. I do not want to go back to the dreadful Irish Ferries dispute and the outsourcing and dumping of well paid jobs from this economy, which is the other side of the picture. More than 100,000 people marched in the streets because of their fears for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the jobs to which the Deputy refers are not minimum wage jobs but are excellent, well paid jobs. They are being sought by many other countries throughout the world but we have successfully brought them here. Many of them are from expanding Irish companies that are making a bigger impact than ever before in many competitive markets.</P>
        <P>I agreed with the points made by the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce at the function in question which I attended and addressed. We do not reduce other nations&rsquo; wealth. Our double taxation treaties, agreed with other countries, use well established arm&rsquo;s length principles. The corporation tax regime produces jobs and revenue that supports public services. The revenue has increased by 250%, from &euro;2 billion to &euro;5.5 billion. We have 44 tax treaties in place, a system of full information exchange and a proper regulation of activities to the highest standards. Ireland maintains a low general corporation tax rate by ensuring a wide tax base and careful prudent management of public finances. The 12.5% corporation tax rate is a general rate and is not focused on any particular segment of <Col N="351"/>Irish industry. Our system is deliberately transparent so that all can see the attractions and benefits to the State. Other countries often have high nominal rates of corporation tax, but mask the true lower rate in deductions and deals with individual firms. We do not go that way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is bound by the same rules on State aid, code of conduct and rulings of the European Court of Justice as other member states of the EU. We are fully compliant with both the code and the OECD process. We have acted in the past to amend regimes to close down abuses if they arise and we will do so in the future. The tax treatment of cross-border flows is regulated in accordance with double tax treaties agreed with other countries, using well established principles. They are negotiated according to OECD guidelines set down for this purpose. In general teams, Ireland has a comprehensive taxation system covering income, capital and indirect taxes. In recent years, we have concentrated on lowering the burden on enterprise and employment to encourage economic activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, Deputy Quinn, brought in the 12.5% rate, which the Labour Party believes has brought a great amount of economic benefit to this country.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland stated that overly aggressive use of Ireland&rsquo;s tax benefit by companies, in an international context, results in little substance or value added activity taking place in Ireland. Marginal benefit to Ireland is not something that is advocated by IDA Ireland. What does the Minister feel about that? I am concerned that our economic strategy is not producing the high value jobs that are essential. Instead, we are concentrating excessively on international property rights being located here without the parallel jobs that the economy should be creating. Today&rsquo;s report suggested that Ireland will go from fourth to 21st place in the creation of high level, knowledge economy, information technology jobs. That is a warning to the Government on its economic strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The idea that we do not have an economic strategy is nonsense. This does not happen by accident. It occurs because we make the right choices. It is true that the Deputy&rsquo;s former leader made an application for a 12.5% corporation tax rate. The work done by Deputy Harney and the former Deputy, Mr. McCreevy, on the application when this Government came into office, as well as the subsequent budgets which were opposed by the Labour Party, enabled us to bring the rate down to 12.5% in three or four years. Sending a letter to the European Union notifying it of the Government&rsquo;s attention to lower the rate to 12.5% does not make the Labour Party a low tax party.</P>
        <P>We have a very clear economic strategy. The report entitled Ahead of the Curve was adopted <Col N="352"/>by Professor Eoin O&rsquo;Driscoll who chaired the group on developing Irish enterprise and on ensuring that the indigenous sector makes its contribution and identifies winners for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We have gone from fourth to 21st.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Interrupting me does not change the facts. The Deputy asked a question and she should allow me the courtesy of giving an answer.</P>
        <P>We are bringing forward a strategy under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael Buckley, who is ensuring all the recommendations from Professor O&rsquo;Driscoll&rsquo;s excellent report are implemented. We are also making serious strategic decisions on the investment in third level education which I announced in this budget and which will be a central part of the next national development plan. We seek to bring about much more investment in broadband and other issues which are critical to the knowledge economy. We want to maintain an overall macroeconomic stance that ensures we remain competitive. We face challenges on competitiveness, as does every open economy. We need to deal with those to maintain the record job creation we have achieved under this Administration. We will implement the strategy successfully for a third term.</P>

        <Quest>the progress made to date in 2005 on implementing the 12-point programme to improve value for money in public spending, announced by him on 20 October 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The measures I announced on 20 October 2005 on value for money build on existing structures to assist better management of capital projects and programmes and follow the initiative announced by the Government on 11 October on the management of information and communications technology projects and consultancies. I have written to all Ministers asking them to ensure their Departments take immediate steps to implement the measures in areas under their remit. Follow-up work is under way in my Department on updating existing guidelines to ensure all the measures are implemented in full. My Department will write to Departments to notify them of formal changes to existing capital appraisal, procurement, ICT and consultancy guidelines and practice and outline plans for <Col N="353"/>further developments on foot of my announcement.</P>
        <P>All other guidance from my Department on matters relating to the better management and delivery of capital and IT projects remain fully in force. This includes rules and guidance for ICT and consultancy, public procurement, public private partnerships and appraisal and management of capital programmes. Primary responsibility for managing capital programmes and projects, ICT projects and consultancies and securing value for money from them rests with line Departments and their implementing agencies. However, I am satisfied that the range of measures in place will better assist Departments and agencies in this respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>What arrangements has the Minister made regarding the proposal in his 12-point plan for <i>ex ante</i> evaluations of capital projects that cost more than &euro;30 million? What <i>ex ante</i> evaluation has taken place of the private hospital proposals by the T&aacute;naiste, especially the tax expenditure proposals included in these private hospital ventures? A &euro;100 million private hospital will give rise to a &euro;42 million tax expenditure cost, which may be even more if the business generated through the National Treatment Purchase Fund is also included.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not be involved in a situation where we undermine our own position. We will proceed with the private hospitals&rsquo; initiative because that is Government policy. We will also ensure that as projects seek approval, my Department will be consulted in the normal way. The arrangements in place for capital appraisal guidelines, which apply to all Departments in respect of all projects of a required level, will be dealt with in the normal way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying there will be no <i>ex ante</i> review as promised in section 3 of his 12-point plan and section 4, which refers to projects above &euro;30 million and provides for a thorough cost benefit appraisal and <i>ex ante</i> review? He is saying that where the tax expenditures on a &euro;100 million private hospital is at least &euro;42 million, that he is abandoning the notion of cost benefit analysis. Will he agree that if he is to do so, this in fact would be a dereliction of the promises he made in his speech to the chamber of commerce and of his role where public expenditure is concerned?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that in my reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify whether he is asking for any <i>ex ante</i> reviews to be carried out, as promised in this paper, of private hospital development and the tax expenditures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>My initial reply will confirm what I said, namely, that the capital appraisal guidelines <Col N="354"/>apply to all projects across all Departments in the normal way. I also pointed out to the Deputy that while she disagrees with the policy initiative, that does not mean we are going to abandon it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the initiative and I want to ask the Minister a few specific questions about the proposal. The idea of having specific individuals who will take responsibility for the success or failure of projects is very welcome. Have those individuals been appointed, with matching contracts for projects, so that we may know who are the individuals responsible for the different initiatives?</P>
        <P>I also welcome the provision for audit by the Department of Finance of some of these evaluations. How will the process work by which the Department will be auditing the evaluations carried out elsewhere? In the past I have found it unsatisfactory the way in which the Department of Finance has tended to just wash its hands of any responsibility for projects that were going down the tubes. Only recently, as regards PPARS, was it shown that the Department of Finance twigged that serious aspects were going astray and it intervened very late in the day. I welcome this, however, and would like to hear more about how these two initiatives will work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s second point, I do not see it as the Department of Finance&rsquo;s role to do the job of every other Department. It is not good for the Department of Finance to try to micromanage every other Department. The direct stereotypical view of people in politics is that the Department of Finance has been micromanaging for far too long, in fact, and in that sense, that it is holding up projects. I do not see it as my role or that of the Department to do on the operational side what happens in the Office of Public Works or anywhere else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not my proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not my proposal. The second point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not mine either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to ensure, particularly with information and communications technology, that we are apprised <i>ab initio</i> and throughout the process to ensure we know the scope of a project. In the past we have been prepared to give budgets to line Departments to enable them to proceed with their ICT and technology issues to bring about a more effective service. We were all agreed on this. These issues have arisen in both the private and the public sectors. There have been successes in both.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for his openness on this point, but it is important that we have an identified person responsible. We cannot have situation whereby no one is responsible in the <Col N="355"/>event of something going wrong. From a management viewpoint it is important that such a person is identified so that everyone knows in respect of every Department in which there are consultancies or operations outside its remit to assist on strategic reviews or whatever, that there are those with overall responsibility for ensuring projects are brought to a successful conclusion and within budget. The moment it is indicated a project will not meet its budget, it is incumbent on him or her to explain the situation adequately so that a systems failure does not arise, as we have seen in the past not just with this Government but under previous Administrations. A public administration culture <i>per se</i> needed to be addressed.</P>
        <P>That is the idea behind these initiatives. They are sensible, fair and will work. They will allow the public service not to recoil into indecision but to make decisions on the basis of adequate preparation so that people may proceed with some confidence and we all know where we are going and do not have problems in the future. That is the thinking behind the initiative and, as a result, it is being welcomed by everybody in the service. I will ask individual Ministers to confirm that they have put these arrangements in place to my satisfaction as a result of this initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise with the Taoiseach the recent actions by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. For a person who set himself up in an organisation supposedly established to investigate matters of public interest, Mr. Frank Connolly has shown a marked reluctance to deal fully with serious questions that remain to be answered and the claims made about him. I do not believe he has fully addressed the questions put to him and it is past time that he came clean on these outstanding matters. When it comes to the protection of the State&rsquo;s security and the prevention of subversion of democracy, Fine Gael will stand four-square behind the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when appropriate action is being taken in the country&rsquo;s interest.</P>
      <P>It is essential that such actions be appropriate and that they are in keeping with the integrity of the office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, has defended his recent actions on the basis that he believed a threat to the State&rsquo;s democracy and authority exists. If that is the case, will the Taoiseach say whether the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed him of this threat to our democracy? Did the Taoiseach consider making a statement to the House about this threat? Was a meeting of a Cabinet sub-committee called to deal with this threat? Were the Taoiseach and other members of the Cabinet and Government made aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intended to leak information deliberately to a particular journalist? Does the Taoiseach agree with the Minister that he has dealt with this threat to our democracy in a satisfactory way? Can the Taoiseach name or identify the organisation which is responsible for this threat to our democracy, given that the House has been informed on a number of occasions that the IRA is now out of business and that there is an end to criminality? These are fundamental questions that need to be answered clearly.</P>
      <P>As I have said, in terms of the protection of this State in dealing with the subversion of democracy, this party will stand behind appropriate action by the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As the House knows, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will <Col N="357"/>make a statement on this matter in a while. He made a comprehensive statement last week by way of a reply to a parliamentary question. The Minister has at all times kept the Government fully briefed on a matter of great importance touching on the issue of security of the State. He has acted with good authority in accordance with the duties attached to his office for the security of the State. The Minister has confirmed he provided a daily newspaper with copies of a fraudulent passport application in response to a request from that newspaper. He did not provide that newspaper with any Garda file on Mr. Connolly. It is a fact that a bogus application for an Irish passport was made. The person named in the application never made it and the signature of a priest in Belfast on the application was forged. The Minister has said on more than one occasion that Mr. Connolly has many questions to answer and I am glad Deputy Kenny agrees. Almost all sides of the House have condemned the activities of a small number in a group of persons who travelled to Colombia and who were engaged in activities that could not be regarded as benign. They brought this country into disrepute by their actions with a vicious band of narco-guerillas who have wreaked havoc on innocent people in their own country. The Minister has dealt with this matter at all times in a proper way. A number of points have been made but Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question was whether the Minister kept those concerned about the matter informed and the answer is that he did.</P>

      <P>I remind Deputy Finian McGrath that I do not need support from him.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has failed to supply the House with any coherent reason for the Minister&rsquo;s action. What was the threat to our democracy? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave the reason to Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Rourke on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; yesterday when he telephoned the programme to say, &ldquo;I did that because on an RTE programme a couple of days previously, remarks had been made that there was no truth whatsoever in these questions&rdquo;. Does it not seem the case that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in a fit of pique, leaked this <Col N="358"/>information to the Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Rourke programme yesterday because he does not wish to have his version of events challenged by RTE? Has he not ensured now that there can never be a prosecution in this case because of a declaration of guilt before a court case has taken place?</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach has not answered the question. The Taoiseach was informed. He regards the Minister as having behaved properly and having dealt with the matter in a proper way. As the Government has strangled the Freedom of Information Act, will the Taoiseach inform the House what was the threat to our democracy? Will he say what organisation was threatening the security of our State? I ask him to tell the House these facts. It should not be necessary for a Minister, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to deliberately leak information to a sole journalist about a matter of public concern. This is a matter for a press conference if necessary rather than having it leaked in the way it was.</P>
      <P>Why has there not been a discussion in the House about the antics or the charges and concerns expressed about Mr. Phil Flynn? We are now to have a debate in the House about a named individual. If any Member of the House names an individual in the House, the Ceann Comhairle will prevent them from speaking out, yet the House is to have a Government-sponsored debate about this matter which I acknowledge is important but such a debate should have taken place before this debacle occurred.</P>

	<P>For the third time, I make the point that I do not see what is wrong when a newspaper asks a Minister about information concerning something that was in the public domain several years ago, namely about Mr. Connolly travelling to Bogot&aacute; in April 2001 using a false passport. I do not see how giving evidence of the use of bogus documents can be wrong. For <Col N="360"/>instance, last week Deputy Kenny was waving invoices at me which were obviously leaked from the HSE. I cannot see what is so special about this. Is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be in some way pressed out of that?</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question, all these things were linked. Last summer people were very concerned and rightly so about issues to do with Colombia and I had to return from my summer holidays to deal with it. The matter was in the newspapers for days. I remind Deputy Kenny that I appreciate his informing me that these were matters of great concern to the people of the country and to our international credibility. The Minister, who takes a tough line on criminality from all quarters and all organisations, has consistently taken a tough line this year. He has been dealing with these issues without fear or favour. He makes his point strongly about anyone who in his view gets in the way and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The substantive question put to the Taoiseach was what was the threat to our democracy. Will the Taoiseach answer that question? I remind him it was protection of our democracy and the institutions of the State that justified a previous Minister for Justice tapping telephones. Will the Taoiseach spell out what was the threat?</P><Col N="361"/>
      <P>Like Deputy Kenny, I think Frank Connolly&rsquo;s answers to legitimate questions would not have satisfied Frank Connolly the journalist if he were asking the questions. I am not interested in either watchdogs or lap-dogs. What I want to know is whether the Taoiseach stands over the untrammelled and unreviewable use of executive power, where no prosecution has taken place or where a prosecution might be contemplated, to access Garda intelligence information in this fashion. If the Minister believes, as he has said, that he had a duty to do what he did, why did he not give expression to that duty in this House? Why, if he felt that was his duty, did he secretly and selectively leak a document from the relevant file?</P>
      <P>We are talking here about a Minister who inserted a particular provision in the Garda Act that gives him access to such files. The same Minister is in favour of a State appointed press council. I am sure the Minister, who knows pretty much everything that is going on, knows that the next stop for the Centre for Public Inquiry was to be Thornton Hall and that the CPI had a number of meetings with the Thornton Hall people. Did he know that? Did he know that would be a conflict of interest and did he record the matter with the Taoiseach? I ask the Taoiseach for the third time to answer the question, did he believe there was a threat to our democracy and what was that threat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>We know what happened before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If there was no statement, I would answer the question, but the Minister has asked to make a statement and I support what he will say shortly.</P>
      <P>There is public interest in the disclosure of criminal activity, particularly where that disclosure is intended to protect the State&rsquo;s interest in maintaining the integrity of the passport system and the upholding of the relevant laws. The Minister is right to take that view. The type of disclosure he made is justified in the public interest. <Col N="362"/>These issues are decided on a case by case basis and the Minister made the point that a general public disclosure is justified in some circumstances. In the case in question, the Minister was entitled to take the view that the disclosure of the false application form through the media was appropriate. The Minister answered the question in the D&aacute;il in reply to a parliamentary question, which is on the record of the House. Therefore, it is incorrect to say he did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is the Head of Government, but he refuses to answer the central question. The Minister has based his justification for what he did on his belief there was a threat to our democratic system and institutions. I and Deputy Kenny asked the Taoiseach what was that threat, but he evaded the answer.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste is on the record as saying that the Centre for Public Inquiry was &ldquo;sinister and inappropriate&rdquo;. Does the Taoiseach agree? Does he agree that a question of balance must intrude here? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform took the uncustomary position of putting names into the public domain some time ago in terms of the fight against subversion, something with which I agreed even though it was unusual. However, most people in the House were under the impression that decommissioning had happened and the threat to the State no longer existed. If it does exist, the Taoiseach has an obligation to tell the House what is the information.</P>
      <P>If the Minister believes he had a duty to do what he did, why does he not make the full file available to the House and allow us judge for ourselves. We cannot have a system operated on the basis of &ldquo;Trust me, I know best&rdquo;. Leaving out the personalities, can a citizen who has not been brought before the courts find himself or herself in circumstances where selective use is made of Garda material to undermine that person? The Taoiseach cannot let Question Time, on an issue as fundamental as this, pass without saying why he is so confident in his support of the Minister in the matter of whether there was a threat to the institutions of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I say for the third time that the Minister will speak on behalf of the Government and will give its collective position on this issue. He will not speak as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but for the Government and he will outline the facts.</P>
      <P>There is no Garda file, the Minister does not have the Garda file. The Deputy is under the same misapprehension as others, that the Minister acted on the Garda file and that he holds it. He does not hold the Garda file on it. He is dealing with the issue of public interest in the disclosure of criminal activity, in particular, where the disclosure is intended to protect the State&rsquo;s interest in maintaining the integrity of the passport system. He had information of a bogus and false passport application form. We cannot argue <Col N="363"/>that people seeking to perpetrate a fraud on the State have a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There must be quite a few such bogus applications. People have done many things with passports. There is no connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was not dealing with a Garda file, he was dealing with a bogus application over a period, over the past few months. It is always the same here, something big happens in the height of summer and everybody then wants to forget about it. I was called on by all sides in this House some months ago to return to the House and deal with the issue of the Colombia Three. There were extended news briefs in the summer on the issue. However, now when the Minister takes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>What did the Taoiseach do about that? We still know as little about it as we did then.</P>

	<P>Allow the Taoiseach continue without interruption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy listen? The one thing people do not want to do is listen, they just want to raise issues. The Minister will outline the issues shortly.</P>
      <P>There were serious issues. The view that the Minister was the first person to put this matter in the public domain a few weeks ago is nonsense. These matters happened long before 28 July when the IRA, thankfully &mdash; it was one of the great events of this year &mdash; decided to cease paramilitary activity. In a prominent national paper in mid-July 2002 it was alleged that an individual travelled to Bogot&aacute; in the spring of 2001 using such a passport. Therefore, it was not the Minister who put this in the public domain in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach referred to the passport system which I understand is under the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Is the Taoiseach aware of a wider web of intrigue that goes further? He said the Government will be represented by the Minister. Is this the Government&rsquo;s initiative rather than that of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or is the Taoiseach suggesting that the Minister is responsible for this development?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach used the phrase &ldquo;at all times&rdquo;, a very loose response to the question as to when he was informed by the Minister about his views and actions. Will the Taoiseach be more specific? When did he first hear about this threat? He has not explained what is the threat. Going around with a false passport, if the allegation made is true, does not represent a threat to bring down <Col N="364"/>the State. When did the Taoiseach first become aware of this precedent which risks hanging out to dry any journalist, Member or other person by a Minister who has turned himself into a one-man star chamber? Can he explain why the information was given to just one journalist? If it was not, is it the case that the journalist was asked to request the information so it might be put into the public domain by the Minister through a journalist?</P>
      <P>What will the Taoiseach do with a Minister who tried so recklessly not only to assassinate the character of a former investigative journalist, with whom he might disagree on many issues, but also to undermine the authority of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the whole judicial system? How can he stand over a Minister who abuses power so recklessly? Is the real truth not that the Taoiseach is actually quite delighted that the Centre for Public Inquiry has had to fold following his initial meeting with Mr. Chuck Feeney? What was he asking Mr. Feeney to do to prevent the set-up of the centre? Is that not what this matter is about more so than anything else?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point the Deputy is making is entirely incorrect. There is no question of there being a campaign against the Centre for Public Inquiry, which happens to be Mr. Connolly&rsquo;s employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on the record. It was discussed at meetings of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter centres round the fraudulent use&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on the website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of an Irish passport and the activities of persons belonging to a proscribed organisation bent on subverting the State. It is about this and not about any of the other issues raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the years I have had many meetings with Mr. Chuck Feeney on many issues and I hope I will continue to do so. Mr. Feeney is very helpful to the State in respect of many projects, and many people involved in education, child care and other areas are very grateful for his activities.</P>
      <P>On the Minister being able to set down in a fair way his position on issues that have arisen or issues on which he is asked a question, his duty is to give full and detailed replies. He has done so and he has a right in this regard. There is a public interest in the disclosure of criminal activity particularly where such disclosure is intended to <Col N="365"/>protect the State&rsquo;s interests, maintain the integrity of the passport system and uphold the State&rsquo;s laws. That type of disclosure is justified in the public interest and is decided on a case-by-case basis. In the present case, the Minister is entitled to take the view that disclosure of the false application form through the media was appropriate even though these events had been in the media several years ago. In answering questions, the Minister is entitled to present all the facts and demonstrate the bona fides of his actions. I cannot see anything incorrect in any of this action. Normally, people withhold investigation and can be investigated for withholding information. The idea that the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions was affected holds no validity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach has basically said, without saying so in words, that there is no threat to the State. So, that was a trumped up statement anyway. How can the Taoiseach defend a Minister who, quite clearly, does not approve of people throwing into the public domain facts that have not been proven in court? He said on 4 September 2003 to Pat Kenny on RTE: &ldquo;I am not supposed to just throw out into the public domain facts which haven&rsquo;t been proven in court about people&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach is defending the Minister when he does something for which the Minister would have somebody else in court and on whom he would impose a five-year jail sentence. This is inexplicable. Is it not important that the Taoiseach answer the very strong charge that the Centre for Public Inquiry was on the tail of the Government regarding the sale of the Thornton prison site? The European Commission also feels this matter needs to be investigated. It is very serious if planning permission is not granted in respect of this site and sites close to it given that the Minister spent &euro;30 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on a site in respect of which planning permission would not be granted under ordinary circumstances. Is it not the case that the Taoiseach does not want an investigation into this matter? Is it not the case that he can run but cannot hide and that this action will draw more heat on the Government than he would have wished for?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the folly of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in proceeding with the Corrib Gas project in view of the findings of the Advantica and CPI Cupewich reports which confirm great danger to the Rossport residents and in view of the terrible explosion in Hemel Hempsted in which Shell was involved.</P>

        No.<i> a</i>19 is a statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to information now in the public domain reflecting on the probity and past conduct and fitness to hold office of the chief executive of the Centre for Public Inquiry. What has this House become? This is not a court of law to determine whether the chief executive of the Centre for Public Inquiry can hold office. This is not public office or somebody in the employ of the State. This is a man whose job, and the jobs of others, have been put in severe jeopardy by the outrageous remarks and abuse of position by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>

	<P>We are in the last days of session as Christmas approaches. Last night, just after 11 p.m., I passed by the front gate of Leinster House where Marie Therese O&rsquo;Loughlin was lying in the freezing fog. Apparently, there is no room at the inn. I understand the State provided the building in which the Morning Star hostel was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has been raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan on the Adjournment and has been allowed. We cannot anticipate the Adjournment debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the time of year and the circumstances involved, there must be some way to investigate this so that it might be concluded.</P>
      <P>I understand serious concerns have been expressed about the imprisonment of a young Tipperary man in England, Christy McGrath, on a murder charge. Little can be done now about <Col N="377"/>this, but it is an issue of which the Taoiseach might take note. I met members of his family and a support group who are anxious that it is taken up with the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and the British Prime Minister.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>

T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil easpa aistritheoir&iacute; &oacute;n t&iacute;r seo sa mBruis&eacute;il. C&eacute; mh&eacute;ad aistritheoir&iacute; a bheas &aacute; gcur ann ag an Rialtas sa dtreo is go mbeidh an st&aacute;das curtha i gcr&iacute;ch i gceart?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We intend to get it running but there is a question of getting sufficient staff numbers to be able to operate the system. Certain standards must be complied with, not only with Irish but staff having another continental language. We are still doing everything we can to ensure it starts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If a doubt now exists whether the Morning Star hostel was subject to State inspection, surely there must be some way for the Government to intervene&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, has raised the matter on the Adjournment and it has been allowed. It is unreasonable to anticipate the Adjournment debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle. There must, however, be some way to end the punishment being inflicted on the woman outside the gates of Leinster House at this time of year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise. As the Deputy knows, he had an opportunity to raise this matter on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government intend to proceed with legislation to establish a statutory press council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be introduced early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that my matter was not accepted under Standing Order 31, will a review of emergency procedures in the event of a disaster such as that at Hemel Hempsted be part of the promised national oil reserves agency Bill? I seek some amnesty and clemency for the lady protesting outside the gates of Leinster House given the suffering she has experienced.</P>
      <P>The Green Party will write to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges submitting a complaint regarding the decision by the House to vote to collude with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in defamation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s actions are not on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the fact that the services directive proposed by the European Commission has gone through a committee of the European Parliament and is likely to be voted on in plenary session in February next year and in view of the amendments to the directive and its significance for many Irish workers, is it possible for a debate to be arranged in Government time when the House resumes in January to discuss this matter and have the position of the Government known before the vote is taken in the Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will examine the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the Adoptive Leave Bill and Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill, which have been before the House for the past two years, be enacted? When will we see the legislation to implement the additional maternity leave announced in the budget last week? Will the Taoiseach facilitate the introduction of such legislation at an early date in order that parents who have children prior to 1 March can avail of the measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to debate the issue later on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The measure is not part of the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Both Bills are well advanced and we would like both of them passed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan has raised the matter on the Adjournment. In fairness to the Deputy who raised it, we cannot have a debate on the issue now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Ceann Comhairle has so ruled but I will say it, as everybody else has done, because I know he treats us <Col N="379"/>all exactly the same. Will the Taoiseach be good enough to reply to the correspondence I issued to him making an appeal on behalf of the lady in question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the D&aacute;il for affording me an opportunity to make a statement to the House. For the information of Members and clarity in proceedings, I am circulating with this statement the reply to the written parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Finian McGrath, the document which was furnished by me to the <i>Irish Independent</i> at its request and published on 26 November last and a transcript of remarks made today on RTE radio by the chairman of the Centre for Public Inquiry.</P>
      <P>As a Minister, I am answerable to this House and through it to the people.</P>

	<P>The Minister should resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it falls especially to me, along with the Minister for Defence, to safeguard the security of the State and prevent the subversion of our democracy. While I am honoured to hold that position, it is one which is both challenging and demanding, constantly requiring the exercise of good authority in a firm and robust manner. Each of us, as a citizen of Ireland, has rights and duties. Article 9 of the Constitution states that every citizen owes a &ldquo;fundamental political duty&rdquo; of &ldquo;loyalty to the State&rdquo;. It is in the context of this duty of loyalty that we all can rightly claim to exercise our constitutional rights and freedoms.</P><Col N="382"/>
      <P>Under our law, the Provisional IRA is an unlawful organisation because it is a treasonable group which claims that the powers of Government of the Irish people are vested in it and not in the institutions established under our Constitution. Moreover, the IRA has over the years consistently engaged in massive criminality, much of which has been motivated by a desire to build up a vast multi-million euro fund to assist the provisional movement in its quest to obtain political power and a role in the Government of this State.</P>
      <P>Apart from major criminal activity, which has been documented in the reports of the Independent Monitoring Commission, the provisional movement has in recent years carried out two spectacular fund-raising criminal acts, namely, the &euro;40 million raid on the Northern Bank carried out days after the breakdown of discussions on the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement last December, and the sale of know-how to the FARC guerrillas in Colombia which was designed to net the provisional movement tens of millions of euro to assist in the provisionals&rsquo; bid for political power in Ireland, North and South.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is my clear duty to prevent and counter this subversive strategy of the provisionals. The fate of Irish democracy in large measure depends upon the capacity of the Government to frustrate the plans of the provisionals to subvert Irish democracy by these unlawful means.</P>
      <P>The Constitution provides in Article 40.6.1 that: &ldquo;The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State&rdquo;. Undoubtedly, the Centre for Public Inquiry, as a body which sought and obtained multi-million euro charitable funds given with the best of motives to be expended for the public good, aspires to be an organ of public opinion, but equally it is one which, in subversive hands, has the capacity to gravely undermine the authority of the State.</P>
      <P>I regard it as my clear and unequivocal duty to bring into the public domain the central role played in that body by a person whom the Garda is satisfied participated in an important way in the series of visits to Colombia designed to exchange know-how in terrorism and explosives for massive amounts of cash, apparently to be spent on distorting our democratic process. I reject out of hand the pernicious and absurd argument that, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I should apply to myself some self-denying ordinance in respect of disclosing in public adverse information about individuals whose actions threaten to subvert our democracy and Constitution, unless such information can be established beyond reasonable doubt by admissible evidence <Col N="383"/>as part of the criminal justice process. I heard with disbelief this argument being advanced today by someone whom I would have expected to understand fully the constitutional role and duty of the Government to use every lawful means to safeguard our democracy and prevent our constitutional order being subverted.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have been authoritatively advised that it is my legal right and constitutional duty to make public information which is given to me in my role as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acting as one of the intelligence services of the State when, in my judgment, the public interest so requires. My legal authority for disclosing information in such circumstances is clearly set out in section 4 of the Official Secrets Act 1963. It is not qualified or abridged in any way by the terms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act recently enacted by the Oireachtas &mdash; it is expressly preserved by that Statute &mdash; nor do the provisions of the Data Protection Act in any way affect data kept for the purpose of safeguarding the security of the State. Nor is there any basis for claiming that the information I gave this House or the document I caused to be published was in any sense confidential or that its release prejudiced any Garda investigation. The passport application form in question was a forgery of a State document originally kept in the possession of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Its disclosure does not breach the confidence or privacy of any private citizen.</P>
      <P>I categorically reject any suggestion that my actions in this matter have infringed the very clear and supportive terms of the law of our land. I have acted with good authority in conformity with the law and in fulfilment of my duties as a member of the Executive branch of Government, charged with upholding and defending the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Irish people and this House would have just cause for complaint if I had remained silent and swept these issues under the carpet or left them in ignorance of the major threat to our democratic values, which would have arisen by doing nothing. I would remind the Members of this House of Edmund Burke&rsquo;s observation that &ldquo;The only thing needed for evil to prosper is for good men to do nothing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In that context, I must ask whether others have shown the requisite vigour in pursuing these matters. In particular, commentators who never asked the hard questions about an issue that was staring them in the face &mdash; since, as the Taoiseach said, all of this was in the public domain a number of years ago &mdash; should perhaps pause before condemning those among their colleagues who genuinely sought to educate public opinion in the manner envisaged for a free press by our Constitution.</P><Col N="384"/>
      <P>I enjoy the wholehearted support of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the entire Government in the actions I am taking. I am calling on the responsible Members of this House, in turn, to acknowledge the propriety of each and every action I have taken. It would be a sad day for Ireland if any of my predecessors or successors, faced with the same situation, failed to act as I have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has attempted to provide <i>post facto</i> justification for behaviour on his part, which was clearly inappropriate and not in keeping with the integrity of his ministerial office. That is the central issue in this debate. Essentially, the Minister has failed to justify his actions and he has signally failed to deal with the central questions that arise in this debate. The first of those questions arises from his statement last Sunday when he said his actions were related to the fact that there were substantial reasons to believe there was a threat to the State&rsquo;s democracy and authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not explained to the House what was the threat to the State that existed then or now. Let me assure him absolutely that if there is at any stage a threat to the security of this State, as he knows, he will have absolute support from Fine Gael for any legitimate action to deal with it. Our problem is that we do not know what the threat is about which he talked. Was it an invasion? Is it supposed to be the importation of arms, or was it just something the Minister dreamed up and then, because it was his <i>post facto</i> opinion, used it as a justification?</P>
      <P>Second, if there was any such threat, what is the organisation from which the threat derived? Was it the IRA? Our understanding was that the IRA had gone out of commission and was not now involved in subversion. Is this not accepted by the Minister?</P>
      <P>Third, if one is interested in protecting the integrity of the State &mdash; and, as mentioned by the Taoiseach, the integrity of the passport system &mdash; how does one do that by leaking a document selectively to a particular paper? How does that protect the integrity of anything? It seems to me that any such activity is effectively, as was pointed out to me in an e-mail from a citizen today, filching a potential court document from a file and using it to bolster his case by revealing it in a back-door way. Essentially, the Minister has not given any explanation for that kind of conduct.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Fourth, the Minister says there is no question of affecting any possible trial in the future. Does that mean that he does not want to see anybody, against whom further evidence may subsequently arise, brought before a court? I do not want to go into any detail here, but I would refer to the case of Sophie Toscan du Plantier in my own area of west Cork. Whether through DNA or otherwise, if further evidence arises there I want the person responsible to be brought before the courts. Should the same not apply to what the Minister <Col N="385"/>suggests are actions against the interests of the State in this case? Therefore, was it appropriate for the Minister to deal with the file in his hands and to release a copy from that official file, where the primary evidence would or could be used in a future trial?</P>
      <P>This is an extraordinary situation and in my long time in the House I have never seen anything like it. What is even more unusual is that the Minister does not realise it is extraordinary, which is probably the biggest concern we have. The real concern among many people is where this will lead to and what kind of precedent the Minister has created. Who will be the next target for the Minister&rsquo;s ire? Does he believe that in his role as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform he is able to use official files in his possession as part of his political armoury to target individuals?</P>
      <P>I have no brief for Mr. Frank Connolly. As far as I am concerned, he has serious questions to answer, in particular concerning his activities in April 2001, but that is not the issue at all. The issue is the behaviour of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and whether it was appropriate in the circumstances. There is real public concern that there may be a continuation of this type of activity. In the fight against criminality and subversion, is it not important that the people should have full confidence, faith and trust in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? The Minister is at the head of the fight. Does he not appreciate how he has undermined that trust and confidence? Does he not realise, even now, that it would be in his interests, for however long he remains in that office, to have that trust and confidence of the people, and that he should make efforts to restore it? Does he not accept simply that, at the end of the day, it is not proper procedure to leak from an official file, a Garda file or wherever it came from, a document or documents that could be primary evidence in subsequent court proceedings? Does he not accept, even at this stage, that activity of that type is utterly inappropriate? He spoke about protecting the security of the State, but does he not also accept that where there is genuine legitimate action to be taken on his part, he will get the full support of this House? He cannot ask for the support of this House or the general public, however, for inappropriate behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The title of this debate is ill chosen. It should reflect the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has questions to answer as well. The Minister is also in the dock but that is not reflected in the title of the debate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister shocked the nation with his candid admission on RTE radio yesterday that he deliberately supplied documents concerning an ongoing Garda investigation into a forged passport to his favoured <i>Irish Independent</i> journalist. At the time of the leaking of the documents to only one journalist, the Minister made no state<Col N="386"/>ment of his intent or purpose. It was a total secret and nobody knew anything about it. In the D&aacute;il last week, however, when he answered a question, he deliberately departed from the thrust of the question to provide confidential information about a former journalist, Frank Connolly, the director of the Centre for Public Inquiry.</P>
      <P>On the RTE programme yesterday, under pressure, the Minister explained his eccentric behaviour by invoking national security for his actions. That is not what the Taoiseach said earlier &mdash; he was concerned about the integrity of a passport. The Minister said he was concerned about the integrity of national security.</P>
      <P>His actions and statements are absolutely unprecedented. He has moved into uncharted territory where no Cabinet Minister has ever dared to venture before. He has determined that he, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, can look into his own heart and decide what constitutes a threat to national security. He can then put confidential material into the public domain by whatever mechanism he chooses. After that, the Minister can become DPP, judge, jury and executioner of the persons identified on the file. The Minister believes that he can bypass Article 38 of the Constitution, which requires due process in the investigation and prosecution of an offence. The Minister has not stated whether he has supplied any other documents from Garda files or from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the same journalist or to others. Perhaps he will tell us that in his replies. Did he act in the interests of national security or did he simply leak the information? Neither has the Minister stated whether he intends to supply documents in future to selected journalists in the interests of national security or otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that this comes from a Minister who recently raged so strongly against garda&iacute; leaking confidential information to the media on ongoing Garda investigations and who, in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, imposed the heavy penalty of five years&rsquo; imprisonment or a fine of &euro;50,000 on any garda found guilty of such an offence. He introduced an amendment to the same Bill arrogating to himself the legal right to access all Garda files at his whim. Now he has apparently begun not just to access files but selectively to release information from them, concerning not only the forged passport but the information relating thereto, to selected journalists. At the time, the Labour Party totally opposed the amendment, knowing that it would be wide open to abuse. We certainly did not expect to be proven right so quickly.</P>
      <P>Given the events, would it not be preferable for the Minister to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the entirety of the Garda file on Frank Connolly and his alleged trip to Colombia rather than having them filtered through the editorial processes of the <i>Irish Independent</i>? Perhaps the people might then be able to make up their own minds on these issues. While he is at it, would he not also lay before the Houses the Garda files on <Col N="387"/>all Deputies suspected of close connections with the provisional movement, including one Member who he has already alleged is a member of the IRA army council? If the security of the State is so much at risk, would it not be better to brief the Oireachtas and all the journalists of the country now?</P>
      <P>It is not desirable in principle or in practice that any officer of the State should have untrammelled and unreviewable powers of access to secret files and of dissemination of related information, either on or off the record, circumventing the judicial or any other adjudicative process, in the absence of redress for those whose rights are adversely affected. Might the hostility shown to this individual, which seems to justify the breaking of all precedent and the making of new assertions of constitutional Executive prerogative, have anything to do with the institution for which Frank Connolly works, the Centre for Public Inquiry? Does the Minister agree with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s outrageous statement on the matter to the effect that the establishment of such a watchdog body is &ldquo;absolutely sinister and inappropriate&rdquo;? If so, will he outline the next individuals or institutions against which the Government is preparing to take action?</P>
      <P>Can the Minister really expect that a loyal Sancho Panza in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, heroic though he may be and mighty with his pen, will demolish all the giants and ugly windmills that Don Quixote, the Minister, perceives to threaten the national security landscape of this little island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to share time with Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Finian McGrath.</P>
      <P>The events of the past few days have a dangerous similarity to Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s witch-hunts in the United States in the 1950s. Demagoguery, arrogance and innuendo were used then to destroy people&rsquo;s careers and they are being used to the same ends by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform today. There is a touch of Senator McCarthy about the Minister, Deputy McDowell. The Minister&rsquo;s actions and allegations have compromised the separation of powers that has underpinned this State since its foundation. He has undermined the garda&iacute; and the Director of Public Prosecutions and he has failed to clarify today how the interests of the State were or are threatened by an individual.</P>
      <P>If he did not get that information from Garda files, where did he get it? Perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has questions to answer regarding whether he handed over information from the passports section to the Minister, and perhaps he should clarify what he knew and what questions he was asked. He should offer a statement to the House too. It is worth remembering that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, introduced amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 that would jail a garda for up to five years if he or she had put information into the <Col N="388"/>public domain; yet the Minister, through his actions, has politicised the judicial process and undermined democracy in this State. At this point, he should resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I charge that the Minister has acted as judge and jury against a private citizen. He has violated Articles 38 and 40 of the Constitution, which provide that no citizen shall be tried, save in due course of law, and that all citizens shall be held equal before the law. In what way was the security of this State threatened in the past few weeks? How exactly did the Minister envisage that giving confidential Garda files to a newspaper would address that supposed threat and advance democracy and the security of this State? He has failed in his opening remarks to explain exactly how due process was safeguarded or even observed by his actions. Does he believe in the presumption that someone is innocent unless proven guilty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Jean McConville?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must state how many other requests from Independent Newspapers for confidential Garda information have resulted in his leaking material to the media. Is he the &ldquo;Garda source&rdquo; so often reported in the tabloids? The Minister has breached the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, legislation introduced by him, by disclosing confidential Garda information, and as such, he should be charged. The criminal offence is punishable by five years&rsquo; imprisonment. I call on him to resign and, if he does not, the Taoiseach has a duty to sack him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Today is a very sad one for the justice system as it marks a step backwards regarding human rights on the island. It is not the first time in the history of our small State that a Minister for Justice has trampled over the rights of our citizens. It is a disgrace, a scandal and an abuse of power. It is a shame that any Minister for Justice should turn his back on the decent, fundamental principles of justice. The Minister has done our democracy a major disservice and hidden behind D&aacute;il privilege to undermine the backbone of our judicial system, which guarantees the presumption of innocence until one has been proven guilty in a court of law.</P>
      <P>I agree with Mr. Justice Flood&rsquo;s comments this morning that we must stand up for the system and guarantee our citizens their rights under the Constitution. There has been nothing progressive or democratic about the actions or words of the Minister over the past few days. He has undermined the justice system and damaged the independence and integrity of the DPP&rsquo;s office. Those are serious issues, and it is time the Minister resigned. We cannot have a Minister who thinks himself above the law or that law and order are his to decide. The Minister would be at home in some right wing government in South America.</P><Col N="389"/>
      <P>I also accuse him of being a hypocrite regarding the leaking of Garda files to a journalist to destroy Mr. Connolly and the great work of the Centre for Public Inquiry in rooting out sleaze and corruption in this country. In recent days we have seen more evidence of it in my constituency, with great damage to politics. Regarding Chuck Feeney and the Centre for Public Inquiry, I urge them to reconsider funding instead of listening to the Minister or his party, who from day one wanted to take out the centre. This country needs such groups, and Frank Connolly has been a tireless investigative journalist who exposed scandals, corruption and sleaze. Many people knew that elements would take him out.</P>
      <P>This debate is about a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who abused his power to trample on the rights of a citizen and seriously damage the integrity of the justice system.</P>

I decided that I would do so for proper reasons to establish the truth. If any other journalist had asked me for that at the time, I would have given it to him or her.</P>
      <P>The Deputies opposite seem to ignore the fact that as far back as the early summer of 2002, all these facts were in the public domain &mdash; that Mr. Connolly travelled to Colombia, used the name &ldquo;Johnston&rdquo; on his travels and was in possession of a passport.

As the document belonged to the Department of Foreign Affairs, which the Minister admitted, did the journalist in question know that the Minister had the document or that he was the person to ask to get it from the Department? Did the Minister go to that Department and request this document that was part of an ongoing Garda investigation and that might have been needed for a future prosecution? That document would then have been contaminated with the possibility that it could never have been used again. Is that what the Minister is telling us he did?</P>
      <P>What were the issues of national security that required the Minister to act in this fashion? He has not answered that question. If there were issues of national security, the Members of this House should know them. This is the body that has the responsibility for ensuring that the people are protected. It does not rest only on the Minister&rsquo;s shoulders. He kept the document to himself all this time, harbouring it until he found a journalist to whom to give it. He protected the integrity of the document but how was he protecting the integrity of the State by keeping it a secret, one which has now come out by chance? The Minister has no credibility. He does not expect us to believe this. A child would not believe what he is saying on this matter.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister not go to Mr. Justice Fergus Flood or Professor Enda McDonagh with the information he had, or did he do this? Mr. Justice Flood is an eminent lawyer. He was chairman of a tribunal, a judge in the Special Criminal Court and a man who knew well about these matters of national security. He was a man who could be trusted through his experience. Professor Enda McDonagh is an eminent philosopher and theologian. Surely he could be trusted to go to about this matter, even if the Minister was not prepared to tell the Members of this House or any other journalist about it.</P>
      <P>It seems strange that the next investigation the Centre for Public Inquiry was about to embark on was an inquiry into the establishment of a prison at Thornton Hall and all the circumstances surrounding it. Can the Minister tell the House categorically that he knew nothing about the <Col N="392"/>intention of the centre to embark on such an investigation?</P>

To promote or perpetuate the notion that the opposite is true is completely false and subverts democracy. It is time for the Minister to face the fact that there is a changed political dispensation on this island, one which he must face on a fair and level playing field, as we must.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>Given the Minister&rsquo;s antipathy to the political beliefs I hold, what were the other motives behind his decision? Were there concerns regarding the Centre for Public Inquiry? Did he or those around him have concerns about matters relating to Shell Oil, the Corrib gas pipeline or links to political figures with views and aspirations akin to the Minister&rsquo;s? The Minister was asked earlier where he received the documentation that he circulated in the House today. How did he come by it?

How many times has he provided information to members of the press in the same way as he has exercised and abused his position with regard to Mr. Connolly and the Centre for Public Inquiry?

      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>I am very pleased to introduce this, the first of two Bills intended to implement the &euro;1.12 billion social welfare package announced in the budget. This substantial investment represents a 28% increase on the 2005 package of &euro;874 million. It brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure in 2006 to more than &euro;13.5 billion, which is double what was spent in 2000. Behind the expenditure statistics are the men, women and children for whom the welfare benefits and supports can be a financial lifeline during vulnerable and difficult times. Around 1.5 million people will benefit from the significant increases and improvements in the budget that will protect and improve the living standards of social welfare recipients.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the fruits of our economic growth benefit all, especially those who are most vulnerable.

By any standard this is a ground-breaking budget.</P>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves. There are some &euro;800 million on substantial increases in allowances, pensions and entitlements and a further &euro;300 million specifically for a range of social policy reform measures. Social welfare payments have been increased by almost four times the expected rate of inflation; the lowest rates of social welfare have been increased by an unprecedented &euro;17 a week, to a new level of &euro;165.80, with proportionate increases in the qualified adult allowance. Means tested old age pensions have been increased by &euro;16 a week to &euro;182 and contributory pensions by &euro;14 to more than &euro;193 a week. A wide ranging reform programme will boost the entitlements of older people, alleviate poverty, support activation and recognise carers. <Col N="400"/>Fuel allowances are being increased by &euro;5 a week as part of a major fuel poverty relief package costing more than &euro;42 million. Carers&rsquo; allowances are being increased by more than &euro;26 a week with the result that the top rate will now stand at &euro;200 a week. A range of measures costing &euro;28 million will promote activation by improving income disregards and tapered payments for people with disabilities. Maternity benefit is being increased to 80% of reckonable weekly earnings and the duration of both maternity and adoptive benefit is being extended by four weeks in 2006 and a further four weeks in 2007.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the past year I have been laying out, with the support of the Government, a strong new social reform agenda and now major funding of more than &euro;300 million is available to underpin and give tangible effect to these important, and necessary, reforms. The reforms, while protecting those who are disadvantaged among us, must also strive to get behind the welfare payments and tackle the social issues involved.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is a well established fact that the best route out of poverty is through employment. That is why, through these reforms, I want to create the changes and opportunities that will bring people from welfare dependency to financial independence by providing the stepping stones to a better standard of living and income. Overall, the budget is a clear demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to vigorously addressing, in particular, the needs of older people, making further progress towards alleviating poverty &mdash; especially child and pensioner poverty &mdash; the development of a range of supports and opportunities for lone parents and recognising and enhancing supports for carers. I want to briefly outline briefly the key benefits of budget 2006 for each of these customer groups.</P>
      <P>We have a booming economy and it is only right that the people who helped lay the foundations for our current prosperity should be able to enjoy the fruits of the tremendous strides the country has made in the last decade or so. The Government has delivered record increases in pensions since taking office in 1997. In fact, pensions have increased by more than 80% since then, well ahead of the increase in the consumer price index, CPI, and gross earnings over the same period.</P>
      <P>In addition to the significant weekly increases, the budget makes provision for a number of very important measures designed to target resources at particular groups of older people including: combining all non-contributory payments for people over 66 years of age, other than carer&rsquo;s allowance, into one standard enhanced non-contributory pension scheme with a greatly improved means test that will lift some 34,000 pensioners on to higher or full pensions; increasing the amount of means disregarded from &euro;7.60 to &euro;20 per week for this standard pension; providing a special earnings disregard of &euro;100 per week; increasing the additional allowance paid to those <Col N="401"/>over 80 years of age by &euro;3.60 to &euro;10 per week, benefiting more than 100,000 pensioners including some 33,000 receiving widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions.</P>
      <P>I am determined that everyone will be entitled to a decent pension. Central to achieving this aspiration is widespread increases in occupational and private pensions coverage. I have received a comprehensive report from the Pensions Board on the current situation and proposals for measures we might take in the future. This report is before the Cabinet for consideration and when this is completed it will be published. I want to see the report engender a national debate on the future of our pensions system.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>On many occasions, I have identified child poverty as one of the key challenges of the Government and of society in general. For individual children, their families and communities and for society at large, the long-term cost of poverty in childhood demands that we address this issue as a priority. In the context of the 2006 budget, I have taken a number of measures, in addition to substantially increasing the lower income weekly rates by &euro;17, to alleviate child poverty. Investment of more than &euro;100 million in increases in child benefit will lift payment rates to &euro;150 for the first two children and &euro;185 for the third and each subsequent child. These increases will benefit more than 540,000 families in respect of more than one million children and fully honours the Government&rsquo;s commitment on child benefit. Taken together with the Government&rsquo;s child care package where all families with children under the age of six will benefit from the new child care payment, this brings the total annual cash support for children to at least &euro;2,800 per annum per child.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>When it comes to practical, targeted and concentrated measures to tackle poverty then the family income supplement, FIS, has an increasingly important role to play. That is why I have made major changes to the support scheme, making it particularly beneficial to larger families, and increased funding by a further &euro;25 million. As Deputies will be aware, FIS is paid to parents in low income employment with the objective of directing more resources to larger families. Under the changes now being introduced, FIS payments will make further significant contributions to incomes in thousands of low income homes. As a result of the improvements it is estimated that more than 5,000 additional families will become eligible for the payment next year.</P>
      <P>From FIS alone, depending on the size of the family, weekly increases will range from more than &euro;11 to &euro;169 a week. For example, a family with four children could see its weekly FIS payment rise by up to &euro;64.80 a week while the increase for a family of six children could rise by nearly &euro;117 a week.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement can contribute significantly to boosting child support incomes. For example, a family with earnings from employment of &euro;20,000 and with two children under six <Col N="402"/>years would qualify for &euro;3,900 in FIS annually. When one adds to that the &euro;2000 in child care payment and &euro;3,600 in child benefit then that family has an annual tax free child welfare income support of a further &euro;9,500 a year. For a family on the same income of &euro;20,000 but with four children, two of them aged under six years, the annual FIS support amounts to &euro;7,644, giving the family a total child support package of &euro;17,684 a year. For emphasis, a family with four children on &euro;20,000 two under and two over the age of six, will have an extra &euro;17,000 a year in income, specifically for child support. At a &euro;30,000 income from employment, the same family would still qualify for total child support income of &euro;11,694 annually. These figures are quite significant in terms of addressing child poverty and focusing on children.</P>
      <P>For thousands of families on low incomes, another significant support is the back to school clothing and footwear payment. This payment is being substantially increased by &euro;40 per child and entitlement to it is being further extended. I am making a further &euro;2 million available to the school meals programme which makes a valuable contribution to the quality of life and the educational opportunities of children in low income families. More than &euro;10 million is now earmarked for the various school meals initiatives next year. I am increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;5, bringing it to &euro;14 per week, payable with effect from January 2006. I am also availing of the opportunity to remove the current anomaly whereby residents in some local authority flat complexes with communal heating systems were ineligible for the fuel allowance. Such residents will now be able to qualify for the allowance if they meet the other conditions of the scheme. In all, more than &euro;125 million will be spent on fuel allowances next year benefiting nearly 275,000 households.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies will be aware that the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has been analysing the issues and developing proposals as regards child income support and in particular, the possibility of merging FIS and child dependent allowance into a second tier child income support &mdash; to avoid the disincentives inherent in child dependant allowance. My priorities for 2006 will include how best we can pursue the proposals arising from the NESC report.</P>
      <P>Central to alleviating child poverty is improvement in incomes and supports for lone parents. As research released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office clearly demonstrates, among those found to be most at risk of poverty were children living in lone parent households. My Department provides income support for approximately 80,000 lone parents through the one-parent family payment, at a total cost to the State of over &euro;760 million this year.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>Since I became Minister, I have repeatedly stressed the importance of reforms in this area and of the need to deliver a better standard of living for lone parents and their children with policies <Col N="403"/>that are directed at the breaking down of existing obstacles to employment, increasing access to career enhancing education and training opportunities, and the transforming of lives through targeted supports and enlightened social policies.</P>
      <P>As many in this House may know, there has been no change to the income limits applying to the one-parent family payment since the scheme was introduced in 1997. I want to give lone parents an opportunity to continue to increase their earnings without raising their fears about losing their entitlement to the payment. In recognition of this I am pleased, therefore, to increase the upper income limit for the one-parent family payment from &euro;293 to &euro;375 per week. This substantial increase will encourage employment. Lone parents working over 19 hours per week can also claim the family income supplement. In addition, I am providing additional funding in the budget for the Family Support Agency and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, in order that they can further develop the services they provide for vulnerable families. The additional funding of &euro;3 million to the Family Support Agency will enable the establishment of 12 new family resource centres around the country and increase the level of grant assistance that the agency provides to marriage and family counselling agencies, amongst other initiatives. The additional funding of &euro;1.5 million that I am providing for MABS includes provision for the further development of the service as well as specific funding for the establishment of a national helpline.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, I have initiated a major review of the one-parent family payment in order to assess how best we can support lone parents in their efforts to improve their lives and those of their children. That review is being finalised and I will be bringing it to Government in January next with a view to publication and wide consultation.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the provision of recognition and supports to carers is one of my principal priorities and I am pleased to announce that this budget provides for a range of measures which will benefit carers including increasing the rate of carer&rsquo;s benefit by &euro;17 to &euro;180.70 per week. The rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance will increase by &euro;26.40 to &euro;180 per week for a carer under age 66, and the rate for carers over age 66 will increase by &euro;30.20 to &euro;200 per week, making it the single largest welfare entitlement apart from that of pensioners aged over 80. These represent increases of over 17% for recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance and will serve to acknowledge and support the invaluable work of our family carers.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc20- ?>The rate of the respite care grant will increase to &euro;1,200 from June next year. The number of hours which a person can work and still receive a carer&rsquo;s allowance will be increased, carer&rsquo;s benefit or respite care grant will increase from ten to 15 hours per week and there will be an increase in the income disregards for the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance to &euro;290 for a single person and &euro;580 for <Col N="404"/>a couple. This fulfils the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to enable all those earning up to average industrial earnings to qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance. There will be an extension in the duration of the carer&rsquo;s benefit scheme to two years per care recipient from May 2006.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>This is a most significant budget for carers, not only in terms of expenditure on income supports from my Department but also in the realisation of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the proper recognition of carers and the delivering of the necessary structures and supports for carers and the people for whom they care.</P>
      <P>Resources in this budget will be targeted on helping those most in need, not alone to raise their level of income and standard of living, but to ensure everyone is a valued citizen who can make their individual contribution to society regardless of their particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Sections 2 and 3 reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting pensioners and together with the Schedules to the Bill provide for increases in the rates of social welfare payments, including an increase of &euro;14 per week for persons in receipt of old age contributory pension and for recipients of widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pension and deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit who are over age 66 and for recipients of retirement or invalidity pension aged 65 and over, bringing the weekly payment to &euro;193.30. Provision is also made for an increase of &euro;16 in the weekly personal rate of old age non-contributory pension, and this increase also applies to blind pension, widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pension and one-parent family payment where the recipient is aged over 66 years.</P>
      <P>In line with my particular focus on supporting carers, I have made provision for a special increase of &euro;30.20 per week for persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance who are over age 66. A special increase of &euro;26.40 is provided for recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance who are under 66 years.</P>
      <P>An increase of &euro;17 per week is provided for in all other social insurance and social assistance payments where the recipient is under 66 and for recipients of invalidity pension for those under 65. Section 2 provides for increases in the social insurance-based payments and for increases in respect of qualified adults of recipients of those payments. An increase of &euro;10.80 per week is being provided in respect of qualified adults of recipients of invalidity pension, where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over.</P>
      <P>An increase of &euro;10.80 per week is also being provided for qualified adults aged 66 years and over where their spouse or partner is receiving an old age contributory pension or is receiving a retirement pension, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for those on certain reduced rates.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>In addition to providing for the increases in social assistance payments, section 3 provides for increases in respect of the qualified adults of those payments. For example, the weekly over 66 quali<Col N="405"/>fied adult allowance rate is increased by &euro;10.60 in the case of old age non-contributory pensioners and by &euro;11.30 for the qualified adults aged under 66 of blind pensioners. Proportionate increases will be applied where persons are in receipt of reduced rate qualified adult allowance payments.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>As I have stated, I am also conscious of the needs of other vulnerable groups in our society. Accordingly, by providing for a weekly increase of &euro;17 in the personal rates of a range of payments, those in receipt of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, one-parent family payment, supplementary welfare allowance and farm assist will receive a maximum personal weekly rate of &euro;165.80.</P>
      <P>The social welfare budget increases included in this Bill will become payable from the first pay day in January 2006. Increases for recipients of the short-term payments such as unemployment benefit assistance, disability-maternity benefit, family income supplement, farm assist and supplementary welfare allowance will be paid from the first pay day in January 2006.</P>
      <P>Recipients, both long and short term, who are paid by means of electronic funds transfer, will receive their increases from the first pay day in January 2006. Due to the lead-in times involved in the production of personal payable orders for certain long-term payments such as pensions, it will not be possible for budgetary increases to be paid immediately, in such cases, from January next. Some 211,000 recipients of, for example, widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s, one-parent family and invalidity payments, will receive their new order books in mid-February 2006. This group will receive six weeks&rsquo; arrears of their budget increase which will be included in the first order of the new book and the weekly increase will be incorporated in their normal weekly payment thereafter.</P>
      <P>Certain other long-term recipients such as old age pensioners and disability allowance recipients &mdash; some 256,000 people &mdash; will receive new pension order books at the beginning of April 2006. This group will receive a special once-off payment in mid-February representing 12 weeks of their budgetary increase. This will cover retrospection of the increase to January plus an advance payment of the increase to the end of March 2006. From the book renewal date at end of March, the increase will be incorporated in the normal weekly payment.</P>
      <P>Section 4 provides for increases in the weekly income thresholds applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement, with effect from 5 January 2006. The new thresholds will range from &euro;465 to &euro;905 with the weekly FIS payments increasing by varying amounts from &euro;11.40 in the case of a family with one child, to &euro;169.20 for families with eight or more children. For example, the FIS payment to a family with four children will increase by &euro;64.80 per week.</P>
      <P>Sections 5 and 6 provide for changes in PRSI. The earnings ceiling for employee&rsquo;s social insurance contributions is being increased, in <Col N="406"/>section 5, by &euro;2,420 from &euro;44,180 to &euro;46,600 per annum with effect from 1 January 2006. In addition, this section provides for an increase in the limit of weekly earnings, below which PRSI is not payable, from &euro;287 to &euro;300.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>Section 6 provides for an increase in the income ceiling, from &euro;44,180 to &euro;46,600 for optional social insurance contributions. This section also comes into operation on 1 January 2006.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>Section 7 provides for an increase in the percentage of reckonable weekly earnings referred to in calculating the rate of payment under the maternity benefit scheme. This provision increases the rate from 75% to 80% and fulfils the commitment under Sustaining Progress to raise the limit to 80% of average weekly earnings during the life of the agreement. The measure will benefit the majority of recipients of the scheme and will take effect from January 2006. In addition, the section provides for the necessary amendments to extend the duration of maternity benefit, from 18 to 22 weeks, consequential on the extension of paid and unpaid maternity leave as announced in the budget last week. This measure takes effect from next March.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increases in the duration of the maternity and adoptive leave periods, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has transmitted the heads of draft orders implementing the increases to the Attorney General for formal early drafting. Section 7 also allows for the extension of the period after birth, by two weeks to 24 weeks, within which a father can claim maternity benefit following the death of the mother, provided that he satisfies the contribution conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>Section 8 provides for improvements to the adoptive benefit scheme by providing that, subject to certain conditions which will be prescribed in regulations, in the event of the hospitalisation of a child in respect of whom adoptive benefit is payable, the continuous payment of benefit may be postponed. This mirrors the current provisions of the maternity benefit scheme. The section also provides for the necessary amendments to adoptive benefit consequential on the extension of paid adoptive leave by four weeks, due to take effect from March 2006. The section further provides for an increase from 75% to 80% in the percentage of reckonable weekly earnings referred to in calculating the rate of adoptive benefit. This measure will come into effect from 1 January 2006. I intend to introduce a technical amendment to the section on Committee Stage to add clarity to the commencement order provision.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>Section 9 provides for the making of regulations to determine the manner in which gross weekly earnings are calculated for the purposes of the one-parent family payment scheme. The introduction of the one-parent family payment in 1997 provided for payments to be made to parents rearing children alone, and subsumed the various schemes which had until then provided for families in those circumstances. Special pro<Col N="407"/>vision was made for recipients of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit to ensure they continued to receive payment for the duration of their continuous entitlement to the scheme, provided that the person&rsquo;s income was below a specified limit. Section 10 contains a technical amendment to the scheme to provide for the making of regulations previously associated with the scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 11 provides for the payment of the over age 80 allowance to recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance from January 2006. At present, for the purposes of the rent or mortgage interest supplement payable in accordance with the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, an amount of up to &euro;60 of gross income from earnings from employment may be disregarded. Section 12 contains an improvement to the scheme by providing for the disregard of up to &euro;60, together with half the gross weekly earnings between &euro;60 and &euro;90.</P>
      <P>Section 13 provides for an increase in the health levy exemption thresholds from &euro;400 per week to &euro;440 per week and from &euro;20,800 per annum to &euro;22,880 per annum. This measure will take effect from 1 January 2006. I intend to introduce on Committee Stage an amendment to this section to correct an error in the annual threshold in the Bill as initiated.</P>
      <P>The Bill, the first of two instalments, builds further on the progression of social inclusion measures adopted by the Government in recent years. It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare income and other supports and prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need. I commend it to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the helpful briefing provided by his officials today.</P>
      <P>We have a booming economy and the Government is collecting unprecedented sums in both direct and indirect taxation. The CSO figures released yesterday show that almost one fifth of the population are at risk of poverty, while the National Disability Authority, NDA, has painted a picture that demonstrates people with disabilities are twice as likely to be at risk of poverty. Therefore, at a time such as this it is only right we make supports and help available to those in need and at risk. To a large extent, this has been done. In previous years we have berated Ministers and criticised them for not doing enough. When the money is available, it should be used constructively. The Minister challenged us to participate in a constructive debate. We will do so.</P>
      <P>The CSO figures announced yesterday highlight the plight of many vulnerable groups. The figures show that 49% of lone parents, 47% of ill and disabled people, 37% of the unemployed and 36% of those living alone are at risk of poverty. The figures show a substantial drop in the rate of consistent poverty, which is welcome. However, much work remains to be done. Our aim should <Col N="408"/>be to eliminate poverty and to do this we must target children.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says &mdash; he has said this consistently since he became Minister &mdash; that education is the way out of poverty. I am alarmed at the number who drop out of school each year without a qualification and who are unable to read and write. It seems the pressure exerted by poverty forces children to leave school to find low paid, dead end jobs. The Minister is moving in the right direction by improving the amount going into the homes of those under pressure. I am a little disappointed with him, however, because for some time he has been talking about a second tier payment. I was hoping we would see some movement towards this.</P>
      <P>We all know the family income supplement, FIS, is an important and useful measure. However, the take-up is very low. Only 30% to 40% of those eligible take it up. Will the Minister tell us what measures he intends to take to ensure eligible persons who really need the supplement know about it and can access it easily? What percentage of those eligible to receive it have not claimed it? We all need to inform people in our constituencies that FIS is available and must work towards ensuring those eligible claim it. Many of those who have attended my clinics have told me they did not know about it and I notice from visits to many welfare offices that there are no notices displayed indicating it is available.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about bringing together the CDA, FIS and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance in a second tier payment. I am disappointed that such a payment is not before us and that we do not have something imaginative and constructive in that regard. I urge the Minister to do what he can to bring this forward, even if he must introduce a new Bill before the summer. He should bring the payments mentioned together and present a package to inform people of what is available and from which they can benefit.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, ably chaired by my colleague, Deputy Penrose, heard a presentation by the National Disability Authority today. The authority painted a bleak picture on the situation of people with disabilities. We have much work to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am introducing this Bill because of particular concerns about a pending inquest but there are far wider implications. I am grateful to the Government, especially the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for agreeing to facili<Col N="409"/>tate its speedy passage before Christmas, for reasons with which we are both familiar.</P>
      <P>It says something about our sense of priorities that there has been legislation on tribunals on nine occasions since 1921, including four Acts this century, yet the Coroners Act has remained unamended since 1962, despite the fact that we have had less than 30 tribunals in the State&rsquo;s history, while dozens of coroners hold hundreds of inquests throughout the State every year. This fact cannot be seen as evidence that the system is working. On the contrary, the difficulties and inadequacies of the system have been known for years.</P>
      <P>The Coroners Act 1962 is acknowledged to be in need of substantial reform. The Minister is on record as saying, &ldquo;As has long since been acknowledged, the current Irish legislation, the Coroners Act of 1962, is outdated and can no longer be said to equip coroners with the appropriate measures to conduct the best possible death investigation.&rdquo; A working group reported to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in October 2004 and made more than 100 recommendations. The report has been accepted by the Government and work is ongoing within the Department on a comprehensive replacement statutory code. I understand a draft Bill will be brought to the Government by the Minister very soon and that it will be published early in 2006, if not this year.</P>
      <P>The immediate need for legislation turns around the fact that a baby died of brain damage after being admitted to hospital on his second birthday for a routine operation linked to his condition as a haemophiliac. Pierce Nowlan of Saggart was admitted to Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin last October to have a device fitted into a vein that would have allowed the regular injection into his blood of factor eight, a clotting agent. During the procedure, it seems an artery was inadvertently punctured as surgeons were attempting to access the vein where the device was to be fitted. Pierce bled from a hole in his artery into the left side of his chest. The oxygen flow to his brain was adversely impacted and he died as a result. His parents, Stephen and Jean Nowlan, had been told this procedure was minor and that there was &ldquo;nothing to worry about&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Dublin city coroner, Dr. Brian Farrell, held an inquest last July and adjourned it until September to study the complicated evidence that had been heard. He also wanted to consider reports on the matter that had been put before the court and to possibly consult others on the case. He needed such time, he said, in part because of restrictions in the Coroners Act that permitted him to call only two medical witnesses in any one case.</P>
      <P>Section 26 of the Act states:</P>
      <P LI="1">(1) A coroner may, at any time before the conclusion of an inquest held by him, cause a <Col N="410"/>summons in the prescribed form to attend and give evidence at the inquest to be served on any person (including in particular any registered medical practitioner) whose evidence would, in the opinion of the coroner, be of assistance at the inquest.</P>
      <P LI="1">(2) A coroner shall not exercise, in relation to the attendance at an inquest of a second registered medical practitioner, the power conferred on him by subsection (1) of this section unless&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) a majority of the jurors at the inquest, it having appeared to them that the cause of death has not been satisfactorily explained by the medical practitioner giving evidence thereof at the inquest, have by a requisition in writing called upon the coroner to cause a summons under that subsection to be served on another registered medical practitioner, or</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) that practitioner had assisted at a post-mortem examination upon the person in relation to whose death the inquest is being held.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The effect of the section is to limit the number of medical witnesses who can give evidence at an inquest to two. The restriction is universally accepted as unwarranted and unfair, particularly in cases where the adequacy or appropriateness of medical treatment given to the deceased may be the key issue at an inquest. For example, there were 23 possible medical witnesses involved in Pierce Nowlan&rsquo;s case, given that 23 medical clinicians had been involved in his care. The section dates from an era when, although patients may have died, doctors never differed, at least not on the public record. The prohibition was always wrong in principle and its survival on the Statute Book is contrary to the interests of truth, accountability and justice.</P>
      <P>When he adjourned the Nowlan inquest, Dr. Farrell called on the Government to introduce an amendment to the legislation lifting the restriction as soon as possible. He said the present circumstances ran contrary to the rights of all involved under the Constitution for access to &ldquo;natural justice, fair procedures and due process&rdquo;. In September, the Dublin city coroner adjourned the inquest again until 9 November after considering further submissions in the case.</P>
      <P>Mr. Raymond Bradley, a lawyer for the Nowlan family, asked for a further adjournment. He said, in the coded language used in such cases, until legislation was introduced allowing the coroner to call more than two medical witnesses, a certain verdict &ldquo;cannot be delivered&rdquo;. He pointed out that doctors involved in the case had given conflicting versions of events. He said that unless more medical witnesses could clarify issues, &ldquo;It would be wrong, it would be unjust for the family, and even for society, for a verdict to be delivered.&rdquo;</P><Col N="411"/>
      <P>The lawyers representing the hospital also agreed with the coroner&rsquo;s views on the limitations placed on him by the Coroners Act. However, they argued there was an obligation on the coroner to bring the inquest to a speedy conclusion rather than adjourn it indefinitely while awaiting Government action on amending legislation. Dr. Farrell eventually ruled that it was beyond his powers to adjourn a case indefinitely in the hope that long-promised legislation might eventually materialise. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">It would be unprecedented for an inquest to be adjourned pending a change of legislation ... In principle it would be wrong and in my view it would not be legal either.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That ruling was entirely understandable. The coroner allowed one final adjournment, until the end of next month, to give the Nowlans time to consider their position and their legal remedies, if any.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Nowlans had been in contact with the Department, me and, eventually, the Minister, Deputy McDowell. They were treated courteously by the Minister and his officials and were told that the prohibition set out in section 26 was recognised by all concerned as anomalous and that it would be repealed in the forthcoming comprehensive amending legislation. However, although that legislation was to be finalised and published as a matter of priority, there was no way it could be on the Statute Book by the end of January next year.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is simply to prioritise and implement immediately just one of the various recommendations of the working group on coroners, that is, the repeal of section 26(2), to fill the gap that would otherwise inevitably arise while awaiting the comprehensive legislation being worked on by the Minister. The proposal is non-contentious and has been accepted by the Government. I am grateful to the Minister and his colleagues for facilitating the speedy passage of the Bill before the end of this parliamentary term.</P>
      <P>In Eastern Health Board <i>v</i>. Farrell, Mr. Justice Hardiman stated in his judgment that section 26 of the Coroners Act &ldquo;is in my view ... a serious obstacle to the proper discharge of the statutory duty of a coroner in the more complex type of inquest.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;If a coroner feels that the question of how the death occurred cannot be answered without further evidence, it seems remarkable that he cannot obtain it.&rdquo; It is quite shocking that the legislation under which a coroner operates is so restrictive that it prevents all the evidence relevant to the circumstances of death from being made available to the coroner.</P>
      <P>Such a default is more apparent where there is a potential conflict of evidence as to what occurred but the coroner can only hear one version of events. Serious issues can arise as to who gets to choose which witness should be presented <Col N="412"/>to an inquest and as to whether that witness is simply presenting the collective, corporate view on behalf of a hospital rather than an expert personal opinion. If a coroner can only rely upon one version of events then, in such circumstances, the capacity of the coroner to ascertain the true cause of death or make recommendations arising out of the findings or verdict delivered must be significantly compromised. It is wrong that where deaths occur in a hospital environment, which cases are inevitably more complex for the coroner in terms of the evidence required to be delivered, the coroner is fettered by virtue of the limitations associated with section 26 in ascertaining the true cause of death.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to accept this Private Members&rsquo; Bill and the co-operation between both sides of the House to ensure all stages of the Bill are passed by the D&aacute;il by Wednesday of this week. I am grateful that the Leader of the Seanad, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, has agreed to facilitate the early taking of the Bill in the Upper House, which should allow it to become law before the end of the year. It is relatively rare for the Government to accept an Opposition Bill. The degree of co-operation between Opposition and Government in regard to this issue is a reflection of the desire on all sides to deal with these anomalies.</P>
      <P>I will deal briefly with the provisions of the Bill as published, and then with the Government amendments, which have been given to me in advance of Committee Stage. Section 1 sets out three amendments to the Coroners Act 1962. First, section 26(2), which limits the number of medical witnesses who can give evidence at an inquest, is repealed. Second, section 37, which provides that a person who, having been duly served with a summons to attend an inquest as a juror or witness, fails to attend at the time and place specified in the summons is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &pound;5, is repealed. The substance of that section is set out in a new section 38. Third, a new section is substituted for the existing section 38. The new section provides that a coroner may, for the purposes of his functions under the 1962 Act, summon witnesses to attend at an inquest, examine on oath &mdash; which the coroner is by this section authorised to administer &mdash; the witnesses attending at an inquest, and require any such witness to produce to the inquest any document in his or her power or control.</P>
      <P>It is provided that a witness appearing at an inquest is entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court. A summons must be signed by the coroner. The section also provides that a person who on being duly summoned to attend an inquest as a juror or a witness makes default in attending, or being in attendance as a witness refuses to take an oath legally required by the coroner to be taken, or to produce any document in <Col N="413"/>his or her power or control legally required by the coroner to be produced by him or her, or to answer any question to which the coroner may legally require an answer, or does any other thing which, if the inquest were court proceedings and the coroner were a judge having power to commit for contempt of court, would be in contempt of such court, is guilty of an offence. The penalties are, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both and, on conviction on indictment, imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or a fine or both.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides a civil remedy as an alternative to criminal proceedings in cases where persons called to attend an inquest as witnesses refuse to do so. It provides that, where a person who having been duly served with a summons to attend an inquest as a juror or witness, fails to attend at the time and place specified in the summons, or fails to comply with a requirement to produce a document or answer a question, the High Court may, on application to it, in a summary manner in that behalf by the coroner, order the person to comply with the summons or requirement and may make such other order as it considers necessary and just to enable the order to have full effect. Section 3 makes standard provision for the short title of the Bill and its collective citation and construction.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Bill as initiated proposes to deal with three simple issues. The first is the repeal of section 26(2). The second is the fact that the existing mechanism for imposing penalties for non-attendance at inquests, either by witnesses or jurors, is almost certainly unconstitutional. The third is the lack of any civil enforcement mechanism where witnesses decline to attend.</P>
      <P>The additional issues were highlighted in the case of Attorney General <i>v</i>. Lee, decided by the Supreme Court in 2000. In that case the Chief Justice pointed out that if a coroner were to invoke the powers purportedly conferred on him and on the High Court by section 38(2) of the 1962 Act, so as to certify the non-attendance of a witness as an offence and send that person forward on his certificate to be punished by the High Court, &ldquo;he would be met with the contention that the provision in question is clearly unconstitutional, having regard to the decision in re Haughey&rdquo;. The coroner in that case had decided not to adopt what the Chief Justice described as &ldquo;a futile course&rdquo;. Instead, the Attorney General had issued proceedings and applied to the High Court for an interlocutory injunction relying upon what was claimed to be the general jurisdiction of the High Court to enforce the law by way of an injunction or other suitable remedy on the application of the Attorney General as the guardian of the public interest, where it was just and convenient so to do. It fell to the Supreme Court to refuse the Attorney General&rsquo;s application. The consequence of this decision was that the offences provisions of the Coroners Act are <Col N="414"/>unenforceable and that there are no civil enforcement mechanisms to ensure the attendance of necessary witnesses.</P>
      <P>As to the Government approach to this Bill and its amendments, my understanding is as follows. First, the Minister agrees with the repeal of section 26(2), which is my principal and most pressing objective. Second, the Minister agrees with the need to increase penalties for non-attendance of witnesses and jurors. However, he points out that identical penalties are not appropriate in the case of jurors and witnesses. I accept that argument and the amendment to cover the point. Third, my understanding is that the Government accepts there is a need for a civil enforcement mechanism. However, the Minister and his advisers would prefer to address this issue in the comprehensive Bill and not, even on an interim basis, in what is essentially short-term legislation.</P>
      <P>I accept the bona fides of the Minister&rsquo;s position, although I would be surprised if his published proposals are very far removed from those set out in this Bill. In the interests of expediting this matter, in maintaining consensus and in enacting the core proposals, I am happy to accept the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, which has the effect of deleting a proposal for a civil enforcement mechanism.</P>
      <P>There is much to be done in the comprehensive Bill. Apart from the recommendations of the working group, there is, for example, a recent High Court judgment declaring that the family of a deceased person has a constitutional right to legal aid when being represented at an inquest. That judgment will have to be reflected in legislation. There are also the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights where coroners&rsquo; inquests and the restrictions under which they operate were considered in the context of the State&rsquo;s duty to ensure an independent, effective and impartial investigation into the deaths of those who die at State hands. A new Coroners Bill will not provide a complete answer to the queries posed by the European Court but it will at least provide part of the solution.</P>
      <P>There are basic procedural issues which arise time and again in the Coroner&rsquo;s Court. Yet again in recent weeks the State had to agree to the quashing of a coroner&rsquo;s decision to refuse the family of a deceased person prior access to the witness statements taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. A new comprehensive Bill must set out these basic entitlements plainly and with certainty. In the interim, I thank the Minister for facilitating the introduction of this Bill. He knows how important it is to the family concerned, to which everyone in this House would offer sympathy for what it has endured. I hope this legislation will provide some adequate answers.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama <Col N="415"/>a roinnt leis an Teachta &Oacute; Conch&uacute;bhair, le cead an Tigh.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the introduction of this Private Members&rsquo; Bill by Deputy Rabbitte and his colleagues in the Labour Party. It has a very specific focus, namely, to address certain deficiencies in the current law pertaining to the conduct of an inquest by a coroner. These deficiencies &mdash; the restriction on the number of medical witnesses and the outdated sanction for non-attendance of a witness or juror &mdash; have, albeit in a limited number of cases, combined to inhibit the conduct of inquests in a manner sufficient to inform the family and relations of a deceased person and society at large. I join Deputy Rabbitte in stating I appreciate the present law would have rendered a significant injustice if it had not been remedied for the Nowlan family. I was conscious of this when I met the family.</P>
      <P>In recent months certain cases have helped to highlight the inadequacies of the current law as contained in the Coroners Act 1962. Since these pertinent cases are still current, the House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to debate the details of them at this time, except to state they are very sad. They prove the need for a change in the law. I am happy to state the Government has approved my proposal that the principle of the Bill should be supported, subject to some amendments I shall be raising, largely of a technical nature.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, announced at the beginning of the session, contained a commitment to replace the Coroners Act 1962 with a modern code of law, to establish a coroner service and to transform the organisation of coroners. My proposals for a Bill have been with Departments and the Attorney General for necessary observations and I expect to be in a position to secure Government approval of the details very shortly. I intend to publish the heads, of which there are more than 190, for public consultation purposes during the drafting process.</P>
      <P>The coroner service is one of the oldest public offices of the State and its origins date back many hundreds of years. Prior to the Act of 1962 there was a Coroners Act of 1927. My predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, began the current process of reform when he established an expert working group, the coroners review group, to examine all aspects of the coroner service with a view to bringing forward recommendations for reform. The group&rsquo;s report was published in December 2000 and contained 110 recommendations covering a wide range of issues. The work of the group was complemented by the subsequent report of the coroners rules committee, published in November 2003.</P>
      <P>The Coroners Society of Ireland, as the body which represents coroners, has been active in the process of reform, for which I thank it. I have met <Col N="416"/>it on a number of occasions in recent years and there continues to be ongoing contact, as well as meetings with departmental officials to advance the process.</P>
      <P>The key objectives of the comprehensive Bill which I intend to bring to Government will be to provide for considerable updating and streamlining of the death investigation and post-mortem and inquest procedures so as to ensure a better and more proper service than is currently possible under the 1962 Coroners Act. To achieve these objectives, I am focusing on two critical elements in the reform of the coroner service &mdash; the widening of scope of the inquest and the development of optimum structures and administration for a modern coroner service. The central element of a modern death investigation service must be to allow sufficient scope to the coroner to carry out the best possible investigation. The 1962 Act and a subsequent interpretation of its intention and scope by the Supreme Court in the cases of Greene <i>v</i>. McLoughlin 1985 and the Eastern Health Board <i>v</i>. Farrell, provided for a restrictive approach to the examination at an inquest of &ldquo;how&rdquo; the person died. The examination is limited to establishing the proximate medical cause of death. Such a limitation is no longer appropriate, given the developments in medical care and treatment since 1962 and increasingly threatens to bring the inquest process into disrepute.</P>
      <P>We must now move to expand the scope of the coronial investigation. We must require that the coroner seek to establish, in so far as is practicable, in what circumstances the deceased met his or her death. Widening the scope of the coroner&rsquo;s investigation was recommended by the coroners review group; reflects jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights; and is consistent with developments in other common law jurisdictions. A series of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights must, in development of my own Bill, be taken into account to ensure compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. These judgments interpret Article 2 of the convention as providing for a more extensive investigation of the circumstances of death, beyond the strict &ldquo;how in those particular circumstances&rdquo; question now posed. They indicate that a certain extension of the scope of an inquest is now required to meet the obligations of the convention.</P>
      <P>Any proposed extension of the role of the coroner&rsquo;s investigation would have to be balanced by maintaining the prohibition on explicit determination of questions of criminal liability at an inquest which applies under our law currently. From any widening of the scope of the coroner&rsquo;s inquiry, there would follow a series of developments which would include: no arbitrary restriction on the number and type of medical or other witnesses who can be summoned to appear and testify at an inquest; increased sanctions for those who refuse to co-operate with a coroner&rsquo;s <Col N="417"/>investigation into a death; powers of compellability for the coroner akin to those available to a tribunal of inquiry; expressly stated powers for a coroner of control of the body of the deceased and other things, including power of entry and seizure; greater involvement of the coroner in the movement of bodies into and out of the State; and in a case where the coroner is concerned, that a fact of death certificate be held by an undertaker before disposal of a body. In the wake of the Shipman events in England we must be conscious that our law is deficient in some respects.</P>
      <P>The coroners review group envisaged certain powers for the coroner akin to those available to a tribunal of inquiry. It is suggested procedures relating to evidence, access to documents, etc. will have to be developed in that regard in respect of the coroner&rsquo;s inquest. The right of access to documentation by all the parties concerned could become a critical point, especially regarding hospital, Garda or other State agency reports. There would clearly be a need to respect the constitutional and legal rights of witnesses similar to the conditions at a tribunal. This need to ensure better, consistent and efficient procedures in light of a new legal scenario would have resource implications; it could not be assured under the current coronial system.</P>
      <P>The primary concern of the coroners review group was to ensure a high quality coroner service with optimal resources and supports would be developed. To achieve this outcome, it recommended a comprehensive overhaul and modernisation of the service. As regards the number of coroners, it envisaged an evolution to a regionalised structure where there would be fewer than the current 48 coronial districts provided for in the 1962 Act. I am satisfied that the current organisation of coroners must be reformed. The proposed Bill I have advanced for consideration by the Government will address all the policy issues, which include best practice in the law on coroners, their organisation and support structures.</P>
      <P>I was, in effect, confronted by a choice. I could have chosen to table a Bill along the lines now being considered or I could have presented a full Bill of the type being finalised. As Deputy Rabbitte pointed out, the chances of the full Bill being enacted prior to the taking of the cases with which Deputies Rabbitte and O&rsquo;Connor, as well as others and I, are concerned are slim. It seemed unlikely that this D&aacute;il would deal with two coroners Bills in its lifetime. I doubt whether a Bill of this kind tabled by me would have survived the inevitable criticism of any sensible person that I was not addressing the wider issues of radical reform. I welcome this Bill as an agreed remedial measure which allows the major reform project to advance also. I hope both Bills become law before the next general election.</P>
      <P>The short Bill, tabled by Deputy Rabbitte, can benefit from some technical amendments with which he has signalled agreement. It might facili<Col N="418"/>tate the House if I were to indicate briefly the contents of those amendments. They are technical in nature, except in respect of the new sanctions for non-appearance as a witness or juror.</P>
      <P>I will propose an additional provision in the Bill that will allow delivery of a witness or juror summons by registered post. I will propose sanctions on those persons, be they jurors or witnesses, summoned to attend at an inquest, namely, to fine jurors &euro;500 for non-attendance on summary conviction and witnesses who fail to attend or co-operate at an inquest, &euro;3,000, and/or impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. I will also propose a transitional provision to ensure the new sanctions will apply only to offences committed after the enactment of this Bill because the Constitution prohibits retrospective criminalisation.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes the provision of increased powers for the coroner to compel attendance as a witness or a juror. Unfortunately, following consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, I will propose to delete the relevant sections from the Bill because without further development this aspect is somewhat problematic. If we had had another week or two to work on this, I would have been able to do as Deputy Rabbitte suggests but time was limited. I will address this issue in my proposals for new comprehensive coroners&rsquo; legislation. We should, however, be prudent at this stage and not include something which is defective or suspect. I am confident that the abolition of the restriction on the number of witnesses and the increased level of sanctions will enable proper interim compliance with the coroner&rsquo;s requests in the investigation into deaths as a short-term measure.</P>
      <P>The Committee Stage amendments I have outlined have been drafted and will become available to Deputies as soon as possible after Second Stage. In a spirit of co-operation, I understand the amendments, in so far as they are known to the proposer of the Bill, may be acceptable and should facilitate the early passage of the Bill as desired by the Members of this House and the Government.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for getting me out of a difficult situation. It was, therefore, a pleasure to propose to my colleagues in the Government that we accept the Bill and expedite its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>It is traditional on Private Members&rsquo; Business to thank the Opposition for putting down the topic for debate. Tonight my thanks are even more sincere than usual because this is an important matter. I hope Deputy Rabbitte will not object when I call him my good friend and colleague in thanking him for his initiative in this regard. It also gives me an opportunity to thank his spokesperson, Deputy Costello, who, like Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, is my colleague on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. <Col N="419"/>This is a good night for democracy because we are co-operating in a definite way. I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s courtesy in allowing me to share time with him in this important debate.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this motion on the Coroners Act 1962 would stand on its own merits. This is also the story of Pierce Nowlan who was born prematurely in the Coombe Hospital on 14 October 2002. He had a medical condition which required a minor procedure and was taken to Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin where he died on his second birthday on 14 October 2004. His parents, Jean and Stephen Nowlan, are in the Visitors Gallery, as is his paternal grandmother, Phyllis. I have known the Nowlan family for many years and had the privilege of working with it in the past year. This gave me a welcome opportunity to work with my colleagues and represent the issues of concern to the family.</P>
      <P>The family&rsquo;s bravery is evident in the way it stepped forward to ensure its baby&rsquo;s case was highlighted and that the anomalies it saw in the legislation were dealt with. When I raised the matter in the Adjournment debate on 17 November, I said the Nowlan family had acted sincerely in highlighting its case through the media, for example, in an excellent interview on TV3. This helped its healing process but also helped to bring an important issue into the public domain. The family is concerned about this issue not only for its own sake but also because it wishes to help other families who find themselves in this situation.</P>
      <P>In the Adjournment debate I acknowledged, on behalf of the Nowlan family, its contact with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who met and corresponded with it. The Minister&rsquo;s co-operation helped the family achieve action. I have had a great deal of contact with the Minister during the year on this subject and acknowledge his assistance and courtesy, and that of his staff. I also acknowledge the interest the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children displayed in the case. She, too, met the family which was happy with the meeting.</P>
      <P>Everyone in the community was deeply upset by Pierce&rsquo;s death. The family wants to highlight this and to seek justice. It wants to find out what happened on that fateful day in October 2004. I hope tonight and tomorrow we can move the case forward. The legislation might enable the Nowlan family to go to the Coroner&rsquo;s Court early in the new year and get the answers it wants. We all understand this is a difficult situation for the family which should be commended on what it has achieved.</P>
      <P>The current legislation is clearly outdated and can no longer be said to equip coroners with the appropriate measures to conduct the best possible investigation into the causes of a death. The inclusion of a proposed coroners Bill in the <Col N="420"/>Government&rsquo;s legislative programme indicates a welcome commitment to reform.</P>
      <P>Considerable work has been done in recent years in reviewing the coroner service and bringing forward proposals for reform. The coroners review group published an excellent report in 2000 which was followed in 2003 by the report of the rules committee. The coroners review group recommended a comprehensive overhaul and modernisation of the coroner service. Ireland is not alone among common law jurisdictions in engaging in reform of the coroner service. In the United Kingdom the coroner service review of 2003 recommended significant structural changes to the coroner service in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The judgments of the European Court of Human Rights have a bearing on the work of coroners and exert a significant influence on our legislative process. In recent years the court has made several important decisions in such cases. Our law must be updated to take account of the likely effect of its decisions.</P>
      <P>The critical feature of Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s welcome Bill is that it seeks to abolish the outdated restriction that a coroner can call only two medical witnesses to give evidence at an inquest. It is not clear why this restriction was introduced in the 1962 Act. There is no indication in the Official Report at the time as to the thinking behind the provision. There was no restriction on the number of witnesses at an inquest contained in the 1927 Coroners Act which was replaced by the 1962 Act. I do not believe anyone can support the retention of this restriction, given its negative impact on the conduct of inquests by coroners. Many coroners have called for its swift ending.</P>
      <P>The Bill also includes proposals for increased penalties for reluctant witnesses or jurors, which I welcome. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated he will table amendments to ensure these penalties have sufficient strength. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s contention that we hold off for now in providing for new powers for a coroner to compel attendance, co-operation and the production of documents at an inquest. The Minister has stated to the House that his preference is for a comprehensive reform of the law relating to coroners. Such a proposal is contained in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme. All Members will welcome these proposals which the Minister hopes to have agreed by the Government.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Government has supported the Labour Party&rsquo;s Bill in a genuine spirit of co-operation. If these proposals can be enacted swiftly by the Oireachtas, they will provide coroners with the means by which they can conduct and conclude many inquests, some of which may have been adjourned for significant periods. If these proposals become law, a coroner can use them to call new witnesses to adjourned inquests. I expect the medical profession will co-operate with coroners under the proposed new dispen<Col N="421"/>sation. I would not expect to see any reluctance on the part of doctors in attending inquests. Modern medical treatments, particularly in emergencies, are complex and will require adequate explanation to the family of the deceased and society at large. This is important as we need to be aware and to remedy any difficulties which may lead to further threats to public health and safety.</P>
      <P>Initiatives to reform and modernise the coroner system are under way in other common law jurisdictions. In New Zealand and the United Kingdom, current proposals are directed at comprehensive rather than partial reform. Ireland is in a position to learn from these experiences in other countries. The aim of the reform should be to put more logical and coherent shape to the coroner service. Foremost among the issues, which I am glad the Minister will address in the forthcoming Bill, is that of the scope of a coroner&rsquo;s inquiry. The coroner review group considered this issue, recommending an extension of a corner&rsquo;s remit to establish the surrounding circumstances of death, including the medical causes of death.</P>
      <P>We need to make a positive statement on the role of a coroner in inquiring into certain deaths. There is a requirement for greater clarity of the nature of the death by the coroner. Not all investigations into death by a coroner necessarily lead to inquests. The new legislation will also set out the procedures for the conduct of inquests by the coroner. There is a requirement for more explicit provisions to deal with those situations concerning deaths in custody or children in care where the State or its institutions had an involvement.</P>
      <P>The coroner review group was concerned with the need to ensure a high quality coroner service with proper resources and supports available to it. The group recommended an evolution to a regionalised structure where there would be fewer than the current 48 districts. If such a change is to come about, I expect the emphasis will be on full-time rather than the current situation of part-time coroners. The Minister is working hard to bring forward his proposals for a comprehensive reform of the coroners legislation. I expect the proposals made by Deputy Rabbitte will be factored into this process.</P>
      <P>The need for legislation in this area is obvious. While he has been working hard in the area, I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not mind if I give credit to Jean and Stephen Nowlan and their family for their efforts in persuading the Government to change the legislation. It is always easy for a Government backbencher to patronise a Minister but in this case, the Minister has been particularly responsive. While I know the Nowlan family were anxious for action on coroners legislation, they have acknowledged the Minister&rsquo;s co-operation in this regard.</P>
      <P>No one could but be affected by the death of Pierce Nowlan. I hope his family will see its cam<Col N="422"/>paign bear fruit when this legislation is enacted, particularly at a time of the year when his death must be more sensitive than usual. We must commend the brave way it engaged with the system, rather than sitting at home corresponding with it. It believed it was important it challenged the system, doing an enormous service to the wider community. I hope the plans for the amendment to the legislation will be a tribute to the Nowlan family. To step out into the public limelight is not an easy task, particularly for a grieving family. The family has often shared with me the genuine upset it feels. My eldest son is a long-time friend of the Nowlan family and he was deeply affected by what happened. It is important to highlight the positive aspects of what the family has achieved.</P>
      <P>I hope the legislation will also be a lasting memorial to Pierce Nowlan. It would be important for his family and the wider community who supported it. It cannot be forgotten that a little boy died on his second birthday. I am happy the members of the Nowlan family are in the Visitors Gallery to see the co-operation between the parties on this legislation. I am not being flippant when I say I believe the Nowlans should write a little book on how to get political parties to co-operate in the D&aacute;il, an unusual occurrence. It highlights the importance of the issue and the positive way we have all responded to the family&rsquo;s plight. While one expects some politics to fly around Private Members&rsquo; Business, I am glad we have been able to park it, at least temporarily, and deal with important business. I support the Bill and look forward to its enactment. I congratulate the Minister on his efforts in that regard.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Crawford and O&rsquo;Dowd.</P>
      <P>It says something that it has been more than 40 years since the Coroners Act was debated in the House. It says something else that it is being debated as a result of an Opposition Bill. I am pleased to support what is essentially an emergency Bill, of which there have been few examples in my time in the House. In 1990 one such Bill was introduced, essentially designed to support the business activities of Larry Goodman, while I recollect another, also in the 1990s, dealing with the issue of greyhound muzzling.</P>
      <P>As we approach Christmas, it is lovely to have a Bill which all parties can gather around. This legislation arises from the circumstances in which a particular family, the Nowlan family, finds itself. While its effect extends beyond the Nowlans, the Bill has a particular resonance for them. Deputies are delighted to rally around the family and offer it sympathy, succour and support by amending the principal legislation to meet its needs.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Labour Party, in particular its leader, Deputy Rabbitte, on taking the initiative and introducing the legislation. I also congratulate the Minister who has acknowledged the urgent need for the Bill and agreed to accept its <Col N="423"/>passage, particularly as the adjourned inquest is due to recommence next month.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise two technical issues. The House must establish a process to ensure, as required, that the Bill passes this week. While I do not propose to cause a problem, Members will need time, preferably in the Chamber, to deal with amendments on Committee and Report Stages and allow the Bill to move to the Seanad. It would put the process off track if we were forced to call a special meeting of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, as to do so would consume time which is probably not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>For the information of the Deputy, the order this morning covers all his concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>On a second matter, the introduction of this legislation highlights the cumbersome nature of getting Bills through the House generally. I do not point a finger at the Minister whom Deputies pointed at enough today when discussing another matter. Despite agreement on the need for reform, the House does not appear to be able to establish a procedure which would allow reform Bills to be put through the House in a reasonable timeframe. A working group issued a clear report on this issue more than five years ago. In addition, Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights which has been incorporated in domestic law contains clear requirements in this regard. Despite these developments, the House is still unable to get it together. In the case of coroners legislation, a new and comprehensive Bill was promised in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. Perhaps we should re-examine the whole process by which we deal with reform Bills, particularly in cases where there is no political disagreement on what needs to be done. Although the reasons for delay may be complexities in the law and a desire to ensure the House produces good legislation, given the goodwill among parties on this matter, would it not be possible to find a better way of expediting reform legislation?</P>
      <P>While the issues highlighted in the Bill introduced by Deputy Rabbitte are of extreme urgency, many other related issues are sufficiently urgent as to warrant reform. The Coroners Act is 44 years old. We need to address a series of other issues, specifically the reporting of deaths and the obligations on coroners and others. We must also deal with issues relating to the body of the deceased and the duty, as recommended by the working group, which should be placed on funeral directors to ensure a certificate of death is procurable or that clearance has been obtained from the coroner to bury the body.</P>
      <P>Statutory requirements are needed on post-mortems. We must provide in legislation that the jurisdiction of the coroner includes the investigation not only of the medical cause of death but <Col N="424"/>also the circumstances surrounding it, while at the same time treating with care the line between civil and criminal liability. Mandatory inquests should be extended to include, at a minimum, circumstances in which a death occurs in Garda custody, an issue which has arisen in the Rossiter case. An unexplained death is particularly difficult for relatives and we must make stronger legislative provisions governing their role and rights. Let us, therefore, agree to place the Bill on the Statute Book tonight.</P>
      <P>While I congratulate the Labour Party on introducing this legislation and endorse its efforts, let us not forget the other, broader issues we should try to deal with it in the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important legislation. I understand from Deputy Rabbitte that it came about as a result of the tragic circumstances of the Nowlan child and that the purpose of the Bill is to try to rectify some of the anomalies which arose in that case.</P>
      <P>Few issues have caused as much controversy in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan as the inquest into the death of Frances Sheridan in Cootehill. The parents of this young girl had hoped for some closure as a result of the inquest but, unfortunately, the outcome raised more questions than it answered. The Sheridan case demonstrated the necessity to improve the 1962 legislation, not only through this Bill but also by carrying out a more extensive overhaul of the Coroners Act.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I seek guidance on who selects inquest juries. Is a panel in place and, if so, how many members sit on it? Does anyone have a right to object to any member appointed to an inquest jury? Although this is the case with all other juries, this rule does not appear to apply to inquest juries. Are public representatives, for example, or those with a connection to the case automatically debarred from serving on an inquest jury? Has a ruling been made in this matter? These questions have arisen because of the extraordinary circumstances which arose when advice given to a jury appeared to have been ignored. What surprised most observers of the complex case in question was that the jury reached a unanimous decision within minutes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the efforts of the Labour Party in bringing the Bill before the House and the Minister&rsquo;s decision to accept it in principle. As I noted during a debate on another Bill a few nights ago, it is the right and privilege of the Minister to make amendments should they be necessary. On the other hand, it is important to achieve cross-party agreement to address expeditiously this delicate matter.</P>
      <P>The general public expects the House to respond to circumstances as they arise. Many people in County Cavan will observe the progress of this legislation to determine how matters could <Col N="425"/>be improved for other families which experience a loss similar to that experienced by the Sheridan family. It is difficult enough for families such as the Nowlans or Sheridans to lose a loved one, particularly at an early age, but the workings of the legal system cause them further problems. The Coroner&rsquo;s Court, as with all other courts, must not only dispense justice but be seen to do so in every respect. No individual ever wishes to do other than what is right, but whenever files are mislaid, as happened in the Sheridan case, and general practitioners&rsquo; letters are not properly adhered to, there are serious doubts in the family&rsquo;s mind as to how the system works. The judge suggested a decision of death by misadventure should be made, but the verdict handed down by the jury was one of death by natural causes. The judge also suggested recommendations should be made on how matters should be dealt with in the future, but no such recommendations were forthcoming. One can see that, while there is not a direct link with the case with which we are dealing, my reason for raising this issue, radical reform of the whole system is required. There needs to be a clear indication in order that people can understand how the system works. I have nothing against any individual who serves on a jury &mdash; he or she does it for free and in his or her own time &mdash; but if there is any connection otherwise, it should be stated. There should be no doubt afterwards that the situation is clear and above board.</P>
      <P>I commend the Labour Party for introducing this legislation. I sympathise with the Nowlan family on what it has gone through. I do not know its members personally, although I do know the members of the Sheridan family extremely well and I am aware of what they have been through. I know of other families in this situation also. In my own case, I had to wait three weeks for an inquest in England to allow my brother&rsquo;s remains to be buried. At least we have a better system here. Let us improve the legal system, as well as the coroner service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Labour Party on introducing this Bill. I empathise and sympathise with the Nowlan family. In the short time available I wish to make a couple of points, one of which concerns people who have died in nursing homes during the years. As I understand it, various coroners have different rules. The Minister wrote to all coroners insisting they carry out their work in a specific way, but I am not aware that every single coroner has done this. Among the obligations on nursing homes is that they report a death to the Health Service Executive within 48 hours. In addition, if the deceased person had not been visited by a doctor in the preceding four weeks, the nursing home must inform the coroner. However, this does not happen in every case, which is one of the issues that has arisen.</P><Col N="426"/>
      <P>We have had appalling situations where people died in nursing homes and were buried without the coroner being informed and a death certificate being issued. That is a serious and important issue. I have spoken to a number of coroners about the matter. The County Dublin coroner, in particular, has drawn the attention of the HSE to the issue. I appreciate that we are all acting together on it. I ask the Minister to use his good offices to get the best possible system in operation for those who die in nursing homes in order that there will be proper and full obedience with the rules and that the coroner is informed when he or she ought to be.</P>
      <P>I have submitted freedom of information requests to all Health Service Executive areas because I am trying to get all coroners&rsquo; reports, comments and views into the public domain. One particular Health Service Executive area has refused to give the information to me on the grounds that it must consult the people mentioned. Outside the Freedom of Information Act, perhaps the Minister would use his good offices to avail of the collective wisdom of all coroners as expressed by them in recent years in order that when he adds this to the legislation he intends to introduce, we will have full and proper vigilance on how people die in nursing homes.</P>
      <P>An inquest takes place when a person dies in a nursing home, but a coroner can only take into account the facts as they are presented to him or her. In the case of poor nursing homes, which I stress are in the minority, evidence of appalling standards of care cannot be brought before inquest proceedings. If the HSE reports on the lack of care in a minority of nursing homes could be presented to coroners, it would change their views on how some people have died in a minority of cases, whether as a result of natural causes or absolute neglect as I believe happened in some cases.</P>

	<P>This speech will be more sincere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acceptance of the proposal from the Labour Party. It is a step in the right direction, but as we all know, there is a body of legislation that needs to be dramatically reviewed in order to bring the coroner service into the 21st century. This move has arisen from a couple of cases, with which some of us are familiar. I found an apt quote from a group called Victim&rsquo;s Voice, describing the dif<Col N="427"/>ficulty facing those who find themselves in the Coroner&rsquo;s Court. The view of Victim&rsquo;s Voice in England is that the bereaved are precipitated into a devastating situation and have to deal with agencies and procedures unknown to them and from which they feel totally excluded. That is certainly the message I have received from anyone who has found himself or herself facing the devastation of grief following a bereavement, as well as the angst-ridden bureaucratic difficulties of dealing with the coroner.</P>
      <P>Two years ago a comprehensive report was produced in the United Kingdom which made widespread recommendations, with which I am sure the Minister and his staff are familiar. I wish to touch on a couple of the issues identified in that report. There was evidence that the coroner service was not identifying some suicides, drug-related deaths and deaths to which adverse reactions to prescribed drugs may have contributed. There was also a view that there was inadequate collation of data, including examining historical data and trends and number-crunching during the years. As it is crucial to examine such information in any fundamental review of the legislation, I am sure the Minister is considering these matters in his draft legislation.</P>
      <P>The view in the United Kingdom was that the arrangements at inquests fell far below modern judicial standards of openness, fairness and predictability. That is what the European Union is saying to us, but it is also the message coming from across the water. A point that will become increasingly important in the years to come is that there is no reliable or systematic response to minority community wishes, traditions or religious beliefs. That issue has already arisen on this island.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of resources for coroners, including administrative or secretarial support. Much more needs to be done in that regard. There are no agreed objectives or priorities and no mechanisms to encourage the system to adapt to the changing times. All these aspects need to be considered, although we must also deal with the here and now of getting people to appear at inquests. I hope we will examine far-reaching reforms of the coroner service, as well as dealing with its curiosities, for example, in having responsibility for treasure trove, with which I was not familiar before now.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Having heard the Minister talk about the Government amendments, they are relatively sensible for the most part. I wish to lend the Bill my party&rsquo;s support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2005 and thanks the Labour Party Deputies for introducing it. The problems it seeks to rectify have been allowed to persist for far too long, with the terrible consequence that families have been denied justice, and the court has been restricted in its <Col N="428"/>ability to identity recommendations to prevent further fatalities. We join in commending the Bill to the House and urging all to support it. This State&rsquo;s legislation on coroners has not been updated for more than 40 years, although the case for reform of the Coroners Act 1962 is convincing. It is undeniable.</P>
      <P>The coroners law and rules must be brought into line with internationally recognised standards for the conduct of inquests, and I wonder if any of the drafters on the Labour Party side or the Minister has read the book <i>Melancholy Madness</i>, which was an account of the coroner&rsquo;s courts in Monaghan over a protracted period quite some time back. It was not what one would expect to be bedtime reading, but it was a very interesting book, and I commend it to anyone interested in the history of the Coroner&rsquo;s Court.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in advocates radical reform and regrets the Government has failed to publish a comprehensive Bill for the replacement of the existing Act, despite recognition of the necessity for wide-ranging legislative reform as far back as 2000. We believe a failure to introduce a proper investigatory role for inquests violates international law and constitutional rights.</P>
      <P>Witnesses should be compellable, and in disputed circumstances coroners should always sit with a jury, which should not be limited to findings of fact but have full powers to bring in appropriate verdicts, including apportioning responsibility for disputed deaths in general terms and making recommendations to prevent further ones where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The parties should have a right to examine witnesses and challenge jurors. Full legal aid should be available to families for that purpose and to cover the services of expert witnesses. All evidence, including autopsy reports, witness statements and other documents should be made available to families and their legal advisers as a right, with adequate time to prepare for the inquest. Inquests should be held promptly in a manner accessible to families, and adjournments kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>I note that, according to the Government legislative programme, the publication of a Bill to replace the Act is scheduled for 2006. I wonder whether I would be wrong to say I should not hold my breath. In the meantime, the proposed Bill represents a worthy effort to address some of the priority concerns identified by the working group that reviewed the coroners service and by the unfortunate families that have been let down by the inquest process. It will eliminate the restriction on the number of medical witnesses and make them compellable. That must be done as a matter of urgency. However, without wishing to delay the Bill unnecessarily, Sinn F&eacute;in submitted two very reasonable amendments to address further priorities we have identified. The Bill, as proposed, does not cover two very important issues. In light of the goodwill in the House, I urge Deputies to consider improving the Bill by <Col N="429"/>ensuring that it puts mandatory inquests into deaths occurring in and following custody on a legislative basis. The need is clearly illustrated by the tragic death of Brian Rossiter.</P>
      <P>The Bill would also be greatly improved by including a provision enshrining the public interest as a positive principle underpinning the purpose of the Coroner&rsquo;s Court. The court should be encouraged to make general recommendations where that could prevent future fatalities, particularly in custody and hospital settings. To achieve this, the Coroners Act 1962 must be reformed to allow a broader interpretation of the purpose of the coroner&rsquo;s court, thereby allowing it to ask all the necessary questions.</P>
      <P>In the tragic case of young Frances Sheridan, who died following her discharge from Cavan General Hospital, the court was not allowed to ask questions necessary to understand the causes of her death fully and hence make recommendations aimed at preventing further fatalities. The court should be able to examine the under staffing, under funding and mismanagement of health services that tragically contribute to preventible deaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Bill, which I obviously support. The legislation, which has particular relevance in the Cavan-Monaghan area at the moment, must be reviewed. In such a situation, one must establish the cause of death rather than lay blame at anyone&rsquo;s door. In many situations it can be quite straightforward to establish cause of death, but there are some situations where it is quite difficult. There are issues to address. One may call only two medical witnesses, something seen in the case of Frances Sheridan to which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred. There is no reason for that to be restricted. If a jury wishes to ask questions, it should not be limited. It is very important that every detail needed to reach a conclusion be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>A family hopes to achieve closure following a death. It will have been through several traumatic incidents, including the death itself. The inquest is generally the last in a line of such events and constitutes the commencement of closure. However, for the Sheridan family, it has led to many more questions. To be told, despite professional advice to the jury, that a nine year old child has died from natural causes to some extent adds insult to injury. We all have family members who have had an appendix removed, and to be told that death is a natural occurrence thereafter is not acceptable. It must be re-examined.</P>
      <P>As I said, this compounds the grief of the family, which now feels it has been let down by the health service. The child was brought in to the health service, and the GP accurately diagnosed the ailment, which was quite complicated &mdash; volvulus, I believe. The notes of the GP who examined her got lost in the system, and the notes were not available. The family felt let down by the health system, and now it feels let down by <Col N="430"/>the justice system too. These matters must be examined now rather than waiting 12 months for developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very glad to support this Bill and warmly congratulate the Labour Party on its introduction, which is not before time. In my area there have been two cases where the coroner was totally and utterly helpless, being unable to do anything owing to the non-attendance of a common killer responsible for the deaths of two Mayo people who should not have died. Whatever the justice achieved by the family of the first person, the second did not deserve to die either. That person would not have died if the coroner had been able to summon this witness and act appropriately. The case to which I refer is that of Jackie Alderslade, a woman in her 50s who died tragically on the side of the road &mdash; a mere stone&rsquo;s throw from alternative therapist Minike Kamper&rsquo;s place of practice &mdash; or killing, as I would say. The lady concerned was trying to get to her because she had such faith in her. Were it not for the diary she kept the extent of the negligence, arrogance and what people will do for whatever reason would never have been known. The lady concerned who was an asthmatic was persuaded by the woman in question to stop taking her essential steroid medication. As a result, she choked to death on the side of the road trying to get to the person she thought would help her. A working group has been trying to sort out the matter since 2003 but it has still not addressed the question of licensing and regulating alternative practitioners. The second case involves Paul Howie who had a tumour in his neck which caused him to choke to death. He should not have died either. When the inquest into the death of the first poor lady mentioned opened, Mineke Kamper was summoned but did not appear. The coroner said he could do nothing about it.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Bill and the fact that the Minister will support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for so generously and at such short notice accepting this legislation prepared by Deputy Rabbitte. We will accept the amendments he has proposed as they will improve the legislation. I thank all of the contributors, Deputies Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, Crawford, O&rsquo;Dowd, Cuffe, &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Cowley and Connolly. I am delighted with the level of interest in the legislation and the number of Members who contributed to the debate. I have no doubt we would have had more speakers if more time had been available.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is simple but important legislation in that it will allow, for the first time since the Act was passed in 1962, the system to operate in such a way where more than two medical practitioners can attend the Coroner&rsquo;s Court. That is the first instance. In the second it will allow for powers to enforce the attendance by jurors and witnesses at the court. These may appear to be simple issues <Col N="431"/>but they had the effect of preventing the coroner from doing his or her job properly. Very often families which were already traumatised by the death of a member of the family left the court frustrated with the results obtained. We must not forget that there are hundreds of such court hearings the length and breadth of the country.</P>
      <P>I sympathise deeply with the Nowlan family which lobbied Deputy Rabbitte to consider introducing this legislation to ensure its case could be dealt with properly. Many other families will benefit from the legislation. That is the reason we are particularly appreciative that the Minister has decided to take it at short notice. Second Stage will conclude tonight. Committee, Report and Final Stages will be taken tomorrow and I have no doubt the Bill will be adopted with the support of all sides of the House by tomorrow night. It will then go to the Seanad the following day, with the result that it will be passed by both Houses by the end of the week.</P>
      <P>There are many other issues we would like to address, which a number of speakers mentioned. They include nursing homes, prisons, Garda custody, hospitals and suicides and drugs, issues currently not properly covered in coroners&rsquo; inquests. I know from experience of attending a number of inquests involving, say, the Prison Service that there are serious problems in putting together the panel of jurors. There is not a common practice and very often the local Garda sergeant is sent out to empanel a jury, the members of which are brought in, put sitting on seats and expected to do their job in that respect. That is not a satisfactory way of putting together a jury. The coroners&rsquo; inquest system must be extended to cover the areas I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that, with the best will in the world, we have not implemented the recommendations of the working group on the coroner service which reported in 2000 and put more comprehensive legislation in place. I trust the Minister will bring his Bill before the House in 2006 and that we will all be anxious to expedite its passage through the House.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I want to briefly mention something we are doing in examining the S&eacute;amus Ludlow case. The family of S&eacute;amus Ludlow who was assassinated by paramilitaries from Northern Ireland was not informed when the inquest into his death was taking place. It is essential that the relevant persons are informed of inquests and that such a mechanism is in place.</P>
      <P>On the question of riders or recommendations, it is not just a matter of the simple questions of how, when and where. It should be possible to have a more robust decision-making process to answer more of the questions not being answered currently. Legal aid must also be provided.</P>
      <P>To come back to the two main issues before us, only two medical practitioners may be present but there is often a conflict between these two practitioners and there is no mechanism to <Col N="432"/>resolve it. I understand that in the Nowlan case there were over 20 medical professionals involved who would have been able to come to court to assist in getting a satisfactory outcome to the coroner&rsquo;s inquest. In many cases, this is a problem in that there is a simple conflict and no way of bringing others to the court to try to resolve it. This leads to enormous frustration.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the coin there is a huge problem with witnesses refusing to come to court, the current penalty for which is a fine of approximately &euro;6.35. This is unenforceable. There is no remedy to compel any person, a juror or a witness, to attend. Deputy Crowley outlined the details of the sad case of a natural health therapist who provided so-called medical therapy and treatment and when a person died, refused to attend court to give any evidence on the manner in which medical treatment or therapy had been provided. We cannot have a situation where such a key person can refuse to attend. We might as well not hold the court hearing if that happens. It is essential to ensure every coroner will have the relevant medical professional practitioners involved in the case present at the inquest and the power to compel the attendance of witnesses who might otherwise refuse to attend.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Government has accepted the Bill and that the Opposition parties have agreed to expedite its processing through the Oireachtas. I look forward to seeing the proposed legislation passed by both Houses on Thursday evening.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the assertion by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that we have a booming economy. He argued it is only just that the people who helped lay the foundations of our current prosperity are allowed to enjoy the fruits of the advances the country has made in the last ten years or so. I have pointed out areas that still remain to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The National Disability Authority, NDA, appeared today before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and laid out a number of issues which worried committee members from both sides of the House. The NDA informed the committee that more than twice as many people with disabilities are in the income bracket termed &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; by the EU. One in seven people with disabilities experiences basic deprivation and goes without basics such as heat or proper meals or gets into debt with regard to daily costs. The NDA argued that <Col N="433"/>this was double the rate found among other adults and that the extra costs of living associated with having a disability were likely to be a factor. The authority also argued that people with disabilities were twice as likely to be consistently poor, that is, to experience a low income and basic deprivation. It argued that consistent poverty among people with disabilities remained virtually unchanged throughout the years of the Celtic tiger, although it halved for other adults between 1995 and 2001.</P>
      <P>Many people with disabilities have talents and abilities and we should focus on these and see what supports we can put in place to encourage and help these people to gain employment. Many people with disabilities want to work. The NDA maintains that in seeking to reduce poverty among people with disabilities, the main issues for the social welfare system are promoting employment and financial independence for people with disabilities who can work, maintaining adequate levels of income for people with disabilities who depend on social welfare and assisting with the extra costs associated with having a disability.</P>
      <P>The NDA spoke about a cost of disability payment, which the Minister for Social and Family Affairs might consider. A review of illness and disability payments schemes carried out in 2003 by a working group in his Department concluded that the costs of having a disability should be met separately, rather than through higher basic income maintenance payments, which would not be targeted at those individuals whose needs are greatest. The working group stressed the importance of meeting the costs of disability in a way that is less dependent on labour force status if people with disabilities are to be given the opportunity to participate in the workforce. The Bill and the budget have not adequately addressed this area. We should now do so because the reports, research and political will on both sides of the House and across the political divide are there. The challenge is for the Minister, whose term will probably last for at least another year, to take this on board. I know the Minister listens to arguments put to him and I appreciate the fact that he takes part in debates in this House and in committees.</P>
      <P>I understand that the living alone allowance has been left untouched by the budget. Perhaps the Minister will explain the reason. It has been brought to my attention that many widows and widowers in their late 40s or early 50s face terrible financial pressure. The problem mainly affects widows because there appear to be more of them and it can be particularly marked for widows who did not work outside the home. Secondary benefits would be of great assistance to these people, yet widows and widowers must be over 66 years of age to access these benefits. The issue of secondary benefits for widows and widowers under 66 is not covered in this Bill but could possibly be examined by the Minister in the <Col N="434"/>future. These people have lost their spouse and the accompanying financial support and could have small children to raise.</P>
      <P>Women whose maternity leave begins in January 2006 or slightly later will not benefit from the additional four weeks. Could the Minister examine whether such women could receive this extra leave? They feel short-changed and have lobbied Deputies on the matter.</P>
      <P>The increase in child benefit is less than the actual increase last year so we seem to be going backwards. The question arises as to whether this is related to the extra &euro;1,000 payment for children under six years of age. The Exchequer has only a certain amount of money, which it must allocate to different areas. It is not clear whether the Department of Social and Family Affairs or another Department will administer this payment. Involving another Department will add another layer of bureaucracy. Could the Minister tell us which Department will administer the payment? He appears to have taken some credit for it in his speech, which I welcome, because children under six years are expensive. The Minister and I both know, as fathers, that in some cases children get more expensive as they grow older and expectations increase. Perhaps the Minister had a certain amount of money and decided to increase child benefit by &euro;8.40 for the first two children instead of last year&rsquo;s increases of &euro;10 for the first two children and &euro;12 for the third and subsequent child. He could possibly revisit this area.</P>
      <P>Travel passes for people in rural areas are not addressed in this Bill but should be considered. These people face major problems in accessing free travel because there is no public transport available. People who live in towns or villages are within easy reach of shops but those in remote rural areas with no public transport and who do not drive face problems in reaching towns to shop. These people can avail of free travel if they can reach a bus stop or train station but the problem lies in getting there. Many people with free travel passes frequently use public transport but many others cannot. It might balance matters if people in rural areas at a considerable distance from a bus route received vouchers which they could use once or twice a month to access local hackney services.</P>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware that private refuse collection service charges often eat away at the increases he awards. Perhaps he could discuss with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the introduction of a waiver scheme for people using private refuse collection services.</P>
      <P>When people living in local authority houses receive social welfare increases, the local authorities sometimes increase the rent, negating the benefit of the increase. A directive from the Department stipulates that it should not happen, but we know it is happening and that local authorities are strapped for cash. The Minister is giv<Col N="435"/>ing this money for people to live, yet the rent goes up automatically as a result of getting it. He should find out what is going on. He could write to the local authorities or contact the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It seems that various local authorities have different ways of doing this.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a great man for getting his picture on the front page of the Sunday newspapers as he is very photogenic. He also gets to state his thoughts for the week.</P>

	<P>In fairness, it does not cost us any money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the beauty of it. I am not sure if it sells any more newspapers.</P>
      <P>On 27 March 2005, the Minister indicated in one newspaper that he would like to move to a system that would replace the lone parent allowance with the more family friendly child benefit. In April, he stated in another newspaper that officials were still examining plans to replace the lone parent allowance with a more family friendly child benefit scheme, which would ease the transition from welfare to work to education. He stated that a range of options was being studied by a high level group of officials from a number of Departments who would report to him in a number of months. He also stated that the system would end where extra benefits are paid on the basis that a parent is living alone at all times. A number of similar statements were made to the newspapers.</P>
      <P>The number of one parent family recipients being paid by the Department at 30 September 2005 was 79,937. The Department records indicated that approximately 9,600 one parent family payment recipients are in receipt of maintenance from their spouses and so on. Spouses, usually women, are being told by officials that they must take their former partners to court to get maintenance. It is very stressful to do that, especially if the relationship has broken down and they do not want any contact with each other. I ask the Minister to look into that practice. Does he agree with it or does he think it should be disallowed? Let us suppose that someone reneges on a payment. It is left to the spouse, usually a women with children who is under much stress, to try to get the money back and deal with it. There is an inconsistency with the way things are working in that area. I do not know how it can be tackled, but it needs to be done because it is causing stress for people. The Minister spoke about moving to a different system. In his speech, he mentioned that something will happen, but when will it happen? He has been talking about this for quite a while. Since he came into office, we have been raising the issue. Now is the time for action on it.</P>
      <P>We have had no increase in the child dependant allowance and the special payment mentioned by the Minister has not come about. People on <Col N="436"/>social welfare payments who are really struggling would have benefited from an increase in the CDA. There has been no move since 1992, but we have many children living in poverty.</P>
      <P>I noted from the budget speech that the &euro;1,000 per year payment for child care is not in anyway linked to quality. The local child care committee must be notified that someone is minding children and that is it. The function of the local child care committee is not to act as an inspectorate of any sort, just to act as an support co-ordinating group. The committee does not have the resources or the function to act otherwise. I am concerned that, at some stage, a scandal will occur where a child is minded by someone who is not capable, not qualified and should not be in charge of children. It is an issue we must take on board. In other countries, child minders are vetted for their qualifications. A scandal is waiting to happen and we will be asked why we did not put in place some form of screening for child minders. There are many people in the grey economy minding children.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance also announced an income disregard of &euro;10,000 per annum for a child minder caring for up to three children in her own home. However, if she earns one cent more than that, she is taxed on the lot. If we do the maths, we will find that she will probably mind only one child. The costs are almost &euro;200 per week. The grey economy will continue or people will declare the &euro;10,000 and leave the rest in the grey economy. I would have preferred to see a &euro;10,000 income disregard, with anything over that being taxed. We should leave the &euro;10,000 untaxed to act as an incentive.</P>
      <P>There is an extraordinary problem with child care, which is costing a fortune. It comes back to this Bill. People on low incomes are paying the same amount of money as those on higher incomes when there are no community cr&egrave;ches. That causes a huge strain on parents. It acts as a disincentive to going out to work as they cannot get quality child care. A cost of over &euro;150 per week is a massive amount of money for people. The current proposals by the Minister for Finance in this area are a huge disincentive. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs is an accountant and he knows what is involved.</P>
      <P>No part of the child care package is linked to quality. There was no thinking about setting up a preschool system, even though it is badly needed. Most progressive European countries have a universal preschool system. The lack of such a system impacts enormously on the Department of Social and Family Affairs because people on low incomes are hit harder than anybody else in trying to cope and pay for child care. Fine Gael brought forward a document which would provide a voucher system that people could use to access registered quality child minders. The whole emphasis was to encourage people to register, to raise the standards and to move people out of the grey economy. When full-time child <Col N="437"/>minders reach retirement age, how are they fixed for pensions? They do not have any. What happens if they get sick? What happens if they have children? We need to raise the quality. This Mickey Mouse measure was an easy thing to do, but it did not tackle the issue. In my view, it was a missed opportunity.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increases provided for under the Social Welfare Bill. They are badly needed. We know the pressures that people are under and we know the costs that they have to endure, especially those with small children. At the same time, we need a strategy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increases for carers, but we need a family carers&rsquo; strategy. Carers, I am told, save the Exchequer about &euro;2 billion a year. If the Exchequer were to pay for the work some 150,000 carers do, it would cost that much. Very often it is 24 hours work, seven days a week. The social welfare measures in the budget have gone some way, but we need to go beyond that. We need to start putting structures together to eliminate poverty altogether, as I said at the start. Measures need to be targeted specifically at families with small children who are suffering in silence and who are poor. Such children are dropping out of school and this is adding to the cycle. They drop out and then they are gone. They cannot ultimately get high paid employment. We know the economy is moving more towards high skill employment and people with low skills are being left behind. That will continue as the years go on. Even people with high skills will be under pressure. In India and China, for instance, today the trend is towards high skill, low pay and that is a major challenge for Ireland. We must stay awake and make sure we are not left behind in that area.</P>
      <P>As regards the second tier child benefit, the Minister said last June he hoped some of the new measures would be contained in the budget and would go further towards addressing the blemish of child poverty. I do not believe they have gone far enough. Money for child care is for child care and money for child benefit is for child benefit and they are two separate issues. They can be blended together and it may be argued that it is a large amount of money. However, child care should be ringfenced for this purpose. People should realise that so much is for child benefit and so much is for child care. Child benefit is for food, clothes, shoes, toys and all the rest. In this day and age people&rsquo;s expectations are high. A woman told me this evening about her eight year old child who has many friends in school, and they have birthday parties. Every time the woman hears of a birthday party she knows that another &euro;20 is gone towards the child who is having the birthday. Then that child must be invited back and there is a widening circle of people involved. However, these are the times we live in and children cannot be deprived of that type of experience, though it is expensive.</P><Col N="438"/>
      <P>I welcome most of what is in the Bill. It would be foolish not to, because the increases are good. More needs to be done, however, as regards structures. I mentioned a number of issues that the Minister should address in the time he has left. We are moving closer to an election. Perhaps in the summer or in the next Social Welfare Bill he might deal with some of those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill. I thank the Minister for Social and Family Affairs for again getting his officials to brief us on the Bill. This is innovative, a novel concept and extremely useful. We appreciate the Department&rsquo;s officials. They are top class and diligent as regards their presentation and very open to answering questions in that regard.</P>
      <P>I also thank the Minister. It would be churlish of me not to acknowledge some of the increases he has given. They are along the right lines and I do not intend to be obstructive. The Minister has indicated he wants a constructive debate and I will certainly give him that. At all times the Labour Party tries to be constructive because it is closely associated with the social welfare area. I was surprised and heartened to see the Minister had taken cognisance of some of the points I made here on behalf of the Labour Party. I knew he listened, but sometimes Ministers listen but do not act. I must give the Minister some plaudits for what he has done.</P>
      <P>One of the initiatives was very simple. Many people do not understand it, but the Minister and his learned officials certainly grasped the issue very quickly as regards the one-parent family calculation for people who take on occasional or holiday work. This used to be calculated on a weekly basis and the income disregard meant people would lose their benefits if they did occasional work of this nature. I gave the example last year of a lone parent who was getting holiday work locally with An Post, at four week intervals. Each time she had to break her claim with the Department, even though over the years the income would not have approximated to the disregard. However, it did on a per week basis and she had to break her claim. Quite fairly, the Department&rsquo;s officials conceded it was not cost effective since each time such a person re-entered a claim it gave rise to an administrative cost. However, the Minister has dealt with this in the course of the Bill, and I acknowledge that and applaud him for it. It shows that sometimes matters emanating from the Opposition benches are not as woolly or as far-fetched as they might seem, even when uttered from mouths such as mine. They might sound long-winded, but they have a purpose.</P>
      <P>Likewise as regards the carers&rsquo; report, I note he has extended the duration of the carer&rsquo;s benefits by nine months, as recommended, which is useful. I know employers will not be excited about it and he probably met some resistance <Col N="439"/>from that quarter. They are having their own problems, however, so they should be happy the Minister is only extending it by nine months. He has also dealt with the number of hours a recipient of carer&rsquo;s benefit may work before qualifying for the respite care grant. That was particularly important. It might not sound much, but ten to 15 hours is particularly useful as the basis for a respite care grant, particularly in the farming community. The Minister is probably reaching the stretch-off point at this stage. Nonetheless, it is important to deal with the issue now, and I acknowledge and applaud that change. As the author of that report, I acknowledge he has taken cognisance of some of the points we made.</P>
      <P>I have to speak on behalf of the Labour Party and its role in advocating various matters. The Labour Party&rsquo;s objective is very clear as regards any anti-poverty and equality agenda, which is, basically to ensure the benefits of rapid economic growth, high employment levels and buoyant tax revenues are used to create a fairer society. In our view, the poor and disadvantaged should benefit as much if not more than the rich from the favourable economic conditions of recent years. Unfortunately, on the basis of the previous McCreevy budgets, the Government worsened the situation for the poor while giving tax breaks and many other benefits to the rich, resulting in a very unequal society.</P>
      <P>Despite the Minister&rsquo;s achievements, which we acknowledge, we still are very low down the scale as regards the proportion of national income that is devoted to social protection. During this Government&rsquo;s two terms in office the proportion of national income devoted to social protection has fallen. Ireland&rsquo;s social welfare expenditure is proportionally at the lower end of national income by comparison with other member states. The norm is for wealthy countries to spend proportionally more on social protection than the poorer ones. However, EUROSTAT 2004 data show the EU average is about 25%, with Sweden at the top, spending 31.3% of GDP. Ireland is at the bottom, spending about 15%, about 18% of GNP. With low social spending the poverty trends are not a wonder. They are highlighted in various independent reports, such as that of the CSO published yesterday and the Combat Poverty Agency, and not the Labour Party. Such reports indicate Ireland has one of the highest levels of poverty among member states.</P>
      <P>In 2003, 22% of Irish people lived in relative poverty, compared to the EU average of about 15%. Over 900,000 adults and 240,000 children were living in poverty. Lack of investment in social protection means we have not ensured a decent standard of life for people with disabilities and carers. Women are made dependent, resulting in a high risk of poverty in old age. Lone parents are trapped in long-term poverty. This means many people are unable to reach their full potential and that is very important. The Labour <Col N="440"/>Party has a vision for a fairer society. We want the social security system to be more than just a way of making weekly payments. We want to use it creatively to encourage and enable full social and economic participation. The fair society is about the expansion of real freedoms that people have a right to enjoy. It is based on the premise that every one of us is born with immense talents, gifts and possibilities, and a successful country is one that allows people to unlock that potential and make the most of that which is within them to achieve. Achievement can come in every shape and form and in every field of human endeavour and it should know no boundary of birth or background.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Labour Party social welfare policy is guided by the challenge of reducing poverty, increasing labour market participation for all who can potentially engage in paid work, enabling maximum personal choice and freedom and encouraging and enabling self-reliance. In promoting a high level of labour market participation, the Labour Party is highly conscious of the need to balance gender equality and the objective of increasing women&rsquo;s labour market participation with the need to manage the impact on the traditional patterns of care for children, older people, people with disabilities and those who are ill. Particular attention must be paid to the ways in which social security impacts on women and family choices and an effort must be made to recognise and facilitate the reality of care and family lives and the real choices that families make over their lifetime. We want to ensure that social security enables people to make positive life choices, particularly that it supports family formation while recognising the diversity in family life in 21st century Ireland.</P>
      <P>One good example of the changes needed to implement our vision can be found in the way in which women are treated by the current inequitable social welfare system. Gender equality requires that women should have equal access to income and employment to men. The facilitation of women&rsquo;s participation in employment is also a key policy to alleviate child poverty. This is particularly acute when applied to lone parents who have one of the highest poverty risks of any household type in the country &mdash; this was confirmed in yesterday&rsquo;s report and was alluded to by the Minister. Their experience of poverty is related not only to the low rate of one-parent family income payments, which is now &euro;185.10, below the 40% poverty line, but also to the relatively low rate of employment for lone parents.</P>
      <P>One of the problems I see in the social welfare code &mdash; I have spoken out about it, for which some people have criticised me &mdash; is that it is based on the model of the male breadwinner, and that is a concern. The man generally claims social welfare for the family, including a payment for an adult dependant equivalent to 70% of the full adult rate. A total of 98% of such qualified adults are women, which translates to approximately <Col N="441"/>130,000 women. These women are not only denied independent access to their social welfare entitlements but they are also invisible in the labour market. I think the Minister will be sympathetic to my argument. In the case of lone parents, the male breadwinner model can mean losing their independent income if they form a stable relationship or if they cohabit with a partner of their choice.</P>
      <P>The limitation rule prohibits a family from claiming two unemployment assistance payments even where they both satisfy the criteria for the payment. This means it is not worthwhile for women to sign on and register as unemployed. It leaves them poorer because up to 1 January they lose approximately &euro;50 a week. It also means that the qualified adult is not directly eligible for many labour market, F&Aacute;S or education programmes. A couple can swap their eligibility but this still means that only one adult can access programmes to help them into work. It is a bizarre restriction in an era of labour market shortages, it is back to the old times. This rule should be shaken up at this stage. For women who secure employment, the assessment of earnings that applies for qualified adults is extremely complex and the current income thresholds have the effect of trapping women in low paid work.</P>
      <P>Many lone parents report that the regulations stopping them cohabiting are a lifestyle restriction. They value the independent income which their social welfare payment provides and are reluctant to become dependent on a partner for economic activity. The limitation rule not only denies women an individual social welfare payment and independent income, it militates against women finding labour market support and help for getting back to work. It prevents many of the 80,000 lone parents reliant on social welfare from making positive choices to cohabit or marry a partner of their choice.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposed changes are probably straightforward to right the current unfair situation and would probably be easy to implement. The Minister&rsquo;s former colleague, former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, rushed on with individualisation. I thought this was a mad idea but he got his way. There is no rush for individualisation in social welfare. If the Government wishes to be consistent, there must be administrative individualisation of the social welfare system to allow women direct access to their social welfare entitlements and to an independent income. The limitation rule must be abolished for reasons of financial equity and to eliminate the relationship trap for many lone parents.</P>
      <P>What I have said may well be of help to the Minister with a problem he will encounter next year. I acknowledge he took my advice on the one-parent family regarding the seasonal nature of the employment which some lone parents might secure. I ask him not to disregard my advice because I have given it some thought. I am <Col N="442"/>aware of the legal ramifications and that we do not wish to disadvantage the formal family situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the lone parent or one-parent family. My suggestion does not leave anybody at a disadvantage nor does it leave anybody open to legal challenge, which is what the Minister must take into account. I acknowledge and salute the Minister for paying attention. I ask him to take note of my argument and I do not mean to sound big-headed when I say that my advice might be of some help to him.</P>
      <P>Child poverty is a big issue and was a central point in the Combat Poverty Agency report and representation. The Minister has increased child benefit and achieved the target so I will not be churlish. I acknowledge the Minister has a mind to merge the FIS and child dependant allowance payments but the child dependant allowance is the only payment that is targeted for children. Nothing has been done with it since 1994 but it is a crucial element of tackling poverty. The Minister should address this issue because it goes across the whole panoply of social welfare and assistance payments. Ordinary people as well as politicians and organisations are speaking about this issue. My colleague in Mullingar, Michael Dollard, is fairly expert in social welfare matters and he reports that this issue is a recurring theme among the public who feel let down at a time when the country has the resources. This is often the one definitive way of ensuring that moneys are addressed to children and I think it was missed out on.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge our efforts to reinstate the communal fuel allowance which has been addressed by the Minister. It will return in January 2006 and I thank the Minister for listening to our questions posed at Question Time. If I want to be bleating, the &euro;5 a week is welcome but there have been 25% increases in fuel charges such as ESB and gas. I refer to the old bags of coal which we used to throw on our backs, not those little bags which we called the poreen bags that can be carried with two fingers. If a person came out of our bog years ago with one of them, they would be hunted back into it; a person would need to come out with a 16 stone sack. I refer to a proper bag of coal weighing eight stone, worth &euro;16 or &euro;17.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>We were only lads of 14 at the time but the work used to harden us up for the football.</P>
      <P>The Minister could have doubled the payment to &euro;18. This may sound like a churlish response, but we want those on social welfare to be compensated for the huge increases in fuel costs over the past year. The fuel allowance will still not buy a bag of coal or even the great Bord na M&oacute;na peat briquettes that we used to have.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am inclined to laugh at the media and I do not pass too many remarks about them but I have <Col N="443"/>read that thousands are better off staying on the dole after a giveaway budget. This reminds me of the case of widows. I identified the savage 16 cuts and it was only when someone spoke on the Joe Duffy programme in February that I realised I had identified that cut a long way back, in the preceding November. I had identified one of the Minister&rsquo;s problems in the budget. I am sure the Minister has people monitoring what the like of us say, but I will speak out inside the House or wherever else I can. They all say that thousands are worse off.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of any budget must be to eliminate poverty traps, but the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has created a monster. Both Richard Curran and David Quinn, correspondents on economic and social affairs recognise this. However, I do not know how Father Se&aacute;n Healy missed it. He must have been so blinded by the light of Inchydoney that he can see nothing now and everything is sweetness and light.</P>
      <P>I am just an ordinary Joe with no great experience in these matters, but I saw the poverty trap looming. I am deeply disappointed that nothing has been done to address the anomaly whereby people who take up work often lose their rent allowance. This means people must be able to command a wage significantly greater than the minimum wage to replace the loss of the rent allowance when they take up work. The Government failed to address this employment poverty trap. The budget was on 7 December, but the newspapers only ran this story five days later. I do not have a research team but rely on what I can dig up myself and I am proud to say that I was five days ahead of the newspapers. I know there is trouble on the way in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many people on this issue and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, is not an answer. The Minister must ensure that people who take up work are not disadvantaged to a point where they end up losing money, up to &euro;7,000 a year. It is time to call the RAS a household subsidy. Housing benefit may have a bad name in Britain because of certain connotations, but we should provide a housing benefit or household subsidy payment to which we should attach two conditions. We should have the type of housing subsidy required for a two or three-bedroomed house, depending on the size of the family, and this subsidy should be determined by income, irrespective of whether the income comes through employment or the social welfare system. This is important. With such a system we would get over the anomaly that has been created.</P>
      <P>Our social policy document sets this out and I am giving the Minister a preview. It is very important that we do not allow this provision to create poverty. The former Minister, Deputy Coughlan, missed out some areas in her budget when she made the savage 16 cuts, some of which <Col N="444"/>were extremely savage. This provision could be the one to implode the Minister&rsquo;s budget. He may say that will not happen, but just watch this space. It is frightening for people to think they will lose all their benefits. This area has widespread ramifications and the Minister should pay it particular attention.</P>
      <P>Another area of concern is that people in receipt of rent allowance who take up a return to education or F&Aacute;S community employment scheme lose their rent allowance if their income, up to now, is above the cap of &euro;317.40 or the general cap for rent allowance, including the &euro;60 disregard. A woman who came to me was in receipt of lone parent&rsquo;s allowance. She missed out on school when she was young and took up the community employment scheme which offered her a return to education to develop her literacy skills for the first time in her life. However, as a result of taking up that scheme, her rent allowance was cut off. She finds this disgraceful. Other people who have seen the results of this scheme agree with me. The rules applied mean that she must lose her home or lose the opportunity to become literate. This is not a nice choice. It is an issue we must address.</P>
      <P>We have pointed out that schemes such as back to education and back to work allowances are not discarded. It is important that all these secondary benefits are not washed out in the flood, especially the rent allowance. That allowance has already been cut. The caps on supplementary welfare allowance make it practically impossible for homeless people to access quality accommodation in the private sector. The cap is between &euro;70 and &euro;98 for single people as set in June 2005 and applicable to December 2006. Local authority officials, community welfare officials and charities believe people cannot rent adequate housing within these caps. I want the Minister to address these issues.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Deputy Stanton referred to the issue of widows and widowers, an issue I have been addressing since I entered the House in 1992. The secondary benefit is very important to this sector at the emotional and traumatic time when they lose their partners. These benefits are critical at this time and we must seek some mechanism to ensure they retain them. Another area of concern is that of a working spouse who is entitled to a widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s pension and who should be entitled to two pensions when he or she reaches 66. Such a person wonders what happens to his or her own contributions or those of his or her deceased spouse and wonders whether they have just gone into the bin. Both widows and widowers are aggrieved about this. This is another time bomb as there are 112,000 such people. The Minister may say that he cannot breach principles and make two payments. However, if people pay into a scheme, they are surely entitled to a return. Otherwise, we are taking money under false pretences. We should hand it back. Something must <Col N="445"/>be done in this regard as this is an important issue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of an additional four weeks&rsquo; maternity leave, it would be better if the Minister brought the effective date back to 1 January instead of 31 March. Otherwise people will lose out. To be forewarned is to be forearmed. The Minister should try to deal with this before it becomes a major issue.</P>
      <P>The issue of the disregard of income from the family income supplement when applying the spouse means test for the household benefit package is another area of concern. Let us take, for example, Jack and Jill &mdash; former Minister, Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s friends who had been dumped &mdash; who are married with two children. Jack receives an invalidity pension while his wife works three days a week, more than 19 hours, to supplement the family income. On the other days she cares for her husband. On the basis of his invalidity pension, he qualifies for the household benefit package. However, once her earnings exceed a certain level, formerly &euro;220 a week but this may have changed, an anomaly arises. While her earnings were below &euro;220 a week she qualified for family income supplement, a payment designed to make work pay. However, her income from FIS is counted in the means test for the household benefit package.</P>
      <P>In the case that came to my attention, the couple were denied the household benefit package because of the FIS payment. They had to make a choice between the two. Income from FIS denies their entitlement to the household benefit package. This is an oversight which undermines the purpose of FIS. This may be an unintended consequence of policy, but it should be reviewed. The obvious solution is to disregard the income from FIS in the means test for the household benefits package.</P>
      <P>I have found another area of concern. Being a lawyer, one finds everything. Many parents never claim their child benefit in respect of the last month of their youngest child. This affects parents who are on book payments. The child benefit book covers from June to May. Children over 16 attending secondary school are normally certified by their school attendance, but many people forget to collect the payment for their youngest child for the month of June in the year the child leaves school. When the child leaves school they do not realise this payment is due. An information campaign would be useful in this regard or the Minister could align the child benefit year with the calendar year, as parents would notice the missing payment then.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to raise the issue of carers. The greatest lacuna in this budget occurred with regard to carers. I know the Minister has said that anybody over 80 years gets &euro;200 and that others get &euro;180 plus. In terms of payment, this is only a few euro an hour. We would all end up in jail if there were enough inspectors <Col N="446"/>to uncover how we are treating our carers. We all stand indicted in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, should note the reaction of a carer from Offaly:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;I am just so mad, we&rsquo;re at the bottom of the list again,&rdquo; was the furious reaction of a carer from the home county of the Finance Minister last night.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Furious with the meagre scraps the Budget had to offer, . . . [the carer] from Tullamore, Co. Offaly, said the increase in her carer&rsquo;s allowance would make little difference to her life or that of her autistic and intellectually disabled 26-year-old daughter . . .</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Carers&rsquo; Association was seeking a national carers&rsquo; strategy. I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that there are about 50,000 full-time family carers but the only way forward is to abolish the means test. Tinkering around at the edges is insufficient. Abolishing the means test will cost &euro;220 million or &euro;250 million but one should bear in mind that we have lost some amount of money through various schemes that ensured people would become extremely wealthy. We do not even know how much some of these schemes cost or how much the beneficiaries were making because some beneficiaries never had to return a penny of their income in tax. Contrast their circumstances with those of carers, who are working for 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 52 weeks per year, apart from the time during which they benefit from some respite care. We are not prepared to take the final step.</P>
      <P>If the Labour Party is ever in Government, a fundamental policy of mine will be to abolish the means test. We have caring on the cheap and this must not continue. People who are caring are becoming more ill and infirm than those they are caring for because they are working to their wits&rsquo; end. I accept the Minister has made some improvements in respect of the disregards and increased the respite care grant by &euro;200. Approximately 500 additional people will gain from his measures but we still have not reached 25,000, which is half the number of full-time carers. This is a major lacuna and it is very sad we have not addressed it. We must find the &euro;250 million to do so. Given the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is from Tullamore, that the head office of the Carers&rsquo; Association is in Tullamore and that the chief executive lives there, I would not be surprised if Deputy Cowen love-bombed the Minister for Social and Family Affairs with money for carers. He should keep the pressure on the Minister for Finance because everybody knows all politics is local, as Tipp O&rsquo;Neill stated.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance will have to provide the money and the means test will have to be abolished. It is costing more to administer than it is worth. Carers deserve its abolition. We need specific targets in the strategy to be implemented in a clearly defined period. Why not make this part of the new social partnership agreement, if it <Col N="447"/>is ever agreed? Carers are part of the community and voluntary pillar but the social partners in the broader sense should be taking this on board.</P>
      <P>Consider the area of disability. Deputy Stanton made a very elucidating presentation in respect of the disability payment. Much work needs to be done in this area, including in respect of the mobility allowance and disabled drivers&rsquo; and passengers&rsquo; tax concessions.</P>
      <P>The Minister has included some very positive measures in the budget, which the Opposition sought. We are possibly on our way to unmasking the only socialist in Fianna F&aacute;il. The Taoiseach certainly is not one but we may have found a socialist streak in the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. We in the Labour Party would have done some of the things he has done but there are areas in which we would have done much more. We would have made the rich pay more to ensure those who are more in need would benefit.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As a member of a party with six Members in this House, I have the invidious role of responding to both the budget speech of the Minister for Finance and to the Social Welfare Bill. It is often thought the budget day speech is the hardest to make given it is a more theatrical event, but it is probably harder for a member of the Opposition to address the Social Welfare Bill as it involves criticising what invariably turn out to be the giveaway provisions of the budget. There are probably two approaches that can be adopted in this regard: one can be peevish and say the increases are not enough, or one can be more considered and say policy opportunities have been missed. My natural inclination is to adopt the latter approach but, given our position in the electoral cycle, I will try to adopt a mixture of both. I will give qualified credit to the Government where I feel it is necessary but I will also point out remaining gaps in social welfare provision in the Bill and in the Government&rsquo;s social welfare policy in general.</P>
      <P>The Government has, for a change, honoured a number of commitments from social partnership agreements in terms of arriving at where we are expected to be at this time. The &euro;17 increase in the lowest rates of social welfare has set the scene nicely for a similar increase in what we expect will be the last budget of this D&aacute;il. It could be said the very modest target of 30% of average household income will have been reached by the Government. Likewise, the commitment to have a maternity benefit of 80% of reckonable earnings is already a Government guarantee under the most recent social partnership agreements. However, credit must be given in respect of meet<Col N="448"/>ing either or both of these targets because the Government has missed certain deadlines in the past.</P>
      <P>The most obvious of these missed deadlines concerns child benefit. The Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance would claim their commitment in this regard has finally been honoured but it has not as the rate has fallen marginally short. If one considers the increase committed to in 2001, which was to be achieved by 2003, index-links the relevant payment and determines what the figure should be for 2005-06, one will note the two rates of payment are approximately &euro;5 per month short of what they should be. I do not know whether this was a mistake with the calculator or whether a conscious decision was made to go this far but no further. The Government is still marginally short of its key commitment regarding child benefit payments. Perhaps the final budget of next year will afford an opportunity to bridge that gap.</P>
      <P>The missed opportunities in this Bill and those that remain for the Government concern important questions of social welfare policy. Previous speakers have alluded to these. I will also contribute in this regard for the benefit of the record. The central question we as political representatives need to address is not so much that of social welfare rates, important as they are in a very costly society, but that of equity in the social welfare system. We should, in the shortest time span possible, have collective agreement on addressing this question and the continued existence of dependant allowances into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to boast about its policy of individualisation regarding taxation. This has had a negative social consequence in that it has forced people to work outside the home. Individualisation in taxation is meaningless in itself if it is not accompanied by individualisation in respect of social welfare. Until the two codes are aligned and every person is treated equally in respect of entitlements and rights in both areas, the poverty gaps and traps in both areas will continue to exist.</P>
      <P>I give credit to the Minister on his commitment to overcome these poverty traps but in this regard his Cabinet colleagues need to be convinced. I refer not so much to his colleague in the Department of Finance but his other political bedfellows. That is the cross he and the country must bear. It is also fair to record that, according to the analysis produced by the ESRI, of the nine budgets this Government has produced since 1997 the first five were grossly disproportionate with regard to the less well-off, the sixth was neutral and the seventh was marginally in favour of the better-off. It is to the credit of the Government that the budgets of this year and last year were the only two in the series of nine where the gap, which was widening, began to be redressed. It is a poor Government record that in a nine-year period only two and a half of the budgets it <Col N="449"/>produced were in any way aimed towards the less well-off in our society.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose referred to tabloid press stories with regard to how it is better to live on the dole than to work. We should encourage some of those who work in such media to do just that. All of us, particularly those of my generation who grew up in the 1980s, knew that experience and it is not one we would wish on this generation or those who went before us, whose experience was a lot worse. The reality is that social welfare is or should be a safety net. It only covers the bare minimum, if that, in terms of people&rsquo;s expectations and living needs. To insinuate that the social welfare system is a pot of gold that can be dipped into and that a segment of society is living at the expense of the better-off is a myth we need to put to bed once and for all. If that was the case, there would not be homelessness, high levels of child poverty or the poverty and welfare traps to which Deputy Penrose referred.</P>
      <P>However much the Bill is welcomed, it is salutary that yesterday saw the release of the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s statistics on disadvantage in Ireland, which were compared with other sets of statistics in the European Union, the EU SILC survey. With regard to relative poverty, which relates to those living at 60% of average income and below, there was marginal or no movement between 2003 and 2004. Some 20% of the population are living in or at risk of poverty, and while I suspect some improvement from the 2004 statistics will arise as a result of budget 2005 and 2006, the movement prior to 2004 was painfully slow. Moreover, if one considers a deeper breakdown of the statistics, those referring to one-parent families show that 48% of people in that category live at the level of 60% of average income or below. That was a damning and shaming indictment of the nature of Irish society in 2004 and I am not confident the situation has changed significantly since then.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a major task to convince his Cabinet colleagues that we need to move towards establishing a fairer, more equal society. It is welcome that most social welfare payments will be paid as of 1 January given that the old system meant they were paid in April, June or even October. However, a degree of slippage remains, with some payments being made in April and June. If possible, the Social Welfare Bill next year should ensure that all payments are made as of 1 January each year.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the increase in the fuel allowance, although I realise the Minister must have debated the issue in Cabinet. A &euro;5 increase, while significant in its own right with regard to the initial figure, which itself was frozen from 2002 on, does not represent the cost of fuel increases for those on social welfare. The only way in which the gap could have been bridged, as it should have been, was through a doubling of the allowance. Far from it being a non-statutory measure, as the allowance is now at the behest of <Col N="450"/>the Minister and within his budgetary control, I would like to have it included as an index linked measure that would be measured in terms of the future problems of fuel poverty and fuel need that will be encountered due to problems such as global warming. If this is an initiative the Minister is prepared to include in next year&rsquo;s budget, regardless of the election and whatever criticism I, as a spokesperson, will give the Government, I would be prepared to welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has again missed an opportunity to tackle disadvantage and poverty, the root and branch problems in our communities and society. While I welcome many of the increases referred to by other Deputies, when one analyses in depth the problems and poverty in our communities, these increases are superficial.</P>
      <P>There is no strategy for dealing with structural inequalities in this budget. What we have seen are increases in social welfare but these have been offset by the absence of an integrated approach to giving people a pathway out of their situation. I refer particularly to those on the non-contributory old age pension who live in local authority housing. The increase they received in the budget has been welcomed by all but, inevitably, in the coming weeks and months their rents will be increased by local authorities due to their increased means and everything they gained in this budget will be taken back before next June. In addition, the issues of reskilling for those living in the poverty trap in working class communities and the provision of the child care necessary to allow people to avail of work have not been tackled. Despite the modest increases in third level allowances, this does not offset the problems that exist in this regard.</P>
      <P>The budget is a typical pre-election budget. It is big on presentation and very well crafted but lacking in substance. The Government has craftily attempted to create a perception that it has spread the resources available to those most in need. However, they are spread very thinly. If one spreads butter thinly on bread, a pound will go a long way. Those in the poverty trap will remain there as the budget has not dealt with the root causes of the problem.</P>
      <P>With regard to housing, the focus is now almost exclusively on affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. These schemes, while welcome even if under-resourced, do nothing to address the housing needs of those not working or on low pay. There is no provision for the type of building programme required to address this issue through adequate provision of social housing. The continued use of rent allowance as a substitute for social housing is a national disgrace. The only people who benefit from this are private landlords and those who have accumulated a number of houses and have their mortgages paid by the State. The onus should be on providing housing for people in need. The Society of St. <Col N="451"/>Vincent de Paul recently called for the supply of a minimum of 12,000 social housing units a year, a call the Government should have listened to and tried to deal with.</P>
      <P>The budget has been a major disappointment for people with disabilities. For years the disability sector has called for a new disability payment which recognises the additional costs and burdens borne by people with disabilities. The rate of unemployment among disabled people is disgracefully high. Many of these people are fully capable and willing to work but are kept out of employment, not by the disability itself but because they may lose State benefits when they work. This may put them in a much less well-off financial condition.</P>
      <P>A cost of disability payment is therefore essential. I deplore that the Government has failed to address this issue and deliver on it. Will the Minister look at this as a mechanism and a means to helping people labelled as disabled, who are wonderful people and whom I view as having extraordinary abilities. They are able to continue, work and do the best they can in their communities and fight for their rights. Recognition should come from the Government in this regard.</P>
      <P>A significant increase was required in the carer&rsquo;s allowance along with the abolition of the means test. Other Deputies referred to this and I fully concur and support everybody who made such a statement. There is no recognition in the budget of the large savings for the State because of people caring for their relatives at home. Throughout the country, people provide a significant service in their homes and, in doing so, reduce a burden on the taxpayer and the State. The State has not reciprocated this or responded to these people who provide a fantastic service.</P>
      <P>An integrated strategic approach is required. If we are to combat poverty we must link this to the educational programme. I welcome the &euro;1.2 billion investment in third level education. However, is this not putting the cart before the horse? A recent survey in this city by the vocational education committee revealed a large disparity in those progressing to third level education directly related to social and economic backgrounds. This may suggest that this money could be used more productively in the pre-third level sector.</P>
      <P>In every constituency with working class areas, many young people drop out of the educational programme at 14, 15 and 16 years of age. There is high unemployment in these areas as well as a high incidence of single parents. One would assume that if a strategic approach is to come about, this problem in the communities should be dealt with. Young people should be kept in school and parents who wish to resume their education should be provided for and aided to develop their abilities.</P>
      <P>The failure to provide adequate funding for a drugs task force is another area where there is a <Col N="452"/>lack of real interest. The failure to make up the shortfall in the emerging needs funds makes up only a small part of the picture. Even more significant is the failure to make funding available to the 14 task forces to implement new plans. The last plans were drawn up five years ago, and in the time since patterns of drug abuse and associated issues have changed dramatically.</P>
      <P>There has been much comment on the commitment shown to child care in this budget. The sum of &euro;29 per week for the average family is simply too little, too late, and this is not to mention that childhood apparently now ends at the age of six. A national payscale for early childhood care and education workers is required. We also need to establish a single accredited body to inspect, evaluate and register all early childhood care and education providers and to ensure that the highest standards are achieved and maintained. As it stands, the most common child care providers are still dependent on community employment workers, and there has been a failure to provide appropriate training. None of these issues has been addressed.</P>
      <P>I welcome several aspects of the budget where there has been an attempt to provide extra funding to people in need. Unfortunately this is spread so thinly that there will be no discernible effect on the major problem in our communities, the poverty trap. I cannot see people finding their way out of this with this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak on this matter. The Minister for Finance has carried out many good actions in the budget. Unfortunately, free travel for emigrants on their holidays has not yet been delivered by this Government. From feedback I have received, I believe it to be very important. The task force report on our emigrants highlighted this issue as something near and dear to the hearts of our emigrants. When these people return here on holidays, they feel they would belong more if they had free travel. The Minister should examine this issue again, although I know he previously precluded the possibility on the grounds of EU law because he cannot discriminate against other citizens. The point is there is a common travel area which is recognised. I hope the Minister will continue to work at this matter, as it is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the contribution made by the Government towards the Safe Home programme, which is the national repatriation organisation in Ireland. The Department of Social and Family Affairs, along with the Department of Foreign Affairs, must be recognised as having given good Government support. Several hundred emigrants, who would not otherwise have been able to return, have been brought back to secure accommodation throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P>A disappointment in the budget concerned the defined revenue funding scheme. This was for people in social housing and was an issue that was being examined by the Government on a cross-<Col N="453"/>departmental level. I met the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, together with Donal McManus of the Irish Council for Social Housing, and it was disappointing that only &euro;500,000 was allocated for 2006, with an equal amount for 2007. That money is for approved sheltered housing schemes. The amount granted for last year was &euro;428,000. It had been calculated that &euro;2.5 million would be needed this year, and &euro;500,000 is far short of this.</P>
      <P>This gives the wrong message to communities. Although I recognise the existence of home care packages etc., the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has given the wrong message in that she has put &euro;28 million more in funding into supporting profit-driven and non-community nursing homes. That total is more than &euro;140 million now. The Government should be doing more for not-for-profit and community focused sheltered housing initiatives which keep people in the community. There are 7,000 sheltered housing and group home units, and the funding would amount to &euro;1.40 per week, which is very little when one considers the wonderful work being done in supporting people in their own community. It would be best to be in one&rsquo;s own home but sheltered housing helps when this is not possible.</P>
      <P>The wrong message has been given out to the voluntary housing associations which do good work. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs may wish to support the development of sheltered housing but the opposite message is being given out. The Minister should have a word with his colleague in the Department of Finance, and the issue of the defined revenue funding scheme might be addressed in the Supplementary Estimates. People should be allowed to stay at home; otherwise frail and elderly people are being driven into profit-driven non-community nursing homes. People would much prefer to be in their community with their friends and families. I welcome the home care packages, which are a positive development and are a step in the right direction. However, the Minister for Health and Children has missed a golden opportunity to recognise the good work done by voluntary housing associations.</P>
      <P>The capital funding limits for social housing have not been raised. There has been no increase in the amount allowable per unit since 2002. This is a mistake which has stunted the growth of sheltered and voluntary housing. There is an immediate need to increase the capital funding limits for social housing. This would be a clear statement to people involved that the work being done is valuable. It would also signal that the Government agrees with what these people are doing and wishes to see more of it. There is a great opportunity to be taken in future and I hope the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will talk to his colleagues in the Department of Health and Children and in the Department of the Environment and Local Government about the issue. Elderly <Col N="454"/>people throughout Ireland do not have the benefit of social housing. This is a missed opportunity. Other opportunities have been missed too, for example, a helicopter emergency medical service, which has been discussed for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with the budget details regarding social welfare. On balance, the social welfare elements of the budget are welcome and will go some distance to addressing the many issues which daily impact on the public. The cost of child care has been regularly ventilated for a long time. This budget attempts to address this issue under various guises.</P>
      <P>The payment of an annual child care supplement of &euro;1,000 for each child under six years of age is welcome. This payment is an addition to the existing child benefit which has been increased by &euro;8.40 a month for each of the first two children and a further &euro;7.70 a month for the third child and subsequent children. While the increases in child benefit are small they are nonetheless welcome. A family with two children under six years of age will receive a total package of direct child-related payments from the State worth &euro;5,600 per annum or approximately &euro;170 per week, which is a substantial sum.</P>
      <P>Some people say, as if it were a surprise, that this budget has one eye on the next election, but it is framed by a politician. As long as it addresses issues of concern to the public, that is fair enough. This budget has begun to address the child care issue, albeit not quickly or well enough for some people.</P>
      <P>I have a problem, however, with the new payment of &euro;1,000 per annum and child benefit being payable to parents, irrespective of income. There should be a means test for payment of this benefit because it is obscene that parents on high incomes receive this payment, which they do not need, while those on low incomes could benefit from higher payments. The resources of the State should be aimed at the needy, not the greedy.</P>
      <P>The figures suggest that total social welfare spending will rise by over &euro;1.1 billion next year and pensioners will be among the major beneficiaries, receiving on average, increases of 10%. This is welcome because today&rsquo;s pensioners were the workers of yesteryear who helped put the country where it is today. Their contribution cannot be forgotten and needs to be appreciated. It is welcome, therefore, that next year the non-contributory pension will be &euro;182 and the contributory pension &euro;193.30 per week.</P>
      <P>Another group which makes a major contribution to society in a concerned way are carers who perform a valuable role, taking care of the most needy. The increases for them are generous at 17.2% and 17.8%, depending on age. This budget, and its social welfare provisions, go some way to acknowledging the members of our society who need to be looked after. I presume that the message delivered to the Government at the last <Col N="455"/>local government elections is ringing in its ears and it will not forget that in a hurry.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Brennan was appointed Minister for Social and Family Affairs it was said he was a right wing Minister in a caring Department, which would not bode well for the less well-off in our society. He has, however, proved his detractors wrong, not alone through the social welfare elements of this budget, but with the improvements he also delivered in social welfare in the last budget. This proves one does not have to wear certain badges or espouse certain philosophies. Actions speak louder than words or slogans, and the Minister&rsquo;s actions since coming to this job show his concern and compassion for the less well-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Carty.</P>
      <P>Once again, I pay tribute to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, on the Social Welfare Bill 2006. In that tribute I include the Taoiseach for his commitment to social inclusion and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, because if he did not provide the resources the Minister for Social and Family Affairs could not distribute the generous benefits under discussion.</P>
      <P>Every year in the wake of the budget the Minister&rsquo;s speech is dissected in the media by economists and politicians, financial commentators and representatives of major accountancy firms. The commentary focuses on the impact on the economy of the various measures announced. We are told how changes in taxation will impact on take-home pay and the exclusion or inclusion of reliefs will affect employers and large organisations.</P>
      <P>It is important, however, that the budget is likely to impact in an equally significant way on the lives of people who depend on the State for income, although this does not receive the same prominence as taxation measures. This year the level of increases is significant and will improve the quality of life for people at all levels regardless of the social welfare benefit they receive.</P>
      <P>The Government is meeting the commitments made since 1997 and reaffirmed in the programme for Government in 2002. These commitments created expectations that real and significant increases in social welfare rates would be provided to help people who depend on the State for income. I am proud to be a member of a party in Government that not alone promised to redistribute the gains made by the State to ensure that all sectors of the community benefit from our growing prosperity, but also honoured those commitments and took decisions to put these promises into effect.</P>
      <P>Our ability to look after the less well-off in society is directly related to the level of growth in the economy and the strong performance of the economy generally gives us scope to offer meaningful and telling increases in rates of payment. <Col N="456"/>We must acknowledge the role of the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, and the present Minister, Deputy Cowen, in implementing prudent and sensible financial measures which have helped maintain the positive growth rates to which we have become accustomed.</P>
      <P>Every year we receive submissions in advance of the budget from organisations working to alleviate hardship among the less well-off in society, which articulate the needs of their clients and seek ongoing improvement in the rates of payment to ensure that we continue to bridge the gap between rich and poor. I was particularly heartened in the immediate aftermath of this budget to hear representatives of so many such groups welcome this budget and acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s contribution to improving income levels for welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>Aside from the general improvement in rates, many aspects of this budget will have a direct and telling effect on people&rsquo;s lives. I am particularly pleased with the measures the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has introduced in the areas of education, child care and support for carers. One of the key drivers of our economy over the past 15 years was the wide availability of an educated workforce. Potential investors in Ireland often say that one of the key considerations when seeking a location for a new facility is the quality and availability of the potential workforce. Our investment in education has proved crucial in enabling us to attract industry, create jobs and provide sustainable employment and income opportunities for a wide range of people. It is therefore opportune that to move into a new phase of economic development as a strong economy in an expanded Europe, our commitment to education must be re-affirmed at the highest level. We must ensure the necessary resources are provided to allow our graduates train to PhD level. One guard against poverty is a job. Producing and educating a workforce and providing educational opportunities for people at all levels will eliminate the likelihood of people requiring social welfare benefits.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The commitment to children is also welcome with the significant increase in child benefit payments, along with the new payment for children under six years. These vital benefits provide real support for parents and are payable regardless of the parent&rsquo;s status. Deputy McHugh referred to having a means test for this payment. A previous examination of this showed it would be more costly. For that reason, it is better to leave the system as it is. For many parents, it will allow them to remain in the workforce, using funds to cover child care costs. For many others, it will allow them to remain in the home looking after their children.</P>
      <P>Regardless of personal choices made by individuals, it is important for the Government to support them. For this reason, the increases in these benefits are to be welcomed. Another aspect of the Bill which will receive widespread <Col N="457"/>approval is the proposal to increase maternity benefit by four additional weeks this year and by a further four weeks next year. This additional eight weeks will ensure a mother will have the benefit of time at home with her children at the most important stage for both the mother and the child in the early months of the child&rsquo;s life.</P>
      <P>In addition to retaining the capital allowances for the development of cr&egrave;ches, which will encourage the development of additional approved child care places, childminding relief is another significant measure that will go some way in tackling the much publicised child care crisis. An individual may mind up to three children in his or her home and avail of tax free income of up to &euro;10,000 per year. This will help formalise the situation that has developed where people mind children in their home but were heretofore not registered. It will also encourage other people to consider looking after children in their home, thus creating additional spaces.</P>
      <P>We have often acknowledged the role of carers in society and highlighted their Trojan work in homes throughout the country. People working in their own community are looking after disabled and elderly relatives and neighbours in a caring and compassionate way which the State could never hope to match. This work is extremely worthwhile but all too often is not properly acknowledged by the State. I am glad the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has continued his trend set in last year&rsquo;s Social Welfare Act by affording special recognition to carers and their valuable role in society. This is being achieved by increasing the carer&rsquo;s allowance by up to &euro;30 per week, representing a 17% increase. It is also noteworthy that the respite care grant has been increased by &euro;200. These initiatives will be further enhanced by the new home care package, costing &euro;150 million, announced recently by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>These benefits are a clear recognition of the importance of carers to society and the Government&rsquo;s stated commitment to ensure people, where possible, are looked after in their homes. It also ensures financial consideration will not be a barrier to ensuring people who wish to be cared for at home can be. I pay tribute to the many organisations that came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs to articulate the needs of the people they represent. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has responded positively.</P>
      <P>A key aspect of the budget is the support that has once again been provided for the elderly sector of our community. In 2002 a commitment was made that the rate of the old age pension would be increased to &euro;200 per week by 2007. With the recent increases in benefits, bringing the level of payment to &euro;193 per week, it will exceed this level after next year&rsquo;s budget. This is a significant statement of the Government&rsquo;s respect for the contribution elderly people have made to the <Col N="458"/>development of the economy over many years. The Government acknowledges that the good times we now enjoy are directly related to the efforts of our retired population who toiled in more difficult times. I am glad the rewards we now enjoy are being used to provide a meaningful pension for older citizens.</P>
      <P>It is also worth noting we need to plan for the future so that today&rsquo;s workers will also benefit from a reasonable pension when they retire. The ongoing contribution to the National Pensions Reserve Fund to provide for future liabilities is an important initiative. It was an inspired idea when first introduced several years ago. As we have an ageing population, we need to continue to build on this reserve fund. We also need to encourage people to begin to fund their retirement and not leave it to the State to carry the full burden of providing for their future security.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to place a cap on the level of fund a high earner can build up for retirement reasons, because I believe some individuals were using this facility to transfer huge sums of money from their companies tax free. However, in tandem with this measure, incentives to encourage other workers must be examined, especially those on the lower tax rate, to prioritise pension contributions and the provision of their retirement fund. Convincing people of the merits of this course of action will ensure the financial future well-being of society will be protected.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the threshold for family income supplement. Again, I ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to make every effort to ensure people are aware of their entitlements under the scheme. It is an excellent scheme but many families do not avail of it simply because they are unaware of it. While that is not the direct responsibility of the Minister or his officials, it could be better advertised through local community groups. More families would benefit if they availed of it.</P>
      <P>This is a good Social Welfare Bill because it continues the trend of providing real and meaningful benefit increases to people dependent on the State for their income. There will always be competing demands for resources and different sectors of the community will have different priorities and ideas on how available resources should be distributed. The Government has, however, prioritised the claims for support of those most vulnerable in our society and responded to their needs by providing real and telling increases. These measures will make a significant impact on poverty by directly benefiting the lives of many people. I am pleased to support them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on introducing the most comprehensive social welfare package in the State&rsquo;s history. These social welfare improvements will benefit the most vulnerable groups in <Col N="459"/>our society. More than 1.5 million men, women and children will benefit as overall spending increases by more than 10% to &euro;13.5 billion, double the spend in 2000. The increases in rates for allowances and supports include a &euro;17 per week rise for those in receipt of lower welfare rates, a special &euro;16 a week increase for non-contributory pensioners and a &euro;14 rise in the weekly income for other pensioners. This is a positive move in looking after the elderly in society.</P>
      <P>More than &euro;100 million has been allocated in increases to raise child benefit payment rates to &euro;150 at the low level and &euro;185 at the top level. This entitlement is paid to in excess of 540,000 families in respect of more than 1 million children. Together with the new &euro;1,000 child care initiative, the Government has now fully honoured its commitment on child benefit. These increases represent a significant contribution towards alleviating child poverty and providing extra support for children.</P>
      <P>In response to increasing fuel costs and their impact on the ability of welfare recipients in meeting their heating bills, the fuel allowance will be increased by &euro;5 per week to &euro;14 with effect from the beginning of January. This increase will directly benefit 274,000 households and is badly needed, especially by older people living alone during the winter weather. I ask the Minister for Finance to consider extending in future budgets the period during which the allowance is paid.</P>
      <P>A new social reform agenda with funding of more than &euro;300 million is being made available to underpin and give tangible effect to some important and necessary social reforms. One of the main objectives of the reforms is to create the changes and opportunities which will bring people from welfare dependency to financial independence, thereby providing a better standard of living and income. Changes in the means disregard and the increase to &euro;100 per week in the earnings disregard will raise 35,000 pensioners on part payment to the full amount and encourage older people to take up employment without fear of losing the pension.</P>
      <P>Carers and their valuable contribution to society are recognised by an increase of &euro;30 per week in the carer&rsquo;s allowance, bringing the top rate to &euro;200 and making it one of the largest single welfare payments in the State. In addition, the respite care grant, which is available to all those providing full-time care irrespective of means, has been increased by &euro;200 to &euro;1,200.</P>
      <P>A &euro;150 million package has been provided to tackle child poverty. The threshold for family income supplement, which provides cash support for workers with families on low earnings, has been significantly increased by amounts ranging from &euro;19 to &euro;282 per week and is specifically targeted at larger families where poverty is more likely to be concentrated. Back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which benefits approximately 160,000 children, has been increased, <Col N="460"/>while the school meals scheme also benefited from the budget.</P>
      <P>The upper earnings income for one parent family payment has been substantially increased by &euro;82 per week to a new limit of &euro;375. Of the 80,000 lone parents in receipt of the payment, it is estimated that 60% are currently in full or part-time employment. The increased income limit will allow several thousand lone parents become eligible for a payment and all those recipients who are working will be in a position to increase their earnings further.</P>
      <P>Almost &euro;28 million extra is being invested in a range of new and enhanced support schemes which will provide opportunities and choices to welfare recipients, especially the unemployed. The qualifying period for access to the back to work allowance for employees has been reduced from five years on the live register to two years and, in the case of the self-employed, from three years to two years.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and staff in his Department for all their work in formulating a package of measures which confirms our commitment to social inclusion by helping in a real way those who are less well off, while at the same time maintaining a strong economy. This social welfare package has all the hallmarks of a caring Government concerned with the needs of the most vulnerable in society and one which is honouring its commitments to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Ring. While it has been described in many quarters as a giveaway budget, I prefer to describe it as a &ldquo;give back&rdquo; budget. With revenue receipts this year running at &euro;1.8 billion above the estimated figure, the Minister for Finance has opted to give back taxes taken by stealth in recent years. People deserve to have this money returned to them and I thank the Minister for doing so.</P>
      <P>I wish to be positive about the budget. The Fine Gael Party welcomes the increase of &euro;14 per week for those aged 66 years or over and in receipt of old age contributory pension, widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pension and deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit. We also welcome the &euro;16 per week increase in the weekly personal rate for the old age non-contributory pension, blind pension, widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pension and one parent family payment, where the recipient is aged over 66 years.</P>
      <P>What more could the Minister for Finance have done in his budget? He could have done substantially more with the &euro;1.8 billion in unanticipated revenue. How much could have been achieved if so much money had not been wasted in recent years? For example, &euro;50 million was wasted on electronic voting and the figure increases every year as the costs of storage rise, while &euro;130 million was wasted on the PPARS project in the Department of Health and Children, a figure which increased to &euro;180 million last year. The <Col N="461"/>consultants involved were protected from liability, which rested with the then health boards, and paid &euro;30 million. The Dublin Port tunnel is running &euro;300 million over budget and we also had Abbotstown, the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo; and many other examples of waste.</P>
      <P>Despite these examples, we still managed to collect an extra &euro;1.8 billion in revenue this year. Were it not for the reckless waste of Government money on the projects outlined, Ireland could be a great country. The way in which a Government deals with good fortune is just as important as the way it acts in bad times. The voters will judge it on this at the next election.</P>
      <P>The increase in support for the carer&rsquo;s allowance amounts to &euro;27 million, the same figure as was conceded in the reduction in betting tax. Where are the values in that decision? While the Fine Gael Party welcomes the increase in the respite grant, for many carers, particularly in Dublin and the east coast, the rise will only cover the cost of about one week in respite care. Since the Government took office in 1997, the number of respite care beds has declined from 785 to 689 in 2004, according to the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s long-stay activity statistics 2004.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance made great mileage in his Budget Statement about caring for older people. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">This Government has always given high priority to supporting older people. Respect for older people and the dignity of older people are at the heart of our policies. That is as it should be. Many older people have active and fulfilled lives. Others have increasing needs for health care and support... While previous Governments have aimed to support this desire, this Government has decided to make a step-change in the level of care and support service for older people in their home or community.</P>
      <P FLI="0">These are fine words but they are far removed from the reality on the ground.</P>
      <P>The Minister also stated that most older people and their families want to live and be cared for at home for as long as possible. He is correct that most elderly people would like to end their days in their own homes in their communities. If people were able to keep their loved ones at home, it would deliver benefits to families, communities and society which would far outweigh the expenditure invested in trying to achieve this outcome. In previous generations grandparents stayed at home and educated and exerted a positive influence on their grandchildren, while also benefiting their communities. What people learned from their experience of life is being lost in many cases, as older people are compelled to enter institutional care or a nursing home for family reasons. Policies which encourage more people to stay in their communities should be supported at every level. Unfortunately, however, such policies run contrary to the current trend.</P><Col N="462"/>
      <P>The Minister and his officials will be sick of hearing me citing the following example of the heartlessness of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in penalising some carers. I have raised this case with the Minister and his predecessors, including Deputies Woods, Coughlan and Dermot Ahern. It relates to a carer, generally a woman, who provides full-time care and attention at home to a relative of her husband, for example, his father. If her husband were to die suddenly and the carer became a widow, she would qualify for a widow&rsquo;s pension but lose her carer&rsquo;s allowance. What could be more cruel than that and what message does it convey to carers in the home? I have asked various Ministers to address that matter, given that there is provision in the Social Welfare Acts to deal with it in special circumstances.</P>
      <P>I will cite another example of where the reality differs from what the Minister for Finance said in his Budget Statement and what the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is saying now. The day following the budget I had a call from a constituent, a farmer who was looking after his aged mother at home. She was getting eight hours of home help per week in September, but that has been cut to four hours. I rang the community care services and informed them that there was a lady in the area who was willing to take on the four hours of work, yet they told me that they could not employ anyone extra due to a Government embargo. With &euro;150 million included in the budget for care of the elderly at home, I ask the Minister to lift the embargo on the recruitment of home helps. I am only talking about my own health service executive area, although I am sure the situation is the same in various parts of the country where the home help service is being cut back. That is the help that families need to keep elderly people in their own homes for as long as possible, while getting the services they require.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider abolishing the means test for the carer&rsquo;s allowance? It would cost approximately &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million to abolish it, but it would be money well spent because it would make many more people eligible for the allowance. It would assist in what the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, are trying to achieve. It would pay for itself in the long run because apart from their great work, carers are saving the State billions of euro annually in caring for loved ones at home. That is to the benefit of the families concerned and society as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he is increasing the number of hours a person can work and receive the carer&rsquo;s allowance from ten to 15 hours per week. That will apply to very few people because most full-time carers in the home have neither the opportunity nor the energy to work even one hour per week outside the home. Caring for someone at home who needs attention due to physical or mental handicap, or old age, is a full-time job. Such carers are exhausted at the end <Col N="463"/>of the week through undertaking such full-time endeavours and, needless to say, they are unable to work outside the home.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister stated: &ldquo;This is a most significant budget for carers, not only in terms of expenditure on income supports from my Department but also in the realisation of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the proper recognition of carers and the delivering of the necessary structures and supports for carers and the people for whom they care.&rdquo; I ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised, including abolishing entirely the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance. If he does so, he will go down in history as being the Minister for Social and Family Affairs with the greatest approach to caring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Since the Minister&rsquo;s appointment to his current portfolio, he has listened to what is being said. He is not as arrogant as some of his Front Bench colleagues who have lost touch with the people as well as losing touch with their ministerial responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I praise the Minister&rsquo;s staff and compliment them on having saved taxpayers and the State a fortune in detecting social welfare fraud. The Minister and his officials issue annual reports which in recent years have shown that much money has been recovered through the detection of fraud in the social welfare system. I compliment those who work in that unit on saving the State and the taxpayers money. Social welfare fraudsters are taking money from those who need it most. While we do not like saying this to our constituents, taking welfare money under false pretences amounts to robbing taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I also compliment departmental officials on responding well when parliamentary questions are tabled in the D&aacute;il. One might have difficulties in getting through to some offices at times, but the officials generally do a good job in preparing replies to questions. I compliment them on performing well in this regard. We can be critical of officials sometimes because people may have to wait a long time for social welfare payments to which they are entitled. They should receive such payments as soon as possible. Most of the sections in the Minister&rsquo;s Department work well, however, in trying to get payments out as quickly as possible. They also deal with queries as swiftly as possible.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister and his officials to examine the issue of people who are refused unemployment assistance because it is assumed they are not searching for work, even though they provide evidence to the contrary. One person intends to take an action against the Department to Social and Family Affairs in this regard and I will support him. If he wants a financial subscription I will give it to him. Some such people are seeking their stamp money, but an official at the social welfare office may tell them they are not <Col N="464"/>actively seeking work, even though they might produce five or six letters from potential employers. In Ballina during the week I came across somebody who found it degrading to visit the social welfare office. They sought unemployment assistance and brought in proof that they were seeking work, but an official behind the desk said he was not satisfied that the person was actively looking for work.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that somebody is taking a case against the Department and I hope the judges will take a sympathetic approach to that person. The person felt they had been degraded, even though they had produced the necessary proof of seeking work. They felt so strongly about how they were treated that they are now planning to take a case to court. I wish them well and hope the Judiciary will not take the Government&rsquo;s side. It should take the side of the person who produces evidence of seeking work, even though someone behind a counter may say they were not doing so. I ask the Minister to examine this situation immediately. This is happening in County Mayo, although I do not know if it is due to a directive from the Minister or his Department. The taxpayer will have to pick up the tab in the end when this case comes to court. I compliment that person on taking the case. I am glad they have done so because it is wrong for someone behind a counter to act in that way just because they may not like the look of a person. There has been very little employment for a long time in the area to which I am referring, but any time employment came up that person accepted it.</P>
      <P>I will give the Minister another example, although when I wrote to him about it he did not do much about it. This concerned someone in my constituency who accepted a temporary job every time one came up. He is a temporary postman and hopes he will get that job on a full-time basis. He was not seeking unemployment assistance, but unemployment benefit, that is the money he paid into. He went to the social welfare office but was refused unemployment benefit and he is now going to appeal. I will accompany him to the appeal because I think any appeals officer will agree when he sees the record concerned &mdash; I sent the Minister his record. That person worked at every single opportunity a job came up. For the first time this year, however, his request for unemployment benefit was disallowed because it was deemed that he was not actively seeking work. His record proves, however, that he accepted job vacancies every time they arose.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a straight question. Has a new directive been issued from the Department whereby whether people have proof of seeking work, they are told they are not actively seeking work? If so, the Minister is only codding the system because people are going to the Health Service Executive where they are paid by the community welfare officer. Nine times out of ten, this money will have to be paid back so it amounts to one arm of the State paying another.</P><Col N="465"/>
      <P>People are upset and hurt, however, because they are being made to look foolish. I hope that if such a directive has been issued, the Minister will respond immediately by issuing another directive asking his officials to be fair to people who have tried to work when work was available. If somebody produces evidence of seeking work, such as a letter, social welfare officials should not say they are not satisfied. Who are they to say that from behind a counter?</P>
      <P>If I tabled a question to the Minister asking him to get a job for a particular person in Ballina, Westport or Castlebar, the reply would be that it is not the responsibility of the social welfare officer. Neither is it the responsibility of the social welfare officer, however, to make a judgment when somebody produces a letter stating that they have sought work. I know that the court case will be won, but I ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to deal with that quickly to prevent taxpayers from having to pay out to fight the case. It is not right. If someone enters the country with letters and shows that he or she is seeking work, that person should be paid immediately, unless it can be proven otherwise. I have no problem with action being taken in the case of a person working and drawing the benefit, but I am talking here about someone seeking work.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister granted generous increases. I listened to Deputies Penrose and McCormack, with whom I agree. We cannot be negative, and the budget contained some very positive things. The increases were generous and I would love to see more. I hope that the increases will be protected. I urge that local authorities should be allowed to take only a percentage of the increases that have been granted to people on social welfare. There is no point in their receiving &euro;14, &euro;16 or &euro;17 if local authorities take &euro;7, &euro;8 or &euro;9 from them in extra rent.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in his budget speech, reduced taxes on home heating oil. I will tell the Minister of two events that are not his responsibility but that of the Government. On Wednesday, when the Minister announced in the D&aacute;il that the Government was reducing the taxes on home heating oil, the oil companies increased the price. If that is not rip-off Ireland, I do not know what is. I know it is not the responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, but I ask the Government to investigate that immediately.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I received several telephone calls from constituents in my clinic who had contacted the oil companies and been told that they were not passing on any reductions that the Government had granted in taxation because of the rise in the price of oil. That is rip-off Ireland and there should be an immediate investigation. If the Government makes an effort to reduce taxes on home heating oil, that should be passed on. If last Wednesday the Government had raised taxes, on Thursday morning all the oil companies would <Col N="466"/>have erected new signs showing increases in their prices. Shame on the millionaires. The Minister and Government must act to protect the weaker of society and investigate the oil companies.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a direct question and I hope that he can answer me in his reply or that his officials will write to me directly. I had a constituent whose mother was very sick and who came home from America. The person is Irish, having been born and reared in Ireland and never cost the taxpayers of this country anything. The person returned to care for that sick mother.</P>

      <P>What is the situation regarding that Irish citizen, who was born in the State and went to America but returned to look after a sick mother? The person has property in America and has returned to care for that loved one until the mother either recovers or passes on. Is that person entitled to a carer&rsquo;s allowance? I thought when the regulation entered force that if one was an Irish citizen, it did not matter where one came from, since one was protected. I thought that the regulation was introduced regarding non-Irish citizens because people were entering the State. I would like the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great pleasure to address the budget&rsquo;s social welfare aspect. A few years ago when the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, was in the post, we came to the House to welcome an increase of approximately &euro;750 million and a massive budget. Last year, the figure was &euro;874 million, and this year <Col N="467"/>we have topped it again. I congratulate the Minister for obviously fighting his corner with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and selling the message that while others might say there was a great deal of money to start with, the important thing is how it is disbursed. It can be dissipated very quickly or spent well.</P>
      <P>It has been a pleasure to be in my constituency this week listening to older people and to the mothers and fathers of young children. A week before the budget, the message was that they would not be forgotten. The same was true of carers of people in the home. Perhaps every sector of society had something good to say about the budget, and many are embraced by the various schemes under the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I start by congratulating not only the Minister but his tremendous departmental staff. As a Member of the House, one is constantly trying to field constituents&rsquo; questions. The response, support, professionalism, speed, efficiency and courtesy afforded by every member of the Minister&rsquo;s staff with whom I have come into contact have been second to none. We would love to see that repeated everywhere. I do not mean to say there is no efficiency or courtesy in other Departments, but sometimes the speed is lacking. Perhaps the Minister should share his secret with them so that everyone might learn from the great facility that he has.</P>
      <P>The speed at which increases have been implemented has been improving for some years. I have been around the House long enough to remember when the increase in the price of petrol was increased at 4 p.m. and was on the pumps by 4.30 p.m. However, the increase in welfare payments was announced at 4 p.m. but not implemented until somewhere between June and September or October of the following year. It was difficult to sell the message that people would get an increase but not just yet. The concept that most increases take effect in January is an extremely important aspect of the announcement.</P>
      <P>The Bill will create some new and very welcome anomalies, for example, that of the pensioner who wishes to retain his or her old-age non-contributory pension and still work or potter about, depending how one sees it, for perhaps &euro;100. Such people will have to work out how to get their full pension, perhaps asking accountants to help them prove that their work is at a certain level. Perhaps before they were entitled only to a part pension and will now suffer the trauma of trying to get that information together to earn a full pension. However, I suspect that it is a trauma that most will be quite happy to encounter. It was a very interesting initiative to take on, since one meets many people who hit a certain age and for some reason are supposed to put their feet up. Life was supposed to stop for them. For many, whether they are involved in an interest or a small degree of serious work, that concept of <Col N="468"/>allowing a person to earn is important. It is a great contribution to their mental health and important for their ability to maintain social interaction. It also provides opportunities in communities to allow people who are still very much emotionally capable of doing something constructive to do so legitimately. If there was one thing in the budget with which I was very pleased, it was that new initiative.</P>
      <P>Another matter on which I had not really picked up until I started studying it is that the age limit for unemployment assistance and the supplementary welfare allowance has been brought down this year to 25. People living with their parents are not evaluated on their family income; they become an entity in their own right at that point. That narks many adults. Until recently people up to 30 years of age were still under the wing of their parents in that their parents&rsquo; income had a serious impact on them. I welcome the concept of reducing the age; 25 is the age recommended in the report that raised this issue but there is an argument that if it is reduced too low it will encourage people to take up unemployment assistance immediately when we should be encouraging them into employment. I welcome that measure.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a number of issues of concern. I welcome the significant increase in the fuel allowance. That record is played here in every budget debate because every euro of an increase had a serious implication on a national level. The fuel allowance is the only allowance that is not one of the free schemes and therefore there is no mechanism for appeal. I became aware of a person recently who was &euro;3 over the threshold and did not qualify for the allowance. She had no means of appeal because the allowance is not one of the free schemes and it was not an automatic entitlement. As this is a fuel allowance for people who are elderly, should there not be some mechanism whereby people can appeal on medical grounds? Perhaps a sliding scale could be introduced. The income limits have changed and that will cover the type of person I am talking about but it is like the two or three mile rule for school transport &mdash; there is always someone who is just that little too far away. I ask the Minister to examine that.</P>
      <P>I must raise an issue that is not strictly to do with the Bill. Cross-Border issues remain to be addressed. I am aware of two people who, unfortunately, were let go from the textile industry after 25 years and who have gone to the North to work. These two are in the same difficulty in that both of them, for various reasons and in different ways, became ill and find themselves out of the system again. They applied for unemployment benefit here but because their last income was earned in Northern Ireland, they were told they had to claim in Northern Ireland. When they tried to claim in Northern Ireland, however, they were told that because of a residency clause there they could not claim there. That anomaly exists <Col N="469"/>although I am aware that much good work is going on to try to address it. I bring that to the Minister&rsquo;s attention because it remains a problem.</P>
      <P>Child benefit and tax credit issues have arisen also for people who are employed. In that regard, I live in an area where people do not see the Border. They go where there is work and if there are impediments to facilitating that, it is worth examining them to see if they can be overcome.</P>
      <P>On the back to education allowance, the focus is to provide an incentive to return to education, particularly to lone parents, because we all know education is the key to a better life. Is the Minister in a position to talk to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, regarding the recognition of NVQ courses, particularly in the North? That is another of my North-South issues. Many people go to the North to do NVQ courses but because they are not HNDs, they are not recognised for educational grant aid purposes. They are not eligible for any of the back to education grants, although I may be wrong about that. I am aware they are unable to get grant aid for the NVQs because it is not recognised as a high enough achievement but it is important that people who left school early and want to get back into education are given every opportunity to do that. If people want to get off the dole and back to education, we should try to do something to help them help themselves.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy McCormack strongly raise the issue of the home help service because the day after the budget the T&aacute;naiste announced a significant improvement in that regard. Trying to help the elderly, which the Minister has done in the social welfare aspect of the budget, embraces all those issues including the need to keep people at home and allow their carers to be in a position where they can afford to look after them.</P>
      <P>Community employment schemes are doing tremendous work in many areas but in that regard it is a case of congratulating the Minister for reducing the number of people who are on the double, so to speak. Some CE schemes are finding it difficult to get enough people to take up the schemes to keep them in operation. There should be a stronger link between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and F&Aacute;S because word has got out that if one does not turn up, nothing will happen. Some of those running the schemes say they do not want people to be forced to take up community employment because they will just work against the system but in my first years as a Member of the D&aacute;il I spent most of my time trying to find ways of helping people get out of taking up a scheme because they had a bad back, arm or whatever. Some of those cases worked and others did not but it was uncanny that within a short period, the number of people who were fighting to stay on the scheme had increased. The letters <Col N="470"/>written to try to get people off schemes became letters asking that they be kept on for a few more years. There is still an issue. If the unemployment level in a particular area is high and a CE scheme is in jeopardy, why are more questions not asked about it?</P>
      <P>The Minister has made changes to the back to work allowance but I want to voice one concern in that regard. I am aware of many people who worked in the electrical or plumbing trades &mdash; it is generally the trades &mdash; for the past 15, 20 or 25 years who used to employ people but the back to work allowance has encouraged some people to set up business on their own. Because they are getting a back to work payment they are able to undercut the person who has been in employment for a considerable length of time. Some people call that competition but others call it something else. I am not against it but a balance needs to be struck. We do not want any displacement or unfair competition whereby a person getting an allowance can undercut another person by &euro;50 or &euro;100 in a contract. Those are the types of issues arising. It is difficult to pick holes in this particular issue and that is the reason I am going slightly outside it.</P>
      <P>A total of 1.5 million people will benefit from the improvements in the Bill and while many of the improvements are for the elderly and the very young, the ones for the unemployed are welcome. Constituencies like mine that have taken a severe hit from the textile industry would rather not have to consider the vista of checking to see how much the social welfare allowances have increased. The fact they have been increased by four times the rate of inflation is welcome. I encourage the Minister to help the interdepartmental working group which is examining the issue of the response to the job losses in Donegal. This would mean I could look for tax cuts in the next budget rather than increases in unemployment assistance. The people of Donegal are quite proud. Factories which are closing have received Labour Court recommendations and we hope they will be able to make redundancy payments above the statutory minimum.</P>
      <P>We are fed up talking about issues relating to statutory redundancy payments and want to discuss employment issues instead. I welcome the increases in payments for people who cannot get jobs and the incentives to boost people&rsquo;s participation in the workforce. I like to think that the Minister supports the work of the interdepartmental working group dealing with Donegal.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase of more than &euro;26 in the carer&rsquo;s allowance, which brings it to &euro;200 per week. Some commentators have argued that the fact that carers are allowed to work for 15 hours per week instead of ten and still qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance and benefit or the respite care grant is not a cause for great excitement. However, not all carers can be grouped in the same category and if a person needs and has the <Col N="471"/>ability to work for ten or 15 hours per week, he or she should be allowed to do so. My own experience is that a change is as good as a rest. An ability and a wish to do something different should be commended. I understand that this is the highest payment yet and it has been recognised that carers are the first group to receive it. This is a very important signal from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, introduced the respite care grant payment, which was one of the most significant measures in the 1999 budget. I know the difficulty experienced by elderly carers who look after middle-aged relatives. The respite care grant gives a break to people who do not want to unburden themselves of their caring responsibilities and it has significantly helped this group.</P>
      <P>The major changes relating to families are very important. There appears to be a rush of births and one would think people inside the D&aacute;il had insider information. Deputy Kelleher and my constituency colleague have had good news in this regard. I do not know if Deputy Naughten has made an announcement but he showed an interest on the Order of Business in the length of maternity leave. However, I am not insinuating anything. There has been justified focus on looking after young children.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for Education and Science is present because I have a request to make of her and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I am sure Deputy Stanton is fed up listening to me argue that young children develop more quickly when they are exposed to the arts.</P>

	<P>It would be wonderful if these two Ministers could devise a scheme as clever as many of those in this Bill, direct it towards young families and expose children to the arts, particularly music, at the youngest possible age. Such a scheme could be run in conjunction with Lifestart. They would capitalise on something that is worthwhile and would give children the best opportunity to develop their language skills, co-ordination and socialisation &mdash; matters which are crucial to their later development. We spend a considerable amount of money later in life trying to rectify matters that should have been tackled when children were under six.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides a considerable degree of support for many people. I would like to see the continuation of the support for the very young and artistic interventions in my constituency. I hope there will be less dependence on unemployment assistance in constituencies such as mine and that they will seek tax cuts rather than social welfare payments so that people will have more money in their pockets. I commend this Bill and the work of the Minister and his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Perry. I welcome the increases in this Bill and the contribution by Deputy Keaveney because some of the Government backbenchers did nothing but speak about the wonderful measures in this budget. Deputy Keaveney is correct in highlighting the problems that exist and the rest of the House should follow her lead. We should give credit where it is due and raise issues that must be dealt with because no matter what advances we make, problems still arise that bedevil Border constituencies which have suffered over recent years.</P>
      <P>I thank staff in social welfare offices who are very helpful. Their time management is not always as good as it could be but they are certainly very constructive and helpful.</P>
      <P>I spoke to an individual who deals with F&Aacute;S schemes who raised the fact that a person receiving unemployment benefit will not receive the benefits of this budget before Christmas while a person on unemployment assistance will receive the benefits. I accept that unemployment benefit is a short-term payment but people receiving it have paid their PRSI contributions and feel very aggrieved that they do not get the same benefits as someone on unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Fuel costs are another major issue. Elderly people and people with disabilities spend a considerable amount of time at home and need heating on a year-round basis. I welcome the increase in the fuel allowance in the budget but it is despicable that the oil companies stated the next day that there would be no decrease in fuel bills because of an increase in costs. This practice is a rip-off and must be addressed. With regard to the poverty trap, it does not make sense for people receiving rent supplement to get jobs unless they are very well paid.</P>
      <P>The increases in pensions are very important. However, a section of the population lives in rented accommodation and it is important we ensure that county councils and town councils do not devour these increases by increasing their rents in February. This despicable practice took place last year. In these circumstances, people are left worse off then ever.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Free travel is a great benefit but the Minister should remember that there are no trains and a very limited bus service in constituencies such as mine, Cavan-Monaghan. It would help if the Minister produced a voucher scheme that would allow people who need to travel to a doctor or hospital to do so because Health Service Executive areas do not have the money to pay for such a scheme. People in these areas hold free travel passes but are forced to use their pensions to pay travel costs. A case from last year involved a woman from Rockcorry in County Monaghan who was forced to use a considerable portion of her pension to travel to Cavan every fortnight.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement should be extended to the self-employed. Farmers have farm assist <Col N="473"/>but shopkeepers and other self-employed individuals no longer have an income supplement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this issue a few months ago. The MacBride community nursing home in Westport, County Mayo, got planning permission for an extension. The nursing home has 49 full-time residents and 20 to 25 day patients. I compliment the matron and the staff on the excellent job they do. This badly needed extension is for the extra services that they want to provide, but also for the extra beds for people in the adjoining area who need full-time care in the home.</P>
        <P>We are not talking about a lot of money, only &euro;1.6 million. Last week, a major announcement was made in the subvention of home care packages and we were told that plenty of money would be made available for the elderly. Tonight, I hope the Minister will tell me that the MacBride nursing home will get funding for the extension that it badly needs. The staff are working under difficult circumstances. There is a health and safety aspect regarding the equipment in the home and it is time that the funding was provided for this facility. The facility is well used, as is the day care facility that is part of the home. The staff are doing an excellent job, but the funding needs to be put in place to provide the badly needed facility. I hope the Government will make that money available immediately. The planning has been done and the staff are still working under difficult circumstances. I raised this a number of months ago and I am disappointed that the money was not provided. The staff are disappointed and the people of Westport are disappointed, as are the patients who have their names on waiting lists.</P>
        <P>There seems to be a new onus on community care organisations within the county. The first thing that happens when elderly people wish to go into a home is that they are handed a subvention form. They are forced to go outside their area and into private nursing homes. This is a publicly built nursing home and it has been very successful. The people in and around Westport like it and it is badly needed. The necessary funding is required for the extension so that the required equipment can be put in place and the extra services can be delivered. In the overall context of the health budget, &euro;1.6 million is a very small amount of money but it is needed for this project so that the people can continue the excellent work they are doing in this nursing home.</P>

	<P>I am replying on behalf of my col<Col N="474"/>league, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The Government has made services for older people a priority and is fully committed to the development of a comprehensive health service which is capable of responding quickly, fully and effectively to the health service needs of older people. An investment package of an additional &euro;150 million has been put in place for 2006 and 2007, which is the largest ever increase in funding for such services and is evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to develop such services. The investment package is focused on caring for people in the community and is a major step in focusing new resources on home and community care, while still supporting appropriate residential care.</P>
        <P>Day care centres are recognised as an important service in the continuum of care necessary to support older people to remain living at home and to support their carers. This is clearly shown by the fact that &euro;9 million of the &euro;150 million investment package is dedicated to day care and respite services. Day care centres provide older people in the area with a facility where they can meet new friends and enjoy recreational activities, promoting social contact among older people with the intention of preventing loneliness. They also provide a break for carers as well as social and physical stimulation in a safe environment for the older members of the local community. Older people deserve first class facilities and recent years have seen dramatic changes in both the concept and practice of services for older people, and enormous strides have been made, and continue to be made in developing a comprehensive, community-based service that is integrated with other health services.</P>
        <P>MacBride community nursing unit is a 40 bed Health Service Executive western area facility located in Westport, County Mayo. The existing services include residential, respite, day care, physiotherapy and occupational therapy outreach services. The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services, including its capital programme. The progression of the proposed day care centre at the MacBride nursing unit is therefore a matter for the HSE.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that the project involves the construction of an extension to the unit to cater for day care services due to the ever-increasing demand for this service. It has also advised that it has cost &euro;20,000 to bring the project to the planning stage, exclusive of upgrading works to the existing nursing unit, and that the total cost of the finished project would be in the region of &euro;1.01 million. The HSE has also advised that this project is included in category two capital projects for 2006, which means that the project <Col N="475"/>is at design stage and it is included as a priority in the HSE&rsquo;s 2006 capital plan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise a matter on the adjournment which is very close to my heart. It concerns the 35 Dairygold workers who are on strike in Mallow. They are being forced to accept the minimum wage, which is nearly half their existing wage packet. This is not acceptable to me, nor to the vast majority of the community. Dairygold workers have suffered heavily in the past few years as 1,000 jobs have been lost. Many workers have been forced to accept this in other sectors of society. When Deputy Martin took over as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, he came to the rescue of Dairygold workers in my area. If he was there at the beginning, when this rationalisation programme was being put in place, there would have been a different outcome. He has an understanding of the need for the working people and this is about passion rather than economics.</P>
        <P>Globalisation is mentioned. Globalisation is a new form of communism. It is a right wing way of doing things and that is part of the problem. There is outsourcing and many workers have suffered due to that. I come from a party that always represented the middle ground in Irish society and life. The same situation is evident in Irish Ferries. In my area, it is not good enough. North Cork has been destroyed by this organisation, which is the economic driver of the area. This is a bread and butter issue and these people cannot accept this level of wages. I ask for the intervention of the Labour Court or some labour organisation that can identify the problem and sort it out.</P>
        <P>This organisation recently lost approximately &pound;20 million when it purchased Aeron Valleys in Wales. Must we ask the workers of north Cork to pay for this error of judgment in the investment strategy of this organisation? What effect does the 1990 labour Act have on this organisation? The workers told me that they cannot picket other businesses because of that Act. These include Galtee Foods, the bottled milk division, the consumer food division and the feed division, working within one organisation. I am not aware that the 1990 Act put any impediment in place where people cannot picket legally wherever they like. They have been told that they cannot go to the gate of the other areas. In the balance sheet of the company for 2004, the management was proud to boast that it reduced the payroll by 19.5% against the background of the national wage agreements. That is a good boast, but it is not good enough for me. It also consolidated two cheese plants into one, a further saving of the workforce. This is a sad scene.</P>
        <P>Dairygold is about to be privatised. Does the management want to go on the stock market at <Col N="476"/>the expense of its workforce? That will make the rich richer and the poor poorer. The management will go off with many millions in options, while the ordinary worker will be left with little or nothing. They will be offered a pittance in the share adjuster. This is not good enough in Irish society, nor in the party to which I belong. I ask that action be taken.</P>
        <P>Irish workers are now the pawns of globalisation and outsourcing is rife in all sections of industry in this country. This is not good enough and it is a matter for Government to look after its people and all sectors of society. We are dealing with human beings.</P>
        <P>We are approaching Christmas and the festive season. I want this matter of Dairygold to be sorted out. I ask for the immediate intervention of Mr. Kieran Mulvey and the Labour Relations Commission to put this matter right. The Dairygold organisation is at fault here, not the workforce. I met the workforce on Sunday and I was appalled at what I was told. I am not from a trade union background, but I am from a background of fair play and honesty and that is what I seek.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, for taking this Adjournment debate. I am proud that a Cabinet Minister is present. In her short time in the Department of Education and Science she has made a serious impact on that sector of Government. In her reply I hope she will use her influence in helping the workers in my area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe for his comments. I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>I should put on record the fact that the Minister does not have a direct role in the resolution of this or similar disputes. I can, however, understand Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s concerns about the restructuring proposals at the Dairygold Co-Operative Society Limited milk powder plant in Mallow where the company has announced that 35 full-time positions will be affected from January 2006. From then, work will only be available on a seasonal basis for these staff. It has been reported that the company&rsquo;s proposals for the Mallow plant could result in a reduction in the number of working weeks per worker to between 26 and 30 weeks per year. The milk powder plant at Mallow is one of three operated by Dairygold. The other two are located at Mitchelstown and Mogeely.</P>
        <P>Dairygold Co-Operative is one of the major employers in the south and is Ireland&rsquo;s largest farmer owned food company and multi-purpose agribusiness. As well as dairy production, its business interests include meat processing, animal feed manufacture, grain trading, the supply of farm inputs and the provision of farm services, including animal breeding and livestock marketing. It also provides retail services. Dairygold Co-<Col N="477"/>Op employs approximately 2,000 people and has an annual turnover in excess of &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>The union claims that management tried to introduce new shift arrangements in November, four weeks ahead of schedule. When the workers continued to work the old shift pattern, they were issued with written warnings and a number of workers were suspended. SIPTU served seven days&rsquo; notice of industrial action on the company. At meetings up to and including 6 December 2005 with the company and SIPTU, the Labour Relations Commission succeeded in facilitating the resolution of some of the issues in dispute and others were referred to the Labour Court. On 6 December, the Labour Relations Commission made proposals for the resolution of some of the outstanding issues in dispute between the parties. I understand that both the company and the trade union representatives agreed to recommend the LRC proposals to senior management and their members, respectively. However, the SIPTU members rejected elements of the proposals and industrial action began on Thursday last, 8 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The Labour Relations Commission has continued to maintain contact with the parties and has invited both sides to conciliation talks to explore ways of resolving the outstanding issues. I understand that the LRC is meeting the parties in Mallow this evening to seek a resolution of the outstanding issues. I encourage both sides to engage constructively with the LRC in an effort to find a resolution to the dispute.</P>
        <P>The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature. For cases where the parties have failed to find a solution to outstanding issues, however, the State provides the dispute settling machinery of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. The experience and expertise of these services are available to the parties. Ultimately however, responsibility for the resolution of issues in dispute lies with the parties concerned.</P>

      <sTitle>Residential Institutions Redress Scheme.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue and thank the Minister for Education and Science for being here to respond to the debate. She will be aware that this issue has been raised by a number of Deputies by way of parliamentary questions and on the Order of Business. Today on the Order of Business, three Opposition party leaders raised the issue of Ms Marie Therese O&rsquo;Loughlin who is outside Leinster House on this very cold night. She has been out there for the past two months because she strongly believes that the institution she was placed in, namely, the Morning Star mother and baby home, should be included in the Residential Institutions Redress Act.</P>
        <P>I realise that the window of opportunity is very short and that the deadline is this coming Friday, but I ask the Minister to take a final look at the <Col N="478"/>two particular institutions I refer to in my Adjournment motion, namely, Bethany Home and Morning Star. I know a few others have been brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention and mine as well. If the Minister decides to introduce a further order under the Schedule, I can assure her the Opposition will facilitate her fully before the end of this session. I understand the redress board has the power to extend its time should it need to.</P>
        <P>The Minister has said she believes it is not legally possible to add these institutions. However, I again ask her to take a final look, because section 4(1) of the Act says:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Minister may, by order, provide for the insertion in the <i>Schedule</i> of any industrial school, reformatory school, orphanage, children&rsquo;s home, special school which was established for the purpose of providing education services to children with a physical or . . . mental disability or mental illness in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I understand the reason the Minister says these institutions cannot be included is that there was no evidence of inspection or regulation. However, I understand that a function does not necessarily mean there has to be evidence. There could, however, be a power, duty or function that did not necessarily have actual evidence of inspection. When we were debating the matter of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, there was evidence that the Department of Education and Science did not have full records. There may have been documents in the Department that could not be found when the commission was doing its work. I suggest that just because records were not found does not mean that there was not a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <P>I find it hard to believe that the Morning Star mother and baby home was never inspected by any arm of the State, and similarly with the Bethany home. I believe there may have been evidence of inspection and I do not know whether any has been given to the Minister. Should anything be produced or if the Minister might be able to accept that there could have been a function, I ask her, even at this late stage, to include these institutions.</P>
        <P>Another home that was brought to my attention was a residential one in Kill o&rsquo; the Grange. I understand people have initiated High Court proceedings and were placed in this particular institution by the relevant health board. That suggests the State had a direct hand in that institution. As for the Morning Star, people moved from that institution to Goldenbridge, which is included under the Schedule. People from Bethany home moved to the Smiley homes which are included as well under the Schedule. It seems that if those institutions are included, surely the feeder institutions could be.</P><Col N="479"/>
        <P>Two other pieces of legislation might indicate the State had a function. One dates from before the foundation of the State, namely, the Children&rsquo;s Act 1908, section 25 of which says:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Secretary of State may cause any institution for the reception of poor children ... supported wholly or partly by voluntary contributions, and not liable to be inspected by or under the authority of any Government department, to be visited and inspected from time to time by persons appointed by him for the purpose[.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">That legislation, which presumably could still have been used, seems to indicate that even where an institution was not directly listed or funded, perhaps, by the State, it could still be inspected. Similarly, the Registration of Maternity Homes Act 1934 suggests that mother and baby homes could have been inspected by the State as well. At this late stage I ask the Minister to reconsider, particularly in respect of the two institutions I refer to but also in respect of any others that might be relevant.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan for raising this matter. Every Member of the House will share the concern that anybody is sleeping outside Leinster House as a protest on these terrible evenings. It is not easy to resolve the issue, unfortunately. If it had been, it would have been done long ago. A number of people, including myself, spoke to Marie Therese and I explained the situation to her. The Department took the opportunity recently to double check in light of issues raised in the House by way of parliamentary questions, on the Adjournment tonight and on the Order of Business, whether anything had been missed. However, the situation remains that there is no evidence of the State&rsquo;s role in this home and it is therefore not possible to include it in the legislation.</P>
        <P>I will set out the background to the case. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position. The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides a statutory scheme of financial redress for persons who, as children, were abused while in residential institutional care. The scheme applies in respect of institutions specified in the Schedule to the Act and the Act allows a three-year period for submission of applications to the board. This three-year period ends this Thursday, 15 December 2005. I again urge potential applicants to the board to ensure their applications are submitted prior to that date. Applications will be accepted up to midnight on 15 December 2005. To date the board has received approximately 12,000 applications and has made approximately 4,500 offers of awards at a cost of &euro;332 million. My Department is making arrangements to extend the terms of office of the members of the board and the review committee <Col N="480"/>for a further period of two years to allow the board to deal with the remaining applications.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Act provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, insert additional institutions in the Schedule to the Act. This section is quite specific in relation to the type of institutions which can be considered for inclusion. The institution concerned must be an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a children&rsquo;s home, a special school for children with a physical or intellectual disability or a hospital providing medical or psychiatric services to people with a physical or mental disability or mental illness. It must also be one in which children were placed and resided and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <P>A total of 128 institutions were originally listed on the Schedule as enacted in April 2002. Since enactment of the legislation, my Department has been contacted by individuals and-or solicitors in relation to a large number of institutions not specified in the Schedule. Following consideration of the matter and consultation with the relevant bodies, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further order was made on 1 July 2005, adding three institutions to the Schedule. This demonstrates we were all anxious to ensure that as many of the institutions as possible would be included on the list, in the interests of those who had suffered abuse while living in them.</P>
        <P>The redress scheme applies to industrial schools, reformatory schools and other such institutions for children where the State&rsquo;s duty of care arose from the fact that the children were separated from their families and were placed and resident in institutions over which the State had a regulatory or supervisory responsibility. On the two facilities specified in the Deputy&rsquo;s motion I make the follows points.</P>
        <P>My Department was requested to place the Regina Coeli hostel on the Schedule of the Act. As hostels do not satisfy the terms of section 4 it is not possible to consider the placement of this facility on the Schedule. When this was explained, a further request was received regarding an institution called the Morning Star mother and baby home at the same address as the Regina Coeli hostel but described as a separate unit from the hostel. Officials from my Department raised the matter with their counterparts at the Department of Health and Children and other relevant bodies. No records were identified to indicate that the State was responsible for this home or unit. The majority of these types of homes were privately operated and not subject to State inspection or regulation. As a consequence, it is not possible to give further consideration to the inclusion of the Morning Star mother and baby home or unit in the Schedule.</P>
        <P>The Regina Coeli hostel was established by the Legion of Mary in 1930 to provide shelter for <Col N="481"/>homeless women, with or without children. A person who stayed at the hostel did so on a voluntary basis and usually paid a small fee for the accommodation.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Bethany home, my Department has consulted the Department of Health and Children and no records have been identified to indicate that it was responsible for inspecting or regulating the facility. As a consequence, I trust the Deputy will appreciate that it is not open to consider further the placement of either of these facilities on the Schedule as it has not been established in the first instance that a State party was responsible for the care of the residents at these homes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The reality is there probably was no responsibility. People today still highlight the fact that there are not sufficient inspection facilities and they are talking about 50 years later. It was a different time. I assure the House if there was evidence of the State having placed people in these institutions or of having an inspection role, I would have liked and wanted to have them included in the interests of the people who were abused in them, or who believe they were abused in them. The lack of evidence means there is nothing to indicate the State had that role as set out in the legislation. At this stage it is not possible and it is not proposed to add further institutions to the Schedule.</P>

	<P>I wish to share one minute of my time with Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an tAire anseo anocht. Ba mhaith liom bheith &aacute;balta an t-&aacute;bhar seo a phl&eacute; as Gaeilge ach n&iacute;l an Ghaeilge go fl&uacute;irseach agam agus t&aacute; n&aacute;ire orm mar sin. I am disappointed I cannot address the matter as Gaeilge but the opportunity I was given to learn Irish was not as good as the opportunity given to the children to whom I will refer.</P>
        <P>This matter is an interesting case on which I hope the Minister will be able to shed some light. I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for allowing me to raise it and I am delighted the Minister is in the House.</P>
        <P>A developer in Midleton in east Cork has offered to supply a site and build a school for the Gaelscoil in Midleton. The overall cost is estimated at &euro;2.5 million. He proposes to hand the school over to the Department or the school as the case may be. This proposal has been made for some time. The Minister considered this matter last June and a letter stating that the Minister was making investigations was sent on 11 November <Col N="482"/>2005. The school is very anxious that a decision is made. I am not sure of the role of the Department. The school is enlisting the help and advice of the Department rather than requesting money. It wishes to build a school that is up to specification.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school is very successful, with 201 students and ten teachers, rising to 11 next year. It is housed in a community centre which leaves a lot to be desired. The building is reaching saturation point with no more room for additional students. There are broken floorboards and dangerous entry and exit areas. Deputy Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe and I visited it last evening and we can vouch for the conditions. Corridors are narrow, there are poor toilet facilities and no staff toilets. There is a lack of storage areas for coats, bins, etc. The stairways are unsuitable for small children; there are steps between the classrooms and there is no proper outdoor play area. A local council field is used in dry weather but this is often not suitable because teenagers are using the field while the children are playing. There is no running water in three of the classrooms or in the staff room which is shared with the learning support teacher and the resource teacher. The office area is too small. The Minister&rsquo;s Department is paying &euro;78,000 in rent per annum.</P>
        <P>The OPW has been looking for a site for a school in the area for some time but without success. This seems to be a golden opportunity. Has the Department a role? Can the Minister support this project in some way or other without further delay? Will she ask her staff to advise the school management and the developer as to whether they are doing the right thing? They will supply play areas. The school will be a fantastic amenity in a growing area. In this case the developer is providing this school free of charge in the middle of a housing development. I hope the Minister will have some news.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. N. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to be here to discuss this matter with my colleague in east Cork, Deputy Stanton, on the opposite side. We met the school authorities last night, Rev. Cannon and the principal of the school, and they put before us the proposals which I discussed with the Minister this afternoon. She was quite helpful to me in her initial consideration of the matter. It is a unique situation where a developer, who is a friend of mine from Mallow, County Cork, is prepared to invest heavily in the Midleton area and, as Deputy Stanton said, invest &euro;2.5 million in a new school. East Cork has many Gaelscoileanna which have been provided by the Government. There is a new school in Mallow, a fine refurbished school in Fermoy, new schools in Cobh, Youghal and Fermoy. Midleton is the only one outstanding of the six large towns in the constituency.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the Minister, who has such a great knowledge of Irish, is so fluent in it and has such love for it, will provide for this school in <Col N="483"/>Midleton. It well deserves her attention. As a result of the explosion in numbers the school will have 11 teachers on the payroll for the school year 2006-07. I do not want to labour the issue, but as Deputy Stanton said, the school is in the community hall through the goodwill of the community in Midleton. The Minister, Deputy Martin, provided the licence for that and it was through my intervention some years ago that the existing facility was set up, but it is no longer suitable, as the Minister understands. Both I and Deputy Stanton, who has taken an interesting position on this, look forward to her reply. I am confident that as a result of the Minister&rsquo;s role in education and what she has demonstrated this evening we will have success and that she will accept this unique offer of a developer, probably one of the first in the country outside of Dublin.</P>

        <P>The school in question is hugely successful as was outlined by the Deputies, having been granted permanent recognition in 2001 following its provisional recognition in 1999. Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe said the school will have 11 full-time teachers next year. It currently has a principal, eight mainstream teachers and two special education needs teachers. Enrolment has increased rapidly to the current level of 200 pupils. The rental cost of the Midleton community centre is grant-aided by the Department at the rate of 95%.</P>
        <P>We acknowledge the need of this school and other Gaelscoileanna for permanent accommodation. In recognition of this we asked the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which deals with the acquisition of sites for new schools on behalf of my Department, to set about acquiring a site for the Midleton school. The normal procedure is that when a suitable site is identified and acquired by the OPW, the building project required to provide permanent accommodation for the school in question is considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme at the appropriate time. This process will apply in respect of Gaelscoil Mainistir na Corr&aacute;n unless a more appropriate alternative solution is put in place.</P>
        <P>In this regard officials in my Department have been made aware through the school authority &mdash; Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe has given me documentation on <Col N="484"/>it also &mdash; of an offer from a local developer to provide a site and construct a 16-classroom school for Gaelscoil Mainistir na Corr&aacute;n at no cost to the Gaelscoil or my Department. Obviously my Department is very willing to discuss and clarify the precise position in this regard and establish the exact details of the offer. Such altruism is very rare. We are anxious to flesh out the details.</P>
        <P>Additional information on this proposal has been requested from the school authority and while a response has recently been received, it does not fully address all the queries raised. I understand that the development company has sought a meeting with the school authority with a view to progressing the proposal further and I expect that the school authority will then provide more details on what is proposed following that meeting. When a document detailing the exact proposal is provided to the Department of Education and Science it will receive urgent consideration.</P>
        <P>The Department does not have any objection to the school engaging with the developer in the provision of accommodation if there is clearly no cost to either the Gaelscoil or the Department. However, the fact that the Department has been consulted in this regard indicates that this may not be the situation. If State funding is required the Department must be satisfied that public procurement procedures and other regulations are fully observed in the context of any such proposal and that the prioritisation criteria in place is not usurped.</P>
        <P>I see the Deputies shaking their heads so I am very interested in hearing the responses to the questions raised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are also legal issues to be explored and addressed with regard to the ultimate ownership of such a site. If this goes ahead as indicated, who would own the site and the building? Those issues must be sorted out.</P>
        <P>I assure Deputies Stanton and O&rsquo;Keeffe that my Department is committed to working closely with the school authorities and would welcome an opportunity to achieve a permanent accommodation solution which will meet the school&rsquo;s needs into the future. I will give any proposal in that regard due consideration. I suggest the Deputies ask the school to address the issues raised by the building unit of the Department so that we can progress this issue.</P>

        <Quest>the value of investment undertaken in 2004 and to date in 2005 under PPP, distinguishing those involving tolling; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>On the basis of the information available to me, the following is the position in regard to privately financed PPP projects being procured under the multi-annual capital envelope investment framework and by the NRA in the roads area. For the years in question, I am informed that the estimated level of capital construction investment in privately financed PPP projects, to be paid for by means of ongoing unitary payments from Departments&rsquo; Votes, was &euro;25.6 million in 2004 and is projected to be &euro;25 million in 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to PPPs funded by user charges, the Department of Transport informs me that the NRA has advised that private investment in roads amounted to &euro;160 million in 2004. The NRA also advised that the estimated total private investment to end 2005 is &euro;137 million. In addition, there are a wide range of PPP projects being procured by local government, in the solid waste, water-wastewater and social housing sectors, which are not comprehended in these figures. Such projects can take a number of forms, including design, build and operate or design, build and finance, and involve land swaps, own resources, some Exchequer funding or a mix of these.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While deal flow has been established in the roads area and in the local government sector, progress was slower than anticipated in the area of PPPs funded by unitary payments from Departments&rsquo; Votes. There are a variety of reasons for this but, principally, the need for specialised skills and capability to manage the process was identified as a key factor. Accordingly, the Government decided in July to establish a centre of expertise in the National Development Finance Agency to accelerate progress in developing PPP deal flow in the central Government area. These new arrangements will not <Col N="486"/>apply to the roads and rails sectors where existing procurement arrangements in place will continue.</P>

	<P>Capital allowances are available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction of certain qualifying private hospitals. Currently, the expenditure can be written off over seven years at the rate of 15% per annum over the first six years and 10% in year seven. Capital allowances for private hospitals is one of the many reliefs which underwent a detailed review by my Department in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners with the help of external consultants. I announced in my budget speech that I propose to publish all the relevant reports reviewing these various tax reliefs in time for the Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>The final report from the consultants has been received by my Department. With regard to the private hospital incentive, the consultants found while there has not been a high level of investment yet under this scheme, there are plans for a number of these facilities coming on line. The consultants stated that the incentive has the potential to contribute to the challenges facing the health sector. The consultants recommend the continuance of the scheme subject to some amendments, including an extension of the clawback period and a new option for investors to claim all relief in year one but at a restricted 50% rate. In line with the recommendations from the consultants, I have decided to maintain this allowance with some minor amendments which I will announce in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>At present, to qualify as a private hospital eligible for capital allowances, the hospital must, <i>inter alia</i>, provide five specialist services from a list of 14 potential services ranging from oncology to paediatric services. This list will be augmented to include psychiatric care services, as announced in the budget. In addition, the current scheme of capital allowances for private hospitals will be extended to provide for capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private psychiatric hospitals. While the hospital will provide services to private patients, 20% of the bed capacity must be available for public patients and the hospital must provide a discount of at least 10% to the State in respect of the fees to be charged in respect of the treatment of these patients.</P>
        <P>The new scheme is subject to clearance by the European Commission from an EU state aids <Col N="487"/>perspective. Full details will be announced in the Finance Bill 2006.</P>

	<P>The duty free allowances for purchases for personal consumption of goods by persons entering the State from outside the European Union are set down in EU legislation, Council Directive 69/169/EEC. Therefore, the same passenger allowances apply across all EU member states. These thresholds were last increased in March 1994.</P>
        <P>For alcohol, tobacco and perfume the allowances are set at certain amounts of the goods in question, while for all other goods, there is a aggregate limit of &euro;175 per adult. In the case of these duty free allowances it should be borne in mind that there are three tax or duty types involved, namely, customs, excise and VAT. From a fiscal viewpoint, the allowances on alcohols and tobacco products are the most sensitive and, therefore, tightly controlled.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission is currently examining the issue of the allowance limits and is expected to issue a proposal early next year. As regards the current monetary limit on goods subject to customs duty and VAT on importation, it has not been increased since 1994 and comes under pressure faced with the rising value of goods. In these circumstances, I would not regard a reasonable upward adjustment in the current monetary allowance as unwelcome. However, in this regard we need also to have regard to the concerns of member states bordering non-EU countries.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners maintain an enforcement presence at all the principal points of entry to the State for the purpose of checking compliance with the limits to these duty free allowances. Officers perform checks on both accompanied and unaccompanied luggage or baggage on a selective basis using intelligence and risk assessment methods. In performing such tasks, a balance must, of course, be struck between the need for enforcing controls and not imposing undue burdens on passengers arriving in this country. In the circumstances, the Revenue Commissioners do not consider the enforcement of the allowance limits unduly difficult or onerous.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the introduction of capital gains tax in 1975, capital gains have been treated differently from income in the tax code. It should be stressed that, in many cases, capital gains arise infrequently, as the asset is normally held by the owner for several years prior to the transfer. If taxed like income, it would mean taxing a large part of the once-off capital gain in many cases at the top rate of<?oasys _jy?>42%, whereas if it had been received as income over the period in question, much of it might only have been taxed at the 20% rate per annum or even be exempt.</P>
        <P>Income tax is charged at progressive rates and individuals are entitled to various reliefs and credits which reduce their effective rate of tax. As the Deputy will be aware, I announced increases in the employee tax credit and the personal tax credit in the recent budget. This ensures that almost 36% of workers will be outside the tax net while about 31% will only be liable at the standard rate of 20%. In addition, it must be noted that there is a low annual personal exemption threshold of &euro;1,270 for capital gains tax as compared to the various relief and credit entitlements for income tax. Accordingly, having regard to the effect of the personal tax credits, the tax on income is, in the majority of cases, likely to be less than the tax on capital gains.</P>
        <P>Capital gains tax is charged on a disposal of assets, for example, shares, land, buildings. The disposal can be by way of sale, gift or exchange. It does not apply on death. A lower rate of capital gains tax encourages owners to dispose of assets during their lifetime. This has definitely occurred since the rate was lowered from 40% to 20% for most disposals in the 1998 budget and for the remainder of disposals in the 2000 budget.</P>
        <P>Since the rate of CGT has been reduced, the yield has increased enormously. The yield from capital gains tax rose from &euro;106 million in 1996 to nearly &euro;2 billion in 2005 and the estimated number of assessments issued by the Revenue Commissioners rose from 7,000 in 1996 to 32,000 in 2003.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 216 together.</P><Col N="489"/>
        <P>The second public service pay agreement under Sustaining Progress provides that the public service benchmarking body will commence the next benchmarking review in the second half of 2005 to report in the second half of 2007. The Department of Finance and other public service employers have been in discussion with the public services committee of ICTU on the membership of the body and on the terms of reference since earlier this year. As provided for under Sustaining Progress, the parties consider that the body should seek to ensure the optimum level of transparency consistent with the efficient and effective operation of the process itself. Progress has been made and it is expected that the body will be established shortly. The terms of reference and the list of grades to be examined will, I expect, be broadly similar to the last exercise.</P>
        <P>Since the body will not report until the second half of 2007, the question of the conditions attaching to any payment of any increases would only arise at the implementation stage. It does not arise at this stage since the purpose of the exercise is first to establish the appropriate rates of pay between comparable jobs in the public service and the private sector taking account of the differences, if any, between the sectors. However, I will seek to ensure that all pay increases will be tied to an ongoing programme of public service modernisation, the maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action.</P>

	<P>Domestic demand, including personal consumption, has been the main driver of economic growth in 2005. In preparing the budget 2006 forecasts, my Department assumed that personal consumption will continue to be a major driver of growth over the forecast period 2006-08, supported by strong earnings and employment growth and overall low interest rates. The maturing of the SSIA accounts is expected to provide some impetus to consumption, particularly in 2007, when the bulk of the proceeds become available.</P>
        <P>While it is difficult to be certain of the impact of SSIA maturity, economic theory and the experience of other countries suggests that it is unlikely that a once-off factor of this nature will have an undue impact on overall consumption patterns. In 2006 growth in personal consumption is forecast to be 5.8%, accelerating to 6.8% in 2007. A slightly lower growth rate of 4.6% is expected in 2008 as the effect of the SSIA scheme unwinds.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested by the Deputy is as follows. It is estimated that 666,400 income earners, representing 32.8% of all income earners, will pay tax at the higher rate in 2005 while 624,000 income earners, representing 30.75% of income earners, will pay at the standard rate. After budget 2006 it is estimated that in the 2006 tax year, 658,100 income earners, representing 31.9% of all income earners, will pay tax at the higher rate while 647,500 income earners representing 31.4% of income earners will pay at the standard rate. However, in the absence of the budget 2006 income tax changes, it is estimated that in the 2006 tax year 748,900 income earners, representing 36.3% of all income earners, would pay tax at the higher rate while 608,800 income earners, representing 29.5% of income earners, would pay at the standard rate.</P>
        <P>The numbers of income earners are based on actual data for 2002 projected forward in accordance with macroeconomic data relating to actual and expected growth in income and employment. The percentages are expressed in terms of the numbers of all income earners on the income tax record, including those who are exempt. It should be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>
        <P>The changes made in budget 2006, in particular the widening of the standard rate bands by &euro;2,600, representing an increase of just under<?oasys _jy?>9%, will ensure that more than 90,000 taxpayers will be removed from the higher rate of tax for 2006. This measure will also ensure that those earning on or below the estimated average industrial wage for 2006 will pay tax only at the standard rate.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s tax policies since 1997 have ensured that Ireland now has the lowest tax wedge in the EU and one of the lowest in the entire OECD, as measured by that organisation using comparative data relating to those earning an average production wage. In addition, after tax income, adjusted for CPI inflation, for a person on the average industrial wage is now about 44% higher than it was in 1997. Approximately half of this increase is due to lower taxes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The role of Government regarding credit growth and associated indebtedness has a number of distinct dimensions. First, it is important to note that, as far as overall economic and financial stability is concerned, the relevant measure of credit encompasses both public and private sector credit and debt levels. The Minister for Finance has a key role in this regard in ensuring prudent management of the budget and overall sustainability in the public finances. In this context, Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal performance is among the best in the developed world, with Government indebtedness the second lowest in the euro area. Responsible budgetary policy has made a significant contribution to economic performance overall, to the maintenance of low unemployment and to the achievement of record employment levels.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the growth of private sector credit and indebtedness needs to be assessed in an appropriate context. In evaluating the financial position of the private sector, it is too narrow an approach to consider the level of indebtedness in isolation from the asset side of the private sector&rsquo;s balance sheet. A high proportion of household indebtedness in Ireland relates to borrowing for house purchase which, in turn, creates an asset for the households. In the same way, borrowing by the business sector underpins high investment levels and the creation of business assets yielding future income.</P>
        <P>Account must also be taken of private sector savings levels. The Government has been actively promoting saving by individuals in the recent past, notably through the SSIA scheme. In Ireland, comparatively high household savings rates by international standards support the sustainability of household debt overall.</P>
        <P>As far as looking after the interests of the individual borrower and investor is concerned, the function of Government is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector &mdash; one that is both comprehensive and robust. I am satisfied that, on foot of the progress made over recent years, especially in establishing the financial regulator with a particular focus on the interests of the consumer, we have such a framework in place.</P>
        <P>Within the implementation of the overall legislative framework, private sector credit growth and debt levels are, in the first instance, a matter for the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. This follows from its role as part of the European system of central banks and its functions, as the financial regulator, in the prudential supervision of financial institutions and the protection of the consumers of those firms.</P><Col N="492"/>
        <P>The financial regulator has already drawn attention to the need for consumers to choose the right type of loan for their needs. The financial regulator, with its statutory consumer mandate, has developed a number of specific initiatives to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products. These initiatives have been developed through the framework of the financial regulator&rsquo;s &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Your Money&rdquo; campaign and have involved publishing consumer guides on credit products, fact sheets and cost surveys on personal loans, all of which are intended to assist borrowers in making the most appropriate credit decisions given their circumstances.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Central Bank&rsquo;s recently published financial stability report concludes that a range of fundamental factors such as growing employment and incomes, falling inflation and low interest rates have supported the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy. The report, however, emphasises the importance of responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders to factor into their financial decision making the prospective impact of potential changes in the future economic environment. I share the Central Bank&rsquo;s assessment of the importance of maintaining financial and economic stability. In that regard, for my part, I intend to maintain a responsible approach to maintaining stability in our public finances, which will ensure that the strategic direction of our economy will focus on sustainable real improvements in public services, social provision and infrastructure.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 227 together.</P>
        <P>The issue of allowing businesses to deduct VAT on conference related business expenses has been raised on a number of occasions in <Col N="494"/>recent years. The Government&rsquo;s tourism action plan implementation group has recommended a change in the VAT rules to allow for the deductibility of VAT incurred by businesses on conference related expenditure, that is, hotel accommodation and meals. In this regard, its proposal distinguishes between routine business travel which is non-discretionary and location specific and a subset of business travel known as MICE &mdash; meetings, incentives, conferences and events &mdash; which is discretionary and is not location specific. The main argument put forward in favour of the proposal is that it would allow Irish hotels to compete more favourably with their European counterparts for conference related business.</P>
        <P>We do not currently allow businesses to recover VAT incurred in respect of hotel accommodation and meals. There is a similar block on deductibility for business cars and petrol. These restrictions were put in place to limit revenue loss and tax avoidance. EU VAT law allows such restrictions.</P>
        <P>While it would, in theory, be possible to remove or reduce these restrictions, it would not then be possible under EU law to reinstate them. In addition, any scheme designed to remove or reduce these restrictions would have significant cost implications for the Exchequer. The Revenue Commissioners have estimated that if full deductibility was allowed on accommodation and meals, it would cost &euro;115 million in a full year. Furthermore, Article 17(6) of the sixth VAT directive limits the type of deductibility allowable to business expenses. This means there is no provision in EU law that would permit expenditure on entertainment to be allowable. Therefore, any scheme that would allow businesses to deduct VAT on accommodation and meals would have to take account of this fact.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners also raised concerns regarding potential abuse, and it is clear the design of a scheme that would allow businesses to deduct VAT on such expenses, even in a limited form, is complex. However, officials from my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism are examining this issue. Specifically, they are exploring if the focus of the proposal could be narrowed by certain administrative solutions to ensure that it is targeted and complies with EU law. I have asked for this examination to be completed as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The target of reducing public service employment was announced in December 2002. To take an overview, the policy has succeeded in cutting back <Col N="495"/>radically on the rapid rise in public service employment in the period 1997 to 2002. From 1997 to 2001 there had been an increase of almost 43,000, or 19%, in the number of public service employees. Since the introduction of the policy in December 2002, the increase has been of the order of 5,500 or less than 2%. This has taken place at a time of significant increases both in employment in the economy generally and in the population, with the corresponding increased demand for public services.</P>
        <P>Numbers employed in the health and education sectors have increased by just under 9,000 over the 2002 baseline. Numbers employed in the other sectors &mdash; the Civil Service, defence, local authority and non-commercial State-sponsored sectors &mdash; have been reduced by 3,500. In fact, by the end of September 2005, the targets for these groups had been exceeded.</P>
        <P>I fully accept that original targets in the health and education sectors have not been met. The Government has been prepared to increase numbers to meet priority needs in frontline and essential services. The employment of additional frontline staff has, for example, been approved for new health units and additional disability posts in the health sector, special needs teachers in the education system and to increase the number of garda&iacute;. This is in line with the approach stated when the policy was launched.</P>
        <P>Total employment in the public service by the end of 2005 will be close to 290,000. The Government will continue to control and regulate numbers in the public service within agreed ceilings. I am allowing limited increases in staff in some key non-administrative areas particularly in health, education and the Garda to improve the delivery of important frontline services to the public. The success of our earlier policy tells me that this is the correct strategy to follow.</P>
        <P>The numbers involved are as follows: Civil Service &mdash; non-industrials and industrials &mdash; 37,700; non-commercial State-sponsored bodies &mdash; 9,600; local authorities &mdash; 33,300; Defence Forces &mdash; 11,400; Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &mdash; 14,000; education &mdash; to be agreed bilaterally; health &mdash; to be agreed bilaterally.</P>

	<P>The Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; study, &ldquo;Effective tax rates of the top 400 earners: Report for the tax year 2001&rdquo;, was published by my Department in March of this year. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a study of the effective tax rates of the top 400 earners in 2002 is being prepared. This will be published by my Department in the normal course.</P>
        <P>Further analysis of the effect of tax relief claimed by top earners, who were included in the report for the tax year 2001 published in March of this year, was undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners, at the request of my Department, as part of the review of tax incentives conducted this year by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners. This further analysis was undertaken in connection with the general restriction of reliefs announced in budget 2006.</P>
        <P>The proposed restriction will not apply to earners whose gross income, before the deduction of reliefs, is less than &euro;250,000 and it will not affect those whose effective rate of tax, that is, whose tax liability as a percentage of their gross income, is greater than 20%. Accordingly, the analysis tracked the 2001 group of top earners into the tax year 2002 and identified earners in that group who had income in excess of &euro;250,000 and effective rates of tax of less than 20% in 2002. The measure announced in the budget was then tested against this sample. The test confirmed that the proposed general restriction of reliefs would have the effect of increasing the effective tax rates of high earners to close to 20%. The results of this analysis will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i> in the next day or so.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned in my Budget Statement last week, I also propose to publish all the relevant <Col N="497"/>reports reviewing the various tax reliefs in time for the Finance Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department&rsquo;s forecasts for revenues in 2006 from capital taxes are as follows: capital gains tax &mdash;&euro;2,035 million; stamp duties &mdash;&euro;2,685 million; capital acquisitions tax &mdash;&euro;260 million. These amounts represent forecast increases of 3.6%, 2.1% and 4%, respectively, on the projected outturns for capital gains tax, stamp duties and capital acquisitions tax in 2005.</P>
        <P>The forecasts assume a lower rate of growth in tax revenues from these sources next year than the significant increases experienced this year. The forecasts still assume, however, a reasonably buoyant property market next year, both residential and commercial. It should also be noted with regard to stamp duties that the forecast for 2006 takes account of the ending of the specific contribution from the financial sector which was introduced in budget 2003. This contribution has yielded approximately &euro;103 million in each of the past three years.</P>
        <P>The methodology for forecasting tax revenues, generally, is based on forecasts of the level and composition of economic activity, which is determined by many factors and is subject to both national and international shocks. Forecasting economic activity on which forecasts of tax revenues are largely based is not an exact science. Moreover, capital taxes are more difficult to forecast than other taxes because they can be influenced by broader factors and considerations than the general level of economic activity.</P>

As regards the future of the tax exemption for stallion fees, I announced in my Budget Statement of 7 December 2005 that this provision will be discontinued from 31 July 2008, the same end-date as for various property based tax incentive schemes. A new regime appropriate to the industry will be discussed with the European Commission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government continues to be committed to the full implementation of the decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004, involving some 10,300 civil and public service jobs in more than 56 locations across some 60 Departments or offices and agencies. My office is in the process of procuring appropriate properties in the designated locations for the Departments and agencies involved, with much progress having been made over the past year. Property acquisition negotiations are completed or are significantly advanced at 23 locations.</P>
        <P>The prevailing property market conditions in each geographical area have a significant bearing on the cost of acquiring sites. As the acquisition process is still in progress, it is not possible at this stage to provide a precise estimate of the cost of the site acquisition programme. However, for working purposes only, an indicative figure of &euro;75 million to &euro;100 million, excluding VAT, is being used by the OPW.</P>
        <P>The decentralisation implementation group, DIG, in its report of November 2004 announced the names of the Departments and organisations selected as &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; and set out a timetable for provision of accommodation. At the same time, the group published a report on the procurement and financial aspects of decentralisation. A further report, in June 2005, updates the timetable announced in November 2004, includes a timetable for the balance of organisations comprehended by the decentralisation programme and sets out commencement and completion dates for accommodation ranging from the final quarter of 2005 to the end of 2009. I am confident that this programme will be successfully implemented.</P>
        <P>With regard to the public private partnership approach recommended by the DIG, my office has been developing a comprehensive risk-adjusted costing of project elements to measure the value-for-money of future PPP bids. Expressions of interest will be sought for the first of these major projects early in 2006.</P>
        <P>Although property solutions will include leasing and fitting-out of existing buildings, it is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the accommodation facilities will be provided by the construction of new office buildings and cost estimation can be approached on that basis. However, in advance of market testing of any procurement methodology, it is possible, at this time, only to assign the most general measurements of cost to such a large scale, diverse and complex programme.</P><Col N="500"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is estimated that approximately 210,000<?oasys _jy?>sq. m. of office space will be required to accommodate the total numbers included in the programme. Current OPW cost norms &mdash; April 2005 &mdash; in respect of offices would indicate an average build cost to fit-out standard in the range of &euro;1,800 per square metre to &euro;2,200 per sq. m. in suburban-rural locations. Such figures exclude VAT, professional fees, inflation and site specific considerations. In addition, the cost of equipping the accommodation to standard office equipment levels could be estimated at approximately &euro;4,000 per person. This would exclude the cost of information and communication technology and specialised equipment requirements.</P>
        <P>Such general measurements of cost do not include specialised facility and equipment requirements and other variables which would arise from the spread of possible procurement methodologies. In addition, general cost indicators of this type show a snapshot in time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is self evident that a firmer scale of costs for the decentralisation programme will only emerge on foot of cost proposals being received from the market. It will be some months yet before sufficient data can be extracted from a suitable range of tender competitions to provide a basis on which more robust estimates of the overall cost of the programme can be made. Nevertheless, it can be estimated that, generally speaking, the cost of providing accommodation in provincial, compared with central Dublin, locations should yield considerable cost savings to the State over time in terms of site costs, capital build costs and maintenance costs.</P>

	<P>The Government recognises the important role of small or medium sized enterprises in the local and national economy and promotes their development to the greatest extent possible. I very much favour maximum participation of SMEs in the public procurement market.</P>
        <P>The public procurement market must operate on an open and non-discriminatory basis and it can be an important source of business for SMEs. In the past, access to public contracts was perceived as a problem by many in this sector. Significant measures have been introduced to combat this. A national public procurement website, <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>, was developed by my Department in recent years where all significant public sector contracts are advertised. This central facility increases transparency and greatly <Col N="501"/>increases access to public sector contracts for all suppliers.</P>
        <P>The SME sector is actively targeted through a marketing campaign and suppliers receive free e-mail alerts to tender notices of interest to them. Figures show a steady increase in the number of registered suppliers competing for business &mdash; currently at 27,000, with a growth of 77% in the past year due to active targeting. I wish to build on this and see SMEs competing vigorously for public contracts in the future.</P>
        <P>An e-business strategy implementation group led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently considering ways in which the opportunities that electronic procurement offers SMEs can be identified and any obstacles to participation addressed.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that to date payments totalling &euro;381 million have been made in tax, interest and penalties by approximately 5,000 taxpayers who have come forward voluntarily.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are conducting their investigation into the use by taxpayers of life assurance investment products for the purposes of tax evasion in two stages. In the first stage of these inquiries, taxpayers who invested undisclosed and undeclared funds in life assurance products were given until 23 May 2005 to advise the Revenue Commissioners of this. This part of the disclosure stage has now been successfully completed and about 10,000 notices of intention to make a disclosure were received from taxpayers or their agents. Some of these notices were protective. Correspondence was received from others indicating that no liabilities arose.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners formally commenced the second stage of their investigation into the use of life assurance products for tax evasion on 23 May 2005. New powers were provided in the Finance Act 2005 to authorise Revenue Commissioners officers to examine the records that relate to a class or classes of life assurance policies and policyholders in the course of conducting sampling exercises. The Revenue Commissioners have completed the preliminary work regarding the use of these new powers and authorised officers are actively engaged in the sampling process. The information gathered in this process and from the voluntary disclosures will be used to ground applications to the High Court for orders directing insurance companies to furnish details on policyholders and policies to Revenue. It is envisaged that the initial applications will be made in early 2006.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The main contributors to economic growth this year are personal consumption and investment, with a weaker performance by exports compared with previous years. The composition of economic growth will vary over time and from year to year. As an economy matures, the part played by consumption will tend to increase. The significant growth in investment is a positive development as it enhances the economy&rsquo;s capital stock, thereby providing a basis for future economic growth.</P>
        <P>Export performance in any given year is affected by a range of factors. These include external developments such as growth in world demand and exchange rate movements as well as internal factors such as competitiveness and the level of inward investment. It can also be affected by supply side factors particular to individual industry sectors such as the ICT and chemicals sectors, both of which account for significant shares of manufacturing output in, and exports from, Ireland. To secure future export growth requires investment now in all forms of capital, physical capital and knowledge based capital. That is the strategy I am pursuing in my budget.</P>

	<P>As I pointed out in my reply to a similar parliamentary question from Deputy Timmins on 9 November 2005, Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty prohibits, in general terms, the granting of aid by the state which distorts competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods, in so far as the aid is liable to affect trade between member states.</P>
        <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>There are a number of components to this provision, all of which must be met before a particular type of support can be classified as a state aid. The principal components are that: the aid in question is granted by a member state, which includes regional or local authorities or other bodies acting on behalf of the state, or through state resources in any form whatsoever; the aid confers an advantage on the recipient; the aid is selective in its application, inasmuch as it is not afforded to other undertakings in the market in general; the aid is capable of dis<Col N="505"/>torting competition, usually by strengthening the competitive position of the beneficiary relative to other participants in the market, and is thus liable to have an effect on trade between member states. The EC Treaty also provides for circumstances in which state aids may be permissible in light of considerations of public policy.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P>The enforcement of the state aid rules across the member states is primarily a matter for the European Commission. It is not the practice of Ministers to comment on areas where, depending perhaps on interpretation of rules or changing practice or jurisprudence, the Commission might wish to take a view on the Irish tax code. As far as Ireland is concerned, all new proposed tax incentives are examined in light of the state aid rules and it has been the general practice in recent years to discuss such measures with the European Commission and to notify schemes as appropriate.</P>

	<P>A list of tax reliefs in respect of which costs are not currently quantifiable or are negligible or are not identifiable within total aggregates is attached to table IT 6 on pages 16 to 22 of the Statistical Report of the Revenue Commissioners for 2004, which is accessible on the Revenue Commissioners website at <i>www.revenue.ie/pdf/sr04eng&under;it.pdf</i>. Provisions were included in the Finance Act 2004 to get more information from tax returns on the cost of certain reliefs. This will provide better data in this area and enable fuller estimates of the tax foregone to be made over time.</P>
        <P>Property based incentives on which information is being sought in tax forms include: urban renewal; town renewal; seaside resorts; rural renewal; multi-storey car parks; living over the shop; enterprise areas; park and ride; hotels; holiday cottages; nursing homes and convalescent homes; student accommodation; qualifying private hospitals, including qualifying sports injury clinics; buildings used for certain child care purposes; stud fees; woodland relief. Preliminary data at aggregate level derived from 2004 tax returns filed via the ROS system should become available from early 2006.</P>
        <P>In my recent Budget Statement, I explained that the consultancy reviews of the various tax incentive schemes included a recommendation that recipients of such tax reliefs be required to supply full data to the Revenue Commissioners to assist in the costing and assessment of reliefs. I will follow this advice as far as appropriate.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>the amount repaid by the Revenue Commissioners to individual taxpayers in respect of overpayments of tax for each of the years 2000 to date in 2005; his plans for information campaigns to ensure that taxpayers are made fully aware of all their entitlements and are claiming all credits and allowances provided for; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[39012/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amounts repaid to PAYE taxpayers for the years 2002 to 2005 inclusive, as at 23 September 2005, are as follows: 2002 &mdash;&euro;242 million; 2003 &mdash;&euro;265 million; 2004 &mdash;&euro;278 million; 2005 &mdash;&euro;282 million to 23 September 2005. The figures for 2001 and prior cannot be produced in the time available but will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a wide range of initiatives are in place on an ongoing basis to inform PAYE taxpayers of their entitlements to tax credits-reliefs and so <Col N="507"/>avoid overpayments of tax. The Revenue Commissioners inform me that the vast majority of PAYE workers receive their full entitlements every year. At the beginning of each year a tax credit certificate is issued to every PAYE taxpayer and this reflects the most up-to-date information that Revenue has regarding an individual&rsquo;s entitlements. Revenue completed the issue of 2.24 million such certificates for 2005 in mid-February and it is anticipated that a similar number will issue in February next to reflect the recent budget changes.</P>
        <P>Each certificate is accompanied by a simple but comprehensive leaflet giving full details of the credits-reliefs to which a taxpayer may be entitled including: main personal tax credits available for the year in question with comparative figures for the preceding year; tax rates and tax bands for the year in question; exemption limits for single, widowed and married persons; how to claim an adjustment to the tax credit certificate.</P>
        <P>Revenue uses media advertising on a regular and systematic basis to acquaint taxpayers with their entitlements and to encourage them to claim these. In the case of the PAYE community in particular there is extensive advertising of the budget provisions each year, including a Revenue free-phone service which operates for two days immediately following the budget. Again, when the tax credit certificates are being issued during January and February each year a newspaper and radio campaign is run to alert people to this.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s website provides easy to access customer service information on the full range of reliefs available to taxpayers, together with a range of claim forms for download and completion. The recent information summary of budget 2006 is now on the website. The website also has detailed information to direct customers to the appropriate contact point should they wish to phone, call, write, e-mail or fax.</P>
        <P>In February 2005, Revenue launched a new self service option for PAYE taxpayers. This service allows PAYE employees to claim, using the Internet, text messaging or the lo-call 1890 phone number, age credits for those over 65, service charges and trade union subscriptions. It also allows them to request forms for claiming various reliefs.</P>
        <P>Revenue also publishes a wide range of claim forms, leaflets and guides on all PAYE credits and reliefs. Some leaflets are available on the website in French, Dutch, Spanish and Polish. All the forms and information leaflets can be downloaded and printed from the Revenue website or ordered on-line. There is also a 24 hour telephone number available &mdash; 1890 30 67 06 &mdash; for requesting forms or leaflets.</P>
        <P>Revenue has recently introduced a redesigned PAYE computer system and, in the early part of 2006, this will allow taxpayers to: access their Revenue records over the Internet to ascertain <Col N="508"/>allowances-credits given and details of pay and tax; amend their tax credit details over the Internet, that is, claim an allowance-credit not on record or change the amount involved for an existing relief; request an on-line review of their liability or a balancing statement, based on the details available on the Revenue record, including where amended with regard to entitlements. This will give taxpayers greater control over their tax affairs and let them check whether they have claimed their full entitlements.</P>
        <P>The launch of these services will be accompanied by a comprehensive marketing campaign to alert customers to the facilities available to encourage maximum take up of the tax reliefs to which taxpayers are entitled. A detailed booklet will be produced informing people how to use the wide range of self service options to make claims on a 24-7 basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Revenue already liaises with other State bodies and private institutions to facilitate the automated granting of credits-reliefs to PAYE taxpayers: for example, the tax relief at source, TRS, system ensures that all those entitled to mortgage and medical insurance reliefs get these reliefs at source and do not have to make a claim to Revenue.</P>
        <P>Revenue is already very proactive in the manner in which it ensures that PAYE taxpayers are made aware of their entitlements and facilitated in claiming these. Revenue keeps the issue under constant review and takes whatever steps are necessary through public information campaigns to continue to inform taxpayers of their entitlements and to simplify as far as possible the arrangements for making these claims. I emphasise, however, that the primary responsibility for ensuring that Revenue has the most up to date information on a taxpayer&rsquo;s affairs lies with the taxpayer.</P>

	<P>Many people who have applied to decentralise have now moved into their new decentralised posts. Concurrently, individuals in decentralised posts who did not wish to decentralise transferred to the vacated posts scheduled to remain in Dublin. Such transfers, which have been taking place for some time now, are accomplished on a voluntary basis with the individuals concerned applying to transfer to the Dublin posts.</P><Col N="509"/>
        <P>My Department has recently extended the arrangements for people remaining in Dublin. The Public Appointments Service has commenced the operation of a system that will match Dublin based posts with people wishing to remain in Dublin. Any decentralising organisation which anticipates that it will have staff wishing to remain in Dublin who cannot be placed within the organisation will engage with the Public Appointments Service in the placement of these individuals. Each individual affected or likely to be affected will be offered the opportunity to indicate preferences on Dublin based posts.</P>
        <P>Regular discussions are continuing with the trade unions on the implementation of the entire decentralisation programme including the details of these arrangements for the staff remaining in Dublin.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the following information is the up to date position on court prosecutions initiated for tax evasion. In 1997, there was one prosecution and one conviction. A fine of &euro;635 was imposed with no custodial sentence. In 1998, there were six cases and eight convictions; fines totalling &euro;42,854 were imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of six months suspended and one of two years suspended. In 1999, there were two cases and one conviction. In one case a fine of &euro;19,046 was imposed with no custodial sentence. In the other the defendant was acquitted.</P>
        <P>In 2000, there were three cases and three convictions. Fines totalling &euro;952 were imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of two years, reduced to 18 months on appeal, and another of 12 months suspended. In 2001, there were four cases and four convictions. Fines totalling &euro;14,284 were imposed. There were four custodial sentences, one of 12 months, two of six months suspended and another of three months. In 2002, there were three cases and three convictions. Fines totalling &euro;5,540 were imposed and one custodial sentence of six months.</P>
        <P>In 2003, there were six cases and seven convictions. Fines totalling &euro;29,365 were imposed and one custodial sentence of two years suspended. In 2004, there was one case and one conviction. A <Col N="510"/>fine of &euro;5,000 was imposed and 180 hours community service was imposed in lieu of a three months custodial sentence. In 2005 to date, there have been eight cases finalised and ten convictions have resulted &mdash; a case can involve more than one person. There have been three custodial sentences, one of 16 months, which is currently under appeal, and two of three months each. In another two cases 240 hours and 120 hours of community service were imposed in lieu of custodial sentences of six months and three months respectively. In addition, fines totalling &euro;199,287 were imposed. A further eight cases are before the courts.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have a clear policy of prosecuting cases of serious tax evasion. This function is tasked to their investigations and prosecutions division. Following the restructuring of Revenue in 2003, all investigation activity was consolidated in this division with a remit to co-ordinate all Revenue prosecution work and, in particular, to increase the number of criminal investigations for serious tax offences and ultimately to increase the number of prosecutions. The number of investigators was also increased for this purpose.</P>
        <P>The most recent figures indicate that this approach is proving successful. There are currently 58 cases under investigation for potential prosecution, the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering a further ten cases and has given directions to prosecute in another four. Bench warrants have been issued in two cases for failure to attend court and eight cases are in the court process. Combined with the eight successful prosecutions to date in 2005, of which the conviction and sentence in one case are under appeal, it is the highest overall figure to date and vindicates the decision to concentrate Revenue&rsquo;s prosecution resources in one area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 217 together.</P>
        <P>The terms of contracts of employment of staff of the Health Service Executive are primarily a matter between the executive and its staff. I will, accordingly, confine my reply to matters relating to my Department&rsquo;s exercise of its statutory role in approving terms and conditions of HSE staff.</P>
        <P>The remuneration of the director was, in common with the other national directors in the HSE, settled by agreement with the Department of Health and Children and the interim Health Service Executive after an evaluation of the posts by independent consultants who measured the jobs and recommended appropriate public service comparative pay levels. The post of the director of the national hospitals office, along with the director of primary, continuing and community care, was set at a level higher than the other HSE directors&rsquo; posts to reflect its importance. The rate is currently &euro;165,716.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children sought my Department&rsquo;s approval for the payment of an allowance to the director of the national hospitals office in respect of his acting as deputy CEO of the Health Service Executive. The extra allowance sought by the Department of Health and Children would have amounted to approximately &euro;45,000 per year. The request for an allowance of this size was turned down by my Department on the grounds that it was not clear why any allowance should be paid. It is normal for senior management in public service organisations to cover the role of the CEO in his or her absence. In addition, the director is eligible to take part in a performance related award scheme. If occasions of having to act as deputy CEO gave rise to exceptional burdens of work, this scheme provides an avenue to recognise this.</P>
        <P>Superannuation arrangements were set for the post reflecting normal public service terms. Issues concerning these arrangements, including assurances that the person concerned claimed he had received, were brought to the attention of my Department by the Department of Health and Children last summer. While my Department expressed the view that further enhancements of the arrangements did not seem appropriate, it sought clarification as to the form of assurances that had been claimed. My Department received no such clarification in advance of the recent announcement of the resignation of the person concerned. There had been ongoing contact before that announcement between my Department and the Department of Health and Children about the person&rsquo;s eligibility for superannuation.</P>

        <Quest>the proportion of the almost &euro;2.5 billion outstanding in uncollected taxes which the Revenue Commissioners expect to recover; if new measures are planned to assist in the collection of <Col N="512"/>outstanding taxes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total tax debt outstanding at 31 March 2005, as reported in Revenue&rsquo;s annual report and in the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, was &euro;1.2 billion, not &euro;2.5 billion as quoted by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As with any tax system, there will always be people who pay late, people who try to avoid paying and people who cannot pay. In this context it is important to note that the debt of &euro;1,217 million at 31 March 2005 is &euro;146 million or 10.7% less than at 31 March 2004. The figure represents 2.5% of annual gross collection and is one of the lowest percentages of any tax administration internationally. Of this figure, &euro;278 million of the total debt is under appeal, with a further &euro;349 million under control or at enforcement. The remainder, &euro;590 million, is under active collection.</P>
        <P>It is the goal of Revenue, as stated in its Statement of Strategy 2005-2007, that all debt on record should be less than five years old or the subject of active enforcement or court proceedings. In this context, I am advised by Revenue that it would expect the current collectible tax debt and any additional debt that will arise for periods up to 31 December 2004, through assessments made by Revenue or submission of overdue returns by taxpayers, would ultimately be reduced over the next five years very substantially. That reduction will be achieved primarily by collection of the debt due.</P>
        <P>Revenue has emphasised the changing element of the debt make-up and the difficulty that this creates in making an estimate of the likely reduction in the debt figure over a five year period. Revenue&rsquo;s strategies and methodologies adopted to achieve a reduction over a five year period will be subject to annual review and evaluation that is carried out within the context of the business planning process.</P>

        <P>In my Budget Statement, I announced changes to the current VAT registration thresholds for small businesses. These thresholds are being increased from &euro;25,500 to &euro;27,500 in the case of services and from &euro;51,000 to &euro;55,000 in the case of goods. This represents an increase of almost 8% to the current thresholds and will remove 2,200 businesses from the VAT net. These increases will be introduced in the Finance Bill and will take effect from 1 May 2006. This initiative will cost &euro;6 million in 2006 and &euro;12 million a full year.</P>
        <P>The effect of this increase will be to relieve small traders of the burden of compliance with the requirements of the VAT system. Increasing the thresholds would also free up Revenue resources to deal with larger cases. Following this increase, Ireland will have the third highest registration threshold for goods and the fifth highest threshold for services in the EU. Some member states have no registration threshold for goods or services and require all firms to register irrespective of their turnover.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax compliance testing programme was rolled out in November 2004 and is used as a random case selection tool in 2005 to test compliance on a number of fronts. It tests payment compliance, filing compliance and reporting compliance. Some 400 cases were allocated to the various regions and to large cases division. Most of these cases are well advanced and it is expected that the programme will be substantially completed by <Col N="514"/>year end. A full analysis of the results will not be available until after the end of the year. A similar programme will be carried out in 2006.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme which is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion by maximising the impact of their resources through focusing on risk. This is strengthened by their new taxpayer compliance testing programme, which ensures that all taxpayers are exposed to the possibility of a compliance check or Revenue audit. This approach is in line with international best practice.</P>

	<P>I have already issued a press statement regarding the end of November Exchequer returns, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The results for the first 11 months of the year indicate that the public finances remain in a sound position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tax Revenue, at &euro;36,879 million, was just over &euro;1.7 billion or 4.9% ahead of profile at end November. Year on year tax receipts were up 10.7% compared with the profiled increase of 5.4% for the year as a whole. The main excesses were on VAT, &euro;504 million, stamp duties, &euro;503 million, capital gains tax, &euro;371 million, and excise, &euro;177 million. Income tax, excluding the impact of one-off receipts from Revenue&rsquo;s special investigations, was broadly on target while corporation tax was &euro;273 million below profile.</P>
        <P>Overall Exchequer issues for net voted spending was &euro;30,559 million at end November compared to &euro;28,398 million for the same period last year, an increase of 7.6%. This was below the estimated, Revised Estimates Volume, increase of 11.3% net for the year as a whole. At end November, the Exchequer balance showed a surplus of &euro;2,959 million. Taking account of anticipated developments in December and as indicated in my budget last week, an Exchequer deficit of &euro;852 million is now expected for 2005 compared to a forecast deficit of &euro;2,988 million at the start of the year. This is an improvement of over &euro;2.1 billion for the Exchequer balance.</P>

To date, 306 cases have been settled on payment of tax, interest and penalties amounting to a total of &euro;53.65 million, of which &euro;4.95 million was paid during 2005.

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am broadly satisfied with the rate of both financial and physical implementation of the national development plan, NDP. The monitoring committee for the national development plan and the community support framework meets this week to consider progress on the NDP overall to end June 2005. It is estimated that approximately &euro;39 billion or some 88% of the profiled expenditure for the period of the NDP from January 2000 to end June 2005 has been incurred at end June 2005. The Exchequer contribution to the NDP is expected to be close to the planned level of expenditure for the period to the end of 2005.</P>
        <P>With respect to the operational programmes, the economic and social infrastructure OP is performing well with expenditure at 102% of profiled expenditure for the period January 2000 to end June 2005. Expenditure on the employment and human resources development OP has achieved 97% of profiled expenditure for the same period and is on course to meet its targets. Performance of the productive sector OP is behind target with 49% of the original profiled <Col N="516"/>expenditure having been achieved. The key factors accounting for the low rate of expenditure relate to the lower take up of financial opportunities by the private sector and less than anticipated absorption capacity for research and development projects in the BMW region. Despite this, physical performance is close to target for the period for this programme.</P>
        <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>The Border, midland and western and southern and eastern regional OPs are showing absorption rates of 61% and 68% of profiled expenditure for the period January 2000 to end June 2005, respectively. Good progress is evident under the local infrastructure and social inclusion and child care measures. Difficulties still exist in the tourism and agriculture sectors where implementation has been slower and demand for grant support has been less than anticipated. The PEACE and technical assistance OPs are on track to meet their targets by the end of the programming period.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
        <P>With respect to the eventual outturn for the NDP, I expect the end 2006 position for the key economic and social infrastructure OP and employment and human resources development OP to be close to or above targets. Similarly, the position for the PEACE and technical assistance OPs will be close to their targets at the end of 2006. The regional programmes and the productive sector OP are unlikely to achieve their end 2006 targets.</P>
        <P>Although Structural Funds are profiled for each operational programme for the years 2000 to 2006, expenditure under co-funded measures will continue until the end of 2008 in accordance with Structural Funds regulations. Account must be taken of expenditure in 2007 and 2008 in evaluating the final position of the NDP. Based on progress reported to date, Ireland will draw down its entitlements of Structural Funds for the programming period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department does not maintain data on the completion status of individual projects under the NDP as this is a matter for individual Departments and agencies which are responsible for project funding and, where appropriate, project implementation.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the statement made by the chief executive of the Equality Authority. Speaking at the launch of the publication &ldquo;Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004 and Provision of Health Services&rdquo;&mdash; a joint <Col N="517"/>initiative of the Equality Authority, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive &mdash; the chief executive praised the health sector for demonstrating leadership in the area of equality. He said there was a particular challenge for the wider public sector in the provision of services in accordance with the standards set out in the Equal Status Acts and pointed out that public service cases accounted for nearly 25% of the Equality Authority case files under these Acts during 2004.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004 prohibit discrimination in the provision of goods and services, accommodation, disposal of premises and education. Discrimination is prohibited on nine grounds: gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. In the Civil Service, customer service is a particular priority in accordance with good practice and legal requirements.</P>
        <P>All Departments and offices have customer service policies which govern all contacts between the office and members of the public to ensure that good and efficient services are provided. These customer service policies are supported by policies for employees on diversity, gender equality and disability which, while they have an internal focus, help to make all staff aware of the importance of equality issues. Parallel policies are adopted in other parts of the public service. I assure the Deputy that all public sector organis<Col N="518"/>ations take seriously their responsibilities under the Equal Status Acts.</P>

	<P>Due to the nature of the programme it is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of civil and public servants who do not wish to leave Dublin, as individual circumstances are open to change and figures can fluctuate. The picture will become clearer over the coming period as staff continue to be assigned to decentralising organisations. In addition, the new applications to decentralise are continuing to be received at the rate of 100 per month.</P>
        <P>Many people who have applied to decentralise have now moved into their new decentralised posts. Concurrently, individuals in decentralised posts who did not wish to decentralise transferred to the vacated posts scheduled to remain in Dublin. Such transfers, which have been taking place for some time now, are accomplished on a voluntary basis with the individuals concerned applying to transfer to the Dublin posts.</P><Col N="520"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 109 together.</P>
        <P>In budget 2005, I announced a major review of tax reliefs to achieve a greater degree of equity in our tax system, and to evaluate whether the various tax incentive schemes continued to be justified in light of the benefits arising. This process involved both internal reviews conducted by the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and external reviews by two external consultancy firms.</P><Col N="521"/>
        <P>As I indicated in my Budget Statement on 7 December 2005, I propose to publish all the relevant reports reviewing the various reliefs, including the consultancy studies, in time for the Finance Bill. A summary overview of the conclusions and recommendations arising from the consultancy studies is set out in the summary of budget measures in the budget 2006 documentation. A summary of the outcomes arising from the internal reviews is also provided in that context.</P>
        <P>As regards the costs of the consultancy studies, the contracts stipulate that Indecon International Economic Consultants are to be paid the sum of &euro;224,004, before VAT, in respect of the review of certain property based schemes, and that Goodbody Economic Consultants are to be paid the sum of &euro;155,400, before VAT, in respect of the review of area based tax incentive renewal schemes.</P>

	<P>The Irish economy is projected to grow at around its long-term sustainable growth rate of 4.5% to 5% over the next three years, as per the economic forecasts published in the stability programme update last week. The recent interest rate rise is unlikely to have a determining impact on this outlook. Its effect on inflation, through an increase in mortgage repayments, is incorporated in the consumer price index, CPI, projection of 2.7% in 2006.</P>

	<P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is independent of Government in the exercise of its functions. It controls and manages the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement the fund&rsquo;s investment strategy. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term, subject to prudent risk management.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to commercial investment in public sector projects, it is open to the fund to become involved in public private partnerships, PPPs. The annual report of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission for 2004 states that the commission has made an initial allocation of &euro;200 million for investment in PPPs in Ireland and will increase this allocation should suitable opportunities arise. The report for 2004 also states that the commission will, in future, rather than join particular consortia in tendering for projects, make equity and-or debt finance available to the winning bidder, provided it is satisfied with the prospective rate of return.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>When the decentralisation programme was announced by my predecessor he appointed a decentralisation implementation group to drive the process forward. The group&rsquo;s terms of reference include the examination of how decentralisation might enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service.</P>
        <P>The implementation group asked that all organisations participating in the programme should prepare detailed implementation plans, including risk mitigation plans. These plans were prepared and submitted to the group. In its July 2004 report, the group noted that the overall quality of the plans was good. In line with a recommendation in the group&rsquo;s November 2004 report, each of the Departments and organisations scheduled as &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; has prepared a revised implementation plan detailing the steps that need to be taken to complete the moves to the new locations successfully. These have been submitted to the group which has been examining them in detail. All other decentralising organisations are currently preparing revised implementation plans. The implementation group has recently met the Secretaries General of <Col N="523"/>decentralising Departments to discuss the overall planning frameworks and review progress to date.</P>
        <P>On a more general note, the Committee for Public Management Research, CPMR, has recently conducted a review of knowledge management in the Irish Civil Service. The purpose of the review was to raise awareness of knowledge management and its potential to support organisations in achieving their business objectives. It recognised that knowledge management had been given greater priority in response to ever increasing pressure to improve efficiency, together with a growing awareness of the importance of sharing knowledge across Government organisations to maintain a whole of Government perspective on policy making and service delivery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It also recognised that the need for this has been given greater impetus by the decentralisation programme and the likelihood of significant changes in personnel in many Departments. The review identifies concrete steps and the cultural change required of Departments to use and share knowledge more effectively.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The centre for management organisation and development in my Department operates a delegated sanctioning regime for ICT expenditure where Departments and offices are required to submit a broad value for money justification for each of their major ICT project proposals. This justification has to receive my Department&rsquo;s approval prior to any project commencement. The delegation arrangements also require Departments and offices to report on an annual basis their progress with projects in the previous year.</P>
        <P>This delegated sanctioning arrangement is being supplemented by a peer review process for all significant ICT projects. This review process will provide an independent peer review of programmes or projects at key decision points by a team of experienced people external to the organisation. It will particularly focus on the preparation of good business cases, affordability, detailed planning, on strong governance arrangements and on ensuring that the scope of a proposed project is appropriate to the current ICT capacity of the sponsoring organisation. It will also take full account of recent Government decisions in this area. It is important to note that peer reviews will not override in any way the <Col N="524"/>accountability arrangements in place within organisations.</P>
        <P>The centre for management and organisation development, CMOD, in my Department has agreed the details for the peer review process and a list of projects for peer review with the ICT directors of those Departments and offices which have significant ICT projects either underway or in planning. The projects that have been selected are those where the development and roll out costs exceed &euro;5 million or where the project is likely to stretch the resources of the sponsoring Department or office. Three of these projects have been chosen to pilot the agreed process and these pilots have begun.</P>
        <P>Peer review teams will be selected by the sponsoring Department or office of each project subjected to the process. These selections are subject to agreement with CMOD. It is envisaged that such review teams will include people with relevant experience from both the public and private sector. CMOD will monitor the peer review process and its findings carefully. Particular attention will be paid to the adequacy of the peer review arrangements agreed with ICT managers and to developing further supports both to organisations sponsoring projects and to project reviewers.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The artists&rsquo; tax exemption was one of the exemptions reviewed by my Department in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners as part of this year&rsquo;s overall review of tax reliefs and exemptions. Prior to budget 2006, I met the Arts Council to discuss the exemption with it. At that meeting, the Arts Council presented me with a copy of the testimonials, so my attention has been drawn to them.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my Budget Statement last week, I have decided to make no change to the tax treatment of income exempt under the artists&rsquo; tax exemption scheme where that income is less than &euro;250,000 per year. I am a strong supporter of the arts here and I believe abolishing or restricting the exemption to artists in the lower income ranges would make it financially more difficult for such artists to continue in their field and could have a long-term impact on the development of the arts here. The statistics compiled by the Revenue Commissioners on the exemption in recent years highlight the fact that the vast majority of artists have been claiming the exemption on income of &euro;50,000 or less.</P><Col N="525"/>
        <P>However, there is a strong case, on grounds of equity, for restricting the amount of earnings that can fall to be exempted under the exemption scheme. Accordingly, I have decided that the new restriction of reliefs, which I announced in the budget, to come into effect from 1 January 2007, will apply to the artists&rsquo; tax exemption where the artist&rsquo;s &ldquo;exempt&rdquo; income exceeds &euro;250,000 in any year from 1 January 2007.</P>

        <P>As indicated in replies to previous questions, it is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables, including where participants voluntarily withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions over the remaining period of the scheme. For this reason also, it is not possible to state the amount expected to be paid out by the Exchequer in each of the 12 months after the SSIAs begin to mature in May 2006.</P>
        <P>The cost of the scheme in 2004 was &euro;548 million. If the current average monthly subscription for the first 11 months of 2005 continues for a full year, the annual cost in 2005 would be approximately &euro;596 million. The total gross cost over the period of the scheme is reduced by the exit tax to be returned when the accounts mature. The first SSIA accounts are due to mature at end May 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Office of Public Works is conscious of the requirement to provide value for money in all activities in the property acquisition and construction areas of its remit. The Office of Public Works has reviewed all of its property procedures in recent years and has introduced measures to ensure greater co-ordination where a number of State bodies, including the OPW, are involved in specific property transactions. Underlying these revisions is the requirement to achieve full value for money in the acquisition and refurbishment of leased properties, for example, since 2000 there is improved co-ordination between State agencies involved in the implementation of the strategy for providing accommodation for asylum seekers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The management of construction projects undertaken by the Office of Public Works is governed by the office&rsquo;s project management plan. The Commissioners of Public Works are satisfied that the procedures and control mechanisms in place ensure that the risk of project overruns is minimised and, where they arise, that an assessment of the impact of the overrun is made. This is borne out by an examination of capital projects undertaken from the Vote of the Office of Public Works which showed that, for seven years up to 2003, the total value of close on 1,000 capital projects undertaken was approximately &euro;985 million. In that period the over-run on some 11 listed projects costing in excess of &euro;1 million each, and for which contractor&rsquo;s final accounts have been processed, amounted to 0.003% of the total expenditure.</P>
        <P>In addition to its existing procedures, the Office of Public Works is a member of the Government contracts committee for construction which is currently involved with the Department of Finance in the development of an integrated ongoing programme to deliver value for money in both current and capital expenditures in line with Government policy in that regard. The proposals involve the introduction of fixed price lump sum contracts as the norm. This development will be fundamental to protecting taxpayers from cost over-runs.</P>
        <P>The aim is to ensure that there is a fair risk sharing and that contractors take on those risks that they are able to manage and control. The optimum transfer of risk will ensure that taxpayers are protected from the financial consequences of unnecessary delays and, in turn, cost over-runs. This should apply to service or consultancy contracts as well as infrastructure projects.</P>
        <P>Value for money concerns are also being dealt with by the introduction of <i>ex ante</i> evaluations, including economic cost-benefit appraisal, for all projects valued above &euro;30 million. This approach will include identification and carefully quantified analysis of all the relevant project costs and <Col N="527"/>benefits, including indirect costs, as well as the identification of any risks of cost escalation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to change the scale or scope of the decentralisation programme. There have been about 10,600 applications for decentralisation so far. New applications are being received every week. Since the closing of the priority application period in September 2004, an average of 100 new applications have been received every month for the past 14 months. I have no reason to believe this rate of application will lessen as the CAF remains open and continues to accept further new applications.</P>
        <P>Using the statistic that few civil servants are moving with their posts is not accurate. It assumes that nobody will move between Civil Service organisations. The fact is that a career in the Civil Service for most people will encompass service in several Departments and different posts within those Departments. Many Civil Service organisations have a formally agreed mobility policy whereby people move post every <Col N="528"/>five years or so. Many civil servants have already transferred across Departments to decentralising posts in advance of the transfers out of Dublin over the coming years. To date, more than 900 of the 7,200 civil servants are in place, more than 30% of whom are middle management and higher level grades.</P>
        <P>To give the Deputy an example of how well the transfer system within Civil Service organisations works, I remind her of the information given by the Revenue Commissioners to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last year. The Revenue Commissioners set up decentralised offices with 900 staff in the mid-west in the early 1990s. At the time 10% to 12% of staff in the Collector General&rsquo;s office opted to relocate. If staff who were employed in other Revenue posts are included that figure increased to 25%. As a result, some 75% of decentralising staff were new to the Revenue organisation. The Revenue Commissioners looked on this as an opportunity to examine its internal efficiency. As a result of that exercise, significant improvements were made to processes, systems and work practices which were implemented in the course of the decentralisation.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows the Collector General&rsquo;s office was decentralised without loss of efficiency or effectiveness and it has risen to all the business challenges which have emerged in the past decade. I expect that Revenue&rsquo;s experience can be replicated in the current decentralisation process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The CSO&rsquo;s most recent employment figures, taken from the quarterly national household survey, showed that there were 1,989,800 people employed in the third quarter of 2005. This was an annual increase of 96,200 jobs, or 5%. The sectors making the greatest contribution to this increase were construction, up by 13.7%, and financial and other business services, which increased by 8.3%. Employment in the wholesale and retail trades also grew by 6.1%. On the other hand, employment in industry fell by more than 3.6% and there was a decrease of about 0.25% in agriculture.</P>
        <P>The CSO&rsquo;s estimate of GDP, that is, the total output of goods and services in the economy, for the second quarter of this year showed an annual increase of 4.1%. Output of all sectors, other than agriculture, forestry and fishing, was up on the previous year. By comparing the growth in employment and GDP, it is possible to calculate a crude indicator of the trend in labour pro<Col N="529"/>ductivity, for example, employment in the first half of 2005 grew by 4.5% on an annual basis. Over the same period GDP increased by 3.1%, implying an apparent decline in aggregate labour productivity of about 1.3%. However, care should be taken in interpreting differences between trends in quarterly employment and in GDP because timing factors and statistical volatility can affect the results. It is too early to conclude definitively that aggregate productivity in 2005 has declined but there is evidence from recent years that while labour productivity levels continue to increase, the rate of growth is slower than previously.</P>
        <P>A major factor influencing the slow down in the rate of increase in labour productivity is the change in the sectoral composition of the workforce. Productivity rates in Ireland have been exceptionally high compared with other countries because of the large numbers of foreign owned high tech industries that generate very high levels of output or value added. However, much of the strong growth in employment in recent years has been in other sectors of the economy with the result that the overall productivity levels have not grown as quickly as in the past and are moving closer to the international norm. With more persons employed in construction and in the retail and service sectors, average output per worker has not grown as quickly as in previous years, although the total numbers employed have increased at a record rate.</P>
        <P>In summary, while employment growth in the first half of 2005 has exceeded the growth in output as measured by the GDP, it is too early to conclude that there has been as a result an unexplained collapse in labour productivity. The available information is still limited, and subject to revision in some cases, and part of the fall is explained by changes in the composition of employment. However, this is something that needs to be monitored as more information becomes available.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that their Ansbacher review team has been carrying out detailed investigations since October 1999. The investigation has essentially two elements. There are Ansbacher type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits.</P>
        <P>Revenue has advised that the review team has inquired into 289 cases to date and 183 of these cases have been finalised. The 289 cases, taking account of spouses and connected companies, consist of 300 names. The 289 cases are made up of 179 cases listed on the High Court inspectors&rsquo; report and 110 similar cases discovered by Revenue or listed on the authorised officer&rsquo;s report. The investigation includes examining the tax position of disclosed entities and accumulating and assembling information on other connected entities. The number of connected entities in cases under investigation is now nearly 700.</P>
        <P>Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available. Revenue has made ten successful applications to the High Court for the production by financial institutions and third parties of books, records and other documentation, which are relevant to liabilities of Ansbacher account holders. Some 200,000 documents have been received under the terms of the High Court orders. Advanced investigative computer software is used in controlling and managing the documentation.</P>

	<P>The Government Supplies Agency, as part of its procurement responsibilities, has placed contracts for several years for the supply of natural gas to a large number of State sites. As with all procurement, the agency seeks to achieve the most economically advantageous terms available for its end users. Prior to 2003 this involved negotiating a price for the supply of natural gas with the single supplier, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann. Following deregulation there was scope for competition in the unit price of gas and the GSA initiated a process of competitive pricing for the unit cost, which is still in place.</P>
        <P>With regard to transmission costs the Deputy will be aware that gas has to be transported from either Inch, County Cork, or Moffat in Scotland to each site in the country. This transmission or transportation mechanism is operated by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation, on 29 July 2005, invited observations from the public and interested parties on its proposed decision regarding transmission or transportation tariffs for the 2005-06 gas year. The Government Supplies Agency, in response to that invitation, submitted its views to the commission on 25 August 2005. In doing so the agency was seeking to promote dialogue on the provision of gas supplies to its customers. I favour such an initiative.</P>

My Department, with the assistance of the Government Contracts Committee for Construction, GCCC, specialist legal drafters and external technical expertise, has drafted a suite of draft standard forms of contract and conditions of engagement for construction related services. These provide for the introduction of fixed price lump sum contracts tendered on a competitive basis with appropriate risk transfer to give effect to the Government decision.</P>
        <P>Consultation with the construction industry and the relevant professional bodies on these draft documents has been taking place since July of this year. During these extensive discussions, the views, comments and concerns of the construction industry and the professional bodies have been outlined in considerable detail. This exchange of views and constructive engagement is very valuable. My Department and the GCCC have examined in detail the issues raised and concerns expressed during this consultation process and have responded, with my agreement, last month proposing appropriate changes to the draft <Col N="534"/>contracts or clarification via guidance material to address many of the concerns raised.</P>
        <P>The intention is to finalise work on the new contracts through further constructive consultation on both sides, which is under way. This process should help fine tune the new draft forms of contract in a way that seeks to further address industry concerns but does not compromise Government policy. We want to have the new contracts and related material available for use in early 2006 and my Department looks forward to continued engagement with the industry and professional bodies with a view to meeting this deadline.</P>

	<P>Under the decentralisation programme, property negotiations have been completed or significantly advanced in 23 locations. In the case of five locations &mdash; Athlone, the Curragh, Navan, Furbo and Sligo &mdash; OPW owned sites have been identified and will be used to accommodate decentralised offices.</P>
        <P>In the case of another four locations &mdash; Carlow, Longford, Newcastle West and Killarney &mdash; sites <Col N="535"/>have been acquired from the relevant local authorities. Privately owned sites have been purchased in Buncrana, Tipperary and Clonakilty. In the case of Tullamore the OPW has entered into an agreement to purchase an office block when it is completed in September 2006. Contracts for sale have been received in a further ten locations, including Donegal, Dungarvan, Knock, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Thurles, Carrick-on-Shannon, Trim, Thomastown and Cavan.</P>
        <P>The total purchase cost for the 18 non-OPW owned sites is estimated at &euro;35.7 million. Of this amount, approximately &euro;13 million is in respect of sites acquired from local authorities and State agencies. The total amount spent to date in 2005 is &euro;12.62 million. The Office of Public Works has taken short-term leases in Portlaoise, Newcastle West, Thurles and Tipperary to accommodate advance parties. The annual cost of these leases is approximately &euro;649,216.</P>
        <P>Decentralisation will be implemented through the transfer of staff on a voluntary basis. There will be no redundancies and, as on previous occasions, the payment of removal or relocation expenses will not arise.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127, 235 and 247 together.</P>
        <P>The primary responsibility for the procurement, management and implementation of capital projects rests with individual Departments and public bodies under their aegis subject to compliance with general conditions of sanction and accountability. Accordingly, details in respect of individual projects or contracts are a matter for the relevant Minister. My Department has put in place an integrated set of actions to help address the issues of better management and implementation of capital programmes and projects to ensure a much closer alignment between the agreed tender price and the final outturn cost and minimise the potential for cost overruns. These include the five year rolling multiannual capital envelopes framework, guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure and a programme of reform of construction procurement.</P>
        <P>Regarding construction procurement reform, the Government decided to introduce new arrangements to reduce the scale of and scope for cost overruns. The key objectives are greater cost certainty, better value for money and more cost effective delivery of capital works projects. My Department, with the assistance of the Government contracts committee for construction, GCCC, specialist legal drafters and external technical expertise, has drafted a suite of draft standard forms of contract and conditions of engagement for construction related services. These provide for the introduction of fixed price lump sum contracts tendered on a competitive basis with appropriate risk transfer.</P>
        <P>An intensive consultation process has been taking place with the construction industry and the <Col N="539"/>relevant professional bodies on these draft documents since July of this year. Amendments have been proposed to address industry concerns and the intention is to finalise the consultation process shortly. This should help fine tune the new draft forms of contract in a way that seeks to further address industry concerns but does not compromise Government policy.</P>
        <P>We want to have the new contracts and related material available for use in early 2006 and my Department looks forward to continued engagement with the industry and professional bodies with a view to meeting this deadline. These initiatives should enhance the management of capital programmes and help to improve the cost effective delivery of construction projects over the medium to longer term.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the impact of peak oil prices on the economy. For the purposes of economic forecasting, my Department uses oil price assumptions prepared by the European Commission. As outlined in the stability programme update published on budget day, the assumptions underpinning the economic forecasts are that oil prices &mdash; Brent crude &mdash; will average $55 per barrel in 2005 and $61.4 per barrel in 2006.</P>
        <P>My Department monitors trends in oil prices on an ongoing basis. In terms of the economic impact of oil prices, economic model simulations suggest that each sustained $10 per barrel increase in the price of oil reduces growth by between one quarter and one half percentage points in a full year in Ireland. However, it is important to bear in mind that these model results are based on historical averages. In addition, the results generally relate to the effect of oil price increases emanating from supply side shocks, whereas the recent increase in prices is generally regarded as reflecting stronger international demand.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I announced a number of measures in budget 2006 to support the provision of alternative sources of energy. In particular, I have agreed with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that Ireland should set an initial target of 2% of the fuel market to consist of biofuels by 2008 and that this should be achieved by targeted excise relief measures. Accordingly, I introduced a new expanded excise relief scheme for biofuels in the budget. The level of excise relief will be &euro;20 million in 2006, &euro;35 million in 2007 and &euro;50 million in each of the following three years. This relief, when fully operational, is expected to support the use and production in Ireland of some 163 million litres of biofuels per year. This is some 20 times the current level of biofuels attracting excise relief. The environment will benefit in terms of a reduction <Col N="541"/>in CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from the initiative. Security of supply of fuels will be enhanced and jobs and outlets for agriculture production created. It is further estimated that it could ultimately give rise to hundreds of new full-time jobs in Ireland.</P>

This represents an improvement of &euro;2.138 billion compared with the budget 2005 forecast deficit of &euro;2.988 billion. This improvement is largely due to an excess of more than &euro;1.8 billion in tax receipts. The forecast of the general Government balance, GGB, for 2005 shows a surplus of 0.3% of GDP, which represents an improvement of 1.1% of GDP compared to the deficit of -0.8% of GDP forecast in budget 2005. The bulk of this shift is explained by improvements in the net balances of the Exchequer, the social insurance fund and the local authorities, partially offset by the recording in 2005 of the full projected cost of the repayment of certain nursing home charges.</P>
        <P>For 2006 the White Paper forecasts a pre-budget Exchequer deficit of &euro;1.088 million and a pre-budget GGB surplus of 0.8% of GDP.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, there is a broad range of factors that determine the effect of changes in interest rates on individual loan repayments. These include, for example, the outstanding loan amount, whether the lending rate is fixed or variable, the length of time over which the increase takes place, the pass-through of interest rate changes to lending rates, the repayment term and the specific nature of the financial product involved. My Department, having consulted the Central Bank, has concluded that, as detailed information relating to all these factors is not available, an accurate estimate of the figure requested by the Deputy cannot be constructed. <Col N="542"/>In reviewing the broad impact of any projected increases in interest rates on households and businesses, account must also be taken of private sector savings levels as any increase in interest rates will obviously have beneficial effects for savers.</P>
        <P>In addition, in assessing the overall financial position of both businesses and consumers following interest rate changes, it is too narrow an approach to consider the level of indebtedness in isolation from the asset side of the private sector&rsquo;s balance sheet. A high proportion of household indebtedness in Ireland relates to borrowing for house purchases which, in turn, creates an asset for the households. In the same way, borrowing by the business sector underpins high investment levels and the creation of business assets yielding future income.</P>
        <P>As far as the position of recently formed families is concerned, the Central Bank&rsquo;s recently published financial stability report concludes that fundamental factors such as increasing employment and incomes, low inflation and interest rates have underpinned the pattern of mortgage growth and associated debt levels in the economy. The maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s strong economic performance and in particular strong income and employment growth provides a positive and supportive economic environment within which households can successfully manage their finances.</P>
        <P>In the case of housing loans, mortgage providers are specifically obliged under the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to inform borrowers of the effect on the amount of their repayment instalments of a 1% increase in interest rates in the first year of their mortgages. A number of specific initiatives have been developed to help consumers make informed choices in terms of the financial products they choose, the amount of risk they take on and the cost of financial products. Mortgage lending practices are closely supervised by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, which require lenders to conduct appropriate stress testing of borrowers&rsquo; ability to meet their obligations, not just in the current economically favourable circumstances but also in more challenging times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It should also be noted that the maintenance of low inflation through the setting of an appropriate level of interest rates for the euro area by the European Central Bank benefits all consumers and preserves the real value of incomes and savings. It is also very important to bear in mind that interest rates remain at very low levels compared with any period of our recent economic history, even following an increase of the order referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. A number of key initiatives announced in budget 2006 will make a significant contribution to improving the financial position of newly formed families.</P>

        <Quest>his plans to amend the criteria laid down for disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme; if, in view of the fact that this section of legislation has not been updated since 1994, he will review same; if not, the reason therefore; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. A person must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions, namely, be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs, be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs, be without both hands or without both arms, be without one or both legs, be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg or have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P>A special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The group&rsquo;s report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme. The immediate term recommendations related to the circumstances in which one could appeal from a refusal of a primary medical certificate and the operation of the disabled driver medical board of appeal and have been implemented.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, I should say that given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the <Col N="544"/>annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The best way of addressing the transport needs of people with disabilities of whatever kind, and the effectiveness, suitability or otherwise of the disabled drivers scheme in that regard will be considered and progressed in consultation with the other Departments that have responsibility in this area. A car tax concession scheme can obviously only play a partial role in dealing with this serious issue, and examination of the scheme is taking place in that context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not attend the ECOFIN meeting in Brussels on 6 December 2005 due to pressure to complete final preparations for the Irish national budget, which was announced on 7 December 2005. Ambassador Bobby McDonagh, the Permanent Representative for Ireland to the EU, attended ECOFIN in my absence. The main results of the Council were as follows, namely, the Council adopted conclusions on the challenges of globalisation and on national reform programmes, prepared by the member states under the Lisbon economic reform strategy, it agreed on a general approach, as part of the EU&rsquo;s strategy against terrorist financing, on the provision of information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds and also agreed to submit work on reduced VAT rates to the European Council on 15 and 16 December with a view to reaching an agreement. If no agreement is reached at the European Council, Austria, as the next Presidency, indicated that it would put the matter on the agenda for the January 2006 ECOFIN meeting.</P>
        <P>The Council discussed future work on regulatory reform on the basis of a discussion paper prepared by the current United Kingdom and future Austrian and Finnish presidencies. The initiative is intended to enable improvements to the regulatory environment in Europe to bring productivity benefits to member states and provide a boost to growth and jobs. The Council heard a report from the chair of the code of conduct on business taxation group. This group has done important work over the last eight years as part of the commitment to eliminate harmful tax competition. The Council took note of the presentation by the Commission of a White Paper on EU financial services policy for the 2005-10 period. The White Paper draws on the results of a public consultation held by the Commission on the basis of a green paper it adopted in May. The Council took note of progress in other Council <Col N="545"/>configurations on implementation of the EU&rsquo;s action plan on combating terrorism and of the plan&rsquo;s strategy on preventing terrorist financing.</P>
        <P>The Council discussed measures taken to follow up a statement on oil prices issued at the informal ECOFIN meeting held in Manchester on 9 and 10 September and was briefed on a recent visit to Saudi Arabia by the president of the Council and the French finance minister and on discussions on energy related issues at the G7 finance ministers&rsquo; meeting in London on 2 and 3 December. The discussion focused on prospects for prices in the medium and long term and on the appropriate policy response as regards both supply side measures &mdash; dialogue with oil producing countries, investments &mdash; and demand side measures, such as energy efficiency and reducing oil dependence, as well as the functioning and transparency of oil markets.</P>
        <P>The Council adopted a decision approving the conclusion of an agreement on the participation of the ten new EU member states in the European Economic Area. The Council agreed to send a request for assent to the European Parliament concerning a draft decision on the conclusion by the EU of the energy community treaty. The objective of this treaty is to create an integrated market in natural gas and electricity in south-east Europe between the EU and the countries of the region. It will be evident from this list of items that the Council had a very productive meeting.</P>

	<P>These calculations are based on such information as is available in the tax system at any given time and on estimates of the take-up of reliefs where such information is not readily to hand. The benefit of reliefs can be assessed in a number of ways based on such economic data as may be available or on data specifically gathered as part of a special examination, for example, by outside economic consultants. Provision has been made in the Finance Acts, and further provision will be made, to enhance the range and quality of this information as far as possible consistent with the efficient working of the tax system.</P>

	<P>The exact information as requested by the Deputy is not available. Unemployment estimates are compiled at a regional level from the quarterly national household survey. The latest statistics show that there were 10,900 people classified as unemployed in the Border region in the June to August quarter of 2005. This equates to an unemployment rate of 5.1% for the Border region, which is composed of counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo. Sub-regional statistics of the kind requested by the Deputy are not available from the quarterly national household survey.</P>

While there are no specific further meetings planned at this stage, the prospect of holding a meeting in County Wicklow during 2006 will be kept under review.</P>

	<P>Since the mid-1990s the Office of the Attorney General has prepared and updated from time to time an electronic Irish Statute Book, which includes the full text of all Acts, statutory instruments and chronological tables published since 1992 on its website. The office has also from time to time published the Statute Book in CD-ROM format. Currently, the website gives the documentation up to the end of 2003 and the office is making arrangements to have this brought up to June 2005 in respect of Acts and statutory instruments and to end 2004 in respect of chronological tables. A new CD-ROM is also being prepared and it and the updated material on the website should be available in mid-February 2006.</P>
        <P>One of the commitments set out in the Government&rsquo;s White Paper, Regulating Better, is to make regulations straightforward, clear and accessible. Accordingly, a working group was set up in July of this year to look at the issue of producing and making publicly available statutory instruments electronically in a quicker and more efficient way. The Office of the Attorney General is also now looking at the future strategy in respect of the Statute Book. In respect of pre-1922 legislation the office is preparing an electronic database which will list the Acts of a public and general nature which remain in force. It is intended to make this database accessible to the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the establishment of the Health Service Executive, parliamentary questions concerning access to services by individuals or in specific geographic areas were referred to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board or Eastern Regional Health Authority for direct reply.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>Pursuant to the Health Act 2004, the functions of the health boards and ERHA were transferred to the HSE. Under the Act, the HSE has responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to have delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. The establishment of the HSE brought into being a new unitary system for the delivery and management of health services at local, regional and national level. The move to the new structure presented an opportunity for an improved service for providing information to Oireachtas Members. Last April the HSE established a parliamentary affairs division which provides a central contact for all Oireachtas requests for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the executive.</P>
        <P>The key purpose in establishing the HSE&rsquo;s parliamentary affairs division is to provide a strong mechanism and specific resource to address the information needs of Oireachtas Members in connection with the discharge by the HSE of its statutory responsibilities under the 2004 Act. The establishment of the division provides, for the first time, a systematic approach to monitoring and improving the performance of the health service delivery system in replying to information requests from Oireachtas Members.</P>
        <P>The HSE aims to operate within a timeframe of 20 working days from the date of asking a parliamentary question for the issue of a final reply to a Deputy. This reflects the arrangements which the former health boards and ERHA adopted prior to the HSE&rsquo;s establishment. It is a starting point and the HSE is committed to reducing this period as it develops its organisational and information capacity. The HSE endeavours to provide more immediate responses in instances where the information sought in the question is of a routine nature or is readily available.</P>
        <P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about a timeframe of two months for the issue of a response in the case concerned. I refer to the HSE&rsquo;s commitment to responding within 20 working days and to reducing this response time progressively as underlining its approach to achieving the objective of timely provision of information to Oireachtas Members. I had inquiries made on foot of the Deputy&rsquo;s question and have been advised by the HSE that a reply setting out the position on the repair and replacement of hearing aids has issued to him.</P>

	<P>On 14 July last, I issued a policy direction to the Health Service Executive under section 10 of the Health Act 2004 aimed at freeing up additional beds for public patients in public hospitals by moving up to 1,000 existing private beds in public hospitals into newly developed private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. I discussed with the chairman and chief executive of the Health Service Executive the implementation of this policy and the details of the assessment framework I set out with it. I understand the board of the Health Service <Col N="560"/>Executive also considered steps to implement the policy. The board, the chairman and the chief executive of the Health Service Executive are rightly concerned to implement this policy correctly and to deal with operational issues arising in the best interests of public patients, which is the aim of the policy itself.</P>

	<P>The monitoring of out-patient waiting lists relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I asked the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to examine the needs of patients waiting longest on out-patient waiting lists. As a result, the NTPF set up a number of pilot projects throughout the country. The intention is that those waiting longest for a number of specialties will receive consultations at out-patient level in private hospitals. It is envisaged that approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients will have out-patient appointments arranged for them. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements will be put in place by the NTPF to assess the outcome of the out-patient pilot projects. I understand that the pilot projects are under way and I expect to receive a report from the NTPF in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 176 together.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the delay in the establishment of the mental health tribunals as provided for in Part 2 of the Mental Health Act 2001. In this regard, protracted negotiations have taken place with consultant representative bodies involving my Department, the HSE and the Men<Col N="564"/>tal Health Commission with no satisfactory outcome to date. The Mental Health Commission has again advertised for the position of consultant psychiatrists on the tribunal panels and that of consultant psychiatrists to act as independent medical examiners. December 19 has been set as the deadline for receipt of applications. My Department, together with the Mental Health Commission, is exploring a number of options on the operation of the mental health tribunals and a decision on how best to proceed will be taken following the December 19 deadline.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Mental Treatment Act 1945, has a number of safeguards to protect the interests of persons who are involuntarily detained. Such safeguards include the right of appeal, as appropriate, to the Minister, the President of the High Court, the Registrar of Wards of Court, the HSE or the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and the right to complain. There are no plans at this time to initiate a review as provided for in section 75 of the Mental Health Act 2001.</P>

Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the HSE in the north east that work is to commence immediately with arrangements to facilitate the installation of a new six slice CT scanner for Louth County Hospital. To facilitate the installation of the scanner, substantial electrical upgrading and some building works must be carried out. Funding for this project will be made available in 2006. It is envisaged by the executive that this work will be completed before the end of September 2006 and that the CT scanner will be operational in October 2006.</P>

	<P>I am extremely aware of the negative effects of harmful drinking in society. These occur across a range of acute and chronic indicators including violence, public order offences, drink driving, under age drinking, unsafe sexual practice, lost productivity, accident and emergency department attendance, certain cancers and suicide.</P>
        <P>The strategic task force on alcohol was established to recommend evidence-based measures to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm and published two reports with more than 100 recommendations. I am hopeful that with the full implementation of these measures we will begin to address the serious problems associated with harmful drinking.</P>
        <P>A working group on alcohol was also recently established to help mobilise the stakeholders through social partnership to achieve a targeted and measurable reduction in alcohol misuse. The working group operates in the context of the special initiative on alcohol and drug misuse under Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>The working group comprises the social partners, the relevant Departments, the Garda, the national drugs strategy team and the Health Service Executive. The working group seeks to agree a programme of actions which can deliver targeted results on under age drinking, binge drinking and drink driving. It is expected to produce a set of recommendations in late 2005.</P>

	<P>It is accepted that the current infrastructure at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children does not generally meet the standards required for a modern paediatric hospital. The available facilities do not satisfactorily accommodate the range and extent of current clinical and associated activity. In recognition of this, a project team was established to plan for the overall future development of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, either on the existing hospital site or at an alternative greenfield location.</P>
        <P>The project team undertook a detailed examination of the potential to redevelop the hospital on its present site. The project team concluded that the existing clinical services could be retained and developed on the present site but also set out the implications of such an approach in terms of time, cost and disruption to services. As a consequence it is likely that the new hospital will be located at an alternative site.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Health Service Executive to arrange for a review to be undertaken of highly specialised paediatric services to ensure they are provided in the most efficient and effective manner. The outcome of this review will help to inform the decision on the range of services to be provided at the new Crumlin hospital. I expect this review to be completed as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that a site option appraisal study will be carried out when the review has been completed. The focus of that study will be to evaluate the options for the relocation of the hospital, leading to the acquisition of an alternative site, if such is recommended by the process. The study will be subject to public tendering procedures.</P>

	<P>Under the General Medical Service, GMS, scheme contract, which participating general practitioners hold with the Health Service Executive, general practitioners are obliged to provide surgery and domiciliary visits, where appropriate, for their medical card patients, for 40 hours each week, at times and locations as agreed with their local area of the Health Service Executive. They must also make arrangements to enable contact to be made with them or a locum-deputy for emergencies outside of these hours. It should be noted that general practitioners make a clinical decision on whether a domiciliary visit is appropriate based on the symptoms of the patient, as presented to them at the time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The GMS scheme provides for a choice of doctor for the patient. A person who no longer wishes to avail of the services of the general practitioner with whom he or she is registered may seek to be transferred to the list of another participating GMS general practitioner in his or her area. Requests for such transfers are made to the local area of the Health Service Executive by the medical card holder and are arranged as soon as possible. In some instances, for example, where patients themselves fail to secure their doctor of choice, they may be assigned to doctors by the <Col N="570"/>HSE for short periods but such decisions are matters for the HSE to make bearing in mind the particular local issues involved.</P>

	<P>The national BreastCheck screening programme commenced in 2000 and covers the eastern, midland, north-eastern and parts of the south-eastern regions of the country. Screening is being offered free of charge, every two years to approximately 160,000 women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of the national breast screening programme to the remaining regions in the country is a major priority in the development of cancer services. A design team has been appointed to work up detailed plans for two new BreastCheck clinical units, one at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork and the other at University College Hospital, Galway. It is anticipated that, subject to obtaining satisfactory planning approval, the design process including the preparation of the tender documentation will be completed by mid 2006.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck has advertised for lead consultant radiologists and radiographers for the two new clinical units. The recruitment of other key clinical posts will commence early in 2006. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of 2007 for commencement of the roll-out will be met. This will ensure that all women in the 50 to 64 age group in every county have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition for the treatment of that condition through the long-term illness scheme, LTI. The LTI does not cover general practitioner fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness &mdash; for people under 16 only &mdash; phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>The medical card, GMS, and drugs payment, DPS, schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. People who do not hold a medical card and people with conditions not covered under the LTI, can use the drug payment scheme, DPS. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, the Government provided funding for an additional 30,000 medical cards and for 200,000 new general practitioner visit cards which allow holders to receive general practitioner services free of charge. In June this year, I simplified the means test for both medical and general practitioner visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. On 13 October 2005, I announced that the income guidelines for both medical and general practitioner visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than this time last year.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is to bring strategic focus to the issue of crisis pregnancy and so to add further value to the work of existing service providers. The function of the agency is, through the development and implementation of this strategy, to effect a reduction in the number of crisis pregnancies and to ensure the provision of supports and services for women faced with crisis pregnancy, both during and after the pregnancy itself. The agency works toward the reduction in the number of women experiencing a crisis pregnancy in a number of ways, some of which include the following.</P>
        <P>On education initiatives aimed at preventing crisis pregnancy, the agency, through the development of the You Can Talk To Me cam<Col N="574"/>paign, supports parents as the primary educators of young people on sex and relationships. The agency&rsquo;s Think Contraception campaign is directed at sexually active young adults to educate them on the risks associated with unprotected sex. The CPA has just produced a resource targeting older women on issues such as fertility, contraception and sexual health to again educate them on risks as many women in the older age group can experience crisis pregnancy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agency has, since its inception, strongly supported the development of crisis pregnancy counselling services nationally. The agency has increased counselling services by 50% enabling women all across the country to access free, non-judgmental counselling. Counselling plays a valuable role in diffusing the sense of crisis for the woman, allowing her to explore her choices; it is the belief of many counsellors that good crisis pregnancy counselling can help the woman, who might have opted for abortion, to explore other options. On funding, the agency has invested strongly in the development of services nationally such as adoption services, supported accommodation, youth health services, information services, etc.</P>
        <P>It is the belief of the agency that the achievement of its strategic objectives over its ten-year remit will reduce the incidence of crisis pregnancy and thereby the number of women who choose abortion. There has been a reduction in the number of women giving Irish addresses at UK abortion clinics in the past three years as shown in the following table. The agency believes that its actions have in part contributed to this reduction. However, the agency believes that abortions figures should be mapped over five years to assess any emerging trends.</P>

A person must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions: be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; be without both hands or without both arms; be without one or both legs; be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; or have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. It is wholly a matter for the relevant senior area medi<Col N="577"/>cal officer within the HSE to determine whether or not a particular applicant qualifies for the primary medical certificate under the scheme. The medical officer is independent in this function. A refusal of the primary medical certificate is appealable to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal.

	<P>There is no statutory obligation on insurance companies to provide insurance to householders. Whether an insurance company accepts an insurance proposal in respect of a risk is a commercial decision and insurance companies vary in the business they are prepared to accept. Accordingly, people having difficulty obtaining insurance should shop around as some proposals for insurance may be accepted by one company but declined by others. The financial regulator has published a guide to home insurance entitled Independent Consumer Guide to Home Insurance. This is available from the regulator at <i>www.financialregulator.ie</i>, by telephoning his consumer helpline at 1890 77 77 77 or by calling to his information centre at 6-8 College Green, Dublin 2. In addition, the Irish Insurance Federation provides a free insurance information service for members of the public.

	<P>The Government is pleased with the numbers of people who have applied to decentralise. Approximately 10,600 applications have been received so far and new applications are being received each week. Of the total number of CAF applications received to date 5,600 are from civil and public servants located in Dublin. Since the closing of the priority application period on 7 September 2004, an average of more than 100 new applications have been received each month over the past 14 months. We have no reason to believe this rate of application will reduce as the CAF remains open and continues to accept further new applications.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14- ?>
        <P>With regard to promotional opportunities, discussions with the unions representing general service grades in the Civil Service are at an advanced stage, while discussions with the unions representing professional and technical personnel are also ongoing. The decentralisation implementation group, in its June report, reinforced the responsibility of management within the various state agencies to progress the implementation of Government policy in this regard. It went on to state progress should be monitored by the respon<Col N="579"/>sible Department and requested that the next and deeper iteration of each agency&rsquo;s implementation plan be prepared. I understand that agencies are preparing these plans at present. My Department has recently reached agreement with the unions representing general service civil servants on arrangements for those remaining in Dublin.</P>

	<P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>The new scheme of child minding relief I announced in budget 2006 is designed in part to increase supply of child care and to bring informal resources into the more formal sector. Under the new scheme, where an individual minds up to three children in the minder&rsquo;s own home, no tax or PRSI will be payable on the child minding earnings received, provided the amount is less than &euro;10,000 per annum. An individual will be obliged to return his <Col N="582"/>or her child minding income in his or her annual tax return and also to notify his or her county child care committee that he or she is providing a child minding service. These committees provide support, information and small grants to the sector.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>It is envisaged this new scheme may be attractive to stay-at-home parents or individuals who work part-time who wish to earn some income from looking after children of friends or neighbours. This new scheme should not be seen as a threat to the formal sector. It should be seen as increasing the range of choice available to parents. There are also measures in the budget that will assist quality commercial child care providers by helping with parents&rsquo; ability to purchase such care. These measures are in addition to the very considerable reduction in the income tax burden on married two earners in the past five years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new national child care investment programme, which I announced in the budget, has the aim of providing 50,000 additional child care places by 2010. This will be over and above the 41,000 places provided under the existing equal opportunities child care programme places created since the start of the programme plus 15,000 further places which are due to come on-stream before it ends.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new child care investment programme will have a capital funding stream with grant aid available to both private and community providers for the building or expansion of child care facilities and a current funding stream to assist with the staffing and other operating costs in those community facilities that cannot meet the costs from fee income alone and to underpin further development of the role of city and county child care committees. My Budget Statement provided that capital allowances for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment or extension of child care premises which meet the required standards as set out in the Child Care Act 1991 will also continue to be available. I hope the company concerned can take some comfort from the balanced set of measures and reliefs I announced in my budget.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that based on their contacts with the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office a large numbers of complaints have not been made to that office regarding accessibility to Revenue by PAYE workers. Up to 14 November 2005 Revenue&rsquo;s lo-call number for the Dublin region &mdash; 1890 33 34 25 &mdash; was manned by approximately 38 operators between 9.15 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. During this time approximately 1,300 calls were handled daily. Since 15 November 2005 the Dublin 1890 service has been operating from 9.15 a.m. to 1 p.m. However, 70 operators are assigned during this time and are handling an average of 2,100 calls daily.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Throughout this year Revenue has been experiencing significant increases in business volume and the 1890 service has been recently restricted to these hours to enable PAYE staff to concentrate on working a substantial backlog of correspondence that had built up during October and November. I am informed that Revenue hopes shortly to return to normal hours of telephone service. There is no trace of any correspondence from the taxpayer in question. It has been established that two of the attempted contacts made by the taxpayer were between 20 and 25 October when the 1890 service had to be curtailed due to the launch of an upgraded and expanded PAYE computer system. Contact has been made with the taxpayer to explain the position and obtain the information required to process her claim. As soon as the information has been received her claim will be processed without delay.</P>

	<P Just="Left">One personal assistant and one personal secretary are employed on constituency work by me. There are two executive level officers in my private office. One of the officers is an executive officer and the other is performing as an executive officer but is from OPW&rsquo;s technical stream, which is approximately an EO equivalent level. The executive officer is my private secretary and is in receipt of the allowance for that role. There is one staff officer serving in my private office who assists with constituency work. Two clerical officers are assigned to my private office. Two of the above staff were appointed in accordance with my recommendation and five are serving civil servants.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I do not propose to introduce measures along the lines suggested by the Deputy. The Revenue Commissioners have a very clear focus on ensuring and facilitating timely payment compliance. I am advised by Revenue that notwithstanding this focus it is unusual for taxpayers to seek a facility for payment of tax in advance of when it is due. The facility exists for taxpayers to make payment by cheque accompanied by a pre-encoded payslip provided by Revenue. These payslips facilitate timely and accurate processing of the payment when received by Revenue. A range of other facilities to enable taxpayers meet their payment obligations on a timely basis are also provided by Revenue. For example, Revenue&rsquo;s on-line service, ROS, is internationally recognised as providing an excellent e-business facility for taxpayers. Payment by the direct debit system is also available. In that latter regard, seasonal businesses can vary the amount they pay each month to reflect their cash flow. It is also open to a taxpayer paying by direct debit to front-load the payments under the direct debt system if he or she so wishes. Specific requirements that a taxpayer may have as regards advance payment or payment on account for VAT or PAYE can be directed to the Collector General&rsquo;s locall number 1890 203070.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as regards educational courses in countries which are not members of the European Union, income tax relief on tuition fees is available only in respect of approved postgraduate courses, that is, only where the participant already has a primary degree or equivalent qualification. An approved postgraduate course is one that is carried out in an approved college; is of at least one academic year but not more than four academic years in duration; and leads to a postgraduate award based on either a thesis or an examination. An approved college is one that is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds of that country or is a duly accredited institution of higher education in the country in which it is situated. The current maximum relief per course per academic year in respect of third level fees is &euro;5,000 at the standard rate of tax. Tuition fees paid by an individual on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian qualify for tax relief. Relief may be claimed at the end of the tax year or, for PAYE taxpayers, the relief may be claimed via the PAYE system during the tax year when the fees have been paid. Tax relief is not available in respect of administration or examination fees or in respect of any part of tuition fees that are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, by an employer or otherwise. The explanatory leaflet, IT31, in respect of tax relief on tuition fees is available on the Revenue website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>. The application form for claiming the relief is contained in the explanatory leaflet. I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that if the Deputy has a particular case in mind, they will examine such case on receipt of relevant details and give a view of the tax relief that may be available in that case.</P>

	<P>The most recent data available from the CSO, collected as part of the quarterly national household survey, regarding working days lost as a result of injury or illness relates to the first quarter of 2004. The data for Q1 2004 shows that the total number of days lost was 1,374,813. This compares with 1,286,100 in Q1 2003 and 1,441,000 in Q1 2002. A breakdown of these figures across illness and injuries is in the following table. It is not possible to calculate the cost to the Exchequer of working days lost. This would depend on a number of factors, including whether persons concerned were paid in respect of days lost or were in receipt of sick pay under the terms of their employment contract; the level of pay of persons <Col N="587"/>concerned; and whether persons concerned were in receipt of disability benefit in respect of days <Col N="588"/>lost. This level of detail is not available regarding the following CSO data.</P><Col N="587"/>

        <Quest>the tax concessions which exist for a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) scheme that provides relief from VAT and VRT on the purchase of a car adapted for the transport of a person with certain disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car up to a certain limit.</P>
        <P>The disability criteria for eligibility for the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. A person must be severely and permanently disabled and satisfy one of the following conditions: a) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; b) be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; c) be without both hands or without both arms; d) be without one or both legs; e) be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; f) have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P><Col N="589"/>
        <P>A special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The group&rsquo;s report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme. The immediate term recommendations related to the circumstances in which one could appeal from a refusal of a primary medical certificate and the operation of the disabled driver medical board of appeal and have been implemented.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, I should say that given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The best way of addressing the transport needs of people with disabilities including the effectiveness, suitability or otherwise of the disabled drivers scheme in that regard will be progressed in consultation with the other Departments who have responsibility in this area. A car tax concession scheme can obviously only play a partial role in dealing with this serious issue.</P>

	<P>Overall, the programme of site identification and acquisition is progressing satisfactorily. To date, property acquisition negotiations have been completed or significantly advanced in 23 locations.</P>
        <P>In the case of five locations, Athlone, the Curragh, Navan, Furbo and Sligo, sites owned by the OPW have been identified and will be used to accommodate decentralised offices.</P><Col N="590"/>
        <P>In the case of another four locations, Carlow, Longford, Newcastle West and Killarney, sites have been acquired from the relevant local authorities. Privately owned sites have been purchased in Buncrana, Tipperary and Clonakilty. In the case of Tullamore, the OPW has entered into an agreement to purchase an office block which is currently under construction.</P>
        <P>Contracts for sale have been received in a further ten locations including Donegal, Dungarvan, Knock, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Thurles, Carrick-on-Shannon, Trim, Cavan and Thomastown. The estimated total purchase cost for the 18 non-OPW owned sites and the building in Tullamore is &euro;35.7 million, excluding VAT.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 237, 252 and 253 together.</P>
        <P>Irish legislation on money laundering is set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994, as amended. Primary responsibility for legislation in this area rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This legislation and relevant regulations made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform implemented the EU money laundering directives of 1991 and 2001 in Ireland. A third money laundering directive has recently been adopted within the EU. This directive and other international anti-money laundering instruments are currently being examined to assess what legislation is required to give effect to them in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The procedures for the prevention of money laundering in the financial system are set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994. These primarily involve the requirement on financial institutions, and other designated bodies, to identify their customers, to have adequate anti-money laundering procedures in place, including staff training, to keep records and to report suspicions of a money laundering offence to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the Revenue Commissioners. The Finan<Col N="592"/>cial Regulator requires all institutions which it supervises to comply with the anti-money laundering legislation and relevant sectoral guidance notes, and to have in place the necessary procedures and controls to ensure such compliance. The adequacy of such systems is reviewed by the Financial Regulator in the course of its ongoing supervision of institutions and requirements for improvement are advised to institutions as necessary. The Financial Regulator is independent in the exercise of its powers.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, in accordance with its legal obligation under section 57(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the Financial Regulator is obliged to make reports to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners where, in the course of its supervision, it suspects that an institution has breached the relevant money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners regularly receive reports from financial institutions and other designated bodies where they suspect that a money laundering offence is being or has been committed. All such reports are investigated and progressed as appropriate by the relevant authorities.</P>

        <Quest>the progress to date in 2005 with regard to implementation of the recommendations of the interdepartmental group which has reviewed the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concession) 1994 Regulations; when he expects to implement new proposals in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A special interdepartmental review group reviewed the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The group&rsquo;s report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme. The immediate term recommendations related to the circumstances in which one could appeal from a refusal of a primary medical certificate and the operation of the disabled driver medical board of appeal and have been implemented.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, including the qualifying disability criteria, given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The best way of addressing the transport needs of people with disabilities of whatever kind, and the effectiveness, suitability or otherwise of the disabled drivers scheme in that regard will be considered and progressed in consultation with the other Departments which have responsibility in this area. A car tax concession scheme can obviously only play a partial role in dealing with this serious issue, and the scheme is being examined in that context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to the decentralisation implementation group&rsquo;s June 2005 report. It contains details of the indicative construction completion dates for most of the decentralisation projects. Based on this report, the major part of the programme is due to be completed by end 2009. In line with the decentralisation implementation group&rsquo;s approach, the phasing of the programme will continue to be based on the readiness of the property, staffing and business elements for each organisation involved in the programme.</P>
        <P>The position is different in respect of the State agencies. In its June report, the decentralisation implementation group took the view that it would not seek to dictate every step in the process to the management of the State agencies. Although the group proposed seven State agencies for early mover status it did not include specific timeframes in recognition of this approach and also of the fact that it is the responsibility of the board and senior management of each agency to implement Government policy.</P>
        <P>The group stated in its report that the practical management of the programme is the role of management of the agencies, that each agency <Col N="596"/>included in the programme should have a successful relocation as a high level strategic objective and should prepare the next and deeper iteration of its implementation plan.</P>
        <P>Due to the heterogeneous nature of the State agencies there are various complexities which arise in specific agencies and these problems can be addressed in conjunction with the parent Department. In the meantime, the OPW is continuing to seek property solutions in respect of any agency that requires it.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that good progress continues to be made on this ambitious programme and I look forward to seeing the fruits of this as the programme is rolled out over the next number of years.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 provide for the scheme. Since those regulations there have been no changes to the limits of tax repayable for drivers, family members of disabled passengers, and organisations providing services to disabled. The limits are as set out below:</P>
        <P LI="1">Driver: A maximum repayment of VRT and VAT of &euro;9,525; repayment of excise duty on fuel used in vehicle for transport of person with disability, up to a maximum of 2,728 litres per year; the engine size must be no greater than 2,000 cubic centimetres.</P>
        <P LI="1">Family members-disabled passenger: A maximum repayment of VRT and VAT of &euro;15,875; repayment of excise duty on fuel used in vehicle for transport of person with disability, up to a maximum of 2,728 litres per year; the engine size must be no greater than 4,000 cubic centimetres, and the car must be adapted to a cost of at least 10% of cost of the vehicle exclusive of VRT.</P>
        <P LI="1">Qualifying organisations: Maximum repayment of VRT and VAT not to exceed &euro;15,875; engine size to be no greater than 4,000 cubic centimetres; repayment of excise duty on fuel used in vehicle for transport of person with disability, up to a maximum of 4,092 litres per year; cost of adaption to vehicle must amount <Col N="598"/>to at least 10% of cost of the vehicle exclusive of VRT.</P>
        <P>Where a vehicle has been specially constructed or adapted for the transport of five or more disabled persons and the seating capacity for non-disabled passengers is not greater than twice the capacity for disabled passengers, there is no limit to amount of VRT and VAT repayable or engine size.</P>
        <P>However, the requirement that the vehicle be adapted to a cost of 10% of the cost of the vehicle exclusive of VRT, was reduced from 20% in 1996, Finance Act 1996, section 78, and from 30% to 20% in 1991, Finance Act 1991, section 121. The reductions in the threshold for cost of adaptation effectively increased the number of vehicles that could qualify under the scheme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of widespread occurrences of the problem raised by the Deputy. A statutory exemption allowing for the paying out of funds from a deceased person&rsquo;s account, other than a joint account, without probate or prior nomination of the beneficiary is available only to one type of financial services provider. Any such payment is at the discretion of the institutions concerned who must also report payments, other than those to the executor of the estate, to the President of the High Court. The amount which may be paid out is subject to a limit set by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. I would not favour increasing this limit to facilitate the paying out of SSIA funds as it could both confer an unintended advantage on a particular type of financial institution while being inequitable <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the heirs of holders of SSIAs and other savings products with all other financial service providers.</P>
        <P>It needs to be borne in mind that there are specific provisions in general law regarding the administration of an estate of a deceased person, and these must be followed before the assets of the estate can be distributed. The funds in the SSIA account constitute an asset of the estate of the deceased person. The net assets of the estate will be distributed to the beneficiaries by the executors or administrators following grant of probate or of letters of administration.</P>
        <P>The SSIA scheme commenced on 1 May 2001 and is administered by qualifying savings managers in accordance with legislation and guidelines issued by the Revenue Commissioners. In <Col N="599"/>general terms the amount of funds available on the death of an SSIA holder are set out in SSIA rules.</P>
        <P>The actual maturing of an SSIA on the death of an individual is an automatic process and is administered by the qualifying savings manager concerned. The tax liability which falls due in the event of death is arrived at by deducting, from the aggregate market value of the assets in the account, the aggregate amount of all subscriptions and tax credits made to the SSIA, in so far as that amount has not previously been treated as withdrawn from the SSIA on a partial withdrawal. A rate of 23% is applied to the resulting figure to give the tax due. Once tax has been deducted the SSIA maturity process is complete and the remaining funds become part of the estate of the deceased.</P>
        <P>In the case of an SSIA that was a deposit account from which no withdrawals had been made up until date of death, tax at 23% would only apply to the interest earned.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the independent regulator.</P>
        <P>It has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband, so my Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These metropolitan area networks, MANs, will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>Twenty MANs are now completed, and a further six are nearing completion. The second phase of the programme involves the building of MANs in a further 93 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the sector. Design and procurement has already commenced in the following six towns in Kerry under phase 2, namely, Tralee, Listowel, Killarney, Dingle, Kenmare and Castleisland.</P>
        <P>For rural communities and smaller towns, such as Keel, Castlemaine and the hinterlands of larger towns, my Department offers funding under the county and group broadband scheme to enable <Col N="600"/>these communities to become self-sufficient in broadband, in association with the service providers.

	<P>It is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which is the primary agency dealing with control and enforcement in this area, to ensure that a company fully complies with its licence and operates its plant in a manner that does not damage the water environment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am advised that in 1998 Aughinish Alumina Limited was issued with a integrated pollution control licence by the EPA. A condition of that <Col N="601"/>licence, as it relates to discharges to waters, is that Shannon Regional Fisheries Board was to be notified of all emissions that did not comply with the requirements set out in the licence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When this matter was brought to my attention recently, I asked for a report from Shannon Regional Fisheries Board in the matter. I subsequently learned from the board that the officer with responsibility for monitoring water pollution, who was aware that the EPA was monitoring and had mechanisms in place to deal with minor breaches of the IPC licence, agreed with Aughinish Alumina Limited that the company would only notify him of an emission where it exceeded the conditions of the licence by<?oasys _jy?>10%. This arrangement was undertaken without the consent of Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and is not normal procedure and, I am assured by the board, has not taken place in any other case.</P>
        <P>I am advised that following an EPA audit of the IPC licence in 2003 the agreement came to light and the EPA instructed the company to implement the conditions of the licence in full, which has been the case since 2003.</P>
        <P>The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board was unaware of this informal agreement and does not condone it. Action has been taken, the board assures me, since this matter came to light to ensure that a recurrence cannot take place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ireland welcomed the decisions at the UN world summit in New York to establish a human rights council and to double the resources of the High Commissioner for Human Rights from the UN regular budget over the next five years. During my recent visit to New York, I conveyed directly to Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General, and Jan Eliasson, President of the General Assembly, Ireland&rsquo;s continued support for the full implementation of these decisions.</P>
        <P>Negotiations on the composition, remit and work practices of the human rights council are currently under way in New York under the chairmanship of the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Jan Eliasson. Ireland is actively contributing to the co-ordinated EU input to these negotiations. In our discussions with EU partners, we have stressed that it is paramount that the human rights council should be a standing body with the ability to address serious and urgent human rights situations. It is also essential that the participation in the human rights council by NGOs and civil society allows them at least the same degree of access as they currently enjoy at the Commission on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>In addition, it is crucial that the negotiated outcome should provide for a smooth transition between the Commission on Human Rights and the human rights council. This would apply in particular to issues such as the carry-over of mandates of special procedures from the Commission to the human rights council. The establishment of a robust human rights council should lead to a stronger and more effective United Nations and to an enhanced focus on human rights issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland also welcomed the UN summit decision to double the resources of the High Commissioner for Human Rights from the UN regular budget over the next five years and stressed that this commitment must be reflected in the decisions of the UN General Assembly. Ireland has long been a firm supporter of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the work of her office and has recognised the importance of providing adequate resources to the office to ensure that it can carry out its important work. Ireland is the seventh largest voluntary contributor to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, OHCHR, in absolute terms and the largest contributor when our contribution is expressed as a percentage of gross national income.</P>
        <P>At present, revised estimates for the years 2006 to 2007, including a proposal for an increase of $24 million in the regular budget of the OHCHR, are due to be presented formally to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly for consideration later this week. This represents an <Col N="605"/>increase of 40% in regular budget funding over two years which would bring the regular budget funding of the office to $91 million and is welcome progress towards achieving the 100% increase over five years agreed at the UN summit. Ireland and its EU partners will actively support the proposals of the Secretary General on these estimates in respect of the OHCHR in the fifth committee negotiations.</P>

	<P>My Department supports organisations in the voluntary sector that are engaged in the delivery of advice and support services to vulnerable Irish people living abroad. Most of my Department&rsquo;s expenditure is disbursed in grants from the DION fund, through which we support services of benefit to our community in Britain who may be at risk of social exclusion.</P>
        <P>Since 2001, DION grants have been made to support the salaries of the staff of the Safe Home Programme Limited, a registered charity which rents its premises from Mulranny Day Centre Housing Limited, a voluntary housing body. My Department&rsquo;s grants have been towards salary costs only and we own no buildings in the complex where the offices of the Safe Home Programme Limited are located.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The details of grants extended by my Department to the Safe Home Programme Limited are as follows: in 2003, a total of &euro;82,530; in 2004, a total of &euro;157,000; and in 2005, a total of &euro;184,743.  I understand that DION grants of &euro;63,487 and &euro;82,500 were paid to the Safe Home Programme Limited in 2001 and 2002 respectively, when the DION fund was managed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I can confirm that regular reports have been received concerning the annual activities of the Safe Home Programme Limited during the time that they have received DION funding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Grants from my Department to the Safe Home Programme Limited fund the salaries and related costs of its four posts, namely, a programme director &mdash; co-ordinator, an administrator and two development workers. In this way, my Department supports the Safe Home Programme <Col N="606"/>Limited in its work in the provision of information and advice to older Irish emigrants, many of whom are resident in Britain, who are considering a return to Ireland. The Safe Home Programme Limited also liaises with individual voluntary housing bodies and local authorities throughout Ireland on accommodation for elderly emigrants returning to Ireland.</P>

	<P>The 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation deals with civil aircraft and hence its implementation in Ireland falls primarily within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Transport. The convention provides that state aircraft, which it defines as those used in military, customs and police services, are not covered by the convention and that such aircraft may not overfly or land in a State &ldquo;without authorization by special agreement or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms thereof.&rdquo; In accordance with the requirements of the convention, such aircraft must have authorisation to land in or overfly the State.</P>
        <P>The convention also provides that each contracting state may not use civil aviation for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of the convention, among which is the development of international civil aviation in a safe and orderly manner. I am unaware that any contracting state is acting otherwise than in accordance with the convention.</P>
        <P>Moreover, I have no knowledge, nor do I have any reason to believe, that flights such as the Deputy describes have passed through Irish or Irish controlled airspace. We have not permitted, and we cannot and will not permit, any flight engaged in so-called &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo; to pass through an Irish airport or through Irish or Irish-controlled airspace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government places considerable importance on the development of our relations with China. Since the launch of the Asia strategy in 1999, following the success of the first official visit by the Taoiseach to China in 1998, our links and exchanges with China have developed greatly. Educational, cultural and interpersonal links have all grown. Chinese students have been welcomed to Ireland to further their studies. Trade has increased significantly and the regular high level visits in both directions clearly demonstrate the strengthening of relations.</P>
        <P>President McAleese undertook a State visit to China in October 2003 and met, among others, President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. The Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Ireland in May 2004. The Taoiseach held a bilateral meeting with Premier Wen in the margins of the ASEM V Summit in Vietnam in October 2004 and in November 2004, the Chinese Vice-Premier Huang Ju visited Ireland.</P>
        <P>At the invitation of Premier Wen, the Taoiseach, accompanied by four Ministers, paid an official visit to China from 18 January to 22 January 2005. The purpose of the visit was to discuss and promote the further development of political, economic, social and cultural relations with China. There have also been regular exchanges of ministerial, parliamentary and official visits between Ireland and China. The Deputy himself participated in a very useful visit to China in September by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. All these exchanges enable us to broaden and deepen our relations with China and develop a mutual understanding on many issues.</P>
        <P>The Embassy in Beijing and the State agencies continue to focus actively on the promotion of Ireland in China and the development of closer relations across a range of areas. In addition to the goal of doubling our level of overall trade by 2010 set by the Taoiseach and the Chinese Premier in January, among the key areas for taking forward co-operation with China are education, agriculture and tourism.</P>
        <P>There are, of course, also issues that remain of concern to Ireland. Dialogue on human rights occurs at every opportunity and progress in this dialogue is an important part of our developing relationship. The Government&rsquo;s approach is to seek to encourage the Chinese authorities to continue improving the human rights situation in China and we believe that this approach is the most likely to yield tangible long-term progress on respect for human rights. The Government will continue to work to strengthen our bilateral relations with China in every way possible. I hope to be in a position to visit China next year. President McAleese has invited President Hu Jintao to Ireland at a time to be agreed and this would, of course, represent a further important milestone in the development of Ireland&rsquo;s relations with China.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I travelled to the United States from 29 November 2005, returning on the morning of 2 December 2005, during which visit I attended meetings in New York and Washington, DC. On 30 November, at the United Nations in New York, I met the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the President of the UN General Assembly, Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden. I reviewed with them progress in the implementation of key elements of the outcome of the UN world summit of last September, including the peacebuilding commission, the human rights council and management reform at the UN. I told them that Ireland would remain fully engaged in the process of implementation and assured them of the Government&rsquo;s support for their efforts in this regard. The UN Secretary General reiterated his support for the role that EU battlegroups can play in UN-authorised peacekeeping.</P>
        <P>Afterwards I attended a lunch at the United Nations to mark the 50th anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the UN, which falls this month. The lunch was organised by the Irish Studies Department of New York University, Glucksman House, and was attended by the UN Secretary General and senior UN officials as well as invited guests drawn largely from the Irish-American community.</P>
        <P>On 1 December 2005 I had meetings with Senator Edward Kennedy and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Washington DC. I also had the opportunity to speak with the US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mitchell Reiss, and to brief him on current developments.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to meet Senator Kennedy, who has been a generous and committed friend to Ireland throughout his many years in office. I took the opportunity to thank the Senator for his unstinting support for the peace process and underlined the continued importance of close US engagement in Northern Ireland. We discussed recent developments and I stressed the Government&rsquo;s determination to take concrete steps towards the restoration of devolved Government at the earliest opportunity next year.</P>
        <P>The Senator and I also discussed the welfare of undocumented Irish people in the US. We reviewed the overall prospects for US legislative reform and I expressed our deep appreciation for his exceptional efforts on this issue in Congress. I also briefed the Senator on the Shannon issue.</P>
        <P>In my meeting with Secretary Rice later that day, we discussed a number of bilateral and foreign policy issues. The bilateral discussions concerned developments in Northern Ireland, US immigration law reform and the question of <Col N="611"/>extradition between the US and Ireland. The foreign policy issues discussed were the Middle East peace process, Iraq, Afghanistan and UN reform, as well as rendition allegations and related issues.</P>

        <QRef>[39315/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The 2006 Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs consists of two Votes, that is, &euro;186.6 million for Vote 28, Foreign Affairs, and &euro;600 million for Vote 29, International Co-operation or overseas development assistance.</P>
        <P>The allocation provided for Vote 29 represents an increase of &euro;129 million or 27% on the 2005 level and is the highest increase in the 31 year history of the aid programme. Taken together with the contributions of other Departments, total overseas development assistance is expected to reach a record &euro;675 million in 2006. Based on current anticipated growth rates, this will bring the aid budget next year to 0.47% of GNP. To put it another way, we will spend &euro;160 for every man, woman and child in the country in 2006 to help the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world.</P>
        <P>With regard to Vote 28, I am particularly pleased by the 45% increase in funding for emigrant services. The allocation for 2006 will now reach &euro;12 million and will enable my Department to help fulfil its commitment to assist the poor and vulnerable amongst Irish citizens living abroad, particularly those living in Britain. It will also go towards funding Irish immigration centres across the United States and will help ease the plight of some of the many undocumented Irish citizens living in stressful circumstances there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Additional funding for the promotion of trade and cultural activities will improve our capacity to promote the country from a business perspective and to further enhance awareness and appreciation of Ireland and Irish culture overseas. I also welcome the extra allocation to support our commitment to the United Nations, by way of increased financial contributions and the significant increase in the grant aid to the European movement in Ireland to help raise public awareness of the European Union and to stimulate debate on EU matters.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the 2006 Estimates allocation will assist the Government in meeting its international objectives, will facilitate my Department in meeting its high level goals and objectives and will satisfactorily fund its operations at headquarters and in the 75 missions abroad, where our officials are engaged in promoting the country&rsquo;s <Col N="612"/>interests and in protecting the well-being and safety of Irish citizens.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 and 274 together.</P>
        <P>I have, of course, noted the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the Irish Genealogy Project. I have requested Irish Genealogy Limited to prepare a 2006 business plan identifying a future course of action to progress the project. I can confirm that Irish Genealogy Limited has produced this 2006 business plan, which may be obtained from Mr. Eamon <Col N="613"/>Rossi, chief executive officer, Irish Genealogy Limited, Shelbourne House, Shelbourne Road, Dublin 4.</P>
        <P>I agree fully that the completion of this project over a further 20 years is unacceptable. My officials are examining the business plan with a view to determining the future of the project and are in consultation with both F&Aacute;S and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in that regard. As major stakeholders, Irish Genealogy Limited and the Irish Family History Foundation are engaged in discussions with a view to arriving at a consolidated approach to the completion of the project in a realistic timeframe.</P>
        <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General expressed some concern in respect of value for money and the anticipated timeframe for the completion of the project. It must be borne in mind that the bulk of the expenditure relates to the engagement of F&Aacute;S trainees under the community employment programme to input the data, and that many of the trainees have gone on to secure permanent employment.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the construction industry are governed by the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Wages and Conditions of Employment) Variation Order, which is enforced by the labour inspectorate of the Department. The enforcement of the provisions of a registered employment agreement may also be effected under the Industrial Relations Acts. A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a registered employment agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of a registered employment agreement it may by order direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.</P>
        <P>There are no provisions relating to a local labour clause contained in registered employment agreements and there are currently no plans for any relevant changes to the Industrial Relations Act to make such provision. Registered employment agreements, such as that applying in the construction sector, are the result of negotiation and agreement between the parties concerned. Accordingly, it is a matter for the parties concerned to consider whether any variation in the provisions of their agreement is warranted. Such agreements attract legal enforcement status, and national applicability, as a consequence of registration with the Labour Court in accordance with the Industrial Relations Acts. It is only once the agreement has such legal status that the labour inspectorate has a role to enforce relevant employment rights terms in the agreement. It is incumbent on those parties undertaking such agreements to ensure that the terms and conditions set out are realistic to the point that non-compliance can be easily and verifiably established so as to underpin enforcement in a practical fashion.</P>

	<P>The factual position in respect of the former workers of the company mentioned is that 154 of them had been made <Col N="615"/>redundant long before the new rates of redundancy came into effect as and from 25 May 2003. As I understand it, they received substantially more than the then statutory rate in settlement with the company. Thirteen workers, who were made redundant by the liquidator of the company since May 2003, have been paid the new enhanced statutory rates from the social insurance fund by the Department. However, these amounts were less than the settlements received by the 154 workers who were made redundant before the company went into liquidation and received <i>ex gratia</i> payments.</P>
        <P>The Comerama facility was purchased by IJM Timber Engineering Limited, the Monaghan-based timber frame housing company, in March 2004. This project is expected to create 50 jobs over the next 12 months and has the potential to create significant additional employment thereafter. Of those made redundant, 150 attended for interviews with F&Aacute;S. Subsequently, 136 people were called for training and 98 of these attended. Most of this training took place between February and June 2003. Some further training was provided for a total of 35 individuals. Training was completed in 2003 and, at that time, F&Aacute;S records indicated that 50% of the workforce who had engaged with F&Aacute;S on training programmes had progressed to employment.</P>
        <P>There have been numerous representations made on this matter both by union representatives and public representatives, and a large number of parliamentary questions have been tabled in respect of the Comerama workers over the past three years. The position remains unchanged. There are no legal provisions for making additional payments from the public purse either to the 154 workers or those made redundant by the liquidator.</P>

Following a review of F&Aacute;S employment schemes, that is, community employment, job initiative and social economy programmes, on 10 November 2004, I announced that the three year cap for participants on community employment was raised to six years for those aged over 55 in order to ensure the maintenance of essential community services particularly in rural areas, where it had been found that difficulties existed in finding replacement participants.

	<P>The main purpose of the community employment programme operated by F&Aacute;S is to provide work experience and training for the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged groups and thereby enable participants to advance successfully to employment in the open labour market. Initially when the community employment programme was introduced in 1994, participation could extend from one year to a maximum of three years. However in practice, participation sometimes exceeded this limit.</P>
        <P>As part of the restructuring of community employment approved in 1999, future participation on the programme by an individual was capped at three years, effective from April 2000. This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of either training or education options, or both, where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals. The three year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. In general, approximately 20% of participants including persons less than 55 years of age benefited from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001.</P><Col N="617"/>

        <P Just="Left">These employment schemes have made a major contribution towards the provision of a network of valuable community services throughout the country. Equally, they offer participants the opportunity of work experience in a wide range of disciplines, which equips them in time to progress to full-time employment in the open labour market.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if, in view of the decline of the clothing and textile sector in Donegal his Department or the State agencies have or had a strategy to attract or promote the development of a particular sector to create alternative employment for the workers affected by <Col N="618"/>job losses in the textile and clothing sector.</Quest>
        <QRef>[39087/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past five years, IDA Ireland has actively encouraged new investment in Donegal in knowledge-based industries. This is part of a focussed strategy to replace the tradit<Col N="619"/>ional clothing and textile industries that have been declining in the north west in recent years.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, my objective is to ensure that Donegal remains a globally competitive, profitable and secure location for business in general. I believe we can best help enterprises in Donegal by continuing to implement policies that are pro-business and by implementing the right balance of enterprise supports at the right time. When provided with the best supporting and competitive environment, business and industry will develop to capitalise on investment and growth opportunities. Developing a competitive economy, resilient to the toughest competitive pressures, is the optimal approach to sustainable employment growth in County Donegal. Indeed, there have been significant job announcements for County Donegal this year, with more than 600 new jobs to come in companies supported by the development agencies.</P>
        <P>Retraining of workers previously employed in traditional sectors such as clothing and textiles is an important element in the strategy to address the relatively difficult employment situation in Donegal. F&Aacute;S will continue to play an active and positive role in providing support to workers who have lost their jobs and require retraining to take up jobs in different sectors. Services offered by F&Aacute;S to workers losing their jobs and requiring retraining include the following elements. There will be liaison with senior management in the company affected, with regard to how the process will be conducted. Information sessions for all affected workers will be provided if required. The aim of these sessions is to outline the range of support and services available from F&Aacute;S and other public bodies. F&Aacute;S Employment Services staff conduct full registration interviews with all workers. These interviews help assess suitable career progression options for each redundant worker and identify their training and development needs. F&Aacute;S prepares a skills analysis report detailing a composite of the skills of the workforce. This is available to the development organisations such as the IDA and Enterprise Ireland on request.</P>
        <P>A skills and training aspiration list is also compiled to inform F&Aacute;S of the required retraining and upskilling needs of the redundant workers. This training is delivered by various means including existing scheduled training programmes delivered by our three training centres within the region at Letterkenny, Gweedore and Sligo, or in the case of a specialist training requirement, at any F&Aacute;S centre throughout the country. Contracted training and community based training can also be availed of. In the past, F&Aacute;S increased dramatically its range of contracted training courses to meet the retraining needs of redundant workers.</P><Col N="620"/>
        <P Just="Left">Special training needs not catered for by the existing F&Aacute;S suite of programmes can be facilitated through its customised training fund, evening or weekend courses as well as e-learning options. The provision of information, career guidance and advice is an ongoing element of the service to redundant workers. Redundant workers are given initial and ongoing information and support to keep them in touch with the labour market. They are advised of the F&Aacute;S Jobs Ireland database, which allows job seekers to register their CVs and source jobs via the Internet. They are also informed of the F&Aacute;S call centre, which provides a job matching facility for job seekers and they are provided with information on the cross-Border and Eures websites.</P>
        <P>Redundant workers who do not succeed through the above interventions will be referred to F&Aacute;S once again via the national employment action plan strategy, on reaching the six month unemployment threshold. They will then be assigned a F&Aacute;S officer and become a caseload client. They will be interacted with on a regular basis to assist their re-entry to the workforce. While most workers being made redundant would have availed of at least some of the services above, approximately 1,000 workers in Donegal availed of full retraining over the last ten years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that there have been significant job announcements in Donegal recently, with over 210 new jobs announced by Zeus Industrial Products, Letterkenny and PowerBoard, Burnfoot. These projects are being supported by the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland, respectively. This was in addition to 423 jobs I announced earlier this year for the north-west region. I can assure the Deputy that the State development agencies under my auspices, namely the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S and the Donegal County Enterprise Board, are fully committed to supporting and promoting job creation and job retention in Donegal. In addition to recent job announcements, this commitment is also demonstrated by ongoing development and support by the agencies for a number of business parks and enterprise centres in Donegal. These include the completion of the IDA Letterkenny business park, the provision of a 25,000 sq. ft. advance office building at Windyhall, the completion of site development work at Ballyshannon for a new facility and also a development at Buncrana, where the IDA is working with a local developer to provide new manufacturing and office buildings. In addition to providing support for nine community enterprise centres in Donegal, Enterprise Ireland has also provided substantial support for the expansion of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology&rsquo;s business development centre and the development of a marine biotechnology centre.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I also recognise that there have been significant job losses in Donegal in recent years <Col N="621"/>as it makes the transition from traditional to knowledge-based employment sectors. This is why I have visited Donegal twice since becoming Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I have met many groups and companies on these visits to discuss both the county&rsquo;s difficulties and positive developments. My colleagues in Government also recognise the particular difficulties in Donegal and we will be working together to increase the attractiveness of the county as a location for enterprises.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 286 together.</P>
        <P>The company in question has received a total of &euro;2.6 million in grant aid since 1983. There is no outstanding grant liability. The company, which was forecasting to grow its business and introduce some research and development activities to its plant, was in discussions with IDA Ireland on supports available for future research and development investments. In August 2005, the company was acquired. The contractual arrangement for the purchase of the company was a matter concluded privately between the purchasers and the owners of the company. However, I understand from IDA Ireland that the purchase price was $54 million. The new owner operates a second manufacturing facility in Manorhamilton, following the acquisition of a mirror actuator business in 2001. At that time, it was proposed to expand this operation. Land was purchased for this expansion and planning permission was received for a new facility. At present, a building which is privately owned, is being leased in Manorhamilton. Plans to invest in the facility and grow the operation in Manorhamilton are continuing in conjunction with IDA Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been notified under section 12 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, that 120 employees of the company concerned are being made redundant at the Sligo plant. While the company cannot be specific about dates, it expects to relocate its business from Ireland during the spring of 2006 with the redundancies resulting from the relocation to conclude by year end 2006. I understand that it is the company&rsquo;s intention to enter into consultations with its employee council in accordance with the Protection of Employment Act 1977. Following the expiry of the consultation process, the company proposes fulfilling all contractual and statutory notice requirements. It is also planning to provide redundancy terms over and above statutory requirements to all employees who are made redundant. All calculations will be based on years of service with the company.</P>

	<P>The term &ldquo;fuel poverty&rdquo; has been described as the inability to afford adequate warmth in a home, or the inability to achieve adequate warmth because of the energy inefficiency of the home. The primary contributory factor is the energy efficiency of the private and public housing stock. Problems relate mainly to older housing with poor insulation and draught-proofing or inefficient heating systems. All new housing, including social housing, is being built to modern energy efficiency standards. In addition, local housing authorities are undertaking an ongoing programme to upgrade the older social housing stock and provide better living conditions generally for tenants, including draught insulation and energy efficiency. The role of the social welfare system in relation to this issue is primarily to provide income support. The main focus of Government policy is to increase primary weekly social welfare rates significantly in real terms, to enable pensioners and other vulnerable groups to meet their heating and other basic living costs more adequately throughout the year. In this regard, the budget provides for an increase of &euro;14 per week in the old age contributory pension rate, an increase of &euro;16 per week in the old age non-contributory pension rate and a general increase in other social welfare rates of &euro;17 per week.</P>
        <P>In recognition of higher home heating costs recently, the fuel allowance rate has also been increased by &euro;5 a week in this budget, with effect from January 2006. This will bring the rate of fuel allowance to &euro;14 for the basic payment and &euro;17.90 for recipients in designated urban smokeless fuel zones. This increase will cost &euro;39.7 million in a full year and bring the total cost of the fuel allowance scheme to &euro;125.1 million in 2006, benefiting some 275,000 recipients. Electricity and gas allowances are paid under the social welfare household benefits package throughout the year to over 320,000 pensioner, disabled and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs, at an overall scheme cost of &euro;108.8 million. In addition, a special heating needs supplement is available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or particular medical condition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In order to address the causes of fuel poverty, my Department is co-operating with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Sustainable Energy Ireland and the Combat Poverty Agency in an action research project to improve heating systems and insulation in selected older private dwellings and to monitor the outcomes in terms of improved cost-efficiency and household comfort and health levels. This project is due to begin shortly and should be informative in formulating future policy on this issue, as well as being of direct benefit to the pilot households involved. In the budget, I have set <Col N="628"/>aside &euro;2 million funding to extend this action research.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. It applies to travel within the State and cross-Border journeys between here and Northern Ireland. There have been a number of requests and inquiries about the extension of entitlement to free travel to Irish born people living outside Ireland, particularly in the UK. This issue has now been examined in considerable detail. The legal advice available to me is that such a proposal would be contrary to the EC treaty, which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality. While taking this advice on board, I intend to continue to examine any options that remain available. Significant improvements have been made to the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. Neither I nor my Department has any function in decisions on individual claims. In determining entitlement to rent supplement, the executive must be satisfied that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need, that the property being rented is suitable to those needs and that a bona fide tenancy exists between the applicant and his or her landlord. In considering whether or not a particular property is suitable to the needs of the applicant, account is taken of the composition of the household, particularly the relationship, age and gender of the people in question.</P>
        <P>The southern area of the Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned <Col N="629"/>was refused rent supplement on the grounds that the accommodation in question was in excess of her needs. While the person concerned was advised of the decision and of her right of appeal, the executive has advised that no appeal has been received to date from her.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In August 2005, the person concerned applied for an old age contributory pension. One of the conditions for receipt of this pension is that the claimant must have started paying insurance contributions in Ireland before reaching 56 years. Following an examination of his entitlement, his application was disallowed as he did not begin paying Irish contributions until he was aged 61 years. His entitlement to an EU<i> pro rata</i> contributory pension based upon a mixture of his Irish and UK contributions is currently being examined and he will be notified of the outcome in due course.</P>
        <P>My Department is also investigating the circumstances of the person concerned to see if he will qualify for an old age non-contributory pension.

	<P>The old age contributory and retirement pensions are payable at ages 66 and 65 respectively. The contribution conditions for the schemes also differ in that a minimum yearly average of 24 contributions is required to qualify for a retirement pension whereas an average of ten contributions will qualify a person for an old age contributory pension. There are concerns across the EU about the sustainability of social protection systems in the future. As the population ages, the ratio of workers to dependants will change dramatically. In our case, the old age dependency ratio will change from 16% to 55% by 2056. A solution to the funding difficulties facing social security and pensions systems is to increase the numbers at work. This means increased employment amongst all sectors of <Col N="630"/>society including older people. Aligning the contribution conditions for the two contributory pension schemes would, in effect, lower the social welfare pension age for many people. I do not consider that this would be an appropriate course of action in the context of the demographic changes including increased longevity and, accordingly, I have no plans to change the schemes as suggested.</P>

	<P>For unemployment assistance purposes, the assessment of means for non-householders resident in the parental home has always taken into account the yearly value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by him or her by virtue of residing with a parent or step-parent. In practice, this is taken to mean the value of free board and lodging to a claimant and such value is ascribed having regard to the level of parental income. In 1986, the commission on social welfare examined the then operation of the benefit and privilege arrangements. The commission recommended the abolition of the concept of benefit and privilege for those aged 25 years and over. In reaching this conclusion, the commission stated: </P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The reason for this cut-off point (25) is that by that age young adults would normally have become financially independent of the parental home. The minority, however, unable to obtain employment by that age or those who become unemployed at a later age should also be entitled to financial independence and it can be argued that such persons should, therefore, be entitled to a payment in their own right, irrespective of parental means. Payment at the full basic rate is appropriate in such cases.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the past three budgets, the assessment of benefit and privilege for unemployment assistance purposes was progressively abolished for persons in excess of certain ages. In this year&rsquo;s budget, announced last week, I was pleased to abolish the assessment of benefit and privilege in all cases where the unemployment assistance claimant is aged 25 or over, thereby bringing the commission&rsquo;s recommendation into full effect. This measure comes into effect in February next and will cost approximately &euro;0.63 million in a full year. In the case of unemployment assistance claimants aged under 25, the maximum assessment is restricted to 17% of parental income. A minimum of &euro;40 is payable where the claimant <Col N="631"/>qualifies for any amount of unemployment assistance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 298 and 299 together.</P>
        <P>The social welfare system is based on income replacement with entitlement related to defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age and widowhood. Social welfare legislation provides that, with few exceptions, only one social welfare payment is payable at the one time. This approach is common to most social security systems across the world and is intended to ensure that resources are applied to the best advantage in meeting the income needs of people who experience the contingencies covered. There are three main principles which underlie the operation of the PRSI system. As already indicated, only one income support payment may be paid at the same time. The contributory principle requires that those qualifying for benefits demonstrate an ongoing and adequate attachment to the social insurance system. Finally, the principle of solidarity means that contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits at the individual level, but can be redistributed to support other contributors. Persons may find that they cannot benefit from the full range of contingencies applicable to their particular circumstances. However, for the reasons outlined above this does not justify a refund of contributions made over the years.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemakers scheme which was introduced from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least ten contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the social welfare system comprises two types of pension; contributory pensions based on social insurance contributions and non-contributory pensions, payment of which are subject to a means test. Within that basic structure, the Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for pensions in their own right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of measures have been introduced over the years which make it easier for people to qualify for contributory pensions. These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to ten and the introduction of special half rate pensions based on pre-53 insurance contributions. <i>Pro rata</i> pensions are also available to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment. This set of measures is of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home.</P>
        <P>There are, of course, those who will not benefit from the homemakers scheme and who cannot qualify for a pension in their own right. In this regard, the Government is committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults aged 66 or over to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension and to facilitate <Col N="633"/>the direct payment of the allowance to spouses and partners.</P>
        <P>Budget 2006 increased the qualified adult rates for age 66 or over by &euro;10.80 per week for contributory pensioners and by &euro;10.60 per week for non-contributory pensioners. Also, since 2002, new pension claimants can now opt to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to their spouse or partner. The administrative and legislative implications of enhancing these provisions are under active consideration by my Department and I intend to progress the matter in the coming year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards the non-contributory pension, in budget 2006 I made changes to the income disregards allowed under the means test. The basic income disregard was increased by &euro;12.40 per week to &euro;20 and I also introduced an earnings disregard of &euro;100 per week. These allowances are doubled in the case of couples and will allow more people to qualify for social welfare pensions.</P>
        <P>I will continue to look for ways, within the current social welfare structure, in which the needs of older people who are at present outside the social welfare pensions system may be addressed.</P>

	<P>Deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit is a payment made to a woman deserted by her husband. Entitlement to payment is based on social insurance contributions paid by the wife or her husband. An earnings limit was introduced for deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit in 1992. The limit, which applied only to new claims after August 1992, was set at &euro;12,697.38 a year, gross earnings. Where earnings are in excess of &euro;12,697.38 a year, there may be entitlement to a reduced rate of payment of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit, provided gross earnings do not exceed &euro;17,776.33 a year.</P>
        <P>Following the introduction of the one parent family payment in 1997, the deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit scheme was discontinued with effect from 2 January in that year. The scheme for deserted wives under social insurance has been retained to the extent that existing entitlements already acquired in August 1992, when the earnings limit was introduced for new claimants, and in 1997, when the one parent family payment scheme was introduced have been preserved.</P><Col N="634"/>

In order to receive EU-WVTA, a car must meet the technical specifications for a range of items, including the glazing and the field of vision of drivers, which are set down in a series of separate directives. It is not open to a member state to prohibit the sale or entry-into-service of a car which has EU-WVTA.</P>
        <P>Under the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963, which specify vehicle in-service standards, a vehicle must be constructed so that the driver can at all times have such a view of the road and of other traffic on the road as is necessary to enable the vehicle to be driven safely. It is a requirement under these regulations for a windscreen to be fully transparent so as not to distort the driver&rsquo;s view. Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Concerns have been expressed about modifications to the glazing and exhaust systems of motor vehicles which result in excessively &ldquo;blacked-out&rdquo; windows and noisy exhausts and it has been suggested that such modifications could be made reasons for failure of the NCT. I would like to clarify matters in that regard. Before proceeding to review existing NCT arrangements, it would be necessary to develop national technical standards for glazing opacity in relation to motor vehicles and then, taking into account the results of regulatory impact assessments, to amend the Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles Regulations and the NCT Regulations taking account of these standards. It would also be necessary to submit the draft amending regulations to the European Commission for consideration and for referral to other member states in accordance with the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 98/34/EC before they could come into force. A timeframe in the order of 12 months would be required to complete such a course of action.</P>
        <P>Given the complexity of the issues relating to the modification of vehicles, I intend to have the matters of excessively &ldquo;blacked-out&rdquo; windows, noisy exhausts and some other issues examined by an expert group. In that regard, one of the recommendations contained in the Price<Col N="635"/>waterhouseCoopers report on the mid-term review of the NCT is the establishment of a technical standards forum to consider and make recommendations in relation to vehicle technical matters associated with the NCT. It is my intention to implement that recommendation and, in that context, the matters of excessively &ldquo;blacked-out&rdquo; windows will be referred to the technical standards forum for consideration upon its establishment. Until such time as I receive the views of the forum on these matters, it would be premature to introduce changes to the existing statutory requirements.</P>

This training will be provided by dedicated training officers within the driver testing service. On appointment and subject to meeting the necessary standard, successful candidates will be appointed as driver testers and are expected to be operational by April 2006. Their period of redeployment will cease at the end of July 2007. The redeployed staff will operate within the normal working schedule of the driver testing service.</P>

	<P>The provision of public bus services on specific routes is a commercial and operational matter for bus operators. It is open to any private operator who may be interested in operating a bus service to apply to my Department for an annual passenger licence under the Road Transport Act 1932. Similarly, it is a matter for the State bus companies to notify my Department of any proposals to operate new bus services or to alter any existing services.</P>
        <P>The Department has not received a request for a town service or for a commuter service between Sligo town and Collooney as mentioned by the Deputy. However, there are four licence applications from private operators and two notifications from Bus &Eacute;ireann under consideration in my Department for bus services, which cater for travel between Sligo town and the towns in the surrounding counties. One licence application and one Bus &Eacute;ireann notification concern proposed new services. The others concern amendments to existing services. These applications and notifications are currently being processed.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of the interconnector along with the provision of the DART on the Maynooth and Kildare lines which will be prepared for electrification by 2010 which will provide the greatest public transport capacity improvement in the Transport 21 plan; the reason same has been scheduled to be completed last in 2015.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The interconnector is intended to be the final phase of a <Col N="637"/>programme to extend and reconfigure the DART and suburban services and to provide higher capacities, frequencies and integration of services to meet forecast demand levels in the Dublin inner-suburban area and to develop an integrated transport system for the capital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The phased programme involves implementation initially of projects to meet short to medium-term demand levels, including the city-centre resignalling project, the quadrupling of a critical section of the Kildare line between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch, the opening of a new station in the docklands, and the opening of the first phase of the Navan rail link as far as Pace, near Dunboyne. While these projects are underway, detailed technical, planning and design studies, as well as the Railway Order and procurement processes will be completed for the interconnector. Construction will start in time to achieve completion of the tunnel, the underground stations and the electrification programme by 2015, thus providing the additional capacity required on the suburban rail network for longer term needs. It is considered this phased approach to implementing Transport 21 is adequate to address changing demand levels. It also addresses the management of the construction programme by, for example, phasing tunnelling work in the city centre, with tunnelling work on metro north preceding the interconnector. Finally it makes sense from the perspective of the effective management of the overall capital envelope.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of the Government&rsquo;s statement that Transport 21 must deliver value for money, the way in which same is consistent with the waste of public money in digging Stephen&rsquo;s Green up twice in a three year period first for the metro north station and then for the interconnector station and purchasing additional Arrow rolling stock for the Kildare and Maynooth lines by 2010 and to replace these with DART rolling stock in 2015.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I said at the launch of Transport 21 that I was convinced that we need a new approach to transport in the greater Dublin area, delivered through a single authority with the power to ensure joined-up thinking and delivery across all transport modes. The St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green interchange facility is a good example of where such joined-up thinking is an absolute necessity. I have appointed a team chaired by Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony to finalise the remit, structures and human resource requirements of the proposed authority and I look forward to receiving the report of the establishment team in the new year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under Transport 21 the metro north line between St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and Swords will be completed by 2012 while the interconnector <Col N="638"/>between Heuston station and the docklands will be completed three years later in 2015. These lines will connect with Luas at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green. Clearly construction of the new underground station for both metro and the commuter rail services at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will need to be effectively managed in order to ensure the maximum efficiencies are realised and that disruption is minimised. In this regard it is envisaged that there will be a single interchange station at this location.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to rail rolling stock, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is currently finalising a rolling stock strategy to meet current and future needs. The company is currently acquiring diesel railcars to meet the ever-increasing demand for services on suburban routes. When the interconnector between Heuston station and the docklands is completed a number of suburban lines will be electrified and DART-style carriages will be acquired to operate on these routes. At that time, the diesel railcar fleet will be used on new routes, will enhance existing outer suburban services and will replace life-expired rolling stock. I expect to receive the rolling stock strategy from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in the near future.</P>

        <P>I am not aware of the research that the Deputy is referring to. Statistics relating to road accidents, based on information provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are published by the National Roads Authority, NRA, in its annual road accident facts reports. The most recent report, entitled Road Collision Facts, relates to 2003 and is available on the NRA website. Reports relating to previous years are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The reports do not provide a breakdown of the licence status of drivers involved in traffic collisions in which death or serious injury occur nor do they contain details of the makes or models of vehicles involved in road traffic collisions. They <Col N="639"/>include an analysis of factors contributing to collisions in 2003, where such factors were listed by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on collision report forms. This analysis indicates that driver error accounted for some 86% of all contributory factors identified while the figure for vehicle factors was only 0.3%.</P>

	<P>The Road Transport Act 1932 provides the legislative basis for entry to the public transport market by private bus operators. In accordance with this legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for passenger licences to provide bus services on specific routes within the State. In accordance with long standing practice, details of all applications received in my Department remain confidential until a decision is made. In this particular case, the local authority concerned is not in a position to provide the necessary facilities to support the services they envisage.

	<P Just="Left">Transport 21 will provide funding for a number of pilot sustainable transport initiatives to facilitate the mainstreaming of sustainability criteria into transport investment decision-making and to make cleaner, more environmentally-friendly vehicles available. I intend that these pilot projects will test biofuel and hybrid-electric technologies, and eco-driving techniques in public transport, the haulage industry and taxis. Details regarding the level of funding for, and the conditions applying to, pilot projects will be announced at a later stage following the completion of consultations with interested parties.</P>
        <P>The inclusion of these projects is but one of the sustainable aspects of Transport 21. The investment framework also provides for a major rebalancing of investment in favour of public transport, which will see public transport capacity almost double over the period of this investment programme thereby facilitating modal shift to public transport.</P>

However, as regards the three State airports, I am informed by the airport authorities for Dublin, Shannon and Cork that their estimate of the numbers employed, both by themselves and by other employers, including airlines operating from the airports, is in the region of 15,500, 1,500 and 3,200 respectively.</P>

        <Quest>if there are formal guidelines for local authorities specifying the technical procedures to be followed to evaluate the hazards on a given road in order that the appropriate speed limit can be set; and if there are formal definitions to enable local authorities to decide whether a particular stretch of road is to be considered an urban road or a rural road for the purposes of setting an appropriate speed limit.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislative basis for the application of speed limits on roads generally is set out in the Road Traffic Act 2004. That Act establishes a range of speed limits that apply to particular classes of road on a default basis and also provides the basis for county councils and city councils to apply special speed limits in lieu of the speed limits that apply on a default basis to roads and motorways.</P>
        <P>The power to apply special speed limits is given under section 9 of the Act to the elected members of county and city councils acting following consultation with the Garda, the written consent of the National Roads Authority in respect of proposals for national roads and motorways and a public consultation process.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the 2004 Act also provides that the Minister for Transport may issue guidelines to county and city councils in relation to the application of special speed limit by-laws. I issued such guidelines on 18 April 2005 to the county and city managers. A copy of the guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library and may also be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 provides that a county or city manager may make a road works speed limit order for the application of a speed limit on any road or part of a road, <Col N="644"/>including a motorway, where road works are being carried out. A road works speed limit order can be applied for any period of not more than 12 months and the minimum speed limit that may be put in place by such an order is 30 km/h.</P>
        <P>In addition, <i>Traffic Management Guidelines</i>, jointly published in May 2003 by my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Dublin Transportation Office, set out guidance and advice to local authorities in relation to speed management and traffic calming generally. The deployment of speed-traffic calming measures is a matter for the determination of local authorities. A copy of this publication is also available in the Oireachtas library.</P>

        <P>These aircraft landed for technical purposes, that is, they were technical or refuelling stops. As stated previously in accordance with the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, aircraft may come into Ireland for technical stops such as for refuelling purposes, without notifying the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>I understand that the US authorities have confirmed to the Department of Foreign Affairs that the US has not used Irish airports for the transit of prisoners.

Transport 21 takes account of the linkages between transport and land use and spatial planning so as to develop a transport system that contributes to sustainable development in all its dimensions, economic, social and environmental.</P>
        <P>In particular development of Transport 21 was informed by and supports the policies set out in the national spatial strategy. It also takes account of the regional planning guidelines adopted during 2004 and supports a number of regional land use and transportation strategies for the cities, such as the Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s long-term strategy, A Platform for Change.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, strategies are in place at national and regional-local level to ensure that land use and transportation planning and investment are undertaken in a co-ordinated manner designed to achieve a better quality of life for people.</P>
        <P>Under Transport 21 the greater Dublin area, which includes Kilcock, will benefit from the <Col N="646"/>development of an integrated network of bus and rail services that will facilitate ease of interchange and enhanced mobility opportunities for public transport users throughout the greater Dublin area.</P>

	<P>The NRA has advised that private investment in toll road PPPs amounted to just over &euro;160 million in 2004. The NRA has also advised that the corresponding estimated investment for 2005 is &euro;137 million, of which &euro;114 million was realised to the end of the third quarter. There has been no non-toll related private investment in 2004 or 2005.</P>

	<P>Area Development Management Limited, ADM, has been central to the management of local and community development programmes since its establishment in 1992. As part of the tri-ministerial review of local and community development structures, an independent review of ADM was commissioned which recommended a number of changes in order to better reflect the context in which the company is currently operating. One of the issues to emerge from the review was the fact that the name of ADM does not reflect the nature of its current programmes that are funded by the exchequer and focus towards communities.</P>
        <P>In January 2004, the Government agreed a number of measures in order to implement the recommendations which emerged from that review. These measures included a fundamental reform of ADM to address accountability issues, to define its role as a delivery agent for Government programmes, to provide for the appointment by the Government of the board and chair and the change of the name of the company to Pobal.</P>
        <P>In relation to the similarity between the name of Pobal and the address of my Department&rsquo;s website, I think the Deputy would agree, that in the context of the worldwide web, similarly named websites can arise from time to time. The important point, however, is that the website of <Col N="647"/>my Department has a unique address which is distinct from that of the Pobal website.</P>
        <P>The name Pobal, is in my view, particularly apt, and more clearly reflects the role of the new company in delivering programmes, carrying out assessments and doing other work on behalf of Government, for the benefit of communities around Ireland.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.</P>
        <P>As part of the national drugs strategy, ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, have been established across the country covering all areas where local drugs task forces are not operating. The RDTFs work in a partnership manner, similar to the local drugs task forces and are made up of nominees from State agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sectors and elected public representatives.</P>
        <P>At the outset the RDTFs were involved in mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas, as well as the current levels of services in place to address drugs misuse in their regions. This work informed the development of action plans to address gaps in key services going forward and these were then forwarded to the national drugs strategy team, NDST, for assessment. All regional drugs task forces plans have now been assessed and allocations totalling just under &euro;5 million per annum have been made to allow them to get a range of projects up and running in their areas.</P>
        <P>The table outlines the amounts allocated to each task force.</P>

	<P>As I outlined in my reply to Question No. 75 of 30 November, earlier this year I launched four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use, as well as a training initiative focusing on frontline workers. Funding of almost &euro;400,000 was provided by me to support the pilot treatment projects and the training programme.</P>
        <P>The four projects deal with the following cohorts of cocaine users: intravenous cocaine users; poly-drug users using cocaine; problematic intranasal cocaine users; and problematic female cocaine users.</P>
        <P>The pilot treatment projects are now all operational. In regard to the training initiative, the first two levels have been completed by approximately 160 frontline personnel from various backgrounds and level 3, final part, has commenced recently.</P>
        <P>Goodbody Economic Consultants Limited, has been engaged to conduct an evaluation of the pilot projects and this work has commenced. It is expected that a preliminary report will be available early in 2006. The main thrust of the evaluation will be to analyse, in a systematic manner, what is being achieved by the projects and to report the findings of the projects and the positive <Col N="649"/>and negative lessons to be learned as a result. The evaluation will focus particularly on the structures, effectiveness, efficiency and value for money of the projects.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of the final evaluation I will be a position to decide on the next steps in this regard.</P>

	<P>The rural social scheme was established to provide income support for low income farmers and fishermen and women who are in receipt of long-term social welfare payments and to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.

        <P>If the social welfare payment made to any RSS applicant, prior to commencement on the scheme included a reduced rate for an adult dependant, as in the case in question, then that participant will only be paid that equivalent while on RSS.

His contribution to the national drugs strategy is acknowledged and appreciated. He previously indicated to my Department his intention to step down from his position last September and offered to remain as a member of the national drugs strategy team until February 2006. He also intends to remain as the community sector representative on the interdepartmental group on drugs and on the national advisory committee of the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund until replacement representatives are nominated.</P>

	<P>The letter concerns the report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture and Food on the early retirement schemes operated by my Department. The committee&rsquo;s examination of the early retirement schemes provided a welcome opportunity to air a wide range of issues and I believe that this in itself has been helpful in clarifying the position. I have provided a detailed response to the report. Regrettably, there are a number of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations that I have not been able to accept. They are precluded by elements of the EU regulations under which the current scheme and its predecessor are operated. Indeed when the same issues were raised by retired farmers with the European Commission, the Commission concluded that my Department was operating the scheme correctly. The committee made a number of other recommendations which I am considering.</P>
        <P>As far as the single payment scheme is concerned, my Department was aware from an early <Col N="655"/>stage in the negotiations of the possible implications for retired farmers who had leased their holdings. In so far as it proved possible in the context of the EU regulations governing the single payment scheme, and following lengthy discussions with the European Commission, provision was made under the rules of the scheme to address some of the concerns of retired farmers.</P>
        <P>It was open to participants in the current early retirement scheme who farmed during part or all of the reference period to activate entitlements in 2005 and lease them to their existing transferee. In cases where the transferees did not want the entitlements, the transferors, retired farmers, who have already activated the entitlements have until 2007 within which to lease or transfer the entitlements, with land, to another farmer.</P>

	<P>Allocations of milk quota from the national reserve are granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal examines and makes recommendations on applications for additional quota from individual producers. The tribunal also considers applications from producers whose herds have been restricted by animal disease, TB or brucellosis, during the quota year.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted an application on the grounds of animal disease in the 2004-05 year. The tribunal examined the application in December 2004 and a temporary allocation of 46,800 litres of additional quota was granted on that occasion. The person appealed this decision and in common with other appeals for the 2004-05 year, the tribunal reviewed the application when the full year&rsquo;s production was known. It recommended an additional allocation of 15,000 litres which was granted and notified to the person in May 2005.</P>
        <P>The allocations made are intended to mitigate to the greatest degree possible the impact of the animal movement restriction on producers. However, given the very high demand in 2004-05 it was not possible to remove all the levy liability for restricted producers. It is not possible at this stage to grant any additional quota to the named person or to otherwise reduce the super levy bill for the 2004-05 milk quota year.</P>

	<P>Japanese knotweed, <i>Reynoutria japonica</i>, has not been classified as a noxious weed under the Noxious Weeds Act 1936 on the basis that it has no agricultural significance and is not harmful to animals or crops. It has grown in this country over the past 100 years, mainly on wastelands, roadsides, railways and riverbanks.</P>

        <Quest>the measures which are being taken to prevent the establishment of ragwort and other noxious weeds; if her Department is complying with the Noxious Weeds Act 1936 in this regard; if a code of good practice regarding same has been drafted and implemented; the number of occupiers of lands failing to destroy same who have been prosecuted in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; the budget available for eradication measures; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Noxious Weeds Act 1936 provides for the control of the spread of the following six noxious weeds: thistle, ragwort and dock &mdash; 1937 order; common barbery &mdash; 1958 order; <Col N="657"/>male wild hop plant &mdash; 1965 order; and wild oat &mdash; 1973 order. Under this Act, it is an offence not to prevent the spread of certain weeds, which are scheduled as noxious weeds under the Act. The owner, occupier, user or manager of lands on which these weeds are growing is liable, upon conviction, to be fined. In the case of fences and margins of public roads, the local authority charged with the maintenance of such roads is the responsible body.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently examining the provisions of the Act with a view to updating and strengthening them in accordance with good agricultural and environmental practice. My Department has written to all local authorities charged with the maintenance of public roads, to seek their co-operation in the control of these weeds on roadsides and other areas under their control. Consideration will be given to timely press releases and to eradication campaigns in the coming year. In the present circumstances, I consider that advice and persuasion is the most appropriate policy to pursue and that the good will of local authorities and others can be relied on to take appropriate action. A Teagasc advisory leaflet is available for the control of noxious weeds and is revised in line with advances in new control methods.</P>
        <P>My Department received a number of complaints concerning noxious weeds and, on investigation, the landowners concerned were issued with a notice to destroy the weeds. Follow-up visits were made to ensure that the notices were complied with.</P>
        <P>Control of noxious weeds is now a cross-compliance requirement for single farm payment under good agricultural and environmental practice. There have been no prosecutions in 2002, 2003 or 2004 under the Act. A publicity campaign will be launched next year by my Department to raise awareness of the need to control noxious weeds.</P>

        <Quest>the number of payments with regard to the single payment in counties Sligo and Leitrim where discrepancies varied from &euro;600 to &euro;1,500 between payment and the statement of entitlements issued in April 2005 as these discrepancies were greater that the 3% modulation; her plans to have these payments issued; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The information sought by the Deputy is as follows: County Sligo, 86 cases; and County Leitrim, 94 cases. An analysis of these cases shows that claimants did not receive the full value of their notified entitlements as they failed to declare sufficient eligible lands on their SPS applications.</P>
        <P>In order to draw down full payment under the single payment scheme, applicants are required, under EU legislation, to declare an eligible hectare in respect of each entitlement. This requirement was set out clearly in the documentation supplied to farmers on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>In such cases all of the entitlements have been activated and will not revert to the national reserve. Therefore, if applicants declare an eligible hectare in respect of each entitlement they hold they will receive their full single payment under the 2006 single payment scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The person named established 38.23 standard entitlements of his own under the single payment scheme. In addition, 66.76 entitlements were transferred to him. He, therefore, holds 104.99 entitlements.</P>
        <P>A single payment scheme application was received from the person named on 16 of May 2005 declaring a total of 74.39 hectares of forage lands. Under EU legislation, an applicant, in order to draw down his or her full single payment, must declare an eligible hectare to accompany each entitlement. This requirement was set out clearly in the documentation supplied to farmers on a number of occasions. Therefore, the person named was paid &euro;9,203.38 based on 74.39 hectares declared on the 2005 single payment application form. The payment was calculated on the applicant&rsquo;s 38.23 entitlements and on 36.16 of the entitlements transferred to him. If the applicant declares sufficient land on his 2006 single payment application, he will be in a position to claim on his full entitlements next year.</P>

	<P>My Department has in place control measures to monitor the importation of both GM seed and GM animal feed materials.</P>
        <P>National legislation is in place requiring all importers of bulk feed material to give my Department prior notification of such material being imported. Documentary checks are carried out on these imports to ensure compliance with the labelling requirements as set out in EU Regulation 1829/2003/EC on GM food and feed. In addition, there is a targeted sampling and analysis system in place, with particular emphasis being placed on imports not labelled as GM.</P>
        <P>There are currently no GM seed or GM crops being imported into Ireland. My Department participates, along with many other member states, in an informal arrangement, referred to as the &ldquo;interim action plan&rdquo; whereby all seeds imported must be accompanied by a certificate, from a recognised laboratory, indicating that each seed lot has been tested and found to be free of any EU unauthorised GM content or within the threshold for approved GM events. The thresholds used are those proposed by the Commission but are as yet not approved and are 0.3% for cross-pollinating crops and 0.5% for self-pollinating crops. This plan applies to seed of beet, maize, oilseed rape, cotton and tomato.</P>

Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and/or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</P>

        <P>It should be noted, however, that the rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him.</P>

	<P>Under EU regulations, extensification premium for 2004 may only be paid where the stocking density of a holding does not exceed 1.8 livestock units per hectare. The stocking density of the holding was determined by dividing the average number of bovine livestock units at five census dates, plus the total number of sheep livestock units, by the declared forage area. The person named declared a forage area of 13.12 hectares on his 2004 area aid application form. Since the stocking density of the holding in this case amounted to 1.8856 livestock units per hectare in 2004, the person named is not eligible for extensification premium.</P>

Under EU legislation, an applicant, in order to draw down payment in respect of standard entitlements, must declare on the single payment application form submitted, an eligible hectare to accompany each entitlement.

The findings of the appeals committee were that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 368 to 370, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There have been no deportations to Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, Angola or Kenya in the past year. It should be noted that consideration is given to the non-<i>refoulement</i> provision in section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, before making a deportation to any country. My Depart<Col N="668"/>ment uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries. The political and social circumstances in countries change and these are monitored over time and, moreover, are assessed in relation to the individual circumstances of the person concerned.</P>
        <P>In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 &mdash; prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>&mdash; of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned. The figures in the following table refer to persons who received notification of intention to deport under section 3(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, but were subsequently granted temporary leave to remain in the State for an initial period of one year. The majority of these would have been persons who were refused refugee status in the State.</P>

	<P>The final report of the Garda human rights audit was publicly launched in March 2005 and is available on the Garda website, <i>www.garda.ie</i>. I fully support the Commissioner in commissioning and publishing the Garda human rights audit which identifies certain shortcomings in respect of the force in an open and transparent manner. The audit focuses on: the need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to further underpin its good relations with the public by developing enhanced consultation contacts with it; increased progress in securing the rights of staff; human rights compliance at both corporate and operational levels; and deducing from the evidence available to it the presence of institutional racism in the organisation.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner fully accepts and has committed to act upon the 15 recommendations contained in the report. An action plan has been devised to give effect to the recommendations. The five priority areas in the action plan are: <Col N="671"/>developing and underpinning comprehensive human rights ethos and structure in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; accountability framework for human rights policing; policing in a diverse community; staff engagement, training and development; and community engagement, involvement and partnership.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that each of the recommendations will be introduced on a phased basis and will be in place by 31 December 2007. The assistant commissioner, human resource management, has been appointed in accordance with recommendation three of the action plan to monitor, oversee and ensure the implementation of all aspects of the report. Progress to date includes: establishment of a strategic human rights advisory committee to support the Commissioner and senior managers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; generic human rights training of all trainers; and training in human rights awareness, which has begun for all senior managers from Commissioner to chief superintendent rank.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 379 and 380 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Sligo-Leitrim division as at 31 December 1997 was 257 in all ranks. The personnel strength of the Sligo-Leitrim division as at 9 December 2005 was 269 in all ranks. This represents an increase of 12, or 4.66%, in the number of personnel allocated to the Sligo-Leitrim division since that date.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the drugs unit in the division as at 12 December 2005 was seven in all ranks. The personnel strength of the drug unit in the Sligo district as at 12 December 2005 was four in all ranks. The unit works between 9 a.m. and 4 a.m. depending on the rostered tour of duty of the members attached to the drugs unit. The unit is assisted from time to time by other uniform and detective members attached to Sligo Garda station. In addition, Ballymote, Manorhamilton and Carrick-On-Shannon Garda stations each have one member dedicated to drug enforcement and these three members also assist the drugs unit at Sligo.</P>
        <P>Garda management have informed me that local Garda management are satisfied there is adequate cover to meet the present policing needs of the area. While the drugs unit in the Sligo-Leitrim division are dedicated to drug enforcement, all garda&iacute;, <i>inter alia</i>, have responsibility for the enforcement of drugs related legislation. Local management also report that members who have previously worked with the drugs unit at Sligo are now working with the regular units at Sligo and will have brought the skills they have learned while attached to the drugs unit with them to the new units and will enforce drugs related legislation where necessary.</P>
        <P>Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. With regard to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force <Col N="673"/>strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Sligo division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

I am further informed that Tulla is part of the community policing initiative and is constantly patrolled by resources attached to Scarriff Garda station, which augments the permanent manpower attached to Tulla. A number of community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes are in place and the divisional crime prevention officer regularly attends meetings advising on personal and home security.</P>
        <P>Garda management report that roving vehicle checkpoints are conducted in rural areas in order to prevent and detect criminal activity and gather intelligence on criminals in, and travelling through, the division. The Clare divisional crime prevention officer recently conducted a security audit on rural post offices and financial institutions and recommendations for improvements have been given to the proprietors. Garda management will continue to appraise the policing <Col N="676"/>and administrative strategy employed in the Clare division with a view to ensuring an effective Garda service is maintained.</P>

	<P>The family concerned arrived in the State on 20 January 2005 and applied for asylum. Their application was refused following consideration of their case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>The mother was informed by letter, dated 13 September 2005, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her children and afforded them three options under Section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely, to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons they should be allowed to remain in the State; to leave the State voluntarily or to consent to the making of deportation orders. Their case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations received on their behalf.</P>
        <P>On 23 November 2005, deportation orders were signed in respect of the family concerned. Notice of these orders was served by registered post requiring the family to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on Monday 5 December 2005, in order to make arrangements for their deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>The family failed to present themselves as required and were classified as evaders. Garda&iacute; visited the accommodation at which the family was staying on the morning of Thursday, 8 December last and found the two children at home alone. Despite their best efforts, garda&iacute; were unable to locate the whereabouts of the mother &mdash; who apparently absconded in anticipation of the Garda visit. The children have now been placed in the care of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>In addition to the 11 factors contained in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, I must also have regard to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement, before making a deportation order. The safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether to make a deportation order. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses <Col N="678"/>extensive country of origin information drawn from independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to Nigeria and other third countries.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the person&rsquo;s applications for asylum and leave to remain, together with all refoulement issues, were comprehensively and fairly considered and that the deportation should proceed. I urge the mother to come forward and present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that a total of 1,125 student garda&iacute; were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. It is anticipated that these student garda&iacute; will be attested to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during 2006. In addition, the Garda Commissioner plans that a total of 1,100 student garda&iacute; will be inducted into the Garda college during 2006 with these student garda&iacute; being attested in 2007.</P>
        <P>Garda management states that it is not possible to give a definitive number of personnel to be appointed to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2006 and 2007. Few trainees, typically around 2%, would not be attested to the force due to failures, resignations, disciplinary proceedings, etc. at phases I, II and III of the student-probationer training programme. However, as the numbers I have given show, a significant number of garda&iacute; will be attested to the force, with full Garda powers, in 2006 and 2007.</P>
        <P>The accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the traffic corps nationally as at 24 September 2004 was 521, all ranks. The personnel strength of the traffic corps nationally as at the 19 October 2005, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 574, all ranks.</P>
        <P>I announced the establishment within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the traffic corps on 23 November 2004. The Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government. As each cycle of recruit training is completed, the Garda Commissioner will assign these new members to the areas of greatest need with particular regard to certain priorities, which include the traffic corps.</P>
        <P>The number of garda&iacute; assigned to the traffic corps will increase from the current level of 574 to 1,200 by 2008. The strength of the traffic corps will be increased on a phased basis in tandem with the recruitment of almost 1,100 recruits in each of the next three years: 2006, 805; 2007, 1,030; 2008, 1,200.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of recent high profile bank raids, a process exists for the vetting by financial institutions of applicants for jobs, to assess if they have criminal records; his plans in relation to the introduction of such a system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>It is a matter for the financial institutions to determine, through their own recruitment practices and internal security arrangements, adequate selection and ongoing supervision of their employees.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to introduce a system of State-provided vetting for prospective employees of private sector financial institutions. However, the Private Security Authority has put in place stringent criteria to ensure the private security industry operates to a high standard. In this <Col N="682"/>regard, all applicants for a licence must undergo criminal record checks by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>According to the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, trainee garda&iacute; have not been accommodated in local hotels in Tipperary, during the construction of the new facilities in the Garda Training College, Templemore. Therefore, no hotel costs have been incurred in this regard. However, garda&iacute; attending in-service training courses have transferred to an outsourced centre at the Abbey <Col N="683"/>Court Hotel, Nenagh in April this year, allowing the Garda college to concentrate on recruitment training. The facilities contracted with the AbbeyCourt include the provision of office accommodation, classrooms and lecture and conference facilities, as well as bedroom accommodation for those attending the courses. The overall costs depend, to a large extent, on usage, including the number of courses and course participants.</P>

        <QRef>[39231/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I commenced the sections of the Disability Act 2005 for which I have responsibility on 29 July 2005 by signing the Disability Act 2005 (Commencement) Order, SI 474 of 2005. With the exception of section 29, which deals with the accessibility of heritage sites and nature reserves, and Part 6, which provides for the establishment of a centre for excellence in universal design in the National Disability Auth<Col N="692"/>ority, all parts and sections for which I have responsibility have come into force either on 29 July 2005 or will come into force on 31 December 2005. The commencement of Part 2 is the responsibility of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, in consultation with the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>Key areas of the Act which commenced on 29 July 2005 include section 30, which gives me the power to request the National Disability Authority to draft codes of practice for the implementation of sections 26 to 28, covering, respectively: accessibility of public services; accessibility of goods and services supplied to a public body and accessibility of information provided by a public body. I have requested the National Disability Authority to prepare this draft code and submit it to me for my approval, in accordance with the Act. In addition, at the request of Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, the National Dis<Col N="693"/>ability Authority recently conducted seminars for public bodies to advise and support them in meeting accessibility requirements under the Act.</P>
        <P>Under section 31, the Departments of Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Transport, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Enterprise, Trade and Employment are obliged to prepare and publish sectorial service plans. These plans will set out for each of these Departments and the public bodies under their aegis the programme of measures to be taken in the provision of services for people with specified disabilities. The plans are to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible but not later than one year after the commencement of the Act, by 28 July 2006. The National Disability Authority has conducted a nationwide series of public consultation meetings on all of the draft plans, outlines of which were published on 21 September 2004 in conjunction with the Departments concerned.</P>
        <P>Among the provisions of the Act which will come into effect from 31 December 2005 are those relating to the powers of the Ombudsman in the investigation of complaints under the Disability Act and the implementation of the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in the public sector. The implementation of accessibility, employment and other provisions under the Act is the responsibility of each Department and public body.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the person in question was found dead on the Isle of Doagh, Clonmany, County Donegal on 29 January 2003. The death was fully investigated and found to be consistent with accidental drowning. No evidence was found to suggest the commission of a criminal offence. An inquest file was also prepared for the coroner who found the person&rsquo;s death was due to accidental drowning.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that following correspondence from the person&rsquo;s family and a meeting with the Garda regional assistant commissioner, a detective chief superintendent was appointed to review the original investigation. This review is ongoing. I have asked to be <Col N="694"/>informed of the result of the review as soon as it is complete.</P>

It is not possible, therefore, to include this institution in the Schedule and the redress board is not in a position to process an application in this case.</P>

The provision of a new school building on a new site to house the amalgamated school has been sought. As the Deputy will appreciate, in the interest of obtaining best value for money, my Department must give due consideration to the possibility of utilising one of the existing buildings before pursuing a greenfield site option. To inform this decision, a technical inspection of both existing school sites and buildings will be undertaken by my Department to establish which, if either, building would be suitable as a host for an amalgamated school. Officials will be in contact with the school authorities when a date is confirmed for the technical assessment.

	<P>This Government is strongly committed to improving participation and achievement at every level of education. We have put the resources and supports in place to ensure there is a wide range of course options available in the further and higher education sectors for young people who wish to continue their studies after second level and for people returning to education later in life.</P>
        <P>Post-leaving certificate &mdash; PLC &mdash; courses represent one such option. The Government&rsquo;s support for this hugely important sector is clear from the fact that we have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996-97. The number of PLC places approved for 2005-06 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004-05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188.</P>
        <P>Government support for the sector is evident not only in the expansion of approved places and teachers but also in the introduction of maintenance grants for students with effect from September 1998. Tuition fees for PLC courses are waived and the PLC maintenance grants scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education. There are nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they will receive some &euro;23 million in direct support.</P>
        <P>Other developments funded by my Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the institutes of technology. PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs. A supplemental non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. This will amount to &euro;5.5 million in 2005. Government commitment to the sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers&rsquo; pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is significant.</P>
        <P>The McIver report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations. Having regard to the number and scope of the recommendations in the report, extensive consultations have been held with man<Col N="700"/>agement and staff interests with regard to such issues as the prioritisation of recommendations, the structural changes envisaged in the report and their implications and associated costs in the context of the overall provision of resources for further and adult education. Active consideration is being given to all the issues involved. While this work is ongoing, extra investment has been provided in the 2006 Estimates to develop the PLC sector further and improve supports for other aspects of further-adult education.</P>
        <P>The Estimates include provision for the cost of the extra 100 teaching posts being provided for the post-leaving certificate colleges in the current academic year. They also provide for an increase of 19% in the VTOS non-pay grant in 2006. This Government has shown a sustained determination to expand and improve further and adult education in recent years. We believe strongly in the value of this sector and will continue to prioritise it for resources and supports in the years ahead.</P>

        <Quest>the assessment she has made of the need for a new second level school in Shankill, County Dublin; if her attention has been drawn to the views of an association (details supplied) which considers such a school to be necessary in view of the increasing primary school population and the increased residential development in the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are enough spare places in the existing second level schools in the vicinity of Shankill to accommodate all students from Shankill for the foreseeable future. The schools in Bray, Loughlinstown and Cabinteely are just a short bus journey from Shankill on the 7, 45, 45A and 84 bus routes. Many students from Shankill walk or cycle to these schools also. The all-girls&rsquo; schools in Rockford Manor and Sion Hill have always served the Shankill area and have the capacity to continue to do so. Rockford Manor can be reached by the 45 bus, while Sion Hill is easily reached by both DART and bus services from Shankill.</P>
        <P>Whether a new school is provided in any given area depends on the availability of places in the existing schools in that area and whether future population growth is likely to require more places than are available. The 2002 census showed that the population of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown electoral area grew by just 0.9% as a whole between 1996 and 2002, with some parts of the area growing considerably, while other parts <Col N="702"/>showed a marked decline in population. The population of the area is also getting older.</P>
        <P>To date, there have been plenty of places available in the existing second level schools in the vicinity of Shankill to accommodate the increase in the number of people of school-going age in the Shankill area and, given the number of spare places available in these schools, this is likely to be the case for some time. Obviously the development of Cherrywood and the Rathmichael area will create demand in the future, which will have to be considered. My Department will continue to closely monitor population statistics for Shankill and other parts of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown to ensure that any new schools that might be required will be put in place in good time.</P>

        <P>As I indicated in my statement on the publication of the Estimates for 2006, extra funding is being made available to the primary school management bodies. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the funding being provided for Educate Together is being increased to &euro;120,000. In addition, a grant of &euro;10,000 payable in two instalments of &euro;5,000 will be paid to the boards of management of newly establishing schools for training of the boards of management and staff in their initial years.</P>
        <P>Schools established in the 2004-05 school year and which are now in their second year of operation will receive &euro;5,000 as a training grant for boards of management. Those established in the current school year will qualify for both instalments of the grant.</P>

        <Quest>the reason Educate Together received no State funding towards its learn together curriculum when protestant and catholic patron bodies receive 100% funding for entire religious education departments in all teacher-training colleges.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the revised primary school curriculum, which was introduced in 1999, does not include a curriculum for religious education. In drawing up the primary school curriculum, it was acknowledged that the curriculum for RE is the responsibility of the different religious authorities, which have traditionally designed curricula, arranged and funded associated in-service development programmes for teachers, and supervised the implementation of curricula in schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the position of religious education <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the primary school curriculum, it follows that the evaluation of religious education in schools is not carried out by my Department&rsquo;s inspectorate. Instead, it has been the tradition that religious education is examined by appropriate personnel appointed by the relevant religious patron.</P>
        <P>Under the Constitution, the State guarantees not to endow any particular religion and the rights of parents regarding non-participation by children in religious education derive from the relevant provisions of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Educate Together schools are staffed primarily by teachers trained in the colleges of education. The colleges of education take different approaches in the area of religious education. In the larger colleges, part of the B.Ed. programme provides all student teachers with two methodology courses in religious education, curriculum religion. These courses focus on the teaching of the subject in the classroom. Student teachers, <Col N="704"/>who wish to do so, may also take religious studies as an academic subject in the B.Ed. programme.</P>
        <P>The question of the development of an ethical programme suitable to the needs of Educate Together schools is a matter for the patron and management authorities of the schools. In this regard, I am asking the teacher education section of my Department to establish a working group to explore with Educate Together and the colleges of education how best training support in this area can be made available.</P>

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the information regarding the number of special education teachers appointed to each school throughout County Wexford is not readily available within my Department. I can confirm, however, that at primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly <Col N="705"/>with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>At second level, approximately 1,628 whole-time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to approximately 200 teachers who were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole time equivalent learning support teachers in our second level schools.</P>
        <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education and the education partners, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

	<P>All schools in County Wexford have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, full details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. In addition, NEPS provides a service for every school in County Wexford in the event of a critical incident regardless of whether the school already has a dedicated service from a NEPS psychologist. Also in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for reasonable accommodations in certificate examinations and responds to queries in relation to individual children from other sections of my Department and from the specialist agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Within each region and each county, the need for educational psychological services is informed by the local knowledge of and research undertaken by NEPS psychologists. Particular consideration is given to factors such as school size, the incidence of special needs and evidence of disadvantage. Where possible, schools are allocated to NEPS psychologists in clusters, i.e. feeder primary schools and post primary schools. The psychological service needs of individual schools are discussed by the NEPS psychologist with the school principal.</P><Col N="707"/>
        <P>The number of National Educational Psychological Service psychologists has increased almost threefold, from 43 on establishment to 121 at present. The Public Appointments Service has recently established new recruitment panels for NEPS. Regional panels are now in place and my Department is in the process of appointing psychologists. Priority will be given to filling vacancies in areas of greatest need. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

	<P>My Department makes a specific ex-quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance to schools in the second level system. That allocation is based on the pupil enrolment in September of the preceding school year. As a result of my decision to allocate an additional 100 posts to guidance from September 2005, an enhanced guidance allocation provision was put in place for the 2005-06 school year. That enhanced provision means that in the case of schools in the free education and block grant schemes, the level of allocation ranges from eight hours per week for schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 47 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. In addition, certain schools had previously been allocated hours in response to particular needs or as part of the guidance enhancement initiative, and such schools have been permitted to retain that higher allocation for the 2005-06 school year.</P>
        <P>In the case of schools outside the free education and block grant schemes, 11 hours per week are allocated in respect of schools in the 350 to 499 enrolment category, and a full post is allocated in the case of schools with 500 or more pupils. My decision to allocate 100 additional posts to enhance existing provision reflects the importance which I attach to guidance.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the general allocation of learning support and resource teachers, LSRTs, is intended to cater for children with learning support and high-incidence special educational needs. The system was constructed so that LSRT allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the matter raised by the Deputy, officials from my Department discussed the concerns of nine north inner city Dublin schools with the Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation recently. The school authorities are advised that they may send material that they feel supports a case for the allocation of additional special needs supports in respect of pupils with high and low incidence special educational needs and learning support requirements to my Department. My officials will consider each case individually and convey the outcome of that consideration to the relevant school authority as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that it has always been the case that schools that were in receipt of resource teacher support in respect of pupils with special educational needs would lose teacher support, either full posts or part-time hours, when the pupils that triggered the extra support left the school.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s approach to tackling disadvantage has been refined to ensure that individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating schools as disadvantaged, we now provide supports commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics associated with educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers is included in the urban dimension of my Department&rsquo;s Giving Children an Even Break programme aimed at combating educational disadvantage. The school receives additional financial resources to provide educational supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils.</P>
        <P>A key element of DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion, is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools for the purposes of qualifying for resources, both human and financial, according to the degree of disadvantage experienced. That standardised system will replace all the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban or town and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools, will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together and build upon several existing interventions for schools and school clusters or communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage.</P>

	<P>I am aware that the areas to which the Deputy refers, like many located in close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places <Col N="714"/>some strain on existing educational provision. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in the areas in question. While the information sought is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy, the following is an outline of the measures undertaken by my Department to ensure that there are adequate places available in those areas to meet demand.</P>
        <P>In the Naas locality, at primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee, while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth&rsquo;s and St. Mary&rsquo;s national school and St. Conleth&rsquo;s Naofa. Temporary accommodation has also been approved at Caragh national school, St. Corban&rsquo;s national school, Gaelscoil N&aacute;s na R&iacute;ogh and Scoil Naomh Brighde.</P>
        <P>A brand new, state-of-the-art, 16-classroom school, together with a double autistic unit, was also opened this September in Naas town. This project, in particular, will assist in easing any difficulties for primary pupil places that may exist in Naas.</P>
        <P>Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David&rsquo;s national school and Two Mile House national school. The long-term accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Caragh and the Convent of Mercy are also currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level, the management authority of St. Patrick&rsquo;s post-primary School, County Kildare VEC, is currently progressing plans to relocate the school and extend capacity to 1,000 pupil places. Additionally, an extension project is under construction at St. Mary&rsquo;s College which will increase capacity at the school to 900 pupils. A similar extension is under construction at Me&aacute;nscoil Iognaid R&iacute;s, and further accommodation needs at the school are currently in planning.</P>
        <P>At Sallins national school, a seven-classroom extension is under construction. When completed, that extension will increase capacity from nine classrooms to 16 classrooms. An extension to bring the school up to 24 classrooms commenced architectural planning this year.</P>
        <P>Regarding Clane, in 2004, St. Patrick&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; school was given capital funding which enabled the school to build two mainstream classrooms and three resource rooms. The school authority recently applied for further additional accommodation. At post-primary level, Clane community school has applied for additional accommodation. Both applications are currently being assessed in the school planning section of my Department.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, and as the Deputy will be aware, following widespread local consultation, my Department recently published an area development plan for the N4-M4 corridor. That plan outlines my Department&rsquo;s long-term edu<Col N="715"/>cational strategy at both primary and post-primary level for the area, which includes Celbridge and Maynooth. Implementation of the recommendations in the plan is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2006 onwards, subject to the prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.</P>
        <P>All those initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned. The school planning section of my Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</P>

	<P>The military medical services and their facilities exist primarily to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities.</P>
        <P>The reorganisation of the Medical Corps, which was effected as part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan in November 1998, redirected the focus of military medical care from a predominantly hospital based service to one in which primary, occupational and field support would continue to be further developed. The Medical Corps facility at the Curragh is not in fact a hospital facility but a military medical facility, MMF. Military medical facilities such as the one at the Curragh have associated infirmaries for the provision of low technology care to &ldquo;living-in&rdquo; personnel, largely recruits and other training course students, who may be suffering from minor physical injury or routine type illness. The bed capacity available at the Curragh for such military personnel is quite limited. The Curragh military medical facility, MMF, cannot provide acute hospital type health services to civilian patients. There is therefore no scope for consideration of the proposal made by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>As I explained in my reply to Questions Nos. 139 to 142, inclusive, on 15 June 2004, the red safety areas are essentially two-dimensional surfaces on the ground originating 60 m beyond the runway thresholds, have a width of 300 m and diverge at a rate of 15% at each side to a width of 700 m and have an overall length of 1,370 m in the case of each runway. The runway approach surfaces are three-dimensional areas which extend outwards from the same start point as the red safety areas and the bases of which rise above the ground at a rate of 1:50 for the first 3,000 m and then at a rate of 1:40 for 3,600 m to a maximum height of 150 m above the start point to a total distance of 15,000 m from the start point. A more detailed technical explanation of such areas is outlined by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, in his replies to Question No. 480 on 16 December 2003, Question No. 415 on 3 February 2004 and Question No. 438 on 17 February 2004. Each of the four red safety areas at Casement Aerodrome comprises 160 acres approximately, while the security zone comprises approximately 1,140 acres. The red safety areas and the security zone overlap each other by 180 acres approximately.</P>

	<P>The military authorities have advised me that consistent with the regulatory requirements as defined in DFR CS4, and Chief of Staff Administrative Instruction CS4, Organisation of the Defence Forces, Staffs, Units and Other Establishments, officers have been appointed as commanding officers of Reserve Engineer, CIS, Transport and Military Police units. These appointments are effective with effect from 1 October 2005, and are filled by officers of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the voluntary nature of the Reserve Defence Force, in the absence of the commanding officer, the unit second in command, 2 i/c, a PDF officer, commands the unit on a day-to-day basis. However, the commanding officer continues to be the reserve officer and when present he or she automatically assumes command of the unit.</P>

	<P>Notwithstanding very strong demand and increased levels of mortgage lending, house price increases have moderated significantly in recent years. This moderation is attributable particularly to the very large increase in housing output, which has been a primary objective of Government policy.</P>
        <P>The recent Permanent TSB data showed an increase of 7.2% in average house prices nationally in the 12 months to October 2005 compared with 10.8% in the 12 months to October 2004. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on variations over relatively short periods in the Permanent TSB index, which is based on its own lending data.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a once-off system of registration for all quarries except quarries which had received planning permission in the five years preceding the date the section commenced, 28 April 2004. This section is intended to ensure that planning authorities have basic information about quarrying operations in their areas. Planning permission may then be required for any proposed expansion or intensification of its operations and, where necessary, new or modified controls on the operation of certain quarries may be imposed. Under the registration system quarry operators have to supply full details of their operations to the planning authority. This information was required to be supplied within a year, that is, by 27 April 2005.</P>
        <P>I understand that, in a limited number of cases, certain individual quarry operators did not register by the deadline and are therefore required to apply for planning permission to continue to quarry. However, I am happy that, overall, the statutory requirement to register under section 261 will help to ensure that the quarrying industry operates to the highest standards in planning and environmental terms.</P>
        <P>To assist planning authorities in applying the section, my Department issued guidelines on quarries and ancillary activities in April 2004 to coincide with the commencement of section 261. The guidelines, which were issued under section 28 of the 2000 Planning Act, offer guidance to planning authorities on planning for the quarrying industry through the development plan and determining applications for planning permission <Col N="722"/>for quarrying and ancillary activities. They are also a practical guide to the implementation of section 261.</P>

The job specification for the post which was circulated at that time is set out below. This emphasised strong leadership and management qualities with regard to the team of some 40 professional archaeologists employed by my Department.</P>
        <P>Applicants were required to provide details of their experience and achievements and to be rated in respect of these by their superior officers. Three applications were received and these, along with ratings by superiors, were reviewed by the assistant secretary, heritage and planning division and the assistant secretary, corporate services division. A recommendation was made to the management advisory committee of the Department and this was endorsed. Appointment as chief archaeologist was made by the Minister with effect from 22 July 2003.</P>
        <P>The appointed chief archaeologist is a qualified archaeologist who has served in the national monuments service of the Office of Public Works; the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government since 1976. He has dealt with a wide range of archaeological issues, including the archaeological survey of Ireland, conservation programmes at national monuments and all aspects of development-related archaeology. He enjoys the full confidence of his team and superiors, as well as my support. The chief archaeologist job specification is set out below.</P>
        <P>The chief archaeologist will lead the professional archaeological service of the Department. Combining strong leadership qualities, management skills and sound judgement, the chief archaeologist will be responsible for the motivation and management of a staff of approximately 40; the management of resources to efficiently deliver specific services such as the archaeological survey of Ireland, a built heritage archive and a monitoring programme for pro<Col N="725"/>tected monuments; the provision of expert professional advice on archaeology as required; the management of systems and processes to ensure that advice on impacts on archaeology are in accordance with the principle of sustainable development and Government policies; the implementation of a programme of change to further improve the quality of the professional archaeological service; the development of teamworking between archaeologists and other disciplines and sections in the Department; and such other work as may be assigned from time to time.</P>

        <Quest>the reports or professional advice he relies upon in formulating his Department&rsquo;s policy with regard to the implementation of the nitrates directive from 1 January 2006; if he has satisfied himself that the regulation as formulated by his Department will not be unnecessarily and wrongly in the name of protecting the water environment, significantly affected in an adverse way, some of the farm enterprises, in particular pig and poultry production; if the original advice received from Teagasc has been subject to revision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[39061/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme under the nitrates directive was formally submitted to the European Commission on 29 July 2005. The programme was prepared jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food, in consul<Col N="744"/>tation with Teagasc, and following an extended process of public consultation.</P>
        <P>Earlier this week, and again following public consultation, I made regulations to give legal effect to the programme and to respond the judgment of the European Court of Justice which held that Ireland was non-compliant with the nitrates directive. Copies of the regulations are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>I should point out that in the negotiation process leading to both the finalisation of the nitrates action programme and the implementation regulations, and on foot of the many submissions received, a number of significant concessions have been obtained for farmers, including postponed commencement of regulations from 1 January 2006 to 1 February 2006, this means that the first closed period will not now come into effect until late 2006, giving farmers a significant transitional period; reductions in the closed periods for spreading slurry for all areas; lesser storage requirement in counties Donegal and Leitrim; major concessions for small mixed pig farms and a new 22-month transitional period for major licensed pig farms; reduced storage requirements for farmers who generally out-winter their animals at a low stocking rate; and reduced buffer zones around water sources. The new transitional arrangements obtained for the major pig producers, together with the additional assistance measures being put in place by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, outlined below, will give that sector a significant window <Col N="745"/>of opportunity to adapt to the new regulatory regime.</P>
        <P>The making of regulations allows Ireland to pursue with the European Commission, and other member states, our case for a derogation in appropriate cases from the limit set by the directive with regard to the landspreading of livestock manure. The scientific case in support of the derogation has been prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Food in consultation with Teagasc and my Department. The scope of the derogation being sought will cater not only for intensive dairy farmers who may need a derogation for their own farming activities, but also specifically for grassland holdings importing manure from intensive pig and poultry farms.</P>
        <P>The regulations, whose provisions will have effect on a phased basis from 1 February 2006, are intended to promote sustainable agricultural development while protecting the interests of Irish farmers. The fertilisation standards provided are based on guidelines issued by Teagasc with updatings where appropriate and were subject to detailed scrutiny by EU scientific experts. They are agronomically sound and will support optimum yields while providing necessary environmental safeguards.</P>
        <P>Farmers generally, including pig and poultry producers, will have to take measures to adapt to the regulations. Some farmers will find that they need to increase their manure storage facilities. Others, particularly pig producers, may have to secure access to additional spreadlands that are in a position to accept pig manure. This is an area where farmers collectively can help themselves and each other. Pig manure contains valuable nutrients which can be used to replace expensive chemical fertilisers. I understand that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will be asking Teagasc to undertake an active promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has announced a proposed revised farm waste management scheme to be introduced as soon as possible. The revised scheme is specifically intended to assist farmers to meet the new requirements under the nitrates action programme and regulations. The Government has put proposals to the Commission which will mean that pig and poultry farmers will be eligible for the first time for grant aid for storage facilities. The level of grant aid is being increased for all farmers and will be as high as 70% in some counties. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has also announced her intention to introduce a scheme to support the demonstration of new technologies, for example, anaerobic-aerobic digestion systems, to help the agriculture sector, and in particular the pig and poultry sectors, to meet the requirements of the nitrates directive.</P>

          I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 and 489 together.  The improvement works in lieu scheme enables local authorities to improve or extend privately owned houses occupied by an approved applicant for housing as an alternative to the provision of local authority housing.  The operation of the scheme is a matter for local authorities.  I have encouraged local authorities to utilise the scheme and other social housing measures available in order to respond to the housing needs in their areas where such interventions are less costly than the provision of a new house.  Under the scheme, local authorities have delegated authority to proceed with improvement works where the cost is under &euro;75,000.  Information relating to activity under the scheme for each local authority is published in my Department's quarterly and annual bulletins of housing statistics, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Department's website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.
