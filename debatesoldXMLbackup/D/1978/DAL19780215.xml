      <P>Has the Taoiseach under consideration the taking of any initiative in the present Post Office engineering dispute in view of the continued widespread disruption of communications? Looking at the situation today, can the Taoiseach tell us whether there will be any initiative on his part?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs answered that question fully yesterday in Deputy O'Leary's absence.  One of the Deputy's colleagues might have communicated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the call for intervention by me, I want to say positively that the Cabinet and I, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, <Col N="1256" /> have been in constant touch with this problem all the time since we came into Government&mdash;a problem which we inherited from our predecessors. I do not say this in any antagonistic way but I want to put it on the record.  I am taking the whole situation very seriously indeed.  We are doing everything possible, and in the present circumstances the Deputy might suggest a way in which intervention could take place at a time when the union responsible are not able to deliver on promises and undertakings made.  On two previous occasions when an under-taking was given of a resumption of work, following which there would be a complete and sympathetic review of the working conditions, on each occasion they failed to deliver on those promises.  Unless we can get the goodwill of the union responsible it is very difficult to see how progress can be made.</P>
      <P>I want to say as well, and the Deputy knows this, that the ICTU representatives met the Minister responsible and the Minister for Labour yesterday, and I hope there may be some possibility of progress as a result of that initiative.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday he would not intervene at that stage.  He did not answer my question which was at which stage and how much worse will the situation have got before he would intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Intervention is not a practical possibility because there are no means whereby I can intervene. As the Minister said yesterday, if I intervene now it would be a recipe for chaos because we cannot make any contracts or any agreements with those people because they refuse to honour them.  The executive agreed on two occasions but some members of the executive ran off and instructed people who were unwilling to carry out any agreement to break those agreements.</P>

    <Title>Consumer Information Bill, 1976: (From the Seanad).</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 2: In page 3, subsection (1), lines 31 and 32, paragraph (k) deleted and the following paragraph substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k) as to the contents of books or as to their authors, as to the contents of cinematograph films (within the meaning of the performers' Protection Act, 1968) or as to their producers or as to the contents of recordings (within the meaning of the Performers' Protection Act, 1968) or as to the performers on such recordings, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to improve the effectiveness of the provision by widening its scope to cover recordings and performers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the amendment because it widens the scope of the subsection, but I wonder if the existing paragraph in section 2 which we are now deleting did not cover what is being covered in the amendment.  For instance, was it necessary to specify the Performers' Protection Act, 1968?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a lot of representations during the passing of the Bill through the Dáil and later when it came to Committee in the Seanad.

      <P>Section 4: In page 4, subsection (3), lines 37 and 38, &ldquo;any such thing is placed&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;places any such thing&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to a drafting point which was raised in the Seanad. It concerned the final phrase in paragraph (a) (ii) of subsection (3).  The original phrase was &ldquo;he places&rdquo;.  The amendment would substitute &ldquo;any such thing is placed&rdquo;.  It was purely to improve the drafting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have congratulated the Minister on her appointment. Would she tell me what is the difference, from a grammatical or interpretation or drafting point of view, between &ldquo;any such thing is placed&rdquo; and &ldquo;places any such thing&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Seanad Committee Stage Senator Alexis FitzGerald pointed out that there is a difference.  At the time I did not see the difference but on looking at it again before Report Stage we decided there is a difference and there-fore we made the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (3), lines 39 to 42 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) A person shall also be deemed to have applied a trade description to goods if he uses the trade description in any manner&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment of section 4 (3) substitutes a phrase for &ldquo;A person who is charged with an offence under section 2 of this Act&rdquo;.  The original phrase might mean that the &ldquo;deeming&rdquo; provision could not take effect until after a person had been charged.  The amendment removes any doubt.  It ensures that the use of a trade description <Col N="1260" /> in any manner likely to be taken as referring to goods can always be taken as applying that description to such goods.</P>

      <P>Section 7: In page 6, subsection (2) (d), line 30, &ldquo;and&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;it;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 is similar to that formerly proposed but later withdrawn when I agreed to have a look at it between then and Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are drafting changes necessary because of accepting amendment No. 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The insertion of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; after &ldquo;it.&rdquo; in amendment No. 4 worries me.  While I appreciate that the deletion of (f) will result in (e) being the last paragraph in section 7 (2) there is a danger of misinterpretation with the insertion of &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  Paragraph (d) states that a person advertising goods, services or accommodation as available for supply or provision shall be taken as offering to supply them and paragraph (e) refers to an indication of the price and so on.  The word &ldquo;and&rdquo; is a conjunction and the interpretation that (d) and (e) must go together could be taken.  It is not (d) or (e), it is (d) and (e).  I appreciate the drafting difficulty. In other sections there are paragraphs (a) (b) (c) (d) and (e) but there is no &ldquo;and&rdquo; between the second last and the last paragraphs in the subsections. The &ldquo;and&rdquo; here might be misinterpreted.  It might be interpreted that both (d) and (e) have to be present to constitute what is set out in section 4 (2).</P>

      <P>Section 17: In page 11, subsection (1), line 29, &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;fine or term of imprisonment&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 relates to section 17.  The section as it was originally passed by Dáil Éireann would have had the effect of removing the former penalty of forfeiture.  This point was raised on Committee Stage by Senator FitzGerald.  It would have removed the penalty of forfeiture in the 1887 Act in addition to fine and imprisonment for cases involved in trade description offences, though it would still have remained for other offences under the 1887 Act.  The implications of this were considered during the Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad and it is clear that the power to forfeit offending goods is in some cases essential because sometimes it may be necessary to withdraw certain goods from sale if it has been found that they do not comply with the regulations. This amendment will mean that although the penalties of fine and imprisonment for trade description offences are now all substituted for the new fines and imprisonment penalties which are provided under this Bill, the position as regards the forfeiture of goods as laid down in the previous Acts will remain unchanged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> In page 11, subsection 3 (a), line 47, &ldquo;of which a person was convicted summarily&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;section&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This subsection was introduced by way of amendment on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide, in the only way possible in criminal cases, compensation for persons who may have suffered loss or damage as a result of false or misleading trade descriptions. The proposals in that amendment had to be restricted from the more open compensation provisions which occurred earlier because of the danger that such open provisions might be found unconstitutional.  Legal advice subsequently received made it clear that this problem would be particularly difficult if a case of this kind were heard before a jury.  For this reason it is essential to ensure that the provisions for civil redress in criminal cases can only apply in summary proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The insertion of &ldquo;of which a person was convicted summarily&rdquo; after &ldquo;section&rdquo; seems tautological.  Section 17 (1) (a) begins by saying &ldquo;on summary conviction&rdquo;. What the Minister of State has now said is in direct conflict with what her Minister stated in the House when handling the original Bill on behalf of the then Opposition.  I presume that the amendment suggested is to clarify the position and in these circumstances I have no option but to agree.</P>

      <P>Section 25: In page 14, line 15, &ldquo;or the provision of any services&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;goods&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in relation to section 25.  The amendment alters the section in such a way that the saver given for contracts is not confined to contracts for the supply of goods but will also cover those for the provision of services.  As <Col N="1264" /> this measure extends to services for the first time the provisions which formerely related only to goods, it is appropriate that the saver in this section should also apply to service contracts.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall that there was a discussion on the definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo; and of &ldquo;services&rdquo; but that was teased out. We have the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; again in the amendment and I wonder if there is some conflict here.  The section will now read: &ldquo;A contract for the supply of any goods or the provision of any services shall not be void or unenforceable by reason only of a contravention of any provision of the Acts or this Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It will be a question of interpretation at a later stage.  The Minister will appreciate that the word may be the subject of a court action. We must be clear as to what we mean and have regard to the interpretation that people might go along with in the event of a court action on these words.  We established that the definitions were open to different interpretations. I am wondering whether the insertion of the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; here complicates matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister of State knows that in the event of an action being taken the line of least resistance would be adopted and that, if the interpretation is left open, a way out would be found.  I am concerned about the tightening up of the words used and am endeavouring to ensure that they will be open to one interpretation only.  On Committee Stage we <Col N="1265" /> established that the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; was open to interpretations other than the more straightforward interpretation mentioned by the Minister.  For that reason the singular in this case might prove to be a more appropriate form.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>Section 27: In page 14, line 45, &ldquo;or the Director&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 27. Originally in respect of expenses we had included only the Minister but we have now included the director in order to add to his independence.  This amendment is in response to the point raised by Deputy O'Toole.  It was raised also in the Seanad.  It is only right that whatever expenses are needed by the director should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the fact that the insertion of the words &ldquo;or the director&rdquo; specifies exactly what is intended.  However, I would have thought that the words in the section&mdash;&ldquo;the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act&rdquo;&mdash;would have covered the director also as well as any agency under the aegis of the Minister, but the Minister of State says that the insertion of the words &ldquo;or the director&rdquo; will clarify the position.  I do not wish to go back to what we have been discussing in the past few minutes but while the Minister has gone all the way in ensuring that what is meant is to be stated in the Act, I do not know whether this is necessary.  While the director should be seen to be responsible for an office that was standing on its own feet and with its own budget, the amendment is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear whether this is normal drafting practice.  I have been trying to ascertain the position in other instances, for example, whether an agency such as the Land Registry is mentioned specifically under the heading of expenses for the Department <Col N="1266" /> of Justice, apart from mention of the Minister and his office.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Originally, as Deputy O'Toole said rightly, we decided in the Dáil that the expenses of the director would be paid as ministerial expenses but the point was made then, and was taken, that the director's independence might be in doubt in that case and that it was absolutely necessary that he be an independent entity.  This amendment is designed to give statutory recognition to his expenses, apart from those of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we made a point of having the director as a separate entity from the amalgam of the Minister's agencies.  From what the Minister has said it is to be understood that the insertion of the words &ldquo;or the director&rdquo; gives this new appointee a certain amount of autonomy or independence?  If that is so, I am glad to agree to the amendment.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that the effectiveness of the Bill as a whole is contingent on the appointment of the director.  Indeed, the Act will be ineffective until such time as a director has been appointed but when is it expected that the appointment can be made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for bringing this Bill a long way before the dissolution of the last Dáil, there are a few words I should like to add.  I agree with Deputy O'Toole that the functions of the director and the full performance of these functions are central to the effectiveness of the legislation.  The amendment is to allow the expenses of the director to be met independently of those of the Minister and before agreeing to this amendment we are <Col N="1267" /> entitled to know when those expenses will first fall due, when it is likely that expenses will be incurred by the director. In other words, we are entitled to know when the director will be appointed.  Given that the Bill is receiving a relatively speedy passage through the House, arrangements should already be in train for the appointment of the director.  Advertisements should have been issued already so that applications could be under consideration and the appointment should be capable of being made immediately the Bill comes into law. If there is an hiatus here, it is most regrettable.  I should like to know what has been done and, if a director cannot be appointed immediately the Bill becomes law, I should like to know why that is the case.</P>

      <P>We are all very concerned about the independence of the director.  I appreciate just as much as the two Deputies opposite do that the Bill would not be enforceable unless we had a director.  It is my intention that the advertisements for the position of director would appear immediately the Bill has been signed by the President.  It was important that the advertisements should not have appeared until such time as the Bill had gone through both Houses.  Otherwise, I would have been pre-empting the decision of both Houses.  It was up to the Seanad and to Members of the Dáil to table amendments which were considered necessary either in respect of the functions of the director or the expenses incurred by the director, or in respect of any matter concerning the director.  It is important that when functions under the legislation are being described in an advertisement for the position of director those functions should have been passed by both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would assure Deputy Bruton and Deputy O'Toole that I would hope that the advertisements would appear almost immediately on the passing of the Bill and that the director would be appointed.  I would further assure both Deputies&mdash;I said this to Deputy O'Toole before in the Dáil&mdash;that it <Col N="1268" /> will not be a political appointment. That is the thing that would be of most concern to all of us&mdash;that whoever would be appointed would be a person who would be well capable of putting into force this legislation and other legislation which is coming up very quickly on the tail of this Bill.</P>

      <P>A question, a Cheann Comhairle.  In that case the expenses incurred would be included in the 1978 Estimates.  The amendment has resulted in the director standing apart from the Minister in regard to expenses. Obviously, in the Estimates as published there could be no heading under which this office could be given any finance because the office did not exist at the time the Estimates were published and is not yet in being. Therefore, I assume that the expenses that will be incurred by the director will come out of the ministerial pool, as you might say, and hopefully it will be a large&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  In the exercise of these functions the Corporation shall not compete unfairly with existing businesses engaged in similar projects&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This concerns the very wide powers to intervene in processing and setting up new enterprises and, in fact, engaging in almost any economic activity, not as a leader, but on its own account, which the ACC has under section 9. <Col N="1271" /> Naturally enough, the ACC is a public body with potential access to unlimited funds from the Exchequer.  If it went into an area of agricultural endeavour in which it was competing directly with private companies, it is conceivable that it could use its unlimited access to funds as against the obviously limited access to funds which any private enterprise in the same area would have, and compete unfairly with the private enterprise. But, I must say I welcome&mdash;and this is a matter that has been discussed in the budget debate and elsewhere&mdash;the idea of State-sponsored bodies getting involved in direct productive activity and in the consequential giving of employment.  I believe, and it must be clearly set out in the statute, that in doing so they have a duty to compete only on a fair basis with private firms already in the field.  If they were to compete on an unfair basis they would probably find themselves in conflict with EEC rules as well as with rules made in the statute of this House.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the idea of State bodies developing in this area on a productive basis.  It is essential to the success of such activity that there should be from the outset an assurance in the minds of all people with whom they might compete that competition would be on a fair basis.  If that assurance does not exist and if there is not a statutory safeguard such as I am proposing in this amendment, the danger is that there will be outright political or ideological opposition to such activity and this would be regrettable. It would be justified opposition because there would not be a basis for assurance that competition would not be unfair.  The amendment which I propose is a very reasonable one and one which will set this sort of endeavour on a solid foundation.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (a), (b), (c), (d) states:</P>
    <P>9.&mdash;The Corporation may do all or any of the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  undertake, promote, engage or participate in, manage or supervise any scheme or project which, in the opinion of the Corporation, will, or is likely to, increase, whether directly or indirectly, the <Col N="1272" /> productivity of, or be otherwise of benefit to, agriculture, horticulture or fisheries,</P>
    <P>(b)  appoint and remunerate clerical, technical and managerial staff for schemes and projects referred to in paragraph (a) and assist and advise in relation to the appointment of such staff,</P>
    <P>(c)  provide the whole or part of the money required for any scheme or project referred to in paragraph (a),</P>
    <P>(d)  agree with the undertakers or promotors of any scheme or project referred to in paragraph (a) to pay and discharge the whole or part of any losses incurred by them in relation to that scheme or project,</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Subsection (d) is particularly relevant. Two firms may be competing, one of them relying on normal credit from a commercial bank.  The other firm could be told by the ACC to fire ahead and not to worry about losing money because they are prepared to underwrite all losses.  That firm has a competitive advantage as against the first firm. Clearly there is a need for a safeguard, such as I indicate, to the effect that the power to underwrite losses and the other powers mentioned shall not be exercised so as to constitute unfair competition.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (g) states:</P>
    <P>Assist in and facilitate, in any manner it thinks proper, the formation, promotion, establishment, reconstruction or reorganisation of bodies corporate referred to in paragraph (e).</P>
    <P>Under this section it appears that the ACC have the power to do almost anything on their own account that any commercial entity can do and to do it with the full backing of a State guarantee. I am not absolutely sure of this because I have not checked the Companies Act.  They have a tremendous power to compete if they so wish.  I have no reason to believe that they would wish to do so at present.  They have the power to compete unfairly and to put out of business firms competing in the private sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> I know the argument that will be put forward by the Minister.  I must anticipate it since I will not be allowed to speak again on this Stage.  The argument will be to the effect that the Minister appoints the directors and the Minister's economic policy at present is one of supporting the private sector and not driving it out of business.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute this and that would be my policy were I in the Minister's position.  We are not passing laws to be implemented only by the present Government or by a Government formed by any of the parties at present in the Dáil.  These laws must stand the test of time in any political situation. I would argue that a safeguard such as suggested in this amendment is necessary and should be implemented to avoid any misunderstanding as to what the ACC can or cannot do. I believe that the acceptance of this amendment would help the ACC to do the sort of things outlined in section 9. The knowledge that such a safeguard exists will ensure that there is a much more co-operative attitude to the ACC in the commercial field if they undertake this sort of endeavour.  There will be much less political suspicion and fear of the ACC's involvement in this area because of the existence of the safeguard.  In the absence of such a safeguard the ACC will continue as they have done in the past; they will not use these powers because they will be afraid to do so and because they will be afraid that the objection will be made that there is not an adequate safeguard against their abuse of power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that there is any necessity for this amendment. I have been dealing with the ACC for 20 or 30 years in getting the co-operative movement under way in the west.  It smelled down there.  The commercial banks were not inclined to advance money to us and some of the co-operatives would have been closed down but for the ACC.  One might say that they were competing with the commercial banks who would not advance the money.  We had been asking that money should be provided for a venture with a reasonable chance of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> The banks are very conservative and so are the ACC.  I can see no reason for this amendment because it is my opinion that the ACC are too conservative. If the ACC think that a venture will not be competitive they will not support it.  The powers of the ACC should not be curtailed.  They have no ambition to go into competition with anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a worth-while and reasonable amendment.  Section 9 (g) provides that the ACC may:</P>
      <P>Assist in and facilitate, in any manner it thinks proper, the formation, promotion, establishment, reconstruction or reorganisation of bodies corporate referred to in paragraph (e).</P>
      <P>Basically the position would appear to be such that the corporation can allow themselves to be involved in types of businesses that would compete with existing businesses.  To me that would appear to border on a dangerous situation. Suppose the Agricultural Credit Corporation assisted and promoted some organisation which perhaps would compete with an existing meat factory or mart or some type of farming business, even a co-operative society.  With the unlimited resources of the ACC behind some group there is a distinct possibility that such a group would be in a position to take risks that a reasonably prudent person might not take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that, as Deputy Callanan said, the ACC are a conservative body but with vast sums of money at their disposal and being a semi-State body they could enter into competition by promoting a meat factory in a certain area if some people were closely involved and had a particular interest in it&mdash; I do not imply any kind of wrong interest.  Such competition could either close down or put an existing business into difficulties.  This would <Col N="1275" /> be unfair competition and would, I think, be unwise and wrong.  Some safeguard is necessary in a case like this.  It would be unwise if this Bill were to allow a firm promoted and assisted by the ACC to reach a situation whereby an already existing firm in some part of rural Ireland would be forced to compete with it.  I believe the Minister would not be happy about such a situation arising and neither would his Department.  Most people would be very unhappy about it. Deputy Bruton's amendment is reasonable and should be incorporated in the Bill as a safeguard for the future.</P>
    <P>While the ACC are generally regarded as a conservative body, as are most financial institutions that lend money, nevertheless I think it incumbent on us to ensure that, whether they are conservative or not, existing businesses that are progressive and prospering would not find themselves faced with unfair competition that had the unlimited backing of a semi-State body.  If the ACC began to promote a firm that was going into competition with an existing firm, the ACC at the outset might not realise this but once they had undertaken the project and after investing a certain amount of money in it they might well say to themselves: &ldquo;It is not going very well but if we give it a further injection of funds, further borrowing powers or grant a further loan that injection of capital may get this firm on its feet.&rdquo; The other firm that may be suffering from a shortage of capital may be put out of business.</P>
    <P>I see no benefit in putting existing businesses engaged in similar projects out of business.  The amendment is couched in very moderate language.  It seems reasonable and fair and its purpose is to prevent a situation arising in which existing businesses would find themselves in direct competition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the impression I got over here.  Section 9 of the Bill empowers the ACC to participate in projects operated by other bodies for the benefit of agriculture and horticulture. Fisheries have now been added to that.  When Deputy Bruton talks about standing the test of time, this provision was also in the 1961 Act and has been there all along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>But it was there and it has been exercised on a couple of occasions without any detrimental effect on any other business.  The object of the section is to enable the corporation to help in cases where private enterprise needs an additional boost or where private enterprise may be unwilling to embark on a particular project, the ACC would step in to provide a much needed impetus or initiative and the question of competing unfairly with existing businesses would not even arise.  If the corporation should ever try to use these powers to enter into any business that was adequately catered for by the private sector or to compete unfairly with other such businesses, the Minister for Finance would, as a matter of public policy, intervene and prevent any such abuse of their powers.  The Minister is the only shareholder in the ACC and appoints all members of the board of directors.</P>

Giving this sort of unlimited power to a Minister in cahoots with the ACC is, to my mind, undesirable and there should be a safeguard against unfair competition &mdash;nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I should like to make is that far from being against the exercise of these powers, as the Minister sought without any justification to suggest, I am in favour of them.  These powers on the part of the ACC to become involved in running companies as distinct from merely lending&mdash;this is a point that Deputy Callanan did not grasp&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I grasped it all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, I accept that.  I was not saying that the ACC were or were not conservative, or that any safeguard of that nature should be imposed in relation to their power <Col N="1278" /> to lend money, nor was I fearing they would lend money in a way that would constitute unfair competition.  I said that there was need for a safeguard in relation to unfair competition being created, not by their lending money but by their becoming involved in setting up and running new enterprises. First of all, the safeguard, which I think the Minister agrees should be there in practice though not in law, is against only unfair competition as a result of ACC activity.  It does not inhibit them from fair competition in the normal way with other competiting businesses in the same area. Secondly it does not restrict them at all in relation to areas where businesses are not already in operation. For instance, if the ACC want to set up a new business where no existing Irish business is involved this amendment will not affect them in the least because then there is no possibility of their competing unfairly with an existing business.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the Minister for Finance is the chief share-holder and that he of course would, in the interests of what is nebulously described by the Minister as public policy, prevent the ACC from exercising their powers in an unfair fashion.  The assurance that the present Minister might do that is not sufficient in relation to legislation of this sort. We are introducing legislation which must stand the test of time, which must be there and be capable of being implemented with the necessary restraints by any Minister.  I will give three examples of the way in which this power could perhaps be abused in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance might be a member of a Government who wanted to take over the private sector in some aspect of agriculture and who wanted to have only State factories involved in the production of, say, meat, who could not afford to pay compensation to the meat factories and wished to drive them out of business.  The obvious way that this could be done would be by using this section.  The Minister could give a directive to the ACC: &ldquo;You set up your own meat factories and compete unfairly with the existing factories.  Spend as much <Col N="1279" /> money as you like; you have a State guarantee.  Keep spending that money until by unfair competition you have driven the private meat factories out of business and we have only the one State meat factory&mdash;or factories&mdash;run by the ACC.&rdquo;  That is one way in which the ACC could be used by the Minister for Finance, not the present Minister for Finance but one who would be committed to the nationalisation of, say, the meat industry.</P>
    <P>The second way in which he could use this power is this.  He could decide that, as in Britain at the moment, there be a pay code where firms would be penalised if they paid more to their workers than a norm set by the Government. Again unless safeguards such as I suggest in my amendment are introduced, this section could be used to implement such a policy.  A Government who might want to punish a meat factory or another agricultural processing industry who had paid more than the norm to their industry could decide to back a meat factory who had obeyed the norm by giving them unlimited facilities so that they would be able to compete unfairly and do down the meat factory alleged to have broken the norm.</P>
    <P>There is a third way, one which I hesitate to suggest, but nonetheless it is real.  We all know that the directors of the ACC are political appointees and that certain people in industries may support one party and other people may support others.  Apart from merely giving credit, the ACC have the power under this section to become involved in setting up and supporting in a very intimate way, one factory and not supporting another.  Is it not possible that these powers could also be used to build up the fortunes of the enterprises of supporters of whoever was in power or whose parties contained representatives on the ACC, to give such firms much greater facilities, equity capital, and guarantees against loss such as are contained in subsection (d) here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning the integrity of the entire board of the ACC or of the present Minister.  What I am saying is that at a possible future time under a different Government from that presently existing or from any ever represented in this Dáil these unlimited powers could be used by a future ACC. I am not questioning the integrity of the present Government or any of the parties in the Dáil or the present ACC. In passing legislation of this sort we must provide for every eventuality including those in which the three possibilities I have mentioned could be part of an unfair policy being adopted by a Government.  I hope that such a situation would never arise and I am fairly confident that it will not, but in passing legislation it is not our job merely to provide for the situation which we hope will not occur.  It is our job to provide for the situation which at the worst we fear might occur.  It is in order to meet what I believe an unlikely but nonetheless possible eventuality that I am suggesting this protection against unfair competition, and in passing legislation it is our duty to approach it in that manner. For that reason I propose what I regard as a very reasonable amendment which will not in any sense inhibit the ACC.  In fact the provision of this safeguard should encourage them to be more active in using their powers.  I appeal to the Minister of State again to reconsider his position and to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It may be of relevance, but it cannot be relevant in the view of the Chair when it has already been ruled out of order.  We must move to amendment No. 5.  Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are consequential on amendment No. 5 and may be taken together.  We can have separate decisions if required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;expiration of every financial year&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;guarantee has been given&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree it is logical to take amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together because they are consequential.  The purpose of these amendments is to provide that the Dáil and through the Dáil, the representatives of the public will become aware immediately of any guarantee being given by the Government of a borrowing by the ACC.  It is important that there should be an opportunity for public scrutiny of guarantees given by the State, or the taxpayers, of loans undertaken by State bodies. In the event of a State body defaulting on a loan, it would fall to the taxpayer to pay back the loan.  It should be possible to know that such a guarantee has been undertaken immediately it is undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, under the section the Minister is obliged to provide a list <Col N="1282" /> of all the guarantees he has given in a particular year at the end of that year.  In other words, if the Minister gave a guarantee to the ACC to borrow £100 million on 2 January 1979 the House would not be made aware of the existence of that guarantee until the end of 1979, possibly 31 December, or the beginning of 1980 for that matter.  A good deal could happen in 12 months. It is possible that a large number of improvident guarantees could be given by an unwise Minister between the time he can commence giving guarantees and the time he must report to the House on the existence of those guarantees.  It would be more logical and more sensible if the Minister were obliged to give information about any guarantee he gives as and when he gives it rather than waiting until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This would impose no additional administrative burden on the Minister for Finance.  Obviously he has to do a considerable amount of preparatory work and paper work before giving the guarantee.  Sending a copy of a notice of the fact that he has given the guarantee, and the basis on which he has given it, to the Dáil Library so that the Dáil would be formally informed of the matter would impose very little, if any, additional administrative burden on him.  It would mean the Dáil would be able to keep completely up to date on the position of guarantees given by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned, if you like, about the introduction of an amendment of this sort in this Bill.  I believe it should be introduced, but its value would be seen if an amendment of this sort were adopted for all companies in respect of whom guarantees are given by the Minister so that as a general practice the Oireachtas could become cognisant of the total amount of guarantees given at any time during a year.  If one went to the Library today and asked for the latest on guarantees given by the State to all State companies one could get the figure and know the total amount guaranteed on 15 February 1978.  At present one cannot do that.  One has to wait until the end of the year when, perhaps, the financial situation might <Col N="1283" /> have changed and the justification for the guarantee might have disappeared, to find out the situation of the Exchequer in relation to guarantees given.  Therefore, I would urge that this amendment, which is purely a procedural amendment and contains no issue of policy with which the Minister could disagree, should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to accept the amendment because the provisions of section 14 about laying particulars of ministerial guarantees of borrowings before each House of the Oireachtas are standard provisions and appear in Acts such as the Agricultural Credit Acts which deal with specific State-sponsored bodies and in the State Guarantees Act, 1954, which enables the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowing by bodies scheduled in that Act or added to the Schedule later by ministerial order.  The Acts provide for the return as soon as may be after the end of the financial year of guarantees given during the year, or given before and still in force at the commencement of the year.  Such returns which show the Minister's total liabilities at the end of the year, including cumulative liabilities from guarantees given in previous years, are much more valuable to the Oireachtas than separate statements submitted to each House every time a new guarantee is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made two substantial objections to my amendments.  First, he argued that the separate statements I am proposing would not be as useful to the Oireachtas as one compiled at the end of the year.  I believe they would be more useful because the up-to-date position could be ascertained at any given time. If the Minister accepts my amendment, and provides details of each guarantee as and when it is given, there is nothing to prevent him also giving an annual statement at the end of the year on the total situation against which the subsequent guarantees could be read.  It is quite open to the Minister, if he accepts my amendment, to have the best of both worlds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> The other substantial objection he made is not a very worthy one, that is, that it has not been done in other legislation and therefore it should not be done in this.  Surely in discussing a Bill of this nature it is our job to improve it as much as possible.  Even if we are proposing something for the first time in relation to the ACC, there is no reason why we should not do it, if it is the right thing to do.  If we do it in this Bill and it works in practice, it is likely that it will be followed in other legislation.  I do not think that objection should be advanced because we are discussing an ACC Bill and not other Bills.  If it is right for the ACC it should be done regardless of whether other Legislatures in the past had the wisdom or lack of wisdom to proceed in a particular way.  I ask the Minister to reconsider accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 6, after &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; to add &ldquo;: provided that the Corporation has made reasonable efforts to provide notice, in advance of the issue of the certificate, to the specified person of its intention to issue the certificate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the issue of the certificate which, once the ACC have issued it, will enable them to distrain against the property of a person to the effect that he owes them a certain amount of money.  Once that certificate has been issued the ACC can go straight to the court and have the property of the person distrained even though it may be the case that the person concerned is not aware that the certificate has been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is undesirable that the ACC should be able to proceed in this manner. I realise it is important that in some cases they should be able <Col N="1285" /> to distrain against the property of somebody who refuses to co-operate and who refuses to recognise that a debt exists.  They must have some way of going direct to the court and getting something done about it.  For that reason my amendment is framed not that the ACC must give notice, because it is possible that in some cases they may not be able to serve notice on the person against whom the certificate is issued, but to the effect that the ACC should have made a reasonable effort to provide notice in advance of the issue of the certificate to the person concerned of their intention in the matter.</P>
    <P>I know that at present the ACC in all cases make reasonable efforts to make sure that a person against whom a certificate is being issued knows about this and also of the likelihood of the ACC having recourse to this provision if he does not co-operate.  There is no problem for the ACC in complying with the terms of my amendment.  They do this at the moment.  However, to guard against any unfair use or abuse of this power at some future time by an ACC that might have a less fairminded approach than the present directorate, I believe that an amendment of this kind should be inserted in section 21.  It provides a protection and assurance that existing practices will be maintained and that the ACC will not be able to behave in an arbitrary fashion in issuing certificates, in bringing people to court regardless of whether a debt really exists and putting an onus on the person concerned to prove that the debt does not exist.  Once the ACC have issued a certificate to the effect that it does the onus falls on the person concerned.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed here when the 1947 Bill came before the House and the arguments advanced then still apply.  The fact that there has not been any abuse of the power in the interim&mdash;and I accept there has not been&mdash;does not invalidate the arguments put forward.  The arguments were based on a possible future situation which might occur rather than what has actually transpired in practice.  It is merely ensuring that a protection is inserted to ensure <Col N="1286" /> that unfair practices do not occur in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the amendment is necessary.  This matter was discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  Section 21 provides that in any proceedings for the recovery of money owing to the corporation a sealed certificate of debt shall within one month after the date of the certificate be evidence that the sum specified in the certificate is due to the corporation. The certificate could be presented as evidence in court without requiring any corporation official to attend and testify that the amount was due although in practice if the defaulter is putting in a court appearance a corporation official attends also.</P>
      <P>The main use of the certificate is in cases where the defaulter does not contest the proceedings.  The certificate is sent to the Circuit Court office who then give a judgement in favour of the corporation.  The borrower has ample notice of such proceedings.  I am sure the corporation will have been in continuous correspondence for a considerable period seeking payment of the debt due.  If the person concerned persists in his refusal to pay, a civil bill is issued requiring him to indicate if he wishes to defend the case.  In default, the corporation then submit the certificate of debt to the Circuit Court office seeking a judgment. Clearly the borrower has ample notice of the debt due and of the court proceedings and, therefore, there is no need for the additional notice envisaged in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Although all of the things the Minister has stated are true, my point is there is no legal requirement that the ACC should give notice or behave in a reasonable fashion in the exercise of these extensive powers. It is not enough for this House to pass legislation on the basis that all the ACC officials and the Ministers concerned are reasonable men and will behave reasonably.  If that was the assumption on which all legislation was passed there would be no need for legislation at all.  One could do everything by administrative act and have no safeguard in law against any line of activity by a Minister or a <Col N="1287" /> subsidiary body.  The need for law in an area such as this is because there is need for protection against arbitrary or unfair action and to say that of course the ACC will behave reasonably is to invalidate the necessity for any legislation in this area beyond giving them the money and letting them do what they like.  A protection of this nature is desirable and the amendment should have been accepted by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the situation whereby the ACC have a share capital of £20 million and have powers of borrowing up to a sum of <Col N="1288" /> £350 million.  These powers are extensive. The ACC borrow money and they invest money.  They operate in a normal commercial manner which is reasonable and satisfactory and with which everybody is in full agreement.  In the last five years we have experienced two banks getting into serious financial difficulties.  Sizeable sums were lost by depositors.  In one case the Government are in the process of coming to the rescue of depositors.  The Minister for Finance says this is a once-on-once off situation: it is something that will never occur again.  A future Minister for Finance may decide otherwise and come to the aid of a bank which gets into difficulties.  In this particular case there has been a good deal of controversy. Some are in favour of the Minister coming to the rescue.  Others, like Senator Whitaker, are against the Minister coming to the rescue.</P>
      <P>Vast sums are invested in the ACC. Vast sums are also invested by the ACC.  It is absolutely essential that investors in a semi-State body should have absolute confidence in that body. Their investments should be 100 per cent safe.  In the event of the ACC running into financial difficulties the taxpayers will have to pay the bill and meet any deficiencies that may arise.  For that reason we must be absolutely certain that the moneys invested in the ACC are safeguarded to the utmost extent.  The ACC should not be allowed to invest money in any institution other than one certified by the Central Bank.  To do otherwise would be wrong and reckless.  We must safeguard the situation.  It is desirable, indeed essential, that the Minister for Finance should give his approval in writing to the ACC to invest money in a particular bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC borrows extensively.  The expansion of the farming industry depends to a large extent on the adoption of a correct policy by the ACC.  The policy and plans of the corporation must be seen by investors to be the correct policy and plans.  We are dealing here with a major industry on which the livelihoods of thousands depend. The capital needed for the expansion of the agricultural industry is <Col N="1289" /> enormous.  That is obvious from the advertisements on television.  It would be wrong if the ACC were tempted to invest money in some banking institution prepared to pay a higher rate of interest.  That would be tantamount to taking a chance.  Should losses be suffered people would lose confidence in the ACC and, if people lose confidence, they will no longer invest with that body.  Confidence must be maintained.  The trust built up over the years must be maintained.  The bulk of the investors in the ACC are small. Sums of £100, £200 and £500 make up the bulk of the deposits.  It is absolutely incumbent on the Minister for Finance to ensure that every safeguard exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment designed to ensure that before a bank is recognised for the purpose of this part of the Bill dealing with chattel mortgages it must be certified by the Central Bank whose financial probity and stability have been fully underwritten by that independent body.  It is very important this protection should exist.  Once a bank is recognised under this Bill it will be given wide powers to enter into transactions with farmers or others who wish to borrow money. To get its money back it will be able to adopt methods which in the normal way a normal money lending institution which is not a recognised bank for the purpose of this section could not exercise. For instance, it will have powers under this section, once it becomes a recognised bank and if it agrees to a chattel mortgage, to seize stock, to prevent farmers selling stock for less than a fair value and in some cases to prevent the sale of stock outright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger is twofold if a bank granting recognition under this section is not a responsible one.  Firstly, if it is not responsible it may dupe individual farmers or creditors into giving them a chattel mortgage and giving them a right over the farmer's property which normal commercial wisdom would not suggest that farmer should do if he had been properly advised.  An unscrupulous bank might do this.  There is a protection in that that bank must be recognised by the Central Bank, as well as being recognised by the Minister, <Col N="1290" /> for the purpose of this Bill and the danger of it engaging in that sort of unscrupulous activity is obviously lessened.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the possibility that if that bank was not financially sound &mdash;again the requirement of the agreement of the Central Bank is a guarantee of its financial soundness&mdash;it could get into difficulties.  Its method of getting out of difficulties might be one of using the powers contained here in relation to chattel mortgages in an extremely severe fashion.  It could use them to their absolute utmost to force farmers to pay up immediately instead of, as a normal financially sound bank would do, trying to get the money, only using the extreme powers given under this section where necessary because of the lack of co-operation on the part of the farmer.  If such a bank found itself in difficulties it might seek to get out of those difficulties by using the powers contained in this part of the Bill in an unfair and arbitrary fashion. For those reasons it is important to ensure that only a bank which has a licence from the Central Bank and which has the approval in writing of the Minister for Finance&mdash;I believe approval in writing is implicit in granting recognition&mdash;and is therefore less likely to engage in duping creditors to give them chattel mortgages or using the powers granted by the issue of a chattel mortgage in an unfair fashion, should be given these powers.</P>
    <P>In reply to our proposals the Minister is likely to state that the law as interpreted by the Attorney General at the moment is to the effect that only a bank which is recognised by the Central Bank is a bank anyway and that, therefore, at law only such a bank can qualify as a bank to become a recognised bank under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be licensed first and then recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In interpreting the term &ldquo;bank&rdquo; in this case the Attorney General expressed the opinion that it was one that had been previously licensed.  He felt that to be recognised it had to be a bank; to be a bank it must be licensed and it could only be recognised if it was first licensed. <Col N="1291" /> I believe that is the sequence the previous Attorney General is quoted as having put on the powers here in reply to a query by the previous Government in relation to this matter.  Without suggesting any disagreement with that interpretation of the law, it is nothing more than the interpretation of a lawyer who was not a judge at the time he made the interpretation and therefore was not creating any binding precedent on other judges by giving that interpretation.  It is not precedent and there is no reason to believe that a future Minister or judge would follow that interpretation.</P>
      <P>Although it was quoted in this House&mdash;this is more important&mdash;it was a private opinion given by the Attorney General to a previous Minister. It is not on the public record anywhere, apart from the record of this House which was referred to by the Minister of State.  Therefore, I submit that Deputy Enright's amendment should be accepted because it merely underwrites in law what the Minister has said is the opinion of the Attorney General anyway.  By putting it in law one is giving a much greater safeguard than one would do merely by relying on the informal opinion of the Attorney General given in private to a previous Minister.  For that reason Deputy Enright's amendment should be accepted and these wide powers in relation to chattel mortgages should only be given to banks which are clearly financially sound and have been agreed to be such by the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some points made by Deputy Enright in moving the amendment seem to be different to the provisions of the Bill.  Recognition means only recognition for the purpose of this section and has nothing whatever to do with deposits, small or large, with ACC or others in such recognised banks.  It is only recognition for the purposes of this section.  Section 7 of the Central Bank Act provides that nobody can operate as a bank unless he holds a licence from the Central Bank.  That has been the law since 1971.  Only such banks as are licensed by the Central Bank are <Col N="1292" /> recognised by the Minister.  Because of that law no other bank could exist so that in practice we see no necessity at all for accepting the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not enter into any controversy over it.  A bank may obtain a licence from the Central Bank; it may be able to force its way through the courts and obtain that licence after a court hearing and other difficulties.  In spite of efforts on the part of the directors of the Central Bank to stop such a licence being issued a bank may be able to obtain this certificate from the Central Bank even though the Central Bank may not be entirely happy over the granting or issuing of such a licence.</P>
      <P>That is the first point I wish to make.  A bank obtains such a licence and the Minister may be aware that the Central Bank have not absolute confidence in that bank.  He might not, therefore, be happy about giving a statement in writing of his satisfaction to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>My reason for putting down this amendment is that not alone must there be a licence issued by the Central Bank but a letter must also be given by the Minister to the Agricultural Credit Corporation pointing out that he is happy with the licence that has been issued.  The Minister appears to be happy that a recognised bank is the only one which obtains a licence under the Central Bank Act and that the situation is such since 1971.  If he is happy about this he should have it inserted into the Act to ensure that confidence continues to be maintained in the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The Minister should add in the extra proviso, that I propose, of having this in writing also.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  The rules of the House prevent me from elaborating on this point but I believe it is something which some Minister for Finance will have to tackle in the future.  I want to ensure that a licence obtained from the Central Bank, which has the approval in writing of the Minister of Finance, shall have recognition. This is a reasonable safeguard and I am surprised there is any opposition to it.  It is to ensure that all dealings have 100 per cent security.  As far as I can see under the Central Bank Act a bank can obtain a licence and can still get into financial difficulties. I want to ensure that if such a bank obtains a licence and the Minister is unhappy about it he will not give his consent in writing to the ACC to have any financial dealings with them.  The Minister should be obliged to furnish a letter bearing his signature that he is satisfied with this particular bank.  This is a reasonable request.</P>

      <P>In page 14, to delete lines 28 to 30, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister may by notice in writing withdraw, giving the reason or reasons therefor, the recognition of a bank as a recognised bank and shall thereupon give to the Minister for Justice notice of the withdrawal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice the Minister recognises only those banks which hold licences from the Central Bank under section 7 of the Central Bank Act 1971.  It has already been said that the Attorney General advised in 1975 that the Minister may not do otherwise.  Equally, it <Col N="1295" /> is likely that withdrawal of recognition will arise in cases where the Central Bank, in exercise of their powers under section 11 of the 1971 Act, revoke a bank's licence, although the Minister is not confined to this.  The Central Bank may revoke a licence only with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 11 sets out the circumstances in which the revocation may take place.  If in most cases the Minister will be withdrawing recognition following an earlier decision to revoke a banking licence there will be no need for a further hearing in Dáil Éireann as implied in Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  It is worth saying, which he did not say, that it arises from the discussion here on Committee Stage, from points made on this side of the House.  I am glad to note that, although the Minister did not accept any of the other points we made, certainly he came a considerable distance towards meeting the points we were making on this matter against the arbitrary and unexplained withdrawal of recognition from a bank.  It is just, as the Minister suggests in his amendment, that a statement of the reasons for the withdrawal of recognition from a bank&mdash;something which could <Col N="1296" /> obviously affect its commercial operations considerably&mdash;should be furnished to that bank at the time the withdrawal is taking place.</P>
      <P>My reason for proposing another amendment somewhat different from that of the Minister's&mdash;it goes in the same direction only further and is to the effect that a statement of the reasons as well as being furnished to the bank should also be furnished to the Dáil&mdash;is to allow more public accountability on the part of the Minister for a decision he takes to with-draw recognition from a bank.  My amendment provides, not that the statement of reasons need necessarily be discussed, but that it should be laid before the House and if at any time in the succeeding 21 sitting days the House decides that the Minister has acted wrongly in withdrawing recognition from a bank, it could&mdash;if it so decided and if a Member raised the matter&mdash;countermand the Minister's decision.</P>
      <P>That is a stronger safeguard against unfair withdrawal or recognition.  It is then open to any Member of the House to raise the matter in a substantive way by proposing a resolution which could countermand the Minister's decision.  Of course, under the Minister's present amendment a Member has the right at any time to raise the matter by means of parliamentary question.  But if the Minister does not give a satisfactory answer that is the end of it, whereas under my proposed amendment if it is the view of a Member of the House that a Minister has acted in an arbitrary or unfair fashion in withdrawing recognition the Member would have the power to raise the matter by means of a motion to annul that decision.  That is a stronger protection against arbitrary action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further point I should like to make relating to both amendments. If a withdrawal is to take place, apart from the case the Minister mentioned of withdrawal of recognition under this Bill in consequence of the licence being withdrawn by the Central Bank under its legislation&mdash;that is concerned with slightly different matters from those in <Col N="1297" /> this Bill here&mdash;it is possible, apart from the Central Bank's initiative, that a particular bank could abuse its powers under Part III of this Bill in relation to chattel mortgages.  A bank could be perfectly sound from the point of view of the Central Bank and all the safeguards required by the Central Bank Act being complied with, but there could be abuse in regard to some of the powers contained here in Part III concerning chattel mortgages.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on who is responsible for ensuring that the provisions of Part III of this Bill are complied with?  Is it the Minister for Finance?  I presume it is.  If so, what means has he of finding out?  Has he any inspectorate or system of checking on banks to ensure that they are not abusing the powers contained in Part III of this Bill?  I do not see any provision anywhere in this Bill for setting up an inspecting agency to ensure that the powers in Part III are not abused, that the Minister will be getting the information necessary to know when to withdraw recognition from a bank at the right time.</P>
    <P>Although I am not <i>au fait</i> with the provisions of the Central Bank Act, I do not think it is sufficient to rely on the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has its Act to enforce; it is not concerned directly with the powers contained in Part III, which are given to recognised banks.  There must be somebody else concerned with abuses of these powers.  I should like to know who that person is and what means are open to him, whoever he may be, to ensure that he has full information on a continuing basis about the way in which recognised banks exercise their powers under this Bill so that he can make a decision to withdraw if necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to note that in regard to the granting of a licence the Minister is not very anxious to do so in writing but that he will give it in writing when he is withdrawing a licence.  That is an interesting differentiation.  I am pleased with the Minister's amendment, which is a good one.  However the amendment <Col N="1298" /> proposed by Deputy Bruton goes a stage further and, of the two, is perhaps the more appropriate to be written into this Bill.  The Minister's amendment will be welcomed by most people going through this Bill, be it any type of investor, solicitor, accountant, stockbroker who may have occasion to go through such Acts of Parliament in a fairly detailed manner from time to time.  It is important that the Minister has such powers in regard to the withdrawing of recognition of a bank as a recognised bank.  It is a good thing the Minister has decided to give notice in writing of the reasons for withdrawal of recognition to the bank. It is of the utmost importance to the bank concerned and affords it the opportunity of going through the reasons for withdrawal with the people involved to show that perhaps, in some instances they are not correct.  Having furnished his reasons the Minister should then go into this matter in detail with some banks, affording them an opportunity of proving that their bank is one that is sound and worthy of trust.  It is equally important that it be seen that the Minister is retaining this power.  This amendment gives a recognised bank considerable standing among other financial institutions.  The section deals with recognised banks and is of the utmost importance.  It involves the question of notice in writing which I regard as being essential.</P>

An important point was made by Deputy Bruton on supervision but there is no specific provision here for supervision. The ultimate situation would be that the Minister would withdraw recognition. Of course the Central Bank supervises the activities of all banks.  If there were abuses the individuals concerned could take it up in the courts.  Such matters would be brought to the notice of the Minister by solicitors, by Deputies or by aggrieved individuals and the Minister would take appropriate steps.</P>

      <P>This is concerned to ensure that when a recognised bank wishes to inspect the register of chattel mortgages in relation to a person seeking a loan the bank must get the consent of the potential borrower.  The register of chattel mortgages contains all information in regard to all properties which may have been given in mortgage by any individual.  Clearly it would be necessary for a bank wishing to lend money to find out whether the person had granted a large number of mortgages on an existing chattel.  He might have granted mortgages to other banks and therfore would not be as creditworthy as he appeared to be from the list of what he owned.</P>

    <P>I accept that if a person approached a bank with a view of getting a loan on the basis of a chattel mortgage, it would be appropriate that the bank should inspect the register of chattel mortgages.  The amendment does not prevent that.  The bank would say to the potential borrower that it could not consider his application unless there is written consent to inspect the register, and if that man wanted money he would give the consent straightaway. The amendment, however, is intended to prevent other banks which may have no dealings with the potential borrower from trying to find out the creditworthiness of all the people in a county, perhaps.  It does not prevent a <i>bona fide</i> bank from getting <Col N="1300" /> the information, with the consent of the potential borrower.</P>
    <P>The kind of operation I am trying to provide against is all the easier nowadays with the advent of the computer. The information could be got from the register of chattel mortgages and it could be digested by a bank who would then have a complete picture of all chattel mortgages in all parts of the country.  The Bill at the moment provides that a recognised lender may at any time by requisition under the hand of the solicitor or law agent of such recognised lender require the county registrar to inspect the register and to provide the recognised lender with certified copies of any entries therein relating to the stock of any person named in the requisition;</P>
    <P>If banks wished to get information about every single person in the State all they would have to do would be to take the register of electors and append a requisition to the county registrar to give all the information in relation to chattel mortgages &ldquo;in the appended list&rdquo;, namely, everybody in the county, and the county registrar would have no option but to supply that information under the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>The point I have been making probably carries it to extremes. What I am concerned with is the possibility of banks, or officials in banks, making inquiries about groups of people with whom they have no dealings.

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of registering chattel mortgages is to ensure that there is an official record of mortgages available.  This protects the interests of the lender who is taking the charge and it enables a prospective lender to check whether any goods being offered as security are already mortgaged.  That is a very important check.  Subsection (6) provides that a <Col N="1301" /> recognised lender, in effect, any licensed bank or the ACC, may require any registrar to supply certified copies of any entries in the register relating to the stock of a person named in the requisition.  The concession is available to bona fide lenders only.  It would defeat one of the purposes of registration if such lenders could not obtain information about charges unless they had the prior consent of the mortgagee. Many countries have open registers and the EEC in a draft directive on securities are advocating open registers for all member countries, open to inspection by all and sundry.  There is quite an amount of protection here. Nobody need have any fear of somebody walking up with a draft register of electors looking for the list of everybody on that who might have some mortgage registered against him.  I do not see any necessity for the amendment.</P>

      <P>Are the Government in favour of the EEC proposals for open registers?  This proposal would run counter to traditional practice here where people's financial affairs are a matter between their God and their bank but not a matter for third parties who are just curious to find out the credit standing of the person.  The introduction of the EEC proposal in justification of the Minister's stand is somewhat ominous.  It implies that the Minister agrees with the EEC proposal, and that implication hangs over the whole debate.</P>

      <P>I am not getting many answers from the Minister, so I will have to.  The situation is that a draft directive if accepted becomes not just the law of the EEC but part of our law.  The fact that the Minister has cited an EEC proposal in support of his stand on this amendment implies that he agrees with the EEC proposal. If the Minister agrees with that it will become the law of the land and people who have their chattel mortgages regisstered in this register will have every reason to fear that every Tom, Dick or Harry who wishes to find whether or not an individual has a chattel mortgage registered against him will be able to see the register.  If the Minister accepts that proposal the consequences will be far more sweeping than the powers contained in this Bill even as it stands.  The protection to be provided by the amendment will not interefere with the normal commercial operations of recognised banks.  It is designed to prevent recognised banks who have no dealings with a person from getting information about that person's creditworthiness. It is not designed to prevent recognised banks who have dealings with a person from getting information. My amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Corporation shall not demand a charge prior to or in preference to an existing charge or burden on the folio, where the said burden or charge creates rights relating to rights of residence, maintenance and support in favour of the father or mother of the borrower.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I dealt with this matter extensively on Committee Stage of the Bill.  I outlined my reasons for having this amendment inserted.  With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will outline the situation of a typical family farm in rural Ireland.  Take a situation in which there is a father of 65 years whose son remains at home to help work the family farm.  The situation arises then that the son decides to marry and to bring his wife to live in the family home.  There is a family arrangement whereby the father who is the major owner agrees, with the consent of the mother, to transfer the farm to the son.  The necessary papers are drawn up.  In some cases there may be included provisions for certain financial sums but in the majority of cases no such provisions are inserted.  Normally the provision is that for considerations of natural love and affection the father decides to transfer the farm to his son but the father and mother in order to protect their own interests usually have inserted in the conveyance certain rights, usually the right of residence in the dwelling house or in a specific section of it and also the right to maintenance by the son.  These rights are registered on the folio in the Land Registry and they afford protection for the parents for their old age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> Should it transpire that the son, instead of attending to his duties on the farm, chose to spend his time on such pursuits as attending race meetings and drinking to excess, the rights included in the folio would prevent him from disposing of the family farm. However, the amendment is designed to cater for the vast majority of cases that work out satisfactorily for all parties concerned.  I am thinking of a son who may be most diligent in regard to working the farm but who, in order to develop the farm further, may apply for a loan to the ACC. He may intend investing in an extensive way in dairying, for instance, and may seek a loan of up to £20,000.  The local manager of the ACC will help with the application form which is then sent to Dublin where, ultimately, it arrives on the desk of the law agent in the ACC. He will discover that there are rights on the folio in favour of the parents of the applicant and, consequently, he will decide at that stage not to agree to the mortgage of the farm and will notify the applicant that in order to qualify for the loan it will be necessary for his parents to renounce their rights of residence, support and so on in favour of the ACC, thereby giving the corporation the first charge on the land certificate or title deeds.</P>
    <P>The applicant tells his parents this and reminds them that he is being restricted in the further development of his farm first because of the lack of sufficient capital and, secondly, because of his inability to raise the loan other than under the conditions stipulated by the ACC regarding the parents renouncing their rights.  The parents are now being asked to agree to release their charge in favour of the corporation and they are placed in the invidious position of having to make a choice between renouncing their rights and being the cause of preventing their son from expanding the holding.  They know that they may be the ones to be the sufferers in the long run.</P>
    <P>A decision to renounce their rights is likely to be satisfactory if the investment for which the loan is obtained proves successful but difficulties would arise if the applicant found himself in <Col N="1306" /> some difficulties after he had obtained the loan.  For example, he might find that a sizeable number of his dairy herd suffered serious damage as a result of brucellosis and had to be got rid of. In such circumstances it might be very difficult to restock.  The farmer is tied up with the ACC and may have great difficulty in meeting repayments and so on.  He may find that he has no income for a year or two.  If he continues to fall behind with his repayments to the ACC they may decide to call in the mortgage and the farm may have to be sold.  In such circumstances the parents rights are whittled away completely.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to this question. Irish farming has been developed consistently down through the years.  There has been fantastic progress in our agriculture, particularly in the last four to seven years.  The achievement in agriculture is something of which we can be proud, in comparison with the achievements of any farmers in the world.  Irish agriculture has stood the test of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but we are moving away from the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We have stood the test of time.  Our procedures and methods of farming have proved satisfactory. The transfer of family farms has proved a workable and satisfactory arrangement in almost all cases.  One reads articles in local and national papers, by Macra na Feirme, by the IFA and others, encouraging early transfer of the family farm by parents to a son or daughter who stays at home.  It is a good thing that we should continue to have early transfer of the family farm from father to son.  It is good for Irish agriculture that a young man should obtain the family farm at an early age rather than having it transferred to him when he is 35 or 40 years of age, at which stage a great deal of his initiative may have been dulled because of the fact that he has been playing second fiddle for so long. I would hope that the policy of transfer of family farms would continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any restriction resulting in the curtailment of such transfers would be <Col N="1307" /> detrimental to traditions in agriculture. The Agricultural Credit Corporation in the majority of instances ask that the parent release in favour of them when getting a priority charge.  It is in the mind of every father and mother when making a transfer of the family farm that they will be asked later to renounce their rights in favour of some financial institution such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation or a commercial bank.  This causes worry because this is the only occasion when parents are asked to renounce their rights when applying for a loan.  The vast majority of farmers obtain their credit facilities from the ACC.  There-fore, under this Bill, the ACC should be granted power&mdash;in fact, they should be directed by this House on behalf of the farming community&mdash;to allow credit facilities to persons and to ensure that the parents' rights will be maintained as a first right and that the Agricultural Credit Corporation right will take second place.</P>
    <P>To take the other side of the coin, I am certain that the Minister will be able to tell me that this would not be good banking practice or good practice for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to take a second charge and that this would be setting a precedent which would not be good for the standing of the ACC or that the ACC would be weakening their charges.  I am quite confident that the Minister will be able to tell me in a few minutes from now that to have a provision in the Bill directing the ACC to grant a loan would mean that the ACC would be unable to lend as much money as otherwise they might, in other words that there would be a curtailment in the amount of credit facilities they could extend.  This argument, while having a certain amount of merit, does not hold water.  Such a provision in the Bill should not restrict the ACC in the amount of money they would lend to a farmer.  I do not think it would affect it in any way.  My reason for saying this is that the interest to which I refer is limited to the life expectancy of the father and mother.  They are rights which pass away on the death of the parents.  They are not rights which will remain in existence indefinitely.  They <Col N="1308" /> are for a limited period.  This shows that the ACC would be in a position to take a second charge in respect of their mortgage.  There is no difficulty. The rights that I mention in the amendment remain on the folio, the rights of residence and so on.  They are a first charge.  The second charge would be the ACC charge and that will be written into the folio.  It will give the security.  It will be written into the land certificate and the title documents and it will be on the person's folio in the Land Registry.  There will be no problem with regard to the security the ACC will have.</P>
    <P>The ACC normally retain the land certificates or the title documents relating to the property of a borrower. It is standard practice that the ACC retain these title documents in the hands of the law agent in head office in Dublin.  Every farmer is quite happy to agree to this and is satisfied with it.  There are no problems.  The persons involved are quite agreeable to this procedure and there are no quibbles or questions and there is no difficulty. The ACC have their charges registered in the folios.  They retain possession of the land certificates.</P>
    <P>I am hoping that by my pressing this amendment and having it accepted the ACC will be entitled to grant loan facilities and will be directed to grant such loans facilities.  It will in no way impinge on the powers of the ACC to grant loan facilities.</P>
    <P>These are highly important matters. We wish to continue to encourage parents to transfer their farms.  This Bill must be seen to encourage farmers to transfer their farms at an early age.  The one way of ensuring early transfer is to do exactly what I have specified in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Enright has gone to great lengths to explain the position that obtains in practically every farm, big and small.  He mentioned the age at which persons transfer their farms and the danger involved.  There seems to be a slight contradiction.  Deputy Enright wants the full loan that would be given if there were no charges on the place, without asking that the charge be <Col N="1309" /> taken off the folio.  Deputy Fitzpatrick argued that we should not do that and that the ACC should not give loans to anyone who had a charge on the folio.  I said that in such case very few loans would be given.  In almost every case there is an agreement whereby parents have the right of residence and it is news to me that the ACC ask them to give away that right.  No parent would dare sign away such a right.  This was explained in rather too much detail by Deputy Enright, but everything he said was true.  If we want to encourage people to sign over the land at a younger age we must see that the right of residence is not taken away.</P>

      <P>I have relatives who have fairly high loans from the ACC and this has not been asked of the father and mother and would not be given.  Young people could tell them that their place is in the local home or in a private home.  I have not known of the ACC insisting that the folio be clear.  Almost every folio has the type of commitment to parents which Deputy Enright mentioned.  If the events described by Deputy Enright should occur and if the parents do not give their consent to remove the charge, the place could not be sold. The ACC are taking this chance.  I do not know of anyone in my own area having to withdraw the charge.  In the case of a charge against another borrower, the ACC insist that they must have the first charge.  County councils insist on that, too, but not in the case of a father and mother.  They will give a loan to a registered owner if the parents have a charge.  I should like this matter to be clarified.  I know people who have received loans from the ACC while their parents had the right of residence; the loan has been granted provided the ACC have the first charge.  A bank or any other lending institution would not give the money in such a case.  The ACC are caught if they allowed the charge to remain because they can never sell the place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Deputy Enright wants the ACC to consider a second <Col N="1310" /> charge.  Anyone with a second charge cannot sell without the consent of the first charge.  I am in favour of what Deputy Enright is saying but how could the amendment be implemented? If the Minister accepts the amendment and the parents have the first charge and the ACC the second charge, how can the place be sold if the son fails on the loan?</P>

      <P>(2)  <i>Social:</i> The primary objective of our aid programme is to promote the welfare of the peoples of the recipient countries, in particular the poorer sections of the population, and respond to their basic needs.  As most of the poorer people in developing countries live in rural areas it follows that the main thrust of our programme must be concentrated there.  We are also in a position to give expertise and experts particularly in the agricultural sector. An important factor, therefore, in deciding on the priority countries was whether the social structures in the countries concerned would facilitate this objective of channelling aid to rural areas.</P>
      <P>(3)  <i>Economic:</i> The selection took into account factors such as the relative poverty of the countries concerned, their actual need of outside aid and their ability to absorb and make effective use of the aid offered.  We also have in mind a relationship with the countries in question which involves co-operation and partnership, rather than just aid and assistance.</P>
      <P>(4)  <i>Cultural:</i> Factors taken into consideration here included the relevance of Irish experience, our historical and other links with the recipient countries, the possibility of being able to use English as a working language, and, in general, familiar legal, administrative and other systems.</P>
      <P>Our selection of countries for priority assistance is an ongoing process and I propose to review the situation from time to time.</P>

      <P>I recognise that the selection was made by the previous administration.  I understand from <Col N="1312" /> what the Minister did not say that he supports the selection and is maintaining the same criteria and holding the same countries that are listed in the reply?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the criteria are valid and relevant but I shall be reviewing the process from time to time.  That could mean that some other countries would be considered that were not previously beneficiaries and perhaps the level of our activity in some of the existing countries might change somewhat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his reply that there were negative political considerations which would prevent aid going to certain countries. Could I ask if there are positive political considerations that would encourage him on political grounds to provide aid, all other things being equal, to certain countries and if that criterion was applied in the selection of these?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, there are. As regards negative considerations, the recipient States generally are very sensitive in this area; they feel that political judgment should not generally be made by the States making the contributions. This is a particularly sensitive area in Africa.  By and large, I can assure the Deputy that there are certainly much more important positive political considerations that we take into account.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the attitude of the <Col N="1313" /> Government in relation to the addition of new member states to the EEC; and if he will make a statement outlining the up-to-date position on negotiations in regard to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has welcomed the applications of Greece, Portugal and Spain for membership of the European Communities.  We have acclaimed the return to democracy in these countries and we are conscious of the fact that the prospect of membership has been a significant factor in the process of democratisation.</P>
      <P>Enlargement, however, poses certain basic problems of an economic and institutional nature which could have serious consequences for the very nature of the Community.  The Government believe that positive action must be taken to prepare for new accessions.  In particular, we believe that a parallel approach should be adopted to promote the elimination of structural and regional disparities in the existing Community as well as providing for the needs of the applicant countries.  Ireland has also repeatedly stressed that adequate resources must be provided to deal with the problems of an enlarged Community and that action must be taken on institutional reform.</P>
      <P>Accession negotiations with Greece were formally opened in July 1976. Following an initial phase of exchanges of information on the various sectors, the negotiations are now entering on a more active and substantive stage which, it is hoped, will be concluded this year.  As regards Portugal and Spain, the Commission, in accordance with the provision of the Treaties, is at present preparing its opinions on the application of those countries.</P>

      <P>May I take it from what the Minister has said that we may expect that the gravy will be spread somewhat more thinly as a result of the additional members joining the EEC?  Without appearing to be a little Irelander or against the additional membership, can the Minister give us any idea of the economic consequences for this country in relation <Col N="1314" /> to the regional fund resultin from such additional membership?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it would have been obvious from my reply that that is one of our concerns, not just in our own interests but in the interests of the existing Community, that the Community has the parallel obligation to which I referred to ensure that adequate resources will be provided to enable the existing Community to meet its own obligations on its own stated terms.  In fact, we have consistently argued that were the applicant countries to join a Community that was weaker and less committed it would be of no benefit either to the existing Community or to themselves. We would certainly discourage thin gravy as the Deputy suggested.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has previously expressed the opinion that while the Irish position was one of muted welcome for new members, there was also a necessity to see that existing funds were such that no loss would accrue to this country as a result of the additional membership. Was it the position that the Greek authorities during his visit expressed reservations on the Irish position in relation to their admission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily. In fact I think anything I have said has been quite consistent in this connection and, I may say, has also been consistent with what has been said by my predecessor.  We have stated at all times that it is a condition precedent for the Community itself, not just for the applicant countries, that the Community would provide adequate resources to discharge its own obligations within the Community, <Col N="1315" /> enlarged or otherwise.  We made this quite clear to the Greeks and to the others and I think they accept that position.</P>

      <P>We secured agreement in July 1976 on the principle of the resources of the Community being enlarged proportionately with its membership.  May I take it that the Minister will insist on the practical implementation of that as and when enlargement comes about?  I take it that is the clear intent of his answer. On another point, may I ask him to state whether he maintains the second reservation which we in Government maintained in respect of the successful conclusion of these negotiations, that we would not agree to enlargement unless and until the decision-making processes of the Community were strengthened to carry the strain of an enlarged Community?  Does that remain an Irish precondition for settlement of the enlargement?</P>

When I restated it at the second Council meeting which I attended, both the Commission and the President of the Council accepted it and it has now been adopted in the minutes of the Council as being the Council position which is perhaps even stronger than having it as an Irish position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I believe that all of the Deputy's six questions bear in one way or another on the current Belgrade meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe&mdash;the CSCE&mdash;I propose with your permission a Cheann Comhairle, to take them together.</P>
      <P>The Final Act of the CSCE signed by 35 Heads of Government in Helsinki in 1975 had two main elements. First it contained what might be called a code of conduct, set out in the form of ten principles to govern relations between participating states.  One of these principles was that of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Secondly, the document set out a series of agreed measures designed to improve co-operation in such areas as economic relations, science and technology.  There were also provisions governing a number of humanitarian issues as well as aspects of information, education and cultural exchange.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki Final Act provided for a review meeting in 1977 and this meeting between representatives of the 35 participating states is still under way in Belgrade.  The meeting has a double purpose&mdash;to review the extent to which the 35 states which signed the Helsinki document in 1975 have carried out its provisions since then; and to consider further proposals which could lead to better implementation of these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these discussions in Belgrade there have been differences of approach by different states to the <Col N="1318" /> human rights issues which are the particular focus of the Deputy's questions. Our view of the importance of these issues is clear and we have made it quite clear at the meeting in Belgrade where we consult closely with our partners in the EEC and with other like-minded delegations.  I think it would be useful in reply to the Deputy's questions to indicate the general lines of our approach.</P>
    <P>This is based on the belief that the guarantee of these rights to every individual and the actual freedom to exercise and enjoy them in practice are vital to a decent national society.  It is natural that we should take this view because of the fact that the denial of political, economic and religious rights was often through our own history a central issue for us in Ireland. We in Ireland have also had a particular historical experience of the tragedies of family separation and exile and we have a corresponding concern to see the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act in these areas implemented.</P>
    <P>Of the Deputy's questions, two relate to the position of Jews in the Soviet Union with particular reference to the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act.  Two other questions relate to the position of specific named individuals who have been detained by the Soviet authorities.  I can understand the basis for the Deputy's concern about these matters, which have indeed been a focus for public concern in a number of countries; and I can confirm that I have had representations on these and similar issues from various bodies and from individuals in this country.</P>
    <P>I recognise&mdash;and I believe the Deputy will accept this&mdash;that inevitably there are limits to the extent to which a country such as ours can make effective representations to other countries with very different social systems on issues which do not involve our own citizens.  Nevertheless, we consider that if the process begun by the Final Act of Helsinki is to be effective it must be based not only on relaxation of tensions and growing co-operation between states but also in respect for human rights within states.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in consultation with its partners in the Community, has made its <Col N="1319" /> views on these issues clear again at the Belgrade meeting.  We have made clear that we believe it is important to carry out in practice the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act in all respects including the provisions in regard to human rights and the provisions on such humanitarian issues as family reunification. Beyond referring to this clear public position which we have taken, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go into detail on other representations which might be made in particular cases.  This approach is I believe generally accepted by various groups who have raised these issues with me from time to time and I hope the Deputy will also accept it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's question in regard to the Moscow Monitoring Group and the Charter 77 Group raises the question of the right of the individual to know and act upon his rights and to participate in the implementation of all the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act.  Our view on this too has been made clear at Belgrade and otherwise. We feel strongly that the governments who signed the Final Act and accepted its human rights provisions must ensure that their own citizens are free to exercise the rights which have been explicitly recognised and that they are free from official intimidation, harassment or arrest&mdash;or indeed from any abridgment of their rights merely because they have invoked them.</P>
    <P>As to the Deputy's more general question about the progress made at the Belgrade meeting, I can say that the review and discussion of new proposals have been carried out on a reasonably satisfactory basis, with a frank exchange of views on the implementation to date of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act.</P>
    <P>This review has shown that the way in which the undertakings accepted in Helsinki in 1975 has been carried out in practice has been satisfactory in some respects but less than satisfactory in others.  We recognise however that it is important to see the process of implementing the Helsinki Final Act as a continuing one and we <Col N="1320" /> believe that the effort to continue and improve it is worth while.  The Belgrade meeting has been discussing more than 90 new proposals from various participating states aimed at better implementation of the Helsinki provisions; and it is expected that another review meeting may be held in 1980 or 1981.</P>
    <P>The Belgrade meeting is now in its final phase&mdash;that of negotiating a concluding document.  I believe the meeting itself and the exchanges which have taken place there have been useful; and I would hope that it will now be possible for all of the participants to agree on a substantial concluding document.  This would reflect adequately the results of the meeting in various areas including that of human rights and incorporate a significant number of new proposals for improved implementation of the commitments undertaken in Helsinki.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said in one of the longest replies I have heard in this House.  There are a number of questions I would like to raise on it.

Can the Minister assure the House that, to his knowledge adequate preparations are being made between the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and his Department?

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if any progress has been made in establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China; if he is aware that the British Government is at present arranging expansion of British exports to that country; and if any examination is under way to assess the likelihood of commencing Irish exports to that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of opening diplomatic relations with states with which we do not at present have formal relations is kept under continuous review in the light of our international interests and the availability of the necessary resources.  As the opening of diplomatic relations is a matter for negotiation with, and requires the prior agreement of, the state concerned, <Col N="1324" /> it would be contrary to diplomatic practice for me to give the Deputy specific details with regard to the present status of our discussions with any particular country.  I can say, however, that the question of diplomatic relations with China is under active consideration at present.</P>
      <P>As regards British exports to China, I am aware that there have been recent reports in the media to the effect that the British authorities are currently reassessing the possibilities which exist for increased trade with that country.</P>
      <P>I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, that Córas Tráchtála have over the past number of years been continuously monitoring the potential for the development of Irish exports to China and they see prospects for exports of certain products.  Representatives of Córas Tráchtála have visited Peking and have had discussions with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) in the course of which they made the council aware of the range of goods available for export from Ireland.  In addition, the question of Ireland's possible participation in a proposed EEC exhibition to be held in Peking later this year is at present under discussion with the European Commission.</P>
      <P>It is to be hoped that the recently initialled trade agreement between China and the EEC will lead to increased Community exports (including Irish exports) to that country.</P>

      <P>In our attempts to expand trade with East European countries our experience would suggest that trade marches almost at the same level as the advance of diplomatic relations with these countries. Diplomatic relations become essential if one's trade with such countries is to be expanded.  Recently there was a report in <i>The Financial Times</i> that the Chinese Minister for Trade was visiting Britain.  At present the British authorities are very hopeful of expanding trade with China.  We should leave no stone unturned in trying to find out whether there is any possibility of increasing our trade with that very large country.  If we are serious about improving relations with <Col N="1325" /> Asia, that is the largest power there. The British see a possibility of increasing that trade.  We should leave no stone unturned in trying to expand our trade.</P>

      <P>In our discussions with countries with which we have existing diplomatic relations, notably some of the major countries who would have a political interest in having diplomatic relations with us, I have made it quite clear we believe one of the best ways of fostering good relations within countries is to allow us the freest possible access to their markets. If they wish to promote good relations within countries, one of the ways of proving that to us is to offer us every facility for expanding our exports.  I see diplomatic representation and trade as a priority in terms that the initial impact is made at political level, that is, ambassadorial level.  You then give a status and significance to the follow-up on behalf of the other organisations.  That is the way in which I will pursue the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant legislation is the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967 as amended in 1976.  The 1967 Act gave the force of law in the State to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963) which are contained at Schedules 1 and 2 respectively to the Act.  Articles 31 and 37 of the first-named convention set out the categories of persons entitled to immunity from criminal and civil jurisdiction by reason of their diplomatic status.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the question, the situation is regulated by article 38 which provides that only a diplomatic agent who is a national of or permanently resident in the State enjoys immunity from criminal and civil jurisdiction in respect of official acts performed in the exercise of his functions.  No diplomatic agent in Ireland comes within this category.  Other members of the staff of diplomatic missions of Irish nationality enjoy no immunity from criminal or civil process.</P>

However, the average prices per acre of land acquired by agreement, primarily for housing by Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation in 1967, 1972 and 1976 were approximately £1,500, £2,000 and £4,000 respectively.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Minimum standards of thermal insulation apply to local authority dwellings commenced after 1 July 1976.  These standards are set out in a statement issued by the Government Information Service on 7 August 1975.  The Draft Building Regulations, published in November 1976, contain detailed and comprehensive provisions in relation to thermal insulation which when the regulations are made will apply to new dwellings. In the meantime a new outline specification for private grant-type houses is being prepared in the Department and will be published in the near future.  It will contain provisions in relation to thermal insulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's involvement in relation to thermal insulation has so far been directed at efforts to secure minimum standards of thermal insulation at the construction stage of new dwellings.  The technical standards <Col N="1331" /> already published are therefore directed at builders rather than home-owners who wish to improve thermal insulation in their own houses.  Booklets and brochures in relation to improving home insulation have not yet been published by the Department as there is a very plentiful supply of such booklets, brochures and other information available from sources in the private sector and from other bodies, for example, the Electricity Supply Board, An Foras Forbartha and manufacturers and retailers of thermal insulation materials and systems.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of making loans available for the purchase of flats is a policy matter to be determined by each building society and one in which the Government do not propose to intervene.  The five largest societies make loans available for the purchase of flats.  However, I understand that they have experienced difficulties on issues such as title, management and insurance.  Where these difficulties can be resolved, loans are advanced.  The £1,000 new house grant, introduced by the Government in July last, is payable in appropriate cases in respect of the purchase of flats.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the would-be purchaser of <Col N="1334" /> a flat is as much entitled to consideration as the would-be purchaser of a house?  Would-be flat purchasers are motivated by the same desire to own their own dwelling.  Therefore, should they not have the same rights under the law as people who want to buy houses?  What are the Minister and the Government doing about ensuring that the building societies give equitable treatment in this respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Security for a house loan includes such aspects as title, and insurance.  This must be covered in the mortgage to ensure that the loan is secured and that the money lent will be recoverable.  There are security and other complications involved in making loans for single flat units which do not arise in the case of loans for the purchase of houses.  Section 79 of the Building Societies Act, 1977 obliges every director of a society to satisfy himself as to the adequacy of the security offered, thus underlining the importance attached to this aspect.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the most recent assessment by housing authorities of the housing needs of their areas, it appears that about 6,500 elderly persons are regarded by them as in need of rehousing, and that the nett annual prospective need over a period of five years is expected to be about 700.  The total requirements of elderly persons for dwellings to be provided by the combined efforts of the private and local authority housing sectors would be approximately 2,000 units per annum if all the accumulated and prospective needs were to be met within the next five years.  Housing authorities are at present providing a little more than 10 per cent of their <Col N="1337" /> total house completions, of about 700 new houses a year, suitable for elderly persons or small families, which is in line with the target recommended to them some years ago by my Department.</P>

      <P>In June 1976 my Department requested the 87 principal housing authorities to prepare and submit reports on housing needs in their areas.  It is not the practice for the Department to publish reports of needs for individual housing authorities; generally, these are available locally. However, a table giving a breakdown of overall needs based on reports received from the authorities since June 1976 has been prepared and is set out in a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of these reports and of an assessment of housing needs already <Col N="1338" /> prepared and published by the National Economic and Social Council in February 1976 the Government indicated in the recent White Paper <i>National Developments</i> 1977-1980, that they will ensure that housing output is maintained at levels between 21,000 and 27,000 houses each year up to 1980.</P>

    <P>  Debate resumed on amendment No. 17:</P>
    <P>In page 25, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> (4) The Corporation shall not demand a charge prior to or in preference to an existing charge or burden on the folio where the said burden or charge creates rights relating to rights of residence, maintenance and support in favour of the father or mother of the borrower.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Enright.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking to this amendment Deputy Enright referred to a very important point.  He was instancing the case of a person signing over his holding to a son who was to be married shortly.  The Deputy talked of a charge being put on the folio for the owner and his wife stipulating that they would be housed and maintained in the home by the son for the rest of their lives.  As I understand it, Deputy Enright is proposing that in the event of a loan being applied for subsequently the ACC would give the full amount and only take a second charge on the holding, giving the father and mother the first charge.  I was endeavouring to point out to the Deputy that, although I agree with him, I do not consider his proposal to be capable of implementation.</P>
      <P>We had reached the stage of removing the house from the farm.  Again, I find I am beating my head against a stone wall here.  If a son to whom a place is being transferred applies to have it subdivided&mdash;taking the house separately from the farm&mdash;the farm is in his name then and is free of any other claim on the folio.  However, it is usually provided in the transfer that the parents are to be supported; but if a son is reckless or for some other reason decides to sell the place, he cannot sell the house.  But, having sold the farm, how is he to maintain his parents?  On reaching 55 people are encouraged to transfer their holdings, but I cannot think of anyone in that age group who would be prepared to do this in the knowledge that, should the transferee sell the farm, there would be no income from which to maintain the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the ACC are insisting on parents releasing their charge.  I have never come across a case of this.  Neither have I come <Col N="1349" /> across a case of the ACC insisting on a place being sold.  I cannot envisage the corporation looking for a first charge and excluding the parents' rights to residence and support.  If they should act in this way there would be no loans because the parents would not relinquish their rights.</P>
    <P>Much as I would like to support the Deputy, the amendment is not practical.  We must rely on the common sense of the ACC.  So far as I know they are always reasonable to deal with and have no wish to sell out anybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright's amendment would seem to be in conflict with the argument put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick. His argument was that there be no right to mortgage in the event of their being a charge on the folio, but Deputy Enright is suggesting that the ACC give a loan without having first charge on the folio.  I am not a lawyer but I speak from practical experience; and my experience of the ACC is that if one approaches them for a loan and can produce the deeds of his holding, he will get the loan but the corporation will have first charge and that all other debts must be cleared.  I have never heard of the corporation asking whether one's parents had a charge against the folio.</P>
    <P>I would not wish to see a situation in which the ACC would refuse any loan because of there being a charge on a folio.  Deputy Fitzpatrick differs with me on that.  We are dealing with a very complicated matter about which lawyers could argue for a long time so we should be careful not to go into too much detail.  I cannot see how an arrangement could be reached whereby a house could be separated from a holding as such and that a separate charge for the house be put on the folio.  It is obvious that parents could not be supported by way of the house alone.  If they had no charge on the farm their rights to maintenance would be nil.  That is the reason why I think Deputy Enright should withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commend Deputy Enright's amendment to the favourable consideration of the <Col N="1350" /> Minister.  The amendment is designed to encourage something which all sides of this House are anxious to encourage, namely, the transfer at the earliest feasible time of the effective ownership and management of a farm from a father to his son or daughter. It is well known in Ireland that the age of succession is late, too late, indeed, for the best benefit to be obtained from the land by the people of Ireland.  The encouragement of such a development is obviously facilitated if there are safeguards for the parents who are transferring the land as to their ability to continue living in the family home after they have transferred the ownership in legal terms of the home and the surrounding farm to their son or daughter as the case may be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright's amendment is designed to deal with the problem wherein this right of residence could be undermined by a charge being given against the entire holding, both the land and the house, by the son who subsequently succeeded, in the event of his being unable to meet his liabilities under the loan whereby the whole place would be sold, including the house, and the right of residence which the son had originally granted to his parents would be set at naught.</P>
      <P>For this, of course, to happen requires three conditions to be fulfilled: firstly, that the land was transferred from father to son subject to right of residence; secondly, that the son takes out a loan from the ACC and the ACC get a charge against the whole holding, including the house; and thirdly, that the son fails to pay the loan for one reason or another and the whole place has to be sold.  These three conditions have to be fulfilled before the problem mentioned by Deputy Enright arises. So, it will not be something that will happen every day.  Deputy Callanan may not be aware of a case in his own constituency, although I acknowledge his experience in this matter is very wide indeed and I do not think his lack of formal training as a lawyer is any disability to him in helping people or contributing to debates in this House on legal matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright's amendment seeks <Col N="1351" /> to prevent the ACC from including the house in which there would be right of residence amongst the items which would be subject to this charge and which could be sold forcibly by the ACC, thereby, if you like, underwriting the right of residence that may be given by a son to his father, and in the case of a father transferring, subject to right of residence, to his son, even if he wanted to, he could not create a situation in which that right of residence would be undermined by its becoming subject to a prior charge in favour of the ACC.  That is basically what the amendment is doing&mdash;in other words, giving parents an additional assurance that their right of residence is being copper-fastened and cannot be undermined by any subsequent agreement by the son in relation to mortgaging the place to the ACC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan made the point with some force as to how could one make this work, because to do it, he claimed, one would have to create a separate folio for the house at the time the ACC loan was originally being negotiated.  This, I gather, is the case that Deputy Callanan is making.  I do not believe that that would be necessary.  This is something that would not necessarily happen.  It would only happen if the son defaulted on the loan, and that would be very much a minority of cases.  The necessity for a second folio will occur only if the place has to be sold in a forced sale.  It would never be created at the time the original loan was being negotiated.  I know that it is quite common for separate folios to be created relatively quickly for plots on areas of land for, for instance, a house to be built.  It should not, therefore, be very difficult for a folio for an existing house to be created separate from the folio for the total farm, if the eventuality were to arise that the place had to be sold forcibly, so as to enable it to be sold separate from the house, thereby preserving the right of residence.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the problem as to how the son could maintain his parents in the home if he no longer had the farm.  I would respectfully <Col N="1352" /> submit that that is a separate problem. We are talking here, not about maintenance, but about right of residence</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that in any event they are separable and that it is possible, for instance, to have an amendment, if one believes, as Deputy Callanan submits, that without the farm the son would be unable to maintain and support his father or mother and there would be no real property with which he could do that.  It should still be possible to preserve the right of residence, which in many cases is what is most important to parents more important than the right of maintenance because the right of main tenance, even if it is being enforced probably creates means which disqualifies the parents or prevents them getting full rate of old age pension.  So if they lose the right of support, they possibly can gain in terms of the old age pension they will get, if it is a non-contributory pension.  On the other hand, if they lose right of residence, there is no way that can be compensated for by the State.  I would submit that, certainly, as far as the amendment is concerned with the right of residence, it is quite possible and desirable to separate that right and the house from the land to be charged In so doing one would encourage parents to pass on their farms to their sons at an earlier age than otherwise they would.</P>
      <P>There may be some doubt as to how maintenance and support could be met in this case but I am sure the Minister will be in a position to deal with that. Deputy Enright will be replying when the Minister has again spoken and he probably will be able to make the case there too.  I would ask the Minister to consider the amendment favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a lot of confusion in the Deputies' minds <Col N="1353" /> when they talk about the reasons for this amendment.  If they read the section and properly understood it, they would realise that what we are trying to do is to facilitate the very people talked of in Deputy Enright's amendment. Where there is a charge registered on the basis of residence or maintenance or support on the folio, we are now enabling the ACC to give a loan with only second priority charge.  That still remains as a first priority.  So, there is a lot of confusion in that regard.</P>
      <P>What is being talked about by Deputy Enright and the others is a valid point in relation to the alleged practices of the ACC.  I do not have any knowledge of the ACC demanding, where these priority rights exist, that they should be foregone in favour of the ACC before they grant a loan. If that has been the case, the ACC have not the authority to demand such a priority.  This Bill does not give them that authority and we would not condone it.  If we are made aware of situations where this practice is followed by the ACC, we will ask them to cease that practice.  It would be our intention that as much land as possible is passed from the older generation to sons and daughters and that there would not be confusion as to their rights.  Any involvement with the son or daughter would not in any way interfere with those rights through dealings with the ACC in regard to a loan.  This section specifically states that where such rights exist the ACC can give a loan and be satisfied with second charges.  The main purpose is to facilitate people such as those mentioned by Deputy Enright and other speakers.</P>
      <P>There is no necessity for this amendment. If this practice is being carried on by the ACC, it is not our intention that it would be so; we do not condone it and we would ask them to cease.  It is our wish that elderly people who own land can in all fairness pass it on without interfering with the ability of a son or daughter to obtain finance from the ACC or from the recognised banks.  The amendment is not necessary and I do not accept it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has <Col N="1354" /> stated that the ACC would agree basically with the sentiments expressed in my amendment.  He went on to state that it is not the wish of the ACC to request borrowers to ask their parents to forego their claims.  He also stated that the ACC would not condone the practice whereby borrowers would put pressure on their parents to take second charges.  He concluded by saying that he is not agreeable to the amendment. Having made the first three statements, the logical follow-through would seem to have been that after consideration the ACC would agree to this amendment.</P>

      <P>If the ACC wish to ensure that this practice does not continue, surely this should be incorporated in the Bill.  I dealt at some length this morning with the history of the situation.  I gather from the contributions of various speakers that it is believed that the ACC are not requesting people to forego their rights and are not requesting farmers to have their parents accept a second charge, thereby granting the ACC the first charge.  I believe it is generally accepted throughout the country that a considerable number of applicants receive loans on these terms.  This is normal practice.  I am in a minority of one in the House in saying that this is standard practice at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for the views of Deputy Callanan and his contributions on this Bill, as on all agricultural matters, are to be listened to and studied.  Much thought goes into the preparation of them and he has had years of experience.  On this matter I must say that it is the practice that people have to forego their rights and take second charges.  I accept the point in regard to opening a second folio, thereby separating the house from the lands.  If we take the case of a 75-acre farm and dwelling-house there is no problem in separating the dwelling-house and half an acre of land from the farm itself, leaving the 74½ acres on the original land certificate and opening a second folio for the dwelling-house and the half acre.  There is no problem whatsoever. <Col N="1355" /> The Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture have accelerated the process.  It is not necessary to get the consent of the Land Commission for the sub-division of sites of less than one acre and this has simplified the procedure.  All a person has to do is mark out the dwelling-house and half acre of land on an Ordnance Survey map or a Land Registry map and lodge it in the Land Registry.  There would be no difficulty in regard to the rights of residents.</P>
    <P>I had considered putting down a further amendment on these lines but I had thought that the Minister might accept a full amendment.  Probably he will not accept the amendment and we are unable to push it through, so there is nothing further I can do.  This matter will be coming before the Seanad and in the intervening time I would ask the Minister to consider the introduction of a formal amendment to the Bill.  It is necessary and desirable. It can be done quite easily in regard to sub-division.  The land certificate of the parent holding could be lodged with the ACC and the first charge could go on that.</P>
    <P>In regard to rights of maintenance and support, those charges could be maintained and remain on the folio. Even in that instance, as Deputy Bruton pointed out, the parents will at least be safeguarded in some way in regard to rights of residence.  It would not cause the same inconvenience to the parents to accept at least a right of residence&mdash;they would have a right of residence&mdash;and ask them to forego as a second charge the right of maintenance and support on the original farm folio which would be, in the example I have given, of 74.5 acres. This would not present the same problem and would not cause that great imposition and amount of arm twisting and pressurising of a parent that might otherwise ensue.</P>
    <P>This Bill has given us an opportunity to highlight something important.  We have many excellent farming correspondents, the Drover in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and different reporters <Col N="1356" /> who contribute to <i>The Farmer's Journal</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be excellent reporters but what has that to do with this amendment? The Deputy must get another opportunity to praise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not altogether to praise them that I intended but I wanted to highlight this matter.  Some of these matters are never mentioned by these correspondents who probably do not come across them frequently. Matters of this nature rarely come to the attention of the public and since we are discussing it on this Bill I think many people involved in agriculture should give it some thought in the years ahead.  It has been there in the past and it will arise in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the loan are agreed and these matters are discussed.  These questions are put: &ldquo;What is the position in regard to such a charge on the folio?  Will you be able to get it changed?&rdquo;  Before letters of approval of the loan are issued verbal agreement has generally been reached.  The matter has been cleared to such an extent that when letters of approval issue all these charges in favour of parents have been put in second place. I accept the good faith of the Minister on this matter and that he is stating his own opinion, but if the position is as the Minister states&mdash;at the beginning of my remarks I took three paragraphs from the Minister's statement dealing with this matter&mdash;I would ask the Agricultural Credit Corporation to issue a statement that this is not one of the conditions they seek.  That simple request should clarify the position.  Until I get that, I stand over my statement and defy contradiction on it.  If the position is not as I state, they should state the contrary.  I want them to come out in the open and put that in print.  I am dealing with something that has serious implications for the farming community.  Perhaps I speak only on behalf of a certain section who are obtaining credit but this situation can come to the door of any farmer.  Many may say: &ldquo;That will never happen to me&rdquo;.  Many parents may say the same thing.  I put it to them that it can <Col N="1357" /> happen to them and I want to safeguard them and ensure that the interests of those signing over their farms are protected.  That is why I think it important and why I think a categorical statement should come from the ACC contradicting me if I am wrong and stating what the position is, thus giving me an opportunity to investigate it further because I believe that what I have stated is correct.</P>
    <P>The practice has grown up of having rights in favour of people on farms and I think it is absolutely essential that we should continue this and have these rights retained on folios as charges in favour of the parents who transfer farms.  We must safeguard their rights and so encourage early transfers.  My amendment is reasonable and I ask the Minister to accept it.  It should cause no inconvenience or difficulty.  The ACC charges would be registered on the folio and they would retain possession of the land certificate and everything else.</P>

As I said on Committee Stage, irrespective of what is said in the House, if the matter is contested later it is what is written into the Acts of Parliament that counts, not what is recorded in the Dáil debates.  This would be a way of copper-fastening the situation if what the Minister states is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> In page 35, after line 36, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>62.&mdash;(1)  An offence under this Act may be prosecuted by the Minister. The Minister may delegate responsibility for the prosecution of offences under specified sections of this Act to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>(2)  A prosecution under this Act may be instituted within three years after the offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is really only a drafting amendment which should lead to no controversy. The Bill creates offences under sections 27, 29 and 35 and offences are also liable to be created for breaches of the regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice under section 26.  Yet, there is no section in the Bill which fixes responsibility on any Minister for the prosecution of offences.  I think it is normal in legislation such as this to have a section in the Bill which says that a particular Minister is responsible for prosecution and which sets a time limit within which prosecutions can be instituted. Otherwise, I am not sure what happens, whether it falls to the Director of Public Prosecutions to institute proceedings. I do not know whether he has either the mandate or the office staff to enable him to oversee the implementation of this highly specialist legislation.</P>
    <P>Therefore there should be a new section inserted in the Bill to fix responsibility on the Minister for Finance, and in certain cases the Minister for Justice, for prosecuting offences under this Bill. The offences created relate to breaches of secrecy of the register of chattel mortgages, to abuse by the mortgagor of the right to sell to the obstruction of the mortgagee in inspecting the existence or non-existence of the mortgage taxes, and to the provision of false information to a creditor in respect of a chattel mortgage.  It is necessary that there be somebody to prevent abuses and to oversee the legislaton in order that abuses be prevented. To make certain that there is this amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>No.  It is a matter for the offended party to take what-ever action he feels necessary.  He can do it in either of two ways.  He can get in touch with the police who would ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute, or the offended party himself can prosecute and thereby become the complainant. There is no necessity for this new section or this amendment at all.  It is a matter for the offended party to take whatever steps he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I am worried about&mdash;and perhaps it has been dealt with&mdash;is the position under section 26.  Here we are concerned with regulations which may be made by the Minister for Justice to preserve the secrecy of the register of chattel mortgages.  Obviously it would be an offence if the secrecy of the register were breached.  Yet there does not seem to be a provision here, certainly in the Bill as it stands, for anybody to prosecute a person who makes a breach of secrecy of the register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, because the person who got information he should not have got might have got it against a large number of people, and the people about whom he got information might not know or have any means of knowing that he got the information about them.  Obviously there is a need for somebody else to be overseeing the implementation of these regulations to ensure that in general secrecy is not breached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's answer does not meet the case in relation to section 26 as <Col N="1360" /> clearly as it meets the case in relation to the other three sections I mentioned. It may be that the regulations made by the Minister for Justice can provide for offences and the prosecution of offences by means of the regulations. I doubt if one can provide for offences and the prosecution of offences within a regulation made under a section if the section itself does not create an offence or give a right to prosecute.  Section 26, as I read it, does not do so.  That is one of the reasons why I introduced section 62 in the form of an amendment.  I am not absolutely certain that my amendment meets the case under section 26 either, because it is not specifically related to section 26.  Perhaps the Minister would have a look at the matter.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few points on this Bill.  As has been said a few times in this debate, a promise was made in the election campaign that a scheme would be introduced leading to the abolition of residential ground rents.  This Bill does not fulfil that pledge.  It provides an opportunity for people to buy their ground rents <Col N="1363" /> voluntarily, but it does not abolish ground rents unless every ground rent tenant chooses to avail of the opportunity offered by this Bill.  If one person does not, ground rents will not have been abolished.</P>
      <P>The Bill is little different in material respects from that introduced by the former Minister for Justice.  It substitutes the Land Registry as the land agent for the county registrars who were the agents in the previous Bill.  I have argued that it would be more convenient for most people if the county registrars were responsible, because they are in all the provinces and all the counties.  Therefore, they are more accessible to ground rent tenants than the Land Registry.  It is well known that the Land Registry are understaffed and overworked and it is very difficult to transact business there.  Therefore, the transfer of functions in the Bill in that respect is unwise.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is to fulfil his election pledge he will have to bring in another Bill doing what he told the electorate he would do.  The last point I want to deal with is legal expenses. Even though the provisions in this Bill are supposed to be simple, in many cases, in addition to the purchase cost, people will have to pay a solicitor to buy out their ground rents.  I would ask the Minister to see if some way can be found to obviate the need for legal costs.  People buying a new house have to meet legal costs and they will have to face further legal costs if they want to buy out their ground rents. Therefore, the value of buying out the ground rent, which very often does not involve a large amount of money, could be countered to a significant extent by the legal costs.</P>
      <P>I give the Bill a qualified welcome in the expectation that the Minister will be coming back with another Bill which will fulfil the promise made to the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on staying within the time limit promised.  This Bill is one of the measures giving effect to the Government's proposals in the area of landlord and tenant law.  Another <Col N="1364" /> Bill has gone through this House and is with the Seanad dealing with the abolition of existing ground rents.  The Minister has stated that he will introduce legislation dealing with other aspects of the landlord and tenant laws which require amendment.  We on this side of the House accept that some of them are urgent and that the Minister realises that.</P>
      <P>Opposition Deputies have said we have broken our promise and our commitment. I said at meetings that we would provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  We also said six months would be the time limit.  We have honoured that promise.  In the area I represent we must have 50 or 60 residents' associations.  They would like to see amendments to the Bill, but on Committee Stage amendments can be put forward by both sides of the House and fully discussed.</P>
      <P>It was made clear by the Minister in Opposition that we never intended to introduce the total abolition of ground rents.  It would take away rights from landlords, to a certain extent, if that were done without some type of compensation.  Naturally, in certain instances, cases for compensation might have to go to arbitration, but you do not take away a man's right without giving him some consideration and perhaps compensation. I do not think it was ever intended that the State should pay that compensation. Otherwise we would have had to say where we would get the money.  Nothing was said about that in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my dealings with residents' associations over the past four or five years I found the problem was that you could make a deal with a builder to buy out your ground rent, but then there was the matter of legal costs. That was the big factor.  The builder said &ldquo;You can buy it out for £100 but the legal costs will be £200&rdquo;. Naturally that would be bad economics for any working man.  Prior to the election people in many estates I know of were negotiating to buy their ground rents and would have been very happy to pay £100 legal costs and £100 ground rent.  They considered that was a fair deal and <Col N="1365" /> were going ahead with it until they were told by the combined residents' associations and the Opposition to wait for our Bill.</P>
    <P>Now we have the Bill.  Its main feature concerns how a tenant may acquire the fee simple.  People may say it is not total abolition.  It is not if the tenant has no interest in acquiring the fee simple.  He cannot be forced to do so because that would be taking away his rights.  The Bill sets out the conditions with which any lessee or tenant must comply to contract the right to acquire the fee simple.  It is a simplification of the provision that existed already.  Heretofore if an individual wanted to buy out his fee simple he would have to go back through the Acts of 1958, 1967, 1971 and all the amendments to the 1931 Act in respect of building leases, proprietary leases and so on.  Certainly no association in the city understood this type of thing.  Now it has all been consolidated.</P>
    <P>Another welcome feature of this Bill is that all known classes of tenants should be given the right to acquire the fee simple, something which did not exist heretofore.  There always seemed to be a discrimination against somebody purchasing a local authority house and this has now been removed. In the case of most housing estates in Dublin, if there is agreement the fee simple can be got for £5.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned the county registrars.  I would have thought that anything that cut down on the risk of documents or papers being lost in the post or between 26 different offices would have been welcomed, but apparently not.  Conversion of the leasehold to the fee simple, giving it to the Land Registry rather than to the county registrars, seems to me to be a very good idea.  The Minister outlined clearly in his speech that it was not merely thrown into the Land Registry, that there was a whole new section involved, with additional jobs being created.  Obviously that fact went unnoticed also.  We have noticed also that the procedure for local authorities will be slightly different, in that it will be through vesting orders rather than through the Land Registry.  In most <Col N="1366" /> cases probably a fee of £5 would clear up the matter.</P>
    <P>Another feature of this Bill which I am sure will be very welcome is the removal of the right a landlord had for years past that if somebody had not paid up within, I think a period of 12 months, he could come in and eject them from the house.  I think it was the legislation of 1931 which said that the residents owned the bricks and mortar but, just because the landlord had some small right to the property, he could come along and eject somebody. Naturally, like any creditor or debtor, he has the right to sue if there is money owed to him.  That is fair enough.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of amendments put forward by the other side of the House.  Probably the Minister will come back on these on Committee Stage, and a lot more will be heard from this side of the House before the discussion ends.  But the Bill as a whole is what we put to the people.  We made that commitment and it can be clearly seen that we have fulfilled it.  It should be remembered that Judge Conroy, who is chairman of the commission, will be called upon very soon to deal with the other matters.  The second stage of the commission's proceedings has been almost completed and I look forward to stage three.</P>

      <P>I think you, Sir, were in the Chair when the first of what the Minister elegantly described as a trilogy of Bills was going through.  You would not allow me to say anything except about the contents of the Bill actually before the House and I remember that you applied a polite and very firm rein to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you politely but very firmly controlled me when I tried to put the first of these Bills into the perspective of the ones which were to come.  I said on that occasion, as well as I could through the impediments you were placing in my way&mdash;quite rightly no doubt&mdash;that I never had <Col N="1367" /> much sympathy with the agitation against ground rents.  I was accurately reported but misinterpreted and misunderstood in that regard.  I should like to take this opportunity to say again what I feel about this problem.</P>
      <P>In a society like this, which is a capitalist one, for better or worse, even people who are not capitalists&mdash;and I am by no means an unqualified supporter of capitalism&mdash;must understand that it is a capitalist society. Perhaps it will not be in ten or 50 years time, but it is at present.  At present, for better or for worse, rightly or wrongly, people are permitted to invest their money in a wide variety of ways.  Some of these ways have got social dimensions which are, very rightly, controlled.  The question of housing is one of these.</P>
      <P>Investment in house property&mdash;if there are tenants in the house property &mdash;will attract all kinds of social controls under the Landlord and Tenant Acts, Rent Restrictions Acts and so on.  That is perfectly proper.  But by and large people are entitled to invest as they please.  That may be a bad thing, and perhaps the political wheel will turn to the point that that will no longer be possible.  But at present, and for the 55 or 56 years that this State has run, it has been lawful.  The State and the law have drawn no distinction between one kind of investment and another.  They have drawn basically no distinction between one kind of operation of the market forces and another.  When I hear people singling out ground rents&mdash;even though I understand well that the thing has got overtones connected with features of a very unhappy national past&mdash;when I hear people singling out this particular imposition, attacking it as though there was something different in kind about it from other situations in which one man is drawing an income which he has not earned by his sweat&mdash;at least is not at present earning by his sweat &mdash;I ask myself why, what is there about this imposition which is so objectionable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not forget that during all the years when developers were putting up houses and reserving ground rents <Col N="1368" /> for themselves, presumably they were doing that on a calculation of how they were going to get the best return on their money.  That may have been very selfish of them, very unsocial of them, but it is not against the law of this country&mdash;not yet anyway&mdash;and never was.  Every developer who decided he was going to sell the bricks and mortar, as they have been described, for £8,000, £9,000 or £12,000 and reserve a ground rent for himself, in the operation of a free market, could have been faced with the competition of another developer who was simply going to sell the freehold.  There was not any reason in the wide world why developers might not have sold freeholds. Many of them have done that and are doing it, putting themselves, <i>prima facie</i>, in a favourable position from the point of view of competition with the builder who was reserving a ground rent for himself over and above the purchase price.  In that event presumably the builder selling the free-hold would have calculated his return on his investment in a different way and that would have been reflected in a somewhat higher capital price of the house.</P>
    <P>It seems to me a strange thing that there should be so much heat generated about a situation in which a man who calculated his investment in a housing estate, charges so much by way of a lump purchase price and reserves something for himself which, if he were not allowed to reserve it, would be reflected instantly in a higher purchase price should be held out as being a remnant of landlordism in the sense in which the word was understood in the year 1800.  It seems to me a strange thing that a house purchaser who has benefited from the fact that the capital cost of a house is presumably that much lower&mdash;on the whole a ground rent is not very large when weighed against the average family annual budget&mdash; should complain about this particular incident of life into which he has entered with his eyes open.  He freely signed a contract which was quite open to him not to sign.  Nobody forced him to buy this particular house to which this rent was attached.</P>
    <P>I hope there are not people so unconscionable as to represent those <Col N="1369" /> words as being a defence of the ground rents system as such.  It is not. It is a plea for straight thinking on this and related topics.  If we do not want a free-market economy, if we do not want the free play of competition and of capitalism in this field, let us say so and let us cut out the whole question of bricks, mortar and roofs from the free market area of our economy. The Constitution permits that, and I doubt if I would vote against it; but so long as that is not against the law I submit that we should not go along weakly with agitations which are irrational.</P>
    <P>I do not own any ground rents.  I do not pay ground rent: I bought my small ground rent seven or eight years ago, a very small one.  I do not hold any brief for any person who owns a ground rent, but I say that this is no different in kind from any other question of investment.  They all represent unearned income.  A man who develops a surplus has sweated all his life for it.  He has accumulated his savings, by his deciding to put money by instead of spending it on drink or on holidays.  A man like that who invests his money in anything, be it post office savings or a State-issued security, is essentially putting money into other people's sweat and by way of return from that he will get the product of other people's sweat.  I am not an economist, but that seems to me to be a proposition so clear that I apologise to the House for wasting time arguing it.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any difference in the world between investment of surplus money, assuming one has earned it fairly and squarely, in ground rents or in an industrial security or in post office savings.  If one gets a percentage return on that one is profiting without earning it from somebody else's effort.  Exactly the same is true in regard to an investment which the possession of a ground rent represents. In this matter I am not fanatical one way or another.  I would willingly go along with my party and I believe my party hold that ground rents are socially undesirable.  What I object to is the weak-minded throwing of every cheap sop a political party can think of to every pressure group in the <Col N="1370" /> country when it comes to election time.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the abolition of motor taxation, for which there is absolutely nothing to be said, and possibly the abolition of wealth tax which was not, I admit, promised in the pre-election manifesto, the party who made these promises had no notion of fulfilling the one in respect of ground rents, or in the terms in which that promise was made.  That promise was perhaps the most unjustifiable part of their campaign.</P>
    <P>I do not want to drag the discussion too far afield or to drag people into it who possibly do not belong in it, but I have to note that the day before the Bill was introduced one of the most significant and important Ministers&mdash; if the Minister for Justice will not mind my appearing to put the other Minister momentarily above him&mdash;the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, spoke here with considerable heat about the hypocrisy of the Leader of my party having taken the line he did about the budget.  I will make allowances for others as I hope they make allowances for me in regard to things said in the heat of the moment which one might not write down and stand over if one got the chance to look at them again, but I must note that this leading member of the Government said, as reported at column 751, volume 303, of the Official Report of 7 February 1978:</P>
    <P>I should be the last to claim perfection but I should try to claim honesty.  That is why I am so vicious or so bitter in this attack&mdash;because I will not stand for hypocrisy, humbug and double talk.  When I come here to make a political speech I make a political speech.  I use one hand. I state my view and I stick to it. When I want to write an academic paper I know where to go and do it in academic form.  I cannot stand anyone sailing under false colours, claiming to be doing one thing while doing the opposite.  I am sorry for being so firm on the issue but I have my views also.</P>
    <P>Later on he thundered:</P>
    <P>Presumably we would have been more mortal still had we not said anything specific last summer; in <Col N="1371" /> other words fudged the issues, go in for the traditional approach&mdash;if you can avoid saying anything specific, for heaven's sake do not commit yourself to anything, just talk in general terms and hopefully you will fool enough of the people enough of the time to get yourself re-elected.  It was because we were determined to put an end to so much of that political humbug that we said what we did in our manifesto and what we are now doing in government.  We said: we will spell out very specific commitments and we will carry them through, deliberately....</P>
    <P>It was a fine exercise in contrived indignation.  I should like to hear this saintly Minister who has such a high line of morals, who is so well able to tick off men like Deputy FitzGerald, come in here and put his reputation for fairness and honesty, which I do not dispute, on the line.  I am saying this because it will cast light on what is going on in the House.  I should like to see the Minister come into the House and put his reputation for being intellectually honest on the line in defence of this Bill.  I cannot command which speakers come in, even of my own party, even when I was Whip, and I certainly cannot do it now for the Minister's side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is a collective authority and in a sense I do not need to make that challenge because I can tar Deputy O'Donoghue with the vicarious brush of &ldquo;the ground rents swindle&rdquo;, but so long as he does not come in to speak on this Bill he <Col N="1372" /> can take the line: &ldquo;Well, you know, that is Gerry Collins' Bill.&rdquo;  I do not say he would do that but I should like to see him coming in here to defend this Bill, to relate it specifically to the manifesto.  I should like to see this paragon of academic virtue&mdash;I believe he may well be that&mdash;asserting in the House that what is going on here is the abolition of ground rents or even a scheme leading to their abolition.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not fanatical about ground rents one way or another.  I do not go along with the kind of agitation which has been got up about ground rents because it is not a straight agitation. I am sure it is well-intentioned, but it is not straight in the sense that ground rents as an economic phenomenon are no different from a hundred other types of investment which are regarded not only as legitimate but are favoured.  I would have supported the Bill the Minister's predecessor brought in and I support the general outline of this Bill, but I object to the statement from those benches that the Leader of my party is a humbug or a hypocrite when the very next day another member of the same collective authority can be brazen enough&mdash;I confess he is a genial and likeable rogue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I did not mean anything seriously defamatory. The Minister opposite has got a nerve which I do not believe the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, would exhibit&mdash;not yet anyway: his contacts with his collective-authority colleagues may weaken his moral fibre over the years but he has not yet got the nerve <Col N="1373" /> to come in here to assert that the Bill in front of us represents a scheme leading to the abolition of ground rents.</P>
      <P>I do not want to start opening dictionaries for the House.  The last time I tried to make this point you would not allow me to continue along those lines, but let me take a common expression which one runs across frequently. There were occasions in ancient history in the Greek world, in the Roman world and since, in which as a social measure in order to relieve the intolerable burden of accumulated debt and interest which the people concerned were incapable of paying off, a tyrant or sovereign authority said: &ldquo;We are going to cancel debts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is called an abolition of debt. Suppose there were an abolition of debt today, or suppose a political party promised that there would be an abolition of debt, would a person regard it as an abolition of debt if he is told that he would still have to pay back the bank, but that he would be let off the bank charges, or that any dealings he had with the bank through his solicitor would be free of charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not the first speaker on this side of the House to make that point. I may not have as good a nose for the political wind as the Minister opposite has.  I know the Minister is an old hand and I certainly will not vie with him for the honour of being a better reader of political signs, but I can sense that the public are not too interested in this piece of hookery.  I know the Minister has been given a disagreeable job and I sympathise with him.  Although I do not think that my party would have the hard neck to do such a thing, I can imagine a Minister of my party sitting where the present Minister is and finding himself obliged to make some show of carrying out this promise.  I can imagine that Minister gritting his teeth and putting his head to the wind.  I might do it myself if I had to, so I sympathise with the Minister.  But I must warn the Minister that when his party begins to slip downhill in Government, this piece of hookery will be remembered and will be resurrected.  I believe this Government <Col N="1374" /> have already slipped due to the abolition of the wealth tax.  I will have more to say about that tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on this Bill, I hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The first sod in the grave of the Government of the 21st Dáil has been dug with the abolition of wealth tax.  This piece of hookery will go down in the political folklore of the country, and the Minister's children and grandchildren will hear about the time Fianna Fáil &ldquo;abolished the ground rents&rdquo;.  That will always be good for a horse laugh.  This is not an abolition of ground rents.  If I were in charge of the Fianna Fáil Government and found that, perhaps in the heat of an election campaign, I had made this promise, instead of going through this charade, which devalues the currency of political language by trying to make people believe that they are carrying out promises, I would tell the people that we could not abolish ground rents, that we could not constitutionally confiscate ground rents and that we could not afford to abolish them by means of compensation.  They were the only two options open.  It would have been fairer to say, just as my party ought to have said in relation to the promise to control prices in the 14-point plan, that it could not be done&mdash;that promise should never have been made; there is no such thing as a control of prices unless everything else in the economy can be controlled&mdash;it would have been a better use of the political function that a Government have if they had said: &ldquo;Forgive us, we have not done badly; we have abolished the motor tax and the rates; we are on the way to carrying out promises in regard to tax concession and we are trying to create the jobs that we said we would create but we made a mistake in talking about abolishing ground rent.&rdquo;  I would argue with some of those points, but some colour of substance could be advanced for them.  Such honesty would have made more friends for the Minister and his party than this abuse of language.  Abuse of language is an abuse of thought and honesty.  It would be an interesting spectacle if the Minister <Col N="1375" /> who saw fit to lecture Deputy FitzGerald on hypocrisy and humbug the other day would come in here and assert to this House that he considered this Bill to amount to a &ldquo;scheme leading to the abolition of ground rents&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In large outline, as the Minister knows, this Bill corresponds to part of the Bill which the former Minister, now Senator Cooney, introduced.  Some of the Fianna Fáil publicity during the election related to the delay which the last Minister for Justice appeared to be guilty of, in introducing this Bill. When I was Whip, part of my job was trying to bring on business in a reasonable rhythm.  There was no Minister that I pestered more about any measure than the last Minister for Justice about this Bill.  The reason why it was so long in coming was that the Minister decided to incorporate, in what I took to be a Bill prohibiting the creation of future ground rents a large number of other reforms in the law of landlord and tenant.  The law of landlord and tenant like any other part of the law is difficult and complex and it has to compete for the time of an often inadequate number of officials in the Attorney General's office and so on.  Once I heard that, I knew we could kiss goodbye to the Bill until a very late stage in the life of the Dáil.  I was right.  Eventually the Bill came out, but the reason for the delay was the decision of the Minister to incorporate a large number of other matters relating to the law of landlord and tenant but not specifically relevant to ground rents.  That may have been a political mistake but it was nothing more than that.  It was an honest, in no way dishonourable or neglectful, operation of the Ministerial machine. The Minister may find himself involved in a similar situation in the future.  It would have been a simple matter to bring in the thing in piecemeal and call it a trilogy as though it were three cantos of a poem, or three cantatas of an oratorio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been possible to do it that way, to bring in first the one that was easy, politically and legally &mdash;the prohibition of the creation of <Col N="1376" /> future ground rents&mdash;and to bring in the rest as and when opportunity offers, these others being of greater importance for lawyers and people affected by the operation of the law than for the ordinary individual.  That might have been a more clever move, politically.</P>
    <P>In speaking of a trilogy the Minister is merely telling the House that he has chopped up the previous Minister's Bill into three pieces of legislation, one of which is on its way through the other House and which was presented almost unchanged.  The second Bill presented to the House is almost unchanged also except that it was misdescribed to the people before the election.  We have not seen the third one yet.  That is the situation in regard to recent reform in landlord and tenant law.</P>
    <P>I concede freely that the Bill contains one improvement, albeit not a very substantial improvement, but it is an improvement that can be described briefly, that is, the taking away of the right of re-entry on the part of the landlord for non-payment of ground rent.  That right was rarely, if ever, availed of.  Perhaps it was availed of only about as often as was the right of a mortgagee to go into possession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good that it is being abolished.  One can readily appreciate that because of failure to carry out a marginal obligation one should not be put at risk in respect of one's strongly socially-conditioned interest in one's home.  To that extent the Bill is an improvement on the measure we proposed, but it is an improvement which is more ostensible than real.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few words I wish to say regarding a point made by Deputy Bruton a few moments ago, and I want to join this with something said by Deputy Ahern earlier.  I refer to the way in which this work is to be done. Our Bill proposed that the operation be undertaken by country registrars, of whom there are about 27 altogether, but so far as I can see the work is to be concentrated in the Land Registry. <Col N="1377" /> I am told by solicitors that this office has an enormous backlog of work, that even a Land Registry matter marked &ldquo;expedite&rdquo; takes on average about 12 months to go through.  The Minister envisages the creation of a new section that would be attached to the Land Registry with corresponding extra staff and so on.  No one would imagine that a county registrar could bear the burden of this work without extra assistance. Many of these people are already working under much pressure.</P>
    <P>So far as the employment potential of this move is concerned, why are these extra jobs not being spread throughout the country, as was envisaged by us?  The Minister speaks of the State's contribution to the alleviation of the ground rents situation.  We, too, were making a contribution in that regard but by a different mechanism. The Minister is creating the extra jobs in Dublin, an area that is already over swollen in regard to the administrative authorities.  If we are serious about decentralising the public service this is not the way to go about it.  Admittedly what is involved here is only a small detail and does not compare with the resiting of a Department, but what the Minister is doing is a reverse of the process of decentralisation.  I expect that most of the extra staff required will need to have legal qualifications of some kind.  Therefore, would it not have made more sense, socially, administratively and so on, to distribute these posts throughout the country rather than to have another enormous office in Dublin with the resulting parking problem?  From every visible consideration, from the point of view of the road system and having regard to the general rundown condition of this city, it compares not only unfavourably but shamefully with every other city in Western Europe. The Minister's plan will mean just another glass and concrete box erected perhaps by a developer and rented to the Government at a very high rate.</P>
    <P>I concede, as Deputy Briscoe wishes me to concede, that the abolition of the right of re-entry is an improvement, although not an improvement of any quantitive material significance.  I must denounce the Minister's plan to <Col N="1378" /> give the work to the Land Registry as being much less efficient and socially more undesirable than its distribution to all the county registrars.  However, these are only points of detail.  We could argue also as to whether this proposal will be feasible.  Perhaps in some ways it will be feasible.</P>
    <P>I wonder, though, whether if we are extending the social welfare content of our system into the legal field the most deserving are those who pay ground rents.  The new system will cost the State a lot of money in administration costs.  That would have been the case in regard to our Bill, too.  Taking into consideration all the extra solicitors who will have to be paid, plus such overheads as rent on buildings and so on, there will be a lot of expenditure involved, perhaps £1 million.  That is an off-the-cuff figure as I have not made any calculation.  It is money that will be going into a legal social service, because that is what is involved here. I can think of more deserving recipients than those who pay ground rent.  For example, we could put the money into the area of family litigation thereby helping those who at times of serious family breakdowns and so on have the added worry of the financial consideration.  Would not the establishment of at least a bridgehead of legal aid into the civil field be a better way to spend this money? Effectively the money is to be spent on what is a social contribution by the State to the burdens which up to now people have had to bear themselves. Looked at in that light, there may be more deserving groups of persons&mdash;I have given the Minister an example&mdash;than the group he has elected, and for purely political electoral reasons, to benefit in this way.</P>
    <P>I do not want to lambaste the Minister any more about this.  My views and the views of everyone on this side of the House about the honesty, the propriety, of describing this Bill as doing what the electoral manifesto promised to do are clear and they will not gain by repetition.  I do warn him that when he has his back to the wall, as every Government's back is to the wall sooner or later, this weapon which he thinks will be swept out of <Col N="1379" /> the way once the Dáil closes down this evening, will be disinterred and used with devastating effect on him and his colleagues.</P>

      <P>The Deputy certainly gave the impression that he opposed the significance behind the Bill.  Our manifesto was clear in so far as it stated: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents&rdquo;.  We have had a lot of words from Deputy Kelly, who speaks absolutely superbly as a constitutional lawyer.  Nonetheless, words sometimes get people into trouble and confuse those whom we represent here.  Constituents are confused by the kind of speech we have just had from the previous speaker.  It is natural that the Opposition would try to make the best case they can against the Government.</P>
      <P>This Bill will inevitably lead to the abolition of ground rents.  The Bill provides for the availability of the necessary legal forms at a cost of £5 and if there is arbitration the cost will be £12.  I do not think there is anyone who will agree that the Bill is other than a means for abolishing ground rents eventually.  Of course, compensation has to be paid.  Apart from anything else, the Constitution gives protection to people who invest in any form of wealth.  Ownership is protected under the Constitution.  There is not anybody who will argue that persons who have invested in ground rents over the years are not entitled to compensation.  It must be stressed that, as specified in our manifesto, the Bill will obviously lead to the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan, speaking on the Bill some time ago, indicated that he welcomed the Bill.  That is good news. Deputy Kelly has just told me that he <Col N="1380" /> is also not opposing the Bill.  He just says that the words in our manifesto were not accurate or were misleading. I do not accept that.  Anybody who read the manifesto or the statement therein about providing a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents will accept the Bill and its provisions in good faith.  Deputy Horgan knows, as do most other Opposition speakers, that abolition of ground rents is not possible under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Ground rents over the years have provided a source of income for individuals who later came to depend on them.  I know of one elderly woman who has 20 ground rents from which she would normally gain £200 per annum, but since there was agitation some years ago she has not collected her £200 because the cost of collection would be too high.  This woman needs the £200 as much as anybody else, and if somebody is going to purchase the ground rent this Bill provides adequate compensation for her and relieves her of an enormous problem.  I spoke to her recently and she welcomed the Bill as outlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that almost 60 extra staff will be provided in the Land Registray office to deal with the arrears in ordinary work, that additional staff will be provided to deal with ground rents.</P>
    <P>The previous Government argued that it is constitutionally impossible to abolish ground rents.  There is no argument there.  As I said earlier, Fianna Fáil accept that.  Our statement indicated quite clearly that we were not going to confiscate anything and were not in favour of confiscation.  It is obviously annoying to the Opposition that they had not the foresight to use the terms that we used in our pre-election undertaking.  That is only one undertaking of the grand plan for the future social and economic recovery of the country.  People recognise this is very important social legislation. I have had no complaints in my constituency and have heard no complaints from anyone apart from one person who 'phoned me recently complaining that we had not kept faith with our promise.  When I pointed out to him the undertaking contained in <Col N="1381" /> the manisfesto he accepted that and most of the members of the residents' association in my area are quite happy that the Fianna Fáil Government have lived up to yet another of their promises. This is what is frustrating the Opposition.  Every time Fianna Fáil introduce a Bill in the House the Opposition wave the manifesto at us and argue about the wording of this section or that section and feel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not mind interruptions now and again.  I do not think there is any suggestion that we are not going to carry out the undertakings in our manifesto.  No matter how much the Opposition may wave the manifesto at us, we will deliver as we have delivered and are delivering here once again on the Ground Rents Bill.</P>
      <P>Some people have suggested that ground rents are immoral.  In their time ground rents were useful investments and private individuals and insurance companies invested in them, as they were entitled to do.  Times have changed and society has different expectations. Now people expect, if they buy a house, that they are buying the bricks and mortar and the patch of ground on which the house is built, that that ground will be included with the house and that there will be no ground rent.  All sides of the House recognise the right to ownership of the entire property.  The amount of ground involved is very small.  Society has changed its mind about the kind of deal to make with house builders.  No reasonable person could argue against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a newcomer to the House, I find if difficult to understand what the speakers on the other side are arguing about.  They talk about legal aid The previous speaker spoke about the cost in the Land Registry office.  What is wrong with that?  It is money spent well and it is used to employ people. I do not see any reason to decentralise <Col N="1382" /> the procedure dealing with the purchase of ground rents by using the county registrars' offices throughout the country.  People know that applications must come to one office and we all know the difficulties that occur when bureaucracy gets out of hand.  The terms in this section are reasonable.  It is right that people should be employed in one place, whether it be Dublin or Donegal.  I feel that Donegal has been greatly neglected.  However, I am quite happy to see the extra staff being employed in Dublin because the necessary infrastructure is there.</P>
    <P>It has not been emphasised strongly enough that this Bill will last only for five years.  After that the Bill will lapse and people may be charged sums three or four times in excess of what they will have to pay now.  It must be stressed that now is the time to enter into the necessary proceedings and to purchase the fee simple for £5 or, in the case of arbitration, pay the extra £12.  It is good bargain.  Some people have suggested that we should seek a constitutional amendment.  I think this was suggested by Deputy Mitchell.  No constitutional amendment would give authority for the total abolition of ground rents without some kind of compensation.  It would be unfair to people like the lady I have mentioned with 20 ground rents who could not collect them because it was too costly and she was too old.  I can assure the House that she will be very happy with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Social mores have changed and expectations have grown and the Minister for Justice is to be congratulated on the speed with which he has brought in this Bill.  Deputy Kelly was complaining about his colleague, the Minister's predecessor, and told us how he niggled him to introduce his own Bill dealing with ground rents. There will never be any delay by a Fianna Fáil Government introducing measures that have been promised which are socially desirable and which are important in giving the people security.  This is a small matter involving, in some cases, sums of less than £100 but people will have the security of owning thier own homes <Col N="1383" /> They can buy out the ground rent for a mere pittance.  I have listened to and read the reports of the debate on this matter and, as a new Deputy, I cannot understand what the argument is about and who is trying to impress whom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <P>People with their own homes in Dublin are, apparently, vastly satisfied with this Bill.  The Opposition are saying, as far as I can comprehend, that we promised to abolish ground rents.  We did not so promise; we promised to abolish car tax and we did so.  We promised to abolish residential rates and we did so. We said we would introduce legislation which would lead to the abolition of ground rents and that is what we have done.  We have done so very rapidly and the Minister is to be congratulated on this.  All the other measures promised will be introduced as quickly as possible.  We have a programme for the social and economic recovery of this nation and we have produced it.</P>
      <P>Certain speakers seem to want to confuse the people at large.  This is unfair. That kind of politics leads to cynicism in the public mind.  The cynics have had thier day and I do not believe that anybody here wants to encourage them.  I feel that the approach of the Opposition to this Bill has been less than honest.  They have caused confusion in my mind and that reflects accurately the kind of confusion they are trying to cause among the electorate.  They have been successful to some degree.  They had the floor for almost all of last week.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I will not speak much longer but I want to conclude by referring to Deputy Kelly, who spoke about the humbug and saintly platitudes of one of our Ministers. If ever I heard humbug and platitudes of a saintly nature I heard them this afternoon from Deputy Kelly.  No more polished humbug has been heard in this house during the past six months.  The curious kind of argument the Opposition have been making has been typified by the rather unfair and mean attack by Deputy Kelly.  I regret that because I admire him as a parliamentarian, as a lawyer, as a citizen and as a man who sincerely believes that his approach is right.  It is unfair to ask for the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to be here to answer some curious questions.  I believe everybody is satisfied that the Minister for Justice is quite capable of answering any question of Deputy Kelly's.  But I suppose Deputy Kelly considers himself a leader in exile and perhaps defending his own leader, who now happens to hold that position, is part of his power play&mdash;I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I welcome the Bill.  Everybody I have spoken to is quite satisfied with it.  I hope that any other Opposition speakers will make their opposition to the Bill clear because I do not think I can repeat often enough that our undertaking was that Fianna Fáil would provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  That is what this Bill does.  That is what the people of the country wanted; that is what <Col N="1385" /> they are getting and they are quite satisfied with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1967 Act gave the tenant or householder the right to purchase a freehold.  The National Coalition introduced a Bill providing a simple method of doing so by allowing the tenant to apply to the county registrar, lodge the purchase money with him and be issued with a vesting certificate which would be absolute proof of freehold title.  Fianna Fáil's promise was made after the Bill had gone through the Second Stage.  The present Minister then stated that he was disappointed that the principle of the abolition of existing ground rents was not in the Bill and promised to introduce a scheme leading to abolition. What did he mean?  He has done nothing.  In fact he has made it more difficult.  We are now asking the householder to go to the Land Registry instead of to the county registrar which makes the matter more complicated in rural constituencies.  The price paid to the landlord is not reduced; in fact, it is increased.  A higher price will now have to be paid because the multiplier is related to the most recent national loan and the latest one was issued at 11½ per cent as opposed to the previous one at 13 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is also the fee to the Land Registry.  I think there is no public representative who has not experienced the delay that occurs in that office.  It appears to be understaffed and overworked and I think it would be much better if the Minister had appointed extra staff for each country registrar's office to enable the matter to be dealt with more quickly.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil promised to abolish ground rents.  They have done absolutely nothing.  This is why we are discussing the Bill.</P>

      <P>As I see it, this imaginative legislation is to be welcomed by all.  It is long overdue and non-contentious in essence.  It is a serious and positive step towards alleviating a most unnecessary anomaly in property ownership.  I have been disappointed at the many attempts by unsavoury contributions to detract <Col N="1386" /> from the Minister's intention in this Bill.  I see some analogy between the inequity that did exist in the rating system and the system of ground rents. The public realise this and they will welcome this legislation.  Surely this is what matters to everybody here.</P>
      <P>One of the most disappointing features of Opposition speeches is the assertion that is bandied about that Fianna Fáil have not fulfilled their election pledge.  It is important to set the record straight about this immediately. I shall quote a statement issued by ACRA, the watchdog of residents' associations and right in the front line of this perplexing problem.  They stated last June that the following letter was received by ACRA from Deputy G. Collins, spokesman for Justice, on behalf of Fianna Fáil:</P>
      <P>With reference to recent discussions with ACRA sub-committee on ground rents, I wish to state that having been returned to office, Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  I am prepared to commit my party to introduce the necessary legislation within six months of formation of Government.</P>
      <P>It is spelled out there in black and white and the statement cannot be tampered with.  It is there for everybody to see.</P>
      <P>I may be accused of taking a partisan view if I refer to an interview reported in <i>The Sunday Press</i> on 15 January last in which Seán Cryan quizzed the Minister on this very point. His opening question was: &ldquo;Did you not promise to bring in a Bill to abolish ground rents?&rdquo;  The categoric answer was: &ldquo;No, not a Bill to abolish ground rents directly but a scheme that would lead to the abolition of ground rents and this we have done&rdquo;. This is clear, emphatic, straight talk.</P>

      <P>During the interruptions somebody mentioned &ldquo;before the election&rdquo;.  That is very reason why I quoted from the ACRA page.  This was before the election.  There is an inherent danger now, it is apparent from some contributions to this debate, that the public would be confused by a very straightforward proposal to abolish ground rents, and I suggest to ACRA that they get in touch with all their residents' associations&mdash;there are a hundred or so of them in Dublin and perhaps many more not directly affliated to ACRA&mdash;to inform their members of this scheme.  I suggest to the Minister that he formulate some scheme whereby all tenants are informed of his intention when this Bill becomes law.  This is most important. No matter how well-intended legislation may be there is always a danger that the public will not avail of it. I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to bring about some scheme to circularise all tenants so that they are made aware of this legislation. There are number of reasons for this, but the most important one is that the legislation covers a period of five years and it would be a pity if the scheme ran out of date just because people were not aware of what was there for them to avail of.  Of course extra staff will be employed in the Land Registry office to cope with the initial inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the inequity of ground rents.  One incident which comes to my mind and is on record is that when the Earl of Pembroke was striding out his estate in Dublin he was brought to Merrion Hill and given the opportunity of casting his gaze across Dublin.  His footman went out and marked the land as far as he could see, and this was deemed <Col N="1388" /> to be his estate.  Fortunately for those living on the north side of the city at Clontarf and Howth there must have been a mist in Dublin at the time because the peninsula of Howth is not included in the Pembroke estate. That is not a system of ground rents that stands up to fair measure.</P>
    <P>What causes me some slight concern &mdash;I am sure the Minister is aware of this&mdash;is the possibility that at the arbitration stage there might well be some delays.  It will be very necessary to maximise the effort at a highly efficient moving operation to cope with the number of inquiries that will flood in as a result of this welcome legislation. Deputy O'Keeffe said that it would be possible to do for £2 what we are doing for £5.  He was doing a grave injustice to ACRA and this could cause immense confusion because it is on record that Deputy Cooney, the then Minister for Justice, said when replying on Second Stage of this lapsed Bill that £25 would be the minimum figure to cover the necessary costs at that time.  It is necessary to make quite clear that no party political gain whatever arises from legislation of this kind because it is legislation running right across the board for every resident who is lumbered with the insecurity of ground rent.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his staff are to be congratulated on the succinct and simple formula put forward in this legislation.  It is easily understood, it is uncomplicated and it is non-contentious. My fear, if I have one, is that the general public will not be informed in sufficient numbers to avail of the provisions of such excellent legislation.  It is up to every Member of this House to unite behind the Minister and to give every possible support to him in making known to the public that this legislation is in their interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Opposition criticised us for not putting in speakers.  One speaker following the Minister was Deputy Woods and he made a valuable contribution.  One reason why we did not put in speakers was that we were quite satisfied with this excellent legislation.  We want it to go through as quickly as possible <Col N="1389" /> so that the people can benefit from it. We have been misunderstood in this respect.  We have 83 members able to speak on this side of the House.  The Ceann Comhairle may not speak.  If we were to put in all the speakers we could and might possibly put in on this measure we could be accused by the Opposition&mdash;as we were before&mdash; of being arrogant or pushing our weight of numbers around.  However, they want to hear from us so we are going to oblige them.  There will be plenty of speakers from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The opposition decided to engage in a filibuster for reasons of their own. All right.  No doubt they will accuse us of filibustering, but I do not think that charge can stand up, particularly in view of the speeches we have heard from the other side.  Therefore it is incumbent on us on this side of the House to make our contributions to this most valuable legislation.  It is not difficult legislation to talk to.  Many years ago in a debate on the Constitution the then Taoiseach, Deputy Eamon de Valera, said that he could not make up his mind whether those on the Opposition side of the House were lawyers masquerading as politicians or politicians masquerading as lawyers.  Listening to the arguments put forward by some of these lawyers, particularly their spokesman, Deputy O'Keeffe, from whom I would have expected better, I was amazed.  The arguments put forward so far have reminded me of a former Member of this House who wrote a very famous book&mdash;I was going to say novel; in a sense it was&mdash;in which he gave two reasons why he resigned from an auspicious body, the second reason contradicting the first and neither of them being the real reason, because the real reason was that he was sacked. I will not identify him other than to say that I understand he works for <i>The Observer</i> now.</P>

        <i>The Observer</i> is the paper he works for, so Members may draw their own conclusions.  I want to <Col N="1390" /> draw attention to the speech of Deputy Barry Desmond last week.  I am quoting from column 885, Volume 303, of the Official Report, of Wednesday, 8 February 1978 volume 303, column 885:</P>
      <P>The legislation could have been enacted had we given it the priority it deserved.  Unfortunately, the Cabinet for reasons best known to itself did not give it absolute priority as a result of which the Bill fell on the dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>That Bill was introduced last February</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has corrected me, January.  The election did not take place until June.  The dissolution of the Dáil was in mid-May. There was adequate time if the then Government had been serious.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was Opposition spokesman on Justice he and I met a deputation from ACRA.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but my recollection is that at no time did that body expect people to have their property confiscated.  They understood, in a most reasonable manner, that compensation of some sort would have to be paid.  The question was how.  We thought long and hard on possible ways of achieving a solution.  Deputy Kelly quite rightly said we cannot abolish ground rents constitutionally. To introduce such an amendment to the Constitution in a referendum would be throwing the baby out with the bath water because the rights to private property are enshrined in our Constitution.  By agreeing to such an amendment to the Constitution, in future years people might fall victim to a Government who might decide to use it to confiscate other property.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly said it was unlikely that ground landlords would use their powers to enter.  He said they have done so in very few cases but he was glad to see that right going in the Bill. Similarly the Government would be unlikely to use the power to which I referred in the future to abuse the rights of the people, but it would be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> In June 1977 a sub-committee of ACRA circulated a document entitled &ldquo;Ground Rent and You&rdquo; stating their various aims.  Their stated aim was to prohibit by law the creation of new ground rents.  We have fulfilled that pledge.  They also referred to the abolition of existing ground rents.  In this Bill we are providing the machinery to abolish existing ground rents.  They referred to compensating aggrieved parties.  This is very important and it underlines what I said previously. There are some poor ground landlords as well as very wealthy ground landlords but at no time did ACRA wish to see ground landlords penalised.</P>
    <P>They published the response from the Coalition Parties.  They published our policy and quoted a letter received from Deputy G. Collins on behalf of Fianna Fáil in which he said that with reference to recent discussions with the ACRA sub-committee on ground rents he wished to state that, on being returned to office, Fianna Fáil would provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  He said he was prepared to commit his party to introducing the necessary legislation within six months of the formation of the Government. As the Minister said in his Second Stage speech, if he can be faulted on anything it is that it is a month later than promised.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have to take his medicine.  This will be one of the finer Bills on which we can look back with pride.  Having studied the contributions by the Coalition Parties last Wednesday, it appears to me that they did not study the Bill or read the Minister's speech.  One Deputy contradicted another.  One Deputy contradicted himself in the same speech. Now we will straighten out a few matters.  i apologise to the Minister for saying he did not introduce the Bill within six months.  In fact he did.  We have lived up to our promise on this.</P>
      <P>The community candidates and Sinn Féin, the worker's party, put forward their policies.  People were urged to read a particular leaflet and judge the facts for themselves before casting their votes and to make sure their votes were votes to end the ground rent system.  Many people read that leaflet and voted accordingly and that is one of the reasons why we are here today and the Opposition are over there. That is democracy.  People know that when Fianna Fáil give a pledge they live up to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the ACRA document.  One of the points they made was about the failure of landlords to demand ground rents from lessees over a period of years and the compensation due to lessees.  They said the right of eviction must be taken from the landlord. That has been done.  In regard to the manner in which he can gain entry they said he would have to go to the courts in the same way as any other debtor would, and the landlord would have process of recovery in debt only for arrears in ground rent due, if any, up to the termination or cessation date.  They said local authority tenants must also be included in the legislation.  We have done that. They quoted certain articles of the Constitution to make their case for introducing the kind of legislation <Col N="1393" /> which would abolish ground rents outright. There is no way.</P>
    <P>The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but one of the figures he quoted in his Second Reading speech as to the estimated cost to the State of compensation was £30 million minimum. Some people gave a possible estimate of £100 million.  We learned recently from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development that £30 million could create 4,000 jobs.  No sane political party could ask any Government to use £30 million&mdash;I am speaking about minimum figures and I think we would all agree that £30 million is a very low minimum&mdash;in place of 4,000 extra jobs.</P>
    <P>I should like to say what this means to many people who have to pay ground rents of, say, between £12 and £20 annually.  Most of the houses built in the last ten years would carry ground rents of approximately £18 to £20 a year.  One must remember the irritation these bills cause, particularly to elderly people&mdash;it is not that they have not the money to pay&mdash;who resent the bills coming in perhaps twice a year, £9 every six months.  I am quite sure such people will be pleased to avail of this opportunity of the £5 bargain of the century in order to purchase their ground rents.  It is extremely important that such people know their rights because many of them are the last to hear of new legislation.  I hope that ACRA, as the central body of residents' associations, will ensure that every residents' association affiliated to them, in turn, informs everyone within their area, so that everybody will know they can now buy out their ground rent for £5.  The Minister has stated that where there is any question of title or where further searches have to be made then there may be a fee of £12 involved whereas previously hundreds of pounds may have been charged.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled at the fact that the Land Registry office in Dublin is being used instead of the county registrars.  In this respect the Minister has considered very carefully the economics of it.  He has arranged that a separate section will be set up <Col N="1394" /> to deal exclusively with ground rents. Extra staff are being taken on&mdash;qualified and experienced people&mdash;which will ensure that most of the applications coming in will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled also at the Minister because this Bill legislates for a period of five years&mdash;people have five years within which to buy out their ground rents.  Many people may have been given the impression by members of the Opposition that if they have not lodged their applications within five years they may not come within the scope of the provisions of this Bill. That would be misleading and untrue. Anybody who has lodged within five years their claim to acquire the fee simple will come under the provisions of this Bill, and there is no question about that.  I am quite certain that within six months or a year from now there will be questions tabled to the Minister asking him how many applications there have been from people to buy out their ground rents.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his introductory remarks on Second Stage, at column 788 of the Official Report of 8 February 1978 said:</P>
    <P>I have always been clear that the real problem of ground rents is the problem of legal costs.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that that has been the big problem.</P>
    <P>In an interview with the Minister in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 15 January 1978 he was asked:</P>
    <P>If ground rents are banned for the future, is not that an admission that they were always immoral?</P>
    <P>The Minister went into quite a lengthy explanation but the most important part of it was when he said:</P>
    <P>But when the Government of the day in 1967&mdash;and it was a Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;brought in a Bill giving tenants a legal right to buy out their ground rents, they did not ban the creation of further ground rents because they were afraid, and with very good reason, that to do so at that time would have pushed up the prices of new houses for young couples to a serious degree, causing <Col N="1395" /> great hardship.  Taking account of the interest rates prevailing at the time, which would nowadays be considered very low, the capitalised value of a ground rent then could have been of the order of £200 to £300 at a time when the house itself might have cost about £2,000 to £3,000.</P>
    <P>The prohibition of grounds at that time could have pushed up the price of houses by as much as 10 per cent, maybe more, but nowadays the price of houses has escalated up to ten times over, and today, taking account of current interest rates, the abolition of a ground rent wouldn't be likely to push up the price of a new house by more than 1 per cent and it could well be less than that.</P>
    <P>One per cent of the cost of a house as against 10 per cent in 1967.  That was one of the arguments advanced&mdash; I remember it well because I was in this House two years at the time&mdash; when this Bill was introduced.  It was one of the arguments we heard then against abolition, because our primary objective was to keep down the price of houses.  Had ground rents been abolished then, as the Minister stated quite clearly, it would have meant a large percentage factor increase in the price of a house.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to certain passages of Deputy O'Keeffe's contribution which I have marked.  At column 797 of the Offical Report for Wednesday, 8 February 1978, he said in relation to our pledge to introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents:</P>
    <P>On that basis initially I have to say to the House that the presentation of this Bill has the odour of deceit and dishonesty about it.  It smells of subterfuge and cynicism. It smells of misrepresentation and fraud.</P>
    <P>That is the most dishonest interpretation that could have been put on it. As I have said, I do not know whether we have lawyers masquerading as politicians or politicans masquerading as lawyers, but that can be construed only as a deliberate misrepresentation of <Col N="1396" /> the statement on our scheme to abolish ground rents.</P>

      <P>I have quoted what Deputy O'Keeffe said about our pledge and I will direct his accusation against us back on him&mdash;I am using his own choice of language against him.  I would be surprised if I were not in order in doing that.  Deputy Kelly agreed that the Minister for Justice is doing more than the Coalition Bill would have done, and Deputy Desmond welcomed the Bill saying that it does more than the Coalition Bill.</P>
      <P>When the Coalition introduced their Bill the then Minister for Justice, now Senator Cooney, promised to deal with the question of legal costs after the Bill had been passed, that it was something they would have to look at. Therefore, there was no way of knowing what the legal costs would be. We have spelled them out at £5.  I would have expected Deputy O'Keeffe, as Fine Gael spokesman on Justice, to have researched the legislation introduced by his party but which they did not have the political will to see through.  At column 798 Deputy O'Keeffe is reported:</P>
      <P>The National Coalition never pretended or attempted to mislead the public into believing that they were abolishing ground rents or introducing a scheme which would lead to their abolition; they merely said they were simplifying the procedure and, in fact, that is what the Minister is doing and no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made it quite clear he was aware of Land Registry delays. He said these delays would be taken care of, that more staff would be recruited, that a special section would be set up.  Deputy O'Keeffe made no reference to that.  Consequently, I assume that he was so busy following <Col N="1397" /> his own script that he did not listen to the Minister, although he spoke immediately after the Minister.  At column 799 Deputy O'Keeffe is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>I must also point out from my own practical experience as a lawyer that the Land Registry at present is totally overworked and as a result of this and also, I think, probably as a result of inadequate accommodation, there are very long delays in the lodging of existing applications in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>I question that, and I am sure the Minister will have an adequate reply. What Deputy O'Keeffe said is that a person can buy a ground rent for something of the order of £2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Coalition Bill about legal fees. Later on in his speech, reported at column 802, Deputy O'Keeffe quoted a statement by Deputy Collins when in Opposition:</P>
      <P>We are absolutely in favour of the legal abolition of ground rents, but we are acutely aware that this could cause constitutional problems and that by doing away with one injustice you might be creating another.</P>
      <P>That only helps the Minister's case. At no time did the Minister for Justice say we would introduce legislation to abolish ground rents outright.  He said there would be constitutional difficulties and today Deputy Kelly said that constitutionally we cannot abolish ground rents.  In our discussions with ACRA, to the best of my knowledge we never said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, if we are returned to office we will abolish ground rents.&rdquo;  If we had said that we would have been fooling them and discrediting ourselves.  We do not stoop to this kind of tactics.  We have always spelt out things as they are. Those people on that deputation know what was stated.  At column 802 of the Official Report, Deputy O'Keeffe quoted Deputy Ray Burke, developing the argument further, as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> I appeal to the Government to ensure that something will be included in the new legislation to reduce drastically the legal fees involved in the purchase of ground rents.  Even if that were done you still do not grasp the nettle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Deputy Ray Burke was appealing to the then Government to drastically reduce the legal fees involved.  The then Government were not prepared to do this.  That was evidenced by the legislation they produced.  I cannot understand the quotations which Deputy O'Keeffe chose to illustrate his case against this Government.  We would love to be able to make a present of ground rents to people if that could be done without penalising other people.  As I stated earlier, not all landlords are wealthy.  Many of them depend on their ground rents as their only source of income.  These people form quite a sizeable proportion of the people who will be affected by this legislation and they have rights which we are protecting.  Nobody could reasonably argue that these people do not have rights to be protected.  At column 803 of the Official Report Deputy O'Keeffe said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;the abolition of existing ground rents.  That will remain until some Government decide to abolish them by some method and until then you will have legitimate agitation and bad feeling about the payment of this barren tax.</P>
      <P>Does the Deputy agree that this is a method?</P>

      <P>That is the end of it. The next line is:</P>
      <P>At that stage the Minister's colleague had in mind that some scheme other than simplifying the procedure and reducing the cost would be necessary to lead to the abolition of ground rents.</P>
      <P>That is the Deputy reading into Deputy Burke's mind what Deputy Burke was thinking.  Deputy Burke did not say that.  I am now quoting Deputy O'Keeffe who stated at that stage that the Minister's colleague had in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have looked at that. I am quite happy to make my own speech.  I am satisfied from reading anything Deputy Burke stated there that at no time was there any commitment or any suggestion that we should abolish ground rents outright.  There was an aspiration to do that if it could be done without hurting a large number of people.  If we introduced a Bill in this House to do that the Deputy would be one of the first people to attack us vigorously for doing such an unconstitutional act.  I cannot believe that the Deputy would be in favour of introducing a constitutional amendment which would deprive people of rights to private property.  I do not believe that the Deputy wants that and I am certain that no member of his party wants that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Deputy Burke's opinion with which I would not agree and with which the Minister obviously does not agree.  People do not want bonds, they want money in their hands.  I am sure the Deputy has dealt with many cases in the Land Commission and he is well aware that people would rather have the money than the bonds.  I agree with the Minister <Col N="1400" /> in his wisdom and I am satisfied that his judgment is correct.  The Minister when concluding his speech did not forget to compliment the members of the Landlord and Tenant Commission who played such an important part.</P>
      <P>It has already been stated that many of the parts of this legislation were contained in the original Bill introduced by the Coalition.  We have improved their Bill considerably.  This has been admitted by certain Deputies, particularly Deputy Barry Desmond who lives in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency where this is a real problem.  I am certain that the people in that constituency will admire his honesty in welcoming the Bill. Deputy Desmond considers that the Bill does not go far enough, but no Bill will ever be introduced that will go far enough to satisfy all Deputies. We will do what we can in the best way we can.  If ACRA are correct in assessing the will of the people to be enabled to buy out their ground rents, then within one year or so this Bill will be proved to have been a success.</P>
      <P>Later on, at column 805 of the Official Report, Deputy O'Keeffe went on to say:</P>
      <P>What is the position in 1978 under the Fianna Fáil Bill?  The tenant will be paying 8½ years purchase, £5 fee to the Land Registry and the same legal costs, because the same simple procedure is outlined in this Bill.  I accept that this is a simple procedure. Why should it not be?  It was modelled on the Coalition Bill. We now find, it is easy to argue, that a person buying out under the Fianna Fáil Bill in 1978 would be paying more than he would have paid last year had the National Coalition Bill gone through.</P>
      <P>That is not true because no legal fees were set out in the Coalition Bill.  I am satisfied that people will be able to judge that for themselves.  At column 806 Deputy O'Keeffe stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister, who is attempting to mislead everybody, has had the sense of propriety not to include in the Long Title to the Bill any suggestion that it will lead <Col N="1401" /> to the abolition of ground rents.  I commend him for that.</P>
    <P>Again, that was another contradiction from the Deputy, who went on to say:</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the Act shall not bind a Minister of the Government, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland or the Irish Land Commission.  It is interesting to refer back to what the Minister had to say in this regard on 23 February 1977.</P>
    <P>I shall not detain the House by quoting the entire speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a lawyer but I know that people are sometimes in awe of solicitors or barristers and are reluctant to argue legal points with them.  I have no wish to denigrate the legal profession but from my years of experience as a public representative I am convinced that the ordinary man in the street often knows more about law than some solicitors.  I am not including in that all lawyers, but it can be said of quite a number of them.  Perhaps Deputy O'Keeffe will agree.  It has been said that lawyers sometimes learn more in their first year of practice than they learn in all the years of study leading up to their degrees.  Many of the arguments put forward, for purposes of political expediency, by Deputy O'Keeffe would not be accepted even by somebody studying law.  One could drive a coach-and-four through many of his arguments, but I appreciate that he was speaking from the point of view of political expediency.</P>
      <P>In concluding his remarks Deputy O'Keeffe said, as reported at column 809 of the Official Report, to which I have referred already:</P>
      <P>My criticisms must be with regard to the manner in which the Bill was presented.  It is altogether wrong and misleading to suggest that this Bill has anything to do with the abolition of ground rents, and on that basis I make my main criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> I can only wonder whether the Deputy has been quoted correctly.  In any case, that statement is very naïve and one that I would not have expected from a spokesman on Justice.  Whatever else he may have to say about the Bill he must not say that it has nothing to do with the abolition of ground rents. However, on Committee Stage he will have an opportunity of clarifying what he said.</P>
    <P>I would recommend generally the perusal of an article on this subject which appeared in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 15 January.  Perhaps it is an article that that paper could publish again after the Bill has been put through both Houses.  It contained full and useful information and was couched in language that was easy to understand. It contained no lofty language, as Shakespeare said: &ldquo;Where be not its quiddities and its quips&rdquo;.  The article referred to the legislation as &ldquo;the bargain of the century&rdquo;, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials have worked very hard on this Bill.  They have made many improvements in it. The opposition have expressed concern regarding the number of speakers offering from this side of the House and have interpreted this to mean that we are not in favour of the Bill. Let me reiterate that the party unanimously are happy with the legislation.  While people would like always to see more being done in any sphere, there is no one in this party who is against the Bill.  It is an improvement on the previous Bill. However, if it is the wish of the Opposition, we shall be happy for many of our members to speak on the Bill and when the Opposition decide that they have heard enough we shall call it a day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke believed that ACRA had a campaign.  Much has been said of a scheme that would lead to the abolition of ground rents. It is very difficult to know exactly when Fianna Fáil changed their mind in regard to the abolition of ground rents.  It is clear beyond doubt that originally they favoured the abolition of ground rents, as can be seen from their statements at the time the Coalition Government introduced the Landlord and Tenant Bill.  On 23 February 1977 at column 163, Volume 297, of the Official Report, Deputy Collins as he then was, now the Minister, stated:</P>
      <P>These is disappointment that the acceptance of the principle of the abolition of existing ground rents is not in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> I suggest that the abolition of ground rents was as much in the Coalition's Bill as it is in this Bill.  Deputy Collins, as he then was, was very disappointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy take a point of information form me? Perhaps, in the interests of fair play all round, the Deputy might read the full extract there, because the disappointment the Deputy is talking about is not my disappointment.  This is a point that was cleverly overlooked by other speakers of the Deputy's party during the course of this debate, and falsely implies that I said that I was disappointed.</P>

      <P>A campaign for the abolition of ground rents has been waged for many years, particularly by ACRA, on the principle that when a man buys a house&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> that is what I quoted for Deputy Briscoe before he left the House. Surely the Minister will agree that if ACRA waged that campaign for many years on the principle that when a man buys his house he should own it, that implies that he should not have to pay anything further?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us he was introducing a trilogy of legislation to deal with ground rents and other matters relating to the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  The first was a Bill to prohibit the creation of future ground rents, which is now before the Seanad and which, please God, will soon be law, and the second was the present Bill.  I do not know at what stage the Government decided to change because they themselves believed at one time in the abolition of ground rents.  They probably realised, as Deputy Cooney, now Senator Cooney, had stated on several occasions, that there was a constitutional barrier to abolishing ground rents. They knew, as Deputy Cooney had told them, that ground rents could not <Col N="1408" /> be abolished without reference to amendment of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The supporters of Fianna Fáil gave the impression to ACRA and some people fairly well connected with Fianna Fáil, maybe not directly members of ACRA, but members of prominent associations affiliated to ACRA, that Fianna Fáil were going to abolish ground rents.  I can remember, as can any member of my party here in Dublin, meeting with members of ACRA who were out actively canvassing for Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I quote from the Minister's speech on the 23 February 1977 as it appears at column 162 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>One of the principal provisions of the Bill as it stands at present is an extension of the role of the county registrar in the operation of the Act. We see in it the elimination of certain impediments in former legislation and a widening of the scope of the categories who would benefit. It aims, as the Minister says, at reducing legal costs.  I hope that it will achieve that aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I said that, but the Minister could not specify what the cost would be and in reply to the debate he said it would definitely be not less than £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the cost would not be fixed until the Bill was passed.  The Minister will recall, as Deputy O'Keeffe has stated, that if that Bill were law today the cost of applying to the county registrar to purchase ground rent would be £2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Keeffe should explain the matter to Deputy Belton.  If Deputy Belton thinks that the full cost would be £2, Deputy O'Keeffe has succeeded in misleading him in the same way that he has misled many other members of his party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the present cost. As well as that, the Minister will agree that the National Coalition Bill provided for a multiple of seven-and-a-half as against eight-and-a-half years' purchase under his scheme.  At least he will agree that the cost of purchase would have been lower.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke went on to say that ground rents would remain until some Governments decided to abolish them by some method and he said that until then there would be legitimate agitation and bad feeling about the payment of this barren tax. Finally, he said that some Government must produce a solution to this constitutional difficulty and that the Government have a responsibility to use all the legal expertise available to them in the civil service and in the courts to devise a scheme to get around this difficulty.  Deputy Burke believed that the Government should produce a solution to the constitutional difficulty.

      <P>When I moved the Adjournment last night I was referring to the fact that the Spanish Government are at present endeavouring to negotiate accession terms to join the Community.  I pointed out that the boats of that country have enjoyed, since the London Convention, certain fishing rights off our coasts.  I wondered, in view of the Minister's attitude in relation to the resolution to which he has given his assent, about the attitude of this country towards the Spanish request, bearing in mind that the Commission recently agreed to issue licences in respect of 107 Spanish boats, on condition that at any one time only 68 of them would be fishing in our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is clearly an impractical sort <Col N="1414" /> of regulation because there is no way, with the best will in the world, that one can say there are only 68 out of a total of 107 boats in an area at any one time.  It is on the same faulty premise that the resolution appears to have been based.  If you licence 100 boats and say there must be only 68 in the area at one time, how can you say how many are actually in the area?  There is also a suggestion being made which should be dealt with by the Minister that there is a great number of boats from that country being caught in breach of the licensing agreement off our coast at present.  The suggestion is made that their fines are being paid by other and interested parties who want to establish a definite and major presence on the part of the Spanish fleet so as to assist them in their negotiations and in getting whatever they may eventually hope to get out of the Commission by way of fishing rights.  If that is the case it should be attended to and opposed vigorously by the Government&mdash;although I doubt it will be if the recent activities are anything to go by.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning again that previously when quotas were issued to the Dutch, according to the Department of Fisheries leaflet 84, in 1976 for zone 6A off the Donegal coast the Dutch were given a quota of 7,600 tons of herring.  According to leaflet 88 from the Department&mdash;this was the inquest&mdash;the Dutch actually reported themselves as having caught 21,039 tons.  If they admit they caught three times the quota allocated to them, God knows how much they really did catch.  If proof were needed that quotas will not work it is there in black and white.  We all know that if these countries exhaust their quotas after three or four months their boats will not stop fishing; they will continue fishing as long as they have a market and their market is virtually insatiable for that type of fish.  They will continue to fish our waters so long as our Government is weak enough to allow them to do so.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister saying, as I suggested last night he had been saying, that the 50-mile demand <Col N="1415" /> is still on the table, because it was said by the chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Hamlett, after the discussion and said again today by the chairman of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation that if it were not for the fact that the British bucked and would not agree, and they were the only one of the Nine not to agree, this supposedly interim or experimental agreement&mdash;as the Minister refers to it&mdash;would have been the final fishing plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister was relying on them.  I must have been right yesterday when I said: another day, another dollar.  The Minister has a different answer every day.  This is another new one today: it did not matter that he voted for it because he knew the British would vote against it and save the day. Congratulations&mdash;that is another version. God knows what it will be next. Whatever possibility there is of quotas working it could only be if all the catches caught in Irish waters were landed at Irish ports.  Deputy Deasy recently suggested in a Parliamentary Question that that concept should be investigated, that any boat fishing in our waters should be obliged to land its catch at Irish ports with the two-fold advantage first, of being able to check exactly what they caught and secondly, of providing a great deal of shore-based employment.  The Minister not only rejected that idea but refused to put it forward for discussion in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also apparent from the Minister's refusal to put forward as a basis for negotiation the idea that there should be a levy per ton caught on all outside countries fishing in our waters, that the Minister is quite opposed to this concept of control.  But, apparently, he is prepared to allow an unlimited number of boats from outside countries into our waters in a way that cannot be controlled no matter how much money is spent on fishery patrol vessels or aerial surveillance.  I am prepared to go along with the Community <Col N="1416" /> concept of sharing and to see our EEC partners share our waters, as apparently the Minister wants to do now, when they agree that we should have a share in the coal in the Ruhr Valley, a share in the North Sea Oil and when other member countries decide to give us the benefit of natural resources available to them which exist without any act of theirs.  In the same way, those off-shore waters are there without any act of ours but I do not see why we should be asked to hand them away without advantage to ourselves. I do not see that our Minister has been negotiating in that way on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The document that has been produced is dreadfully woolly.  There is a duty not only on the Commission but especially on the Irish Government and the Minister to clarify exactly what it means because my copy of it seems to be absolutely contradictory and virtually incomprehensible.  It is such a master plan of apparent deception, contradiction and woolliness that I suspect the Minister may have been the author of it on behalf of the entire Community.  It bears the stamp of his method of shifting from one foot to the other with all the capability of a centipede.  If one looks at clause 4, paragraph 1 it suggests there should be an assurance of the enjoyment of natural geographic advantage in catch possibilities within a few hours steaming time from home ports so as to favour balanced development.  In clause 6 it is suggested that the fishing plan should take account of vessels which, due to their limited range, can only operate close to the coast, and should have priority in the coastal area.  That appears to discriminate in favour of in-shore fishermen while the earlier clause appears to discriminate in favour of those within a few hours steaming time from home ports.  But clause 3 says the fishing plan must not discriminate as between fishermen of the member states of the Community or affect their right of access. Which clause takes precedence?  What does a few hours steaming time mean? Does it apply a standard rate of steaming?  Different boats have different steaming times.  Does it mean that a boat leaving a port ten miles <Col N="1417" /> up an estuary should only have the same number of hours steaming time from its own port as a boat whose port is based on a headland?</P>
    <P>This document appears to me to mean virtually nothing because of the way it is phrased.  It is very difficult to comprehend from it what sort of deal has been knocked out of the Irish Government by the Community partners. The Irish Government have a duty to ensure that there is an adequate supply of fish for Irish fishermen to catch at all times.  That has not been happening in the last few years.  That is apparent from the Minister's figures given in reply to a question on 31 January when Deputy Deasy asked the number of fishermen who were in arrears on loans to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Out of a total of 438 loans, 292 are in arrears.  One-third of those, or 96 of them, owe in excess of £1,000 and 29 borrowers have arrears in excess of £10,000.  The simple reason for this is that fish stocks have not been there in the past few years for our fishermen to catch, and they have not been there because our Community partners, more than anybody else, have raided our fishing waters.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Minister to take Ireland out of the conservation net and he should at least insist in Brussels that there should be year-round open fishing of herring for the Irish fleet because it was not the activities of the Irish fleet that denuded us of our herring stock or made them unavailable.  We are not big enough or strong enough to interfere with the stock.  We are not the maurauders, the plunderers or predators. We should be given the opportunity at least to allow these men to make their repayments in the way they set out to make them and in which they are so well able to make them if given half a chance or given any assistance by their own Government. They are not getting that at present and I believe the fault lies in the way the Minister has conducted these negotiations in Brussels.  The agreement was to be a cosmetic job on the original concept of quotas and licences which were strenuously rejected by our Government and opposed by us tooth and <Col N="1418" /> nail right down the line.  A bad cosmetic job it was and the paint is beginning to wear off it already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to recommend to Dáil Éireann that the motion before the Dáil be rejected.  I do so on the basis that what has eventuated so far in various talks on fisheries among the member countries of the Community is that we now must put into operation fishing arrangements within our 200 miles that will prevent a free-for-all situation.  The worst possible situation as far as Irish fishermen and the Irish fishing industry are concerned would arise if, on the failure of the member countries to reach agreement on a common fisheries policy, there was no agreement on even a temporary interim arrangement pending the finalisation of a common fisheries policy. That above all else is what we have been concerned about avoiding.  That is what induced me, along with seven other countries, to decide that it was essential to prevent the chaos that would result from free-for-all, open, uncontrolled fishing in all Community waters.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent that occurring and developing it was essential for small countries such as Ireland concerned about improving the development of the fishing industry to ensure that in this interim period, pending determination of a common fisheries policy, some control regime should be established.  This was the net result of the last meeting of the Council of Minister when eight of the countries agreed that for a trial period during the year 1978 fishing plans should be introduced with a view to reducing the fishing effort in our waters for conservation reasons.  I am talking about our own waters now.  Our main concern is to ensure that during this interim period conservation measures are adopted and that there is a reduction of fishing effort by the other member countries in our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>By &ldquo;our waters&rdquo; I mean waters up to 200 miles.  The main thrust of our effort, when it was <Col N="1419" /> evident that agreement could not be reached on a final fisheries policy package, was to ensure that for this year we had a regime where fishing by other member countries would be reduced in intensity and where Irish fishermen would have the maximum opportunity to fish to the fullest extent in this capacity.</P>
      <P>With that in mind certain quota figures have been prepared as guidelines for these fishing plans.  The old crude mechanism of unmonitored quotas is quite clearly not suited to our requirements.  What fishing plans involve is, in effect, a system of licensing allied to quotas.  I am concentrating on our waters now, but this would apply in all other member states' waters, except for the British.  They will take their own action, but they say they will take their action in consultation with the Community.  Under this system each member state fishing our waters will submit its plans for fishing up to 200 miles from our coast. We will seek to limit that effort to the greatest degree possible in accordance with the quotas that have been suggested by the Commission.  The boats will have to be licensed and will have to be limited in regard to length and engine power.  They will have to specify in what areas they propose to fish, what species of fish they propose to catch and what type of gear and equipment they propose to use.  We will then have in our possession a list of licensed boats which will be entitled to fish to a certain level up to 200 miles from our coast.  We can monitor and control that licensed situation.</P>
      <P>This is a major step forward from the old mechanism of paper quotas. This is an attempt for the first time to have a properly organised fishing system so that we can ascertain properly the fishing effort of member countries within our 200 miles.</P>

      <P>No, because the 200 miles was not accepted.  Under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act passed in this House, from 1 January 1977 the 200-mile zone obtains as Community waters for the whole Community. Within the Community we are concerned about the 200-mile zone from our coast.</P>
      <P>Crucial to this whole proposition of putting fishing plans into operation is the extent of quota allocation.  Here I might mention for the benefit of the House as I have already done on the radio that the quotas which we have obtained are quite substantial and the differential advantage in regard to Irish quotas allocation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other member countries is quite substantial. as I will now detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am using the base of average catch for 1975 which, as the Deputy and the House are aware, is the base year.  Dealing in percentage increase and decrease since then, I find that in regard to total fish quota allocation Belgium is down 11.6 per cent; Denmark is down 16.6 per cent; France is down 6.6 per cent; Germany is down 11.9 per cent; the Netherlands down 30.4 per cent; Britain is down 5 per cent.  We are up by 26.1 per cent.  Taking the reduction in the fishing effort envisaged in Irish waters for member countries and comparing it with the increase granted to Ireland the differential in percentage quota terms between Ireland and other member countries for all fish is of the order of 37 per cent.  In regard to herring, taking the same base year, the differential in regard to the percentage of Irish quota allocation <Col N="1421" /><i>vis-á-vis</i> other member countries is of the order of 57 per cent.  We have been substantially favoured in the allocation of these quotas.  These quotas will be used as the guideline for the exercise of fishing plans during the year 1978 in our waters.  I mention those two figures because they are very pertinent to the preferential advantage we have secured in regard to all fish, both white fish and pelagic fish, and in particular the preferential advantage we have secured in regard to the most important species of all, which of course is herring.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say Deputy Deasy got somewhat confused yesterday in relating the total tonnage catch and in stating that we have not got the two-thirds improvement we should have got since 1976.  He did not take into account, in making that statement, that there are substantial conservation measures in regard to herring which inevitably lead to a reduction in the herring fishing effort.  We have a total ban on herring fishing in the Celtic Sea at present.  We have a similar restriction in the Irish Sea, and we have a partial ban operating on the western and north-western coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The doubling of the catch was to be irrespective of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might mention also that in respect of shellfish, which are a very valuable commodity so far as Irish fishing is concerned, they do not come into this estimation because we have the shell fishery entirely to ourselves. I want to emphasise that in order to clarify the matter.  If we exclude shellfish and herring, we have way above a two-thirds increase in regard to our quota allocation situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question in regard to the conservation of fishing stocks and the reduction of fishing effort on the part of member countries should be put into perspective.  These represent our two objectives, which are quite plain. I am speaking slowly and deliberately in case there is any confusion.  Our first objective is to conserve fish stocks <Col N="1422" /> around our coasts.  In order to do that we must bring in herring bans and we must achieve a limitation or reduction of fishing effort on the part of member countries within 200 miles of our coast.  The conservation principle leads on to a reduction of fishing effort.</P>
    <P>If that fishing effort can be reduced to a sufficient extent to enable the Irish fisherman to develop to his full potential by way of fishing plans, then fishing plans will have achieved the same results as exclusive bands.  If we can achieve the same results through a reduction of fishing effort under the umbrella of fishing plans as we would secure by way of exclusive limits, then that is all right so far as I am concerned. I am willing to give this a trial for this year to see can these fishing plans work, to see will they work. If they do not work within this year, we have still reserved our position in regard to the conservation zone of 50 miles around our coast.  That still stands on the table, is our position and without prejudice to this position, we will co-operate with other member countries in seeing can we get fishing plans working this year.</P>
    <P>Already talks have started on devising specific fishing plans, species by species and area by area around our coast.  I might mention in reply to some of the criticisms advanced on the resolution in Brussels which was agreed upon on 29 January that this resolution is simply a declaration of principle. It is only a single page resolution and is not intended in any way to be the comprehensive detailed documentation of fishing plans.  It is simply an enabling statement of intent to put fishing plans into operation, to enable the member countries to get down to the hard, tough business of negotiating fishing plans with each other and with the Commission.  I want to emphasise that point.  I was rather surprised that Deputy Deasy seriously tried to say this was intended to be a final document.  It is not.  Quite obviously it cannot be.  It is a single page document intended to be a statement of intent by the member countries, except the United Kingdom, to get fishing plans off the ground.  Those are the bones of the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> My officials were out in Brussels last week and will be out next week and every week for the next few weeks to ensure that by 1 April we have fishing plans ready to come into operation. This will mean a number of bilateral discussions with various other members countries and with the Commission. The guidelines for those plans will be the quota situation I have mentioned.  The quota situation is eminently favourable and in Ireland's interests.  Within the limit of these quotas in 1978 we will be able to fish to the fullest extent.  I should like to speak on a motion on this matter at the end of the year or early next year and we will see that these quotas have provided an umbrella under which the Irish fisherman has been enabled to fish to the maximum extent.  The extra fishing effort he is now being enabled to engage in under this quota umbrella will mean that he will be pushing himself and his fleet to the fullest extent possible throughout the year seeking to reach quotas which will stretch Irish fishing to the maximum development and the maximum production.</P>
    <P>There is no question but that the quotas are ample quotas.  The problem is the basic problem of monitoring, controlling, supervising and ensuring that these quotas are observed.  The way forward in that direction is to have a fishing plans system in which there will be proper mutual licensing of boats fishing in each member country's waters so that we will know in the Department of Fisheries, the protection authorities will know, and the Department of Defence will know precisely what specific boats are entitled to fish in specific areas, and no other boats except those.</P>
    <P>In my view that is well worth trying in the coming year as an interim measure on a pilot basis.  It is infinitely preferable to the only alternative.  Because of the British failure to agree to a common fisheries policy, the only alternative was a buccaneering free-for-all situation with every country entitled to fish with every type of boat right up to six miles from our coast, a system of chaos, plunder, buccaneering with no control and no regime obtaining.  We have avoided that and <Col N="1424" /> we have done very well to avoid it.  We have preserved our fundamental position which is that, if this does not work in 1978, we will say to our community partners: &ldquo;Look here, this does not work.  It has not worked.  We are sticking by our 50 miles.&rdquo;  That is the only way in which conservation can work.</P>

A rather substantial gain was made to which very little reference has been made in this House, whether by reason of lack of grace or anything else I do not know.  We managed to get £30 million agreed to by our Community partners for protection services here &mdash;75 per cent of the total cost, an unprecedented Community contribution to any member country in any area of economic or social activity.</P>
      <P>The Department of Defence have submitted plans for the building of protection boats and the purchase of protection aircraft to the extent of five boats over the next four years and five twin-engined aircraft at a total cost of £40 million.  We are getting £30 million towards that cost.  This will keep Irish boatyards going over the next four or five years and will provide an Irish protection service. We have got £30 million agreed to and written into that resolution.</P>

      <P>In regard to other aspects raised in the course of the debate, I should like briefly to refer to the question of fines for illegal fishing.  In view of the recent High Court decision it is quite clear that legislation will have to be introduced to provide for the prosecution of these fishing offences, not on a summary basis in the District Court but by way of indictment in the High Court or Central Criminal Court.  This can be good and means that, through the exercise of a slower legal procedure, we can keep boats and gear out of fishing for a very long period.  I hope to have this legislation before the House in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>In regard to Spanish fishing I agree that it is in our interest to see a further reduction in the fishing effort on the part of the Spanish fishermen. I have taken this matter up with the Commission with a view to effecting a reduction in the number of licences issued to them.  There already has been a substantial reduction in licences issued to them and I hope to see a further substantial reduction in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have outlined the situation in regard to fishing plans and what they mean sufficiently clearly.  I want to put the whole matter into perspective as far as we in this Government are concerned.  We came into power in early July last year.  On 13 July last the European Court suspended the <Col N="1426" /> unilateral measures adopted by the previous Coalition Government.  I was faced with a situation, at my first Council meeting a week after we assumed office and a few days after the European Court suspended the Coalition Government's measures, in which the fleets of the Common Market were poised to come in and plunder our waters.  I had to go out to the first Council meeting and repair the damage done by a Coalition Government interested only before the election in using this matter of fishing limits as a pre-election stunt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention this because that is the situation that has obtained since this Government were elected, that we have had to repair the damage done by the previous Coalition Government, when the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and the then Minister for Fisheries were seemingly incapable of agreeing anything at conferences <Col N="1427" /> in Brussels, week in, week out.  They were each coming home telling different stories here and, out there, saying different things to different Ministers and officials.  The fact of the matter is that a complete joke was made of the Irish case prior to the last election.  The obvious and blatant confrontation situation that obtained out there between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries was and is the talk of the town in Brussels.  That situation has now ended.  We have to fight to secure the best possible case for the Irish fising industry.  I am convinced that at present, in order to avoid a total situation of chaos, the right thing is to give these fishing plans a chance to work while retaining our fundamental position.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise one point.  The British and their attitude was mentioned here.  As far as I am concerned, out there I am fighting Ireland's case. Some aspects of our case happen to coincide with that of the British, in that the British are also seeking a form of exclusive band, as we are.  At the same time, when it came down to putting fishing plans into operation on an experimental basis this did not suit the British because they have their own war in the North Sea with the other EEC countries.  I was not going to rise to that one and fight Britain's war in the North Sea against Denmark and Germany: that is Britain's business. But, as far as the Community is concerned, they are quite willing to give us a decided preferential advantage in the preparation of fishing plans around our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not interested in how they allocate, where they allocate or what sort of coastal band exists in the North Sea area of Britain affecting Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark in their fishing relations with the United Kingdom. That is a separate ball game. Our objective is to secure, to the highest possible degree, the highest maximum reduction of effort within the compass of fishing plans around our coast in which they have already acknowledged our case for a preferential advantage by giving us the preferential quota percentages to which I have alluded. <Col N="1428" /> If at the end of the year we see a situation in which these fishing plans have not worked&mdash;they may not work&mdash;then our case to the Commission and to the Community is: these plans cannot work, they have not worked, they have failed to achieve the required reduction of effort.  Then we say in that case an exclusive zone is the only answer.</P>
    <P>The whole matter is now on test as far as the <i>bona fides</i> of the Community and the Commission are concerned. The ball is squarely in their court.  We have no need whatever to worry because the Irish fishermen will be tested to the utmost to get near the quotas on offer.  What is important to ensure is that we so control the fishing effort that we pin member countries down to their fishing effort in the areas they have been allotted.  If we pin down their fishing effort and sufficiently monitor and control that, thereby having the maximum catch available to our fishermen within that period, that is the way in which they can work and can be seen to work.  It would be the height of irresponsibility for an Irish Government to have walked away from the conference table leaving Irish coasts naked as far as the fishing efforts of Community countries is concerned.</P>
    <P>That will not be the case.  We are now engaged in talks and negotiations that will enable a controlled regime to operate through proper licensing and proper planning of the fishing efforts in our waters right up to 200 miles, and in the process of that to phase out the historic rights that have existed over centuries and were incorporated in the 1964 London Agreement in the six- to 12-mile belt around our coast. The phasing out of that historic right for member countries will be part of our target and objective within the compass of fishing plans&mdash;gradually to phase out altogether fishing within that six- to 12-mile belt.</P>
    <P>That is the practical way forward. It is certainly far more advantageous than the sort of rhetoric in which the Coalition Government engaged and which foundered in the European Court within a few days of our taking office.  We have been slowly picking up the pieces.  We have got the pieces welded together, the shape is being well executed and within that shape <Col N="1429" /> we can move forward to greater prosperity for the Irish fishing industry. Above all else, what the Irish fishing industry needs is a practical plan with practical attention to detail.  We want less rhetoric and fewer headlines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Quota situation eminently suitable and to Ireland's advantage&rdquo;.  That is the theme of the Minister's statement.  I could not understand the Minister's speech here in the past half an hour.  Between 1975 and 1977 we were discussing here an exclusive 50-mile band around the Irish coast.  We were not discussing quotas or any of the ráiméis the Minister seemingly brought back with him from Brussels in the form of this document.  The Minister was not a Member of this House in that period but I am sure he was conversant with the fisheries debates here at the time. We had a number of them and in all of them it was mainly Front Bench Members of Fianna Fáil who participated. They are now members of the Government.  We had the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy who addressed himself to the question on numerous occasions.  We had the Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Gibbons.  We had the Minister for Health.  Deputy Haughey, who went to great pains to lecture the Coalition Government about what should be done.  We had Deputy Molloy contributing to a number of debates.  We had Deputy Gallagher, who, it was thought, would be Minister for Fisheries with a change of Government.  We also had contributions from present Ministers of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were their statements?  Was there any question of quotas or licences?  No.  Their statements, as <Col N="1430" /> recorded in the Official Report, were that Irish fishermen were entitled to an exclusive 50-mile band and that no fishing boats from third countries or from other Community countries should have the right to fish within that band.  Deputy Gibbons said: &ldquo;We want no nonsense about it.  We want our 50-mile limit.&rdquo;  He put it to the fishermen that this was their undeniable right which they should put to the Government.  Fianna Fáil have been in office for eight months and the fishermen will be coming along, and I suggest it is their undeniable right, to put that case to Fianna Fáil.  They were told by Fianna Fáil it was easily attainable.</P>
    <P>In those debates Deputy Colley had this to say: &ldquo;To suggest that we have some security or some guarantee in a promise which we got from Brussels that our catch could be doubled is ridiculous because we cannot double our catch unless we get the 50-mile limit.&rdquo;  Deputy Molloy said: &ldquo;We in Fianna Fáil, if given the opportunity before too much damage is done, will take that stand, will protect our fishing industry and our fishing community and will ensure the acceptance of a 50-mile coastal band.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Leary, now Minister of State, said the same thing.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not know, if he has read those debates, that it all centred around a 50-mile coastal band?  During the statement he made here in the past half hour he scarcely mentioned that plan.  He has come back to tell us what he has secured from Brussels but there is nothing in the document we have been given about a 50-mile band.  Fianna Fáil were very anxious to get back after their 1973 defeat.  Fishing became an emotive topic and Fianna Fáil cashed in on it as much as possible.  I said it then, and I repeat, that Fianna Fáil spokesmen at the time had as much integrity as you would find in a bunch of three-card-trick men.</P>

      <P>Is it not self-evident now that Fianna Fáil conned the fishermen purely for political purposes? They made it quite clear that if they were returned to power they would give the fishermen the 50-mile exclusive limit.  After eight months in power all they have produced is this document which the Minister has brought back from Brussels.  Their tactics in the past three years brought our political standing to a new low level.  They told a group of honest hardworking fishermen that if they voted for Fianna Fáil they would get a 50-mile exclusive band.  There was insincerity so far as that was concerned. There was no justification for the way in which Fianna Fáil conned the fishermen.</P>
      <P>During my four years dealing with fishermen I was truthful and I gave them the facts as they were.  I did not add or take from the facts because I believed the industry was too important and that we should have as open a discussion as possible in this House, if the occasion arose, and with the interested groups such as the fishermen and other people who derived their livelihood from the fishing industry, boatyard workers and those working in processing plants.  We made it quite clear that any Deputy who had any feasible suggestion to offer could come along to our office and make that suggestion. Instead of that we had repeated scenes here.  Week after week we had motions from Fianna Fáil Deputies trying to build this up into an emotive question.  They did so with success.  Unfortunately, they got favourable comments on the availability of the 50-mile coastal zone from some of the Press writers.  I made it clear during all the negotiations and during all my statements here down through the years, not just since 1973, that I felt that an exclusive coastal band was essential, that Ireland's position is akin to the position obtaining in Iceland and that unless we got this exclusive zone our fish would steadily disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> All this arose because in 1971 when we were negotiating our entry to the Common Market we completely overlooked the fisheries question.  That is the root of the problem.  The six member countries at that time had a common fisheries policy and we voted overwhelmingly in May 1972 to accept that policy.  It was against this background that we had to negotiate from 1973 onwards.  The rules applying to each member state in respect of fishing in the maritime waters within the jurisdiction of the Common Market say in plain and simple language that there should be no differences in the treatment of member states and that member states shall ensure equal conditions of access to the fishing grounds situated in the waters referred to.  The Community can say to Deputy Lenihan or to any other Irish negotiator that we accepted those conditions.  We did accept them.  What I tried to do during my time in fisheries and what the Coalition tried to do was to change the rules and get the best bargain possible. Whether we like it or not, at that vital time we completely overlooked fisheries in negotiating our entry into the Common Market.  Fisheries were swept under the carpet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about that.  That is the root of our difficulties today.  I was in Brussels on a number of occasions at the time; we had several Labour Party deputations to meet the different commissioners and executives in Brussels and I have not the slightest doubt that had we bargained at that time for an exclusive 50-mile limit we would have got it.  Unfortunately, we did not do so.  I understand that someone in a senior position mentioned the question of fisheries during the President's negotiations when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, and he was asked to return to Ireland so as not to be making a nuisance of himself.  Fianna Fáil put little value on fisheries in 1972.  I campaigned unsuccessfuly along with my colleagues in the Labour Party against our entry to the Common Market until such time as questions such <Col N="1433" /> as fisheries were properly dealt with We knew very well that we were rushing into something that we were not prepared for.</P>
      <P>The Common Market at that time were anxious that Ireland become a member of the Community.  We could have made a good bargain in relation to fisheries then.  It is water under the bridge now.  I am not reflecting on the democratic overwhelming decision of the people when they voted for membership.  I and some of my colleagues were not in favour of membership until proper negotiations had taken place.  We considered that there was a big rush.  It was thought at that time that unless we got in now we would not get in at all.  It was thought that they had an open purse in Brussels and that as soon as we got in they would start handing out money wholesale to help poor old Ireland. The members of the Community had something up their sleeves.  They knew that Ireland had a vast fishing ground. They knew the immense potential of the Irish fishing grounds.  They knew that their fish were becoming scarce and they believed if they got Ireland into the Common Market without any stipulations in relation to fisheries they would have the right of access to Irish waters after 1982, not only access to six or 12 miles but access up to the shores.</P>
      <P>My reading of the documentation told me most emphatically that the only reason why this question of derogation was set down, this period of ten years, when all boats, French, German, Italian or any other boat from the Community could fish off our shores, was that there could be a question of an exclusive three-mile limit such as we had long ago.  That was the only hope so far as that negotiation was concerned, that there was a possibility of getting an agreement on a three-mile limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated the background against which any Irish Government must work in this regard.  Everybody makes mistakes.  We made mistakes but we are prepared to admit to them. In our negotiations we were faced with a major obstacle and our task was to <Col N="1434" /> overcome that obstacle bearing in mind that finalisation was to be reached before the end of 1977 and not, as the Minister says now, 1978.  It was our view in Government that we should have exclusive rights.  We were aware of what were quotas and licences.  The Minister has admitted that it is impossible to monitor a system of quotas and licences so far as the other eight member states are concerned. That, too, is the general viewpoint I got from almost everybody connected with fisheries.  Our aim is to get agreement on the highest possible exclusive limit.  I would have preferred by far to get agreement on an exclusive band, even if it were less than 50 miles, than to get a 50-mile band but with permission for each of the other member states and for some third countries to fish within it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Minister's appointment to this portfolio, it can be said that he is as good for the job of Minister as is any of the other Ministers. However, strangely enough, the Taoiseach did not appoint to this Ministry Deputy Gibbons, Deputy Haughey, Deputy Molloy, Deputy Gallagher or any of these other people who were so loud in 1976 and in particular before the general election in calling for a 50-mile exclusive band.  Our objective must be to succeed in regard to a 50-mile exclusive band.  One need not be a great scholar to understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; and to know that it does not mean giving to others licences or quotas.</P>
    <P>I have never favoured protest marches but I can see the justification for our fishermen leaving their work today and tomorrow to come here to protest against the Government's attitude in regard to fisheries.  I am sure the Taoiseach and the Minister will have no hesitation in meeting a representative body from such an important industry and explaining to them what Deputy Haughey, Deputy Gallagher and other Fianna Fáil Deputies meant when they spoke of there being no problem in regard to a 50-mile limit. Perhaps, too, the fishermen will be told what Deputy O'Kennedy meant&mdash; a man who is a member of the Inner <Col N="1435" /> Bar&mdash;when he advised them about how easy it was to reach agreement on a 50-mile limit.  Perhaps these people, 12 months after they made these statements, will meet the fishermen and explain to them what they meant.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil conned the fishermen and in so doing succeeded in getting the votes of most of the skippers.  We would be failing in our duty to a large section of people if we watered down in any way our recommendations for this exclusive band.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to quote at length but I have some quotations here that might be worth reading.  One of these is very important because it contains a request to the IFO to underline for the Government the necessity of the demand for a 50-mile exclusive limit. I am referring now to Deputy Gibbons's time but he is the one who sneered here during several of the fishery debates.  Now he is in office. The shoe is on the other foot and I wonder whether he will meet the fishermen tomorrow.  I do not know whether at the time Deputy Haughey was aiming at something higher&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are several other items that could be dealt with during this debate but time does not permit.  However, the main question before the House, and this is the question that was before the electorate in June last, is the question of an exclusive 50-mile limit.  There was no ambiguity in this regard before <Col N="1436" /> the election so far as Fianna Fáil were concerned.  Their message was clear: &ldquo;Put us back in power and the boats of other countries will not be allowed fish within 50 miles of our shores&rdquo; and as well as that, that &ldquo;we will have a big voice in the conservation measures for waters beyond our 50 miles and up to 200 miles&rdquo;.  I make out, and I hate to do so, that it is essential to bring such facts again before the House.  It is not that most Members of the House are unaware. It was as shabby a piece of business as happened during my time in this House over the years, the gimmickry here and the various debates on fisheries that took place here.  The only question at the time that motivated Fianna Fáil was to undermine the efforts being made by the then Government to achieve a reasonable deal on behalf of the Irish fishermen.  We were moving towards that objective.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is that, again, after eight months, there is no change whatever, no suggestion whatever, not even an idea <Col N="1437" /> of a suggestion, from either of the two Opposition parties.  Deputy Murphy spoke concerning an exclusive band against all others for Irish fishermen. Even the chairman of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation did not go that far. Apart from that, what he was talking about as having been declared by the Coalition Government is now illegal and has been so declared by the courts in Europe and the final decision will be made tomorrow, as we all know, that it is totally illegal.</P>
      <P>What the Hell are the Opposition talking about?  Is there any retraction from the situation that having run against a stone wall once, you retreat and run against it again?  That is exactly what they have been doing.</P>
      <P>There must be some way to get around this great national problem but the low type of rhetoric we have heard on the two motions by the Opposition in the last two or three months certainly has done nothing to help but has done a great deal to hinder any progress that might be made.</P>

      <P>There is no difficulty about producing examples of low type rhetoric in this House over the last couple of years.  We have heard a number of speakers.  We heard Deputy Molloy&mdash;the Minister for Defence now &mdash;saying we would not deviate from our insistence on a 50-mile limit; we can double our catch only if a 50-mile band is applied.  We had Deputy Haughey saying it is the only answer and it is the only way we can be protected. We had Deputy Gallagher saying we cannot move one inch from that position.  We had the Ceann Comhairle &mdash;I understand I must refer to him by title rather than by name&mdash;telling us our fishermen will settle for nothing less and &ldquo;if we were now in power we would be standing out for a 50-mile exclusive limit, fast and definite&rdquo;.  That <Col N="1438" /> is the type of rhetoric we had in the last Dáil.  The Minister does not believe, his officials do not believe, the Fianna Fáil benchers do not believe, the House does not believe, the fishermen do not believe, the country does not believe that at this stage, after the Minister's caving in, there is any chance whatever of a 50-mile band.</P>

      <P>Instead of a 50-mile band we are offered fishing plans which, in accordance with the terms of the draft directive, may not discriminate as between fishermen of member states.  That is what we are offered in lieu of a 50-mile band by this Government, after what they had to say when in Opposition.</P>
      <P>Let me recapitulate the negotiations and the key points.  Where did we stand in October, 1976?  In the mid-October meeting in that year of the Council of Ministers, I made our case in terms that were clear, definite and tough.  The reaction was harsh from some of the other member states at first. During the first few days they were not prepared to believe that we were as tough as we were being, that we meant what we said, but they began to realise very quickly that we were serious in what we said.  The result&mdash; Commissioner Gundelach visited here and prepared proposals which he published on the morning of 29 October, proposals which offered this country a special position totally separate from Britain or any other member state, which accepted our development plan entitling us to double our catch by 1979 and to increase it thereafter and which gave us aid for fishery protection since determined at 75 per cent of the total capital cost.  In October, 1976, that was secured.  This was the offer by Commissioner Gundelach, the Commissioner at that stage, as an interim solution without prejudice to the 50-mile band which was yet to be negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How was this achieved?  It was achieved by differentiating our position from that of the United Kingdom, by careful negotiation with the Commission <Col N="1439" /> and by seeking sympathetic reaction from other member states.  We based our case, having secured their sympathy on the basis of the fact that our catch is only 2 per cent of the total Community catch, that even to double or treble this could have little effect on the others, that we had a genuine regional problem, and we had their goodwill because we had been as a Community member, a constructive member of the Community since we entered it.  In contrast, the United Kingdom did not have similar goodwill and the amount involved in giving a similar concession to Britain, especially on Britain's east coast, would be so big, that the others made it clear, privately as well as publicly, that under no circumstances would they make similar concessions to Britain.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom Government tried to ride on our backs.  At the time they were trying to negotiate their deep water position reciprocal rights with third countries, and they left it to us to fight the coastal band, expecting and hoping that whatever we got they would get.  On the morning of 29 October, what they got was a land when Commissioner Gundelach published his proposals for a specific regime for Ireland in all these respects. That evening, the British Minister for Foreign Affairs, since deceased, invited me to visit the British Embassy in Brussels to discuss matters with him and there he handed to me a piece of paper and said it was up to me to seek for Britain all the things I had won for Ireland and indicated what the consequences might be for this country if we were not compliant with British wishes in this matter.  I had the guts to tell him where he got off and to tell him that we were fighting our own case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the next morning at the Council of Ministers that British Minister dropped his claim within five minutes of the opening and we never heard one more work of the threats at that stage because we stood up to the British then and since then <Col N="1440" /> and for the rest of the period that we were in Government, Britain could not ride on our backs and our position was clearly differentiated; the other countries were willing to consider our position because the concession to us was small and because we had separated our position and had made it clear and had got it agreed that whatever we got would come to us only and would not have to go to Britain.  The key to the whole negotiations was the separation of our position from that of the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>There was another important element, however, and that was our visible determination to veto any agreements with third countries for reciprocal rights for Community countries in their waters, which most of our partners need, unless and until the coastal band was conceded.  At first, when we made this clear, we were treated with hostility, even incredulity, but the firmness of our stand gradually convinced others that some solution of the Irish problem of the coastal band would have to be found. In all discussions with the Commissioner and the other countries' foreign ministers, the sole and only basis of discussion on my part was the coastal band.  Two problems were raised by this: (1) traditional rights&mdash;and there is a problem there.  We showed our willingness which I must say, Fianna Fáil have shared and said in Opposition that they shared, to take these traditional rights into account.  It was clear that this problem was one which could be overcome by careful negotiation, perhaps including some bilateral negotiations with the two countries most involved, France and the Netherlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other problem which remained and which had not been resolved at the time of the change of Government was how to give us a coastal band under what might be described as a Community umbrella.  This would give us effective control of our waters but under a Community umbrella which would make it respectable in Community terms.  Neither I nor the Commission had found the formula to cover that, but that is what we were negotiating: a coastal band with provision <Col N="1441" /> for the negotiation of traditional rights and some mechanism by which effective control of our own zone would be given a Community umbrella cover.  That is where the negotiations were when we left office and there was no inherent problem which could not have been overcome.  I do not want to claim too much.  I do not want to exaggerate our achievement.  But, first of all, there was this general acceptance, including at the very end the British, that we were a special case and that a special solution was needed for us.</P>
    <P>One Foreign Minister told me how he had told his own Government that Ireland, Greenland and, outside the Community, Norway, were special cases because of the importance of fish to their economies and that his Government, after his explanation, understood this.  Because of the importance of not conceding to the UK, his position would remain publicly inflexible until the UK had settled.  Secondly, we had secured a realisation that we meant business about vetoing third country agreements and the initial hostility which our determination to do this caused had died down. Thirdly, the problem of the coastal band had been reduced to one of its size and the method of giving it an aura of Community respectability by leaving us with effective control.</P>
    <P>We had got matters to that point when the Government, unfortunately for the fishermen and Irish national interests, changed.  All these gains have now been lost.  All that bargaining position has been abandoned.  This is not because the Government were not aware of the position.  It is fair to say&mdash;and right that I should say&mdash;that when the Government changed, in accordance with appropriate practice, I fully briefed my successor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on many aspects of foreign affairs, including every detail of these negotiations and every private contact I had had in the absence of civil servants who might have all the details, to make sure that the new Government would have the advantage of everything I knew.  This was a full briefing lasting several hours.  The Government have no excuse in suggesting that they did not <Col N="1442" /> know the position or were at any disadvantage. In this I followed the national interest and not the party interest.</P>
    <P>Why then have the Government given in and conceded a coastal band? I think it is because the lack of conviction of the Minister has convinced the other countries that we are now, under this Government, a soft target. The realignment with the UK by the Minister has hardened the attitude of other member countries willing to make concessions to us but not to the British.  The astonishing result is that it is now the UK which is holding out for special concessions and is seeking special treatment, which we had negotiated for this country and not the UK in October 1976.  Moreover, the catch that has been fixed for this year appears to be 96,000 or 97,000 tonnes, yet the agreement of October 1976, which there was no difficulty in having honoured, was that our catch would be doubled from 75,000 tonnes in 1975 and the 1976 figure was expected to be similar or slightly higher.  It turned out to be 80,000.  It was to be 150,000 tonnes in 1979 and in all the negotiations it was agreed that this was to be achieved in three stages and the catch provisions for last year were of the order of 100,000 tonnes.  What the Minister has done is to secure for this year perhaps fractionally less than the catch provision for last year and he has given away an agreement which could have given us 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes more fish this year.  It is no excuse to say that there is a problem of herring conservation, because when we negotiated that agreement in October 1976 the problem of herring conservation was known and the doubling of the Irish fish target was agreed on the basis that there would have to be herring conservation but that nevertheless our total fish catch, herring and the rest, would be doubled by 1979.</P>
    <P>To lose so much and so quickly must be a unique and dramatic performance. I think I can be forgiven for feeling a little bitter about it.  I put more into this than anything else during the four-and-a-half tough years as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Every <Col N="1443" /> move in the game, every phrase, every decision as to whom to talk to in turn was agonised over.  I can recall one night when I sat up until 4.30 a.m. thinking over the moves to be made. I woke at 7.30 a.m. and started noting down exactly what I would say to which person during the day and at what point in order to ensure that we would miss no trick or mistake.  All that is now lost.</P>
    <P>The fishermen were consulted throughout.  They were brought into the consultations, into the building and into our offices and their views were taken into account in every move that was made.  This consultation has been abandoned by the Minister because he is afraid to bring them in, afraid to let them know what he has been up to during the past few months.</P>
    <P>I bitterly resent what has happened. I resent it on behalf of the Irish fishermen and I resent it for Ireland.  I resent that all has been lost.  Every card handed to our successors has been thrown away, although all these cards were well marked by us for our successors at the briefing which took place on the change of Government.  I regard what has happened as a disaster for Ireland, more damaging than just in its effect on the fishing industry. From my experience it is not going too <Col N="1444" /> far to say that our whole bargaining stance in the EEC is affected.  Others now believe that we are no longer serious and that we can be overridden as weak negotiators in fish, and the same can happen elsewhere.  The respect built up for our position, our genuineness and our toughness has been lost.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that this is all the Minister's fault.  The Taoiseach must have known, like the rest of the country, that the Minister has great qualities of friendliness, geniality and bonhomie, but at the same time he does not have the finesse and toughness for this type of job.  Why, then, was he chosen for it?  Was it because he was the only one available who had not hung the 50-mile limit around his neck in imprudent speeches in the Dáil or Seanad?  Was he picked because he was the man to sell us out since he was not on record regarding the 50-mile limit?  I do not know.  Certainly I do not think he is the man for this kind of negotiation.  I do not think the Government have shown the courage of their stated conviction in Opposition. They have shown neither courage nor conviction and the Irish people and the Irish fishing industry are the losers as a result.</P>

      <P>I am, however, advised by CIE that the fleet of buses assigned to this general area is adequate in the normal way but that problems have arisen owing to changes of school hours in certain schools which have added to the heavy demand for public transport in this area at around the same time in the mornings and evenings.</P>
      <P>It is also understood from CIE that studies are being carried out of the school transport situation in the Lucan/Maynooth areas and that when these studies have been completed they will consult with the parents' associations and other interested parties in the Lucan/Maynooth areas with a view to seeing what can be done to improve the standard of service for school children.</P>

      <P>Where such payments are made pursuant to a Court order they are treated as an application of, and not a charge on, the husband's income.  The husband is entitled to the married personal allowance if he shows that his separated wife is wholly maintained by him. The payments are not regarded as income of the wife.</P>
      <P>Where payments are made under a voluntary agreement they are treated as annual payments by the husband from which tax is deductible.  The wife receives the payments net of tax; she is regarded for tax purposes as a <i>femme sole</i> entitled to the single allowance and, if her total income is such that she is not liable to tax, she may claim repayment of the tax deducted. The husband is granted the single allowance instead of the married allowance.</P>
