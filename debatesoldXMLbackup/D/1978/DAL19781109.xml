    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they are afraid of.  For a few minutes I want to deal with the long list of sections a contravention of which will be an offence when this Bill becomes law.  The list is a good deal longer than it was, and rightly so, because in the original state of the Bill sections and not subsections were referred to and some mandatory duties imposed on registrars and on the Minister himself, which were capable of being neglected in contravention of the section, theoretically would have exposed the Minister or registrar to prosecution, which obviously was not intended. That aspect of this section has been improved.  On the other hand, this is still a drafting disaster and I will briefly explain to the House why this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 14 (1) a duty is laid on officers, members, agents, or servants of a society, the affairs of which are being investigated under section 13, to produce to the inspector all books, accounts, deeds, records or other documents and so on.  Obviously, that is a mandatory requirement.  Yet in section 28, which we are now amending, there seems to be no reference to the offence of failure to produce.  There is reference, on the other hand, to a failure to supply.  I know that the same thing is meant but we are talking about a situation in which a counsel or solicitor defending a society or officer <Col N="568" /> on indictment or on a summary charge would be looking closely at such matters. The draftsman should have made sure that the words in the section which lays the duty and the words in the section which imposes the penalty and which constitutes the offence are the same.  This is a sloppy way of doing this job.  I can see quite clearly what is intended but it should not be necessary to have to interpret it in this way.</P>
    <P>The same section, 14 (1), requires the officer to give the inspector all assistance. This presumably includes answering questions; that must be the principal component of the idea of giving assistance.  Yet this component is particularly singled out in the second subsection and is there declared to be an offence under section 28.  Are we to take it that other forms of refusal to give assistance besides refusing to answer questions or to produce documents, if there can be other forms, will not be penalised?  They seem to me to fall outside the provision of subsection (2) and equally they seem to fall outside the provision of section 28.</P>
    <P>Exactly the same kind of thing could be said about section 23.  Again the word &ldquo;produce&rdquo; is used instead of the word &ldquo;supply&rdquo;.  Finally, section 35 (2) makes it an offence punishable on summary conviction to a fine of £500 or less to fail to comply with the provisions of section 35 (1).  Why is this offence separately listed?  It seems to be the only one in this Bill, which contains a lot of potential offences, in which a separate subsection is included with a separate penalty provided.</P>
    <P>These are points which suggest that this drafting is still untidy.  While we will not oppose the section and we acknowledge that an effort has been made, we feel that a much better effort could have been made.</P>

      <P>I support the drafting amendments.  We received some advance indication of these amendments a few days ago and have considered them since.  It appears that the Bill has had an area of ambiguity removed and it is certainly strengthened.  This amendment is sensible and I am glad that these matters were discussed in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I should have added that the long list which it is now proposed will constitute subsection (1) of section 28 does not include subsection (1) of section 14 and subsection (1) of section 23.  Turning to section 28, a failure to supply books, accounts and so on in paragraphs (c) and (d) is referred to sections 11 and 21 and sections 13 and 22, not to sections 14 and 23.  I understand there is some kind of drafting reason for it but I do not grasp that reason and it is another instance of a rather messy job.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the points made by Deputy Kelly, the draftsman has said that section 28 (1) (a) as amended and section 28 (1) (d) will cover the offence created in section 14 (1) and section 14 (2).  He has said that it is quite acceptable, quite enforceable and will stand up in a court of law.  Regarding the points made on section 35, the reason for having separate mention of a society under subsection (2) is that a society cannot be indicted and therefore it must be a summary conviction.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 28: In page 17, lines 17 to 24, subsection (3) deleted and the following subsection substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate or by a person purporting to act on behalf of a body corporate and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or approval of, or to have been facilitated by any wilful neglect on the part of any person who is an officer of the body corporate, that person shall also be guilty of the offence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is to rectify loose drafting which we discovered following a point made by Deputy Kelly.  Reference was made to the word &ldquo;official&rdquo; and, having looked at it again after the Committee Stage here, we decided before going to the Seanad to make the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is to accommodate a suggestion made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald, who is very knowledgeable, perhaps the most knowledgeable man regarding company law in either of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The amendment was made to accommodate the Senator.  It brings the section of the Bill in line with the provisions in the Companies Act.

      <P>Section 36: In page 19, between lines 13 and 14, the following new section inserted before section 36:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;36.&mdash;(1) An investment trust company shall not accept or hold deposits.</P>
      <P>(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), an investment trust company incorporated before the 4th day of October, 1978, and which on or before that date had accepted or held deposits shall not hold deposits after the end of the period of two years commencing at the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>(3) In this section &lsquo;investment trust company&rsquo; has the same meaning as in the Central Bank Act, 1971.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the introduction of a new section in which we include investment trust companies which were not previously included. Under section 7 (4) of the Central Bank Act, 1971, an investment trust company was exempted from the scope of section 7 (1) of that Act.  They could carry on a banking business without the need to hold a banking licence and without the need to maintain a deposit in the Central Bank.  This was a loophole and we are now closing it because we have reason to believe it might happen that an industrial or provident society would direct their business into an investment trust company and get away with it.  It is necessary for the Bill to close the loophole.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, last evening I was approached by my Whip to know if I would speak this morning on this motion and I agreed to do so.  The Whip said that the Minister had given an assurance that I would be able to speak today and on that basis I am here this morning to speak.  Although I was not here the last evening I intended to speak on this important legislation.  I felt last evening that sufficient people were in the House to keep the debate going and consequently even though perhaps I should have been here I was not here.  However, I was assured by the Whip and by our spokesman, Deputy Boland, that I or anybody else who wished could speak.  I also got the impression from the Chair this morning that had Deputy Blaney been here he would have been allowed to speak.  If Deputy Blaney would be allowed to speak there is no reason why I should not be allowed to speak.  Technically, as the Minister stood up and just said &ldquo;A Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rdquo; he should be allowed to reply, but in the spirit of the situation I should not be denied the right to say something.  I would ask the Chair to call on me to speak and I will not delay the House for any length of time.</P>

      <P>It is not the duty of the Chair to curtail any speeches in the House but this matter was unresolved, it was somewhat in mid-air.

      <P>On a point of order, it has never been the practice in this House for as long as I have been here, to deprive a Deputy of the opportunity to speak on a Bill or an Estimate.  The Ceann Comhairle has departed from that practice on this occasion.  As far as I know it is customary for the Minister to give way to Members of the House who wish to contribute to a debate and if the Minister for Health and Social Welfare is departing from that tradition it is most unfortunate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would emphasise that nobody is being deprived.  It is a question of sticking to Standing Orders.  We should be rigid in this matter because frequently people will arrive late and will attempt to get into a debate when the Minister has already commenced replying.  Deputies will agree that the Minister has been on his feet to reply.  He should be allowed to do so.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I appreciate that the Ceann Comhairle was not here at the time, but what really happened was that Deputy Browne concluded at two minutes to seven and Private Members' Business was due to begin at seven o'clock.  The people involved in Private Members' Business came in and took up their places on these benches and on the Labour Party benches and I got the impression that Deputy Blaney did not immediately rise because he understood that these people wished to contribute to the Social Welfare Bill.  In fact, they had come in for the business which was due to commence two minutes later.  As soon as Deputy Blaney realised that they were not offering, he offered and by that time the Minister had risen and claims that he <Col N="574" /> said &ldquo;A Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rdquo;.  I did not hear the Minister say that but surely these words do not disclose the contents of the Minister's reply to the Second Stage of the debate.  It is being terribly technical to say that the Minister had commenced when he said &ldquo;A Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rdquo;.</P>

The Minister told me yesterday evening that if Deputy Blaney was available this morning to speak, he would allow him to speak.  While I appreciate that the Chair must adhere to Standing Orders, surely the Minister can give way to those who wish to contribute.  I asked the Minister if he intended to conclude if Deputy Blaney was not available and he said no, that if any members of my party wished to contribute they could do so.

      <P>That would not be my approach.  I think that if Deputy Neil Blaney were here this morning, the Minister was prepared to give way to him, in view of the difficulty that arose on Tuesday night.  I am calling Deputy O'Brien now and the Minister comes in at 12 noon.  I want to make something else clear in view of some difficulties that arose.  We are dealing only with the social insurance code on this Bill.  The Bill has nothing to do with the social assistance code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving way.  I shall be brief.  I welcome the new system for collecting contributions.  This change has been long overdue.  It will save money for employers.  It will also cut down robberies of insurance stamps.  We hope also that it will yield additional revenue. I welcome the reduction in the contribution for lower paid workers.  This is index-linked so it will operate for only a short time because, as time goes on, the contributions will rise.  However, it is worth while.</P>
      <P>If additional funds become available we should consider the position of the elderly and the raising of their allowances. We must look after the aged. We have been doing that in areas like housing.  In local authority accommodation the aged pay very small rents.  I would ask the Minister&mdash;this is something I raised with his predecessor&mdash;to consider the case of the elderly living in private accommodation.  Very often they have to pay very high rents, and I would ask the Minister to do something for these by way of supplementary rent allowance.  As the Minister knows, they are very vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is looking at the free fuel scheme and its operation.  The system needs overhaul.  I think the Minister is in consultation with the local authorities about the system.  It just does not work.  The intention is good but the <Col N="584" /> recipients are not able to collect this fuel and so they are not getting it.  The system is breaking down.</P>
    <P>Another area about which I am not happy&mdash;the Minister may not be able to do much about it&mdash;is where you have people on assistance getting butter, turf and other perks.  I believe this should extend right across the board for everyone. Otherwise it appears to be unjust.</P>
    <P>Another area the Minister might look at is where people are unemployed for a fairly lengthy period.  I have had a number of people coming to me lately and they have told me that, when they go to sign on, they are asked to produce no fewer than four letters from would-be employers to say they were looking for work.  Now four letters is a bit much. What I say is fact.  I would ask the Minister to look into this.  There is an element of hounding in it.  I do not know any who were denied entitlement but they have certainly been asked to produce these letters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They might not get a letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The employer might say he had no time to be writing letters.  I think these people should be referred to the Manpower Service.  Again, when an individual is unemployed for 18 months or two years, he should be given retraining. It is well known that when people are unemployed for a lengthy period they tend to lose confidence and their will to work.  This is a sad situation.  We do not want people unemployed for long periods, and I suggest that these should have the benefit of retraining programmes to ensure their confidence is not eroded.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister also to examine Dublin City labour exchanges. They are very dreary places and people having to go there seem to have a feeling of losing their self-respect.  These labour exchanges should be run more on the lines of the manpower services.  They should be model offices with their personnel able to sit down and talk to people about various employments.  The whole idea of hatches and wire cages in these offices in this day and age is wrong and demoralising for any human being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The Minister might well consider examining and up-dating these exchanges. Indeed he might consider also the retraining of their personnel who deal with people on unemployment benefit.  Their attitudes and so on should be sympathetic because generally speaking they are dealing with people with serious financial problems on account of which they may be emotionally disturbed.  A review and up-dating of the system would pay for itself in many ways.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to social welfare should not be one of feeling that we are handing out something to people; rather that it is their right.  In this respect more could be done, through advertising, to inform people of their entitlements.  The Department has a very comprehensive and enlightening booklet on this matter but, from time to time, it would be no harm to have television programmes to inform people of their entitlements.  Here I am thinking particularly of the elderly who quite often are not aware of them. Therefore there should be positive publicity or advertising to inform them in this respect.  The Department must have a humane attitude rather than a bureaucratic one.  Indeed the forms which have to be filled in for claiming benefits often are very complex.  We might well examine all of these aspects.  I do appreciate that the Department must get detailed information but it is important that forms be kept as simple as possible.</P>
    <P>In present society I am afraid that pressure will be exerted on the less well-off by those in the better-off brackets, the tendency to maintain that social welfare recipients are getting too much. In an economic pinch I notice that the better-off people tend to become a little selfish and not advocate increases in social welfare allowances.  No matter what is the economic climate the Minister must make it quite clear that such increases are necessary in both health and social welfare, ensuring that recipients have sufficient to maintain a reasonable standard of living.  I do not think the Minister would yield to that type of pressure.  However it is exerted, particularly before elections, when it tends to prevail amongst people who have to make contributions&mdash;and let us <Col N="586" /> face it, that is what our income tax code is all about&mdash;in the form of additional taxation.  We must not yield to that type of pressure.  Rather we should ensure that the welfare code is updated and benefits increased at regular intervals. As has been the practice in recent years we should seek to devise ways and means of giving additional fringe benefits, particularly to the elderly.  We must continue to examine what can be done in that area.  We must all have knowledge of elderly people living alone endeavouring to eke out a living and how difficult they find it.  That is the main area of social welfare about which I am most concerned.</P>
    <P>On the subject of unemployment the impression is created that there is a move afoot to reduce the unemployment figures, at forcing people, for one reason or another, off the unemployment register.  If that is to be the approach to illustrate that unemployment figures are dropping it is a shameful one.  I am not accusing the Minister of endeavouring to do that but I fear that could be the motivation of instructions from other Departments to his to see what can be done to cut unemployment benefits.  The Minister must resist any such pressure. Rather, at the Cabinet table, he should ensure that he gets the best deal possible for the people and areas he represents.  If the Minister does not do so it will be the less well-off people in our society who will be deprived.  The Government do not appear to be terribly concerned with the less-well off.  If one examines their record since assuming office one rather finds that it is the better-off who have tended to reap the benefits.  That is a dangerous attitude and one the Minister must resist at all times.  It is vital that our attitude to social welfare be one of right or entitlement rather than one of handling-out or of having special benefits conferred on certain people.  That attitude must not be allowed to prevail because, as a nation, we are not very concerned with the less well-off.</P>
    <P>I would plead especially for the elderly, that the Minister&mdash;particularly at budget time&mdash;will remember these people and do something for them.  I think there was a question tabled in the House recently about a bonus benefit for them <Col N="587" /> at Christmas.  Certainly the Minister might examine this from the point of view of the old age pensioner.  Perhaps he could see his way to letting them have an additional week's benefit at Christmas.  I know it costs money but we must keep our priorities in order.  Indeed the Minister might well consider also the payment of such bonus for the disabled. People, and particularly the elderly and disabled, like to be remembered.  This is a way in which they could be remembered in a very positive sense, without over-burdening the Exchequer.  I think it was said last year it could not be done.  Hopefully it will be done this year.</P>
    <P>Basically the Bill is a reasonable one. The idea is good.  The Minister will be collecting additional finance which I hope will be spent in the right areas, with additional benefits being made available. The payment of additional benefits should be investigated and paid to as many people as possible ensuring that those who are unfortunate enough for one reason or another to be unable to work&mdash;whether it be for reasons of health, unemployment, old age or otherwise&mdash;are assured of a reasonable standard of living.  The Government should ensure that funds are made available in the next budget to give substantial increases to the people in this bracket so that they can have a better way of life.  After the earlier hassle about whether or not we could speak this morning I would like to thank the Chair for sorting the matter out.  People are happier that they have made their contributions. I do not believe the Minister will be delayed very long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill because obviously legislation which affects almost three quarters of a million of our workers must be important. There are many good points in the Bill such as the abolition of the flat rate. The two basic elements in the changes are the method by which the money is collected and the amount that is paid by the employer and the employee.  The flat rate, as the Minister pointed out, was not always fair.  Last January, the Minister reduced by £1 a week the amount that those earning under £50 a week paid. <Col N="588" /> Some of those paying the reduced rate got increases during the year; and when this took them up to £50 a week, or over that amount, they found they lost 66p per week.</P>
      <P>It is good to see the differential gone between male and female and to see domestic servants coming into pay related benefit.  I am glad to see that there will not be tax relief on the employee's contribution.  It would obviously have been impossible for the employer to collect it.  I am glad to see that the employee is given relief in another way.  The ceiling of £5,000 will increase the amount of pay-related benefit.  If one takes the difference between £14 and £100 a week, which is the new ceiling, 40 per cent of that would give £34.40 as against £14.40 previously.</P>
      <P>The most important element in the change is the method of collection. While it will make it more simple for employers to collect the money along with PAYE, it is vitally important that now there will be proper records.  It is fair to say that under the stamp card system a very good job was done by all concerned, but nevertheless there were cases from time to time where insurance cards got mislaid and proper records were not available in the Department. This sometimes led to undue hardship for the employees who were out of work and claimed unemployment benefit or disability benefit and perhaps had to wait a long time for their money.  If those people had families they suffered a lot of hardship during the period those people were waiting to receive their benefit.  I believe that now the record system will be almost foolproof and that even where a true record is not available the employee who has paid his contribution will not have to suffer too long waiting to receive the benefit he is entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question of the benefits, which have been changed regularly over the past 25 years since the first Social Welfare Act became law. They will have to be reviewed at some stage because there are obviously gaps in the benefits.  The health benefits, which are still under the Social Welfare Acts, such as dental and optical benefits, should be reviewed to include dependants <Col N="589" /> of insured workers.  This perhaps is more appropriate to the Department of Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has no impact on the employment situation.  Social insurance is an absolute necessity, but it is unfortunate that it constitutes a payroll tax.  Every extra person employed means that so much more money has to be paid to the Exchequer.  That is my most serious criticism of the Bill.  No attempt has been made to reduce the negative effect that social insurance has on employment retention and employment creation. We could have improved our employment prospects if we gave special consideration to labour intensive industries in the social insurance area. This Bill does not provide any concession for labour intensive industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to answer.  It certainly fails to provide it in any significant way. The Bill, in general, is in the right direction but sufficient attention has not been given to the payroll tax aspect of social insurance.  The Minister even at this stage might consider what encouragement he can give to labour intensive industries in this area.  If an employer has a fixed overhead per employee of approximately £7 a week, that is a reason to employ machines where that is possible. This is another contributing factor to our serious unemployment situation. This is a case of one aspect of Government policy militating against another, that is, job creation.  This was an opportunity to do something really significant about job creation, because social insurance has an impact on it.  Surely a simple system could have been devised whereby an industry employing 100 people would pay 5 per cent less than an industry employing 50 people and an industry employing 200 people would pay another 5 per cent less and so forth.  This would mean that the more people an industry employed the less the social contribution per head would be.  That would help significantly in the area of job creattion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of whether we <Col N="590" /> should seek alternative methods of funding social insurance other than by taxing employers is a fundamental one.  I know it is not easy because a lot of money is involved but it does not make sense to tax employment in a country like ours where unemployment is so serious.  I know it is done elsewhere but we should consider our special situation. We threw away money on items like the wealth tax; perhaps it would have been better to have spent the surplus money in areas like this.  The Government would be in less trouble today if they had approached the whole area of finance and taxation in this manner rather than in the way they did.  I know this question is too big to be tackled by this Bill but at least a start could have been made in easing the burden for capital-intensive industries.  I put it to the Minister that he should seriously consider the question of how to remove payroll tax, how to find substitute finance for the employers' contribution to social insurance. Perhaps he might consider setting up a commission to study the matter. It is an urgent and important task and it is central to the principal problem facing this country&mdash;unemployment.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the changes proposed in this legislation; for instance, abolishing the differential between manual and non-manual workers. However, the £5,000 limit is not welcome.  I am not sure that there should be any limit although I know costs must be taken into account.  What will happen&mdash;as the Minister admitted&mdash;is that anybody earning more than £80 per week, which is approximately the national average wage, will have to pay more for less.  Many people in manual employment who have enjoyed full cover in the matter of social insurance will not do so if they earn more than £5,000 a year.  I think it fair to say that this is the first move in taking back from the middle income group what was given in motor tax and the abolition of rates on domestic property.  This is the beginning of the clawback for which the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, became famous some days ago and which caused such consternation at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting yesterday.</P>

      <P>The extra charge being put on people earning more than £5,000 a year is the first clawback on benefits received because of the abolition of rates and motor tax.  In the whole area of social welfare, to an extent we have not been discriminating enough.  It is frequently said that there are abuses in the social welfare system, that people are getting benefits who do not need them and that some people are better off on social welfare than at work.  That is an unfortunate situation and it brings social welfare into disrepute.  The fact is that in this country, in particular in this city and notably in my constituency and in the inner Dublin area, there is ghastly poverty. Social welfare is not nearly discriminating enough in favour of people in those areas.  I know the Minister is a thoughtful man and I ask him to give consideration to a more discriminating code of social welfare, discriminating positively in favour of the really poor. There are too many people who are well below the poverty line and who are living in absolute misery.  However, it is difficult to see how a Government that abolished wealth tax and so on can even know or be concerned about that poverty.</P>
      <P>With regard to the taxing of contributory pensions, it is wrong to tax people in receipt of contributory old age pensions and widows' pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but I would point out that that is an irritant to people with contributory old age and widows pensions who are taxed and the Minister might take up the matter with his colleague.  It does not make sense that what is a form of savings should be taxed.  If a person has a total income in pensions of £7,000 or £8,000 he should pay his share of income tax but it does not make sense that a person in receipt of a contributory old age pension that has been paid for in advance during the <Col N="592" /> years should be taxed.  This is happening while other social welfare benefits are not taxed.  Why is there discrimination against recipients of contributory old age and widows' pensions?  It is unfair. The Minister would do a lot for these people if he removed that anomaly. Perhaps he will get an estimate of the cost involved?  I do not think the amount will be considerable and it would remove a great annoyance to many old people and widows.</P>
      <P>I welcome the general intent of the Bill.  It will remove many of the administrative anomalies that have existed in the social welfare code.  It will diminish the amount of fraud or negligence that existed in the past and exists at present.</P>
      <P>When this Bill has been passed will the Minister give careful consideration to the effect the social insurance payment has on job creation to see if there is any possibility of finding an alternative source of income to substitute for it?</P>

      <P>From reading this Bill and the other legislation dealing with social welfare, I find that it has become extremely complicated over the past few years.  The purpose of this legislation is to give effect to the Government's decision to introduce a system of pay-related social insurance contributions.  This legislation is beyond the grasp of the average person because he does not have the background knowledge and experience in social welfare legislation necessary to get an overall perspective of the scope, dimension and intentions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare is one of the most important Departments in the country because of the number of social welfare recipients involved.  In fairness to the Minister he has received credit from a number of people for the running of his two Departments.  Will the Chair allow me to speak on health benefits?</P>

      <P>The proposed ceiling of £50 will benefit the lower income group because it relates to people who are presently excluded from eligibility for medical cover under the medical card system.  Where people were just over the limit, this ceiling will help them.  On the other hand, it will hit the middle income group to a greater extent than hitherto. The ceiling of £5,000 will no doubt help the higher income group because even if a person earns more than that he will still pay the £50 limit.  Therefore this Bill will help the lower income groups and the Minister is to be complimented for that.</P>
      <P>As I said, there has been a vast amount of confusion among ordinary people as to what exactly they are entitled to under the different medical regulations.  It would be of benefit to the Minister and his Department to continue to expand their present policy of explaining what people are entitled to by virtue of the payments they make under the social welfare regulations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell mentioned the fact that contributory and widows' pensions are taxed.  This is causing an increasing amount of worry among older and not so old people who have unfortunately been left on their own.  Once their income goes beyond a certain limit they are liable to pay tax.  I am sure the Minister is only too well aware of the hardships and complications which are put before these people in their daily lives.  With rising prices and increases across the board these people find it much more difficult to maintain a decent standard of living, if this is the only benefit they receive. The Minister would do well to recommend that his colleague, before his deliberations next January when he delivers the 1979 budget, seriously consider increasing the tax free allowance to people in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation has been criticised for not doing a number of things it was never intended to do.  It represents a major administrative reform of the social welfare system.  It is probably the most important single reform of the system since the system was introduced.  It is primarily concerned with the method whereby the contributions to the insurance fund are collected from those who are insured.  It is not intended to deal with the other side of the coin, namely, payments out of the fund, the level and nature of benefits, improvements in benefits or anomalies in the payment or the rate of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is primarily an administrative form on the collection side, nevertheless we have availed of this opportunity to achieve some important economic and social effects.  Perhaps the most important <Col N="595" /> of these from the social point of view is the fact that it greatly eases the lot and improves the situation of the lower paid worker.  The principle of pay-related payments is now fully adopted and enshrined in this legislation and the effect of the operation of that principle is entirely to the benefit of the lower paid worker.  The main purpose is to ensure that lower paid workers pay somewhat less in order to achieve the same benefits; but, unfortunately, the corollary is that some sections must pay more.  I have already said that 500,000 workers will pay less when these provisions come into operation and approximately 200,000 will pay more.  That is the most important side effect of this changeover from the social point of view.</P>
    <P>The next point is that it will provide a significant benefit for Labour intensive industries, and I take issue with Deputy Mitchell on this point.  By and large, labour intensive industries are those which employ lower paid workers.  Not alone will the contributions paid by such workers be less but the corresponding contribution by the employers of lower paid workers will be less.  This must considerably improve the situation of labour intensive industries.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other economic side benefits on the official administrative side and also for the employer.  It will greatly streamline and facilitate our collection procedures and administration generally.  For the employer there is the benefit that in future only one deduction from payroll will be necessary and that will be a percentage from each wage or salary paid.  The cumbersome system of cards and stamps will be eliminated and the risk of fraud, deceit and robbery inherent in such a system will also go.  The benefit on the administrative side will be very great indeed.</P>
    <P>There will be a very considerable improvement in pay-related benefit.  At the moment it goes up to £2,500 per annum or £50 per week and that will be extended to £5,000 per annum or £100 per week.  This is a major improvement in the pay-related benefit system.  Female domestic servants, as they are called for <Col N="596" /> want of some better term, will now be brought within the scope of the pay-related scheme.  There are some improvements in the form of the elimination of discriminatory aspects of a minor but nevertheless important nature.</P>
    <P>On broad aspects of the legislation I will deal with two points which were raised.  The first was in regard to insurance of the self-employed and the other was concerned with pensions generally.  These are the next two major areas to be tackled in the field of social welfare.  Work in regard to them is very well advanced.  In both cases we published Green Papers outlining different aspects of the situation, the problems and possibilities, and asked for comment.  In regard to the self-employed we asked that all comments should be submitted by 31 May last.  At least two very important organisations asked for a postponement of that closure date because they were not ready to submit their views by then and we extended the time for the submission of these views. We have now informed everybody that we cannot wait any longer and unless we get their views almost immediately we must proceed without them.  We have gone through the same process in the matter of a national pensions scheme. We are accepting views from all the various bodies and organisations who have a legitimate interest, as well as from individuals.  These two major gaps in our social welfare structure are next on the list for attention.  As soon as we get this changeover effectively in operation, we will be able to get down to dealing with these other areas and put forward proposals in regard to them.</P>
    <P>While the level of benefits, abuse and such matters are not related to this legislation, they were mentioned in the debate and I will speak briefly about them.  It is part of our duty and responsibility as a Department of Social Welfare to ensure on a continuing basis that the social welfare code is not abused and is not availed of fraudulently by anybody.  Everybody realises that in a modern community no Government scheme can be entirely free from abuse and fraudulent misuse.  Right through the whole spectrum of public administration there is abuse to a greater or lesser <Col N="597" /> degree.  To use the modern phrase, people are beating the system.  In regard to social welfare, I do not think the level of abuse is greater than in any other area of public administration.  Whether it is or not, it is our responsibility to ensure that it is combated and dealt with as effectively as possible.  It can never be completely eliminated, but we must deal with it constantly and on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>We do that.  It is necessary we should do so from a number of points of view.  It is demoralising and distressing for the genuine person who works hard and does his best to earn an income to maintain himself and his family to see someone else fraudulently, if you like, availing of benefits and services to which he is not entitled.  That is probably the most important aspect of any abuse in social welfare.  It gives rise to feelings of frustration, annoyance and anger among genuine conscientious people doing an honest day's work when they see being rewarded someone else who is not.</P>
    <P>As one Member said, the more we can eliminate abuse the more we will have available ultimately for those genuinely in need&mdash;and, God knows, there are enough of them to demand that we do not fritter away any of our scarce resources on people who are not entitled to them.  Certainly there will be no witch hunts, no harassment, nothing of that nature as far as I am concerned.  There will be a simple, straightforward discharge of our duty and obligation to ensure, as far as we can possibly do so, that all those entitled to benefit get benefit, and that those who are not so entitled do not.</P>
    <P>I accept, as has been pointed out here in this debate, that I have a special ministerial responsibility to ensure that the needs and requirements and welfare of the poor and needier sections are brought constantly to the attention of the Government in any changes being made, in any policies being adopted, and in all the Government's activities.  The Government have, of course, a social policy.  Fianna Fáil have always had a social policy.  A progressive social policy has always been an integral part of Fianna Fáil's philosophy right from the days of their foundation.  We have pioneered major improvements in the area of <Col N="598" /> welfare generally&mdash;social welfare, health and education.  We are as firmly committed today to a policy of social justice as we ever were at any time in the history of our party.</P>

      <P>That is the outlook and philosophy and policy of this Government and, as far as I am concerned, as Minister for Social Welfare, I have the special duty of ensuring that that philosophy is translated into practical effect, and that the intention of the Government is constantly directed to any areas where action needs to be taken, or can be taken, to ensure that that social philosophy of ours is given full effect.  I intend to discharge that duty and I have the understanding, the sympathy and the co-operation of all my colleagues in that regard.</P>
      <P>There was some confusion about the rates of contribution that will come into operation under the new legislation.  Section 5 provides for a standard rate of social insurance contribution of 11.2 per cent.  That will be made up of 3.4 per cent from the employee and 7.8 per cent from the employer.  That contribution will cover benefits other than occupational injury.  That is paid exclusively by the employer and, from now on, it will be at the rate of .45 per cent.  Now the 3.4 per cent employee contribution is, in fact, 3.9 per cent.  That 3.9 per cent is reduced by .5 of 1 per cent to compensate for the fact that the pension element of the contribution will no longer be deductible for income tax purposes.  That .5 of 1 per cent concession in the employee's rate is related directly to what will be lost to employees and gained by the Exchequer because of the fact that we will no longer be able, for administrative reasons, to make the deduction in income tax to allow for the pension element in the contribution rate. I trust I have made that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be three rates for the voluntary contributor&mdash;4.4 per cent, 2.7 per cent and 1.7 per cent&mdash;payable in full by the contributor and the rate will depend <Col N="599" /> on the benefits for which the contributor is covered.  All those rates will either be confirmed or varied before 6 April next. The reason for that is that we have put into the Bill the various figures, levels, qualifications and rates appropriate to the latest overall industrial earnings figure as we know it.  The average industrial earnings figure is related to March.  It is available around September and it will be the base on which the following year's ceiling will be fixed.  We take the average industrial earnings figure and multiply by roughly 1½ to ensure that the great bulk of workers is covered.  We will fix the final figure then to come into operation on 6 April next related to the average industrial earnings as at March of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have adverted to most of the points raised by Deputies. The question of the consolidation of the legislation was raised.  There is no great point of principle involved in postponing the activities of the standing joint committee. Since the Bill, the consolidation measure, was presented to that committee the Social Welfare Acts of 1977 and 1978 were passed.  This Bill represents further major changes and it is just common sense to bring forward a new updated Consolidation Bill.  Whether we do that or not it certainly would not be sensible to go ahead with the work of the consolidation committee while this legislation is on the stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the committee have not even been appointed since July, 1977?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that they had not been appointed.  The committee are simply appointed whenever we are ready to go ahead with the work.</P>
      <P>Some political play was made of the question of the Exchequer contribution. Deputy Noel Browne conveyed, with some sleight of hand, the impression that this Government had reduced or were embarking on a programme to reduce the Exchequer rate of contribution.  That is not so.  When we assumed office the rate of Exchequer contribution was around 20 per cent.  We maintained it at that rate for 1978 and all these calculations are based on a continuation of that level of Exchequer subvention to the insurance fund.  There is a great deal of misapprehension about the reality of the situation.  Deputies are prone to throwing out statements that we are the worst in Europe or the worst in the world, but in fact the level of contribution by the Exchequer to welfare as a percentage of the funds payable into insurance funds is very high compared with that prevailing in Europe.  It is much higher than in most countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, all that is hardly relevant because we must try to manage our affairs in relation to our situation and our resources.  The situation is that these figures, the calculations in this legislation, are based entirely on making this changeover on a totally neutral basis so <Col N="601" /> far as income is concerned.  We are seeking to devise rates and percentages which will bring in exactly the same amount as the existing flat rate contributions are bringing in.  At no level, either in income tax concessions or in any other area, are we using this changeover to effect any substantial change in the contribution from either the employee or the employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What about female civil servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Female civil servants to whom this applies will again be asked to contribute on a pay-related basis, about 1.7 per cent.  As Deputies know, in 1956 a change was made which took them out of the system.  That was fairly relevant at that time because female civil servants had to resign on marriage and most of them would never benefit from the contributions made.  That does not apply now.  Employees, including women, in the public sector are insured for a limited number of benefits.  A special flat rate contribution is applicable to them at present.  That will be converted into a pay-related contribution at the same reduced rates appropriate to the cost of the limited benefits for which they are insured.  In 1956 female pensionable public servants were relieved of the obligation to pay a proportion on the grounds that the majority of them would never benefit from the system.  However, the marriage ban was removed in 1973 and women now qualify for widow's pension either on their own or on their husband's insurance. It is appropriate now that women in the civil service should come back into the situation.  Their contributions will have exactly the same value as male contributions.</P>
      <P>I hope I have dealt with the main points raised.  This is a very long, complicated piece of legislation.  I suggest that anybody who has not had an opportunity of giving expression to his views on the Second Reading, either through his own dilatoriness or through the workings of the system, will have plenty of opportunity on the sections on Committee Stage to make any point he wishes.</P>

      <Col N="602" /> I commend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.

    <Title>Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill, 1978: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make legislative provision for an extension of the range of courses in respect of which higher education grants may be held. Under the Act which established the grants scheme&mdash;The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968&mdash;grants were tenable only in respect of attendance at university degree courses and courses in other institutions of higher education which were equivalent to university degree courses.  This Bill provides for the award of grants to designated courses in institutions such as the colleges of Technology and the regional technical colleges which would not be degree courses or their equivalent.  This arrangement was initiated at the commencement of the academic year 1974-75 and, accordingly, the amending legislation provides that the appropriate date from which the amendment should come into operation is 1 August 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The academic attainment standard prescribed for the purpose of a higher education grant is stated in terms of achievement at the leaving certificate examination. <Col N="605" /> The relevant provision in the published grants schemes is that the candidate must have obtained grade C or a higher grade in higher or common level papers in four or more subjects or, alternatively, have obtained grade C or a higher grade in higher or common level papers in Irish and in two other subjects or in mathematices and in two other subjects.</P>
    <P>This amending legislation allows candidates who reach the prescribed standard at the leaving certificate examination to choose an approved course of study in the non-university sector in preference to going to university, if they wish to do so.  Such approved course must be based on leaving certificate entry standard and be a wholetime course of minimum duration of two years leading to a certificate or diploma validated by an appropriate authority, which would normally, and increasingly so in the future, be the NCEA.  These course are provided mainly in the Dublin colleges of technology and in the regional technical colleges.  Approved courses in other institutes of third-level education may, however, also be included.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances of the provision being allowed by the terms of this Bill, candidates who qualify for higher education grants have, accordingly, available to them an extra option in their choice of course&mdash;that of following a third level education course at non-degree level.  I am satisfied that it is very desirable that this option should be available as an alternative for the student who desires to pursue a course of study at third-level without commitment, at least at the commencement of the course, to completion of a full degree course.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the regional technical colleges for the purpose of tenure of higher education grants is also a commendable development for many reasons.  Their inclusion offers the student a wider choice of course.  For some students the convenience of the local college to home will, socially and educationally, be welcome; and the inclusion should enhance the status of those colleges and promote the development of a wide variety of courses of study in them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> As I have already stated these arrangements have been in operation since 1 August 1974 in anticipation of the relevant amending legislation.  This is not a practice which I would wish to condone or to take example by.  At this stage I merely mention the fact as an introduction to a statement of the number of students who in 1977-78 held higher education grants in non-university institutes. In that year a total of 5,848 students held higher education grants&mdash;a lower figure, incidentally, than might be expected if the value of the grants and a revision of the means' conditions had taken place as it should have in the period 1973 to 1976.  Of that number 160 held their grants in institutes other than the universities.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is also appropriate to point out that a scheme of scholarships is operated by vocational Education committees.  The number of students who received such scholarship assistance in the academic year 1977-78 was 1,658.  In making comparison with the figure of 5,848 students holding higher education grants it is necessary to bear in mind that the average duration of the courses in the non-university sector is shorter than in the case of the universities and that, for this and other reasons, the total number of students following the designated courses in the regional technical colleges and in the colleges of technology is much less than the number of students in the universities. The VEC scholarship scheme will, accordingly, continue as the principle vehicle by which student aid will be given in the non-degree area of third level education. The means' conditions for these scholarships are the same as for the higher education grants scheme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I may say that I consider that this proposed amendment of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, provides a bridge by which higher education grant holders may proceed to courses having a technological rather than an academic emphasis and it will in this way contribute to the supply of trained personnel for the country's expanding industrial sector.  I confidently commend it to the House for approval.</P>
    <Col N="607" />
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is merely an amending Bill to take into account the fact that higher education grants have been given in respect of institutes other than universities and for courses other than degree equivalent courses in non-universities. In 1974 the National coalition Government widened the courses available.  This Bill might have been introduced in the House before now to give legal effect to that change in policy. Certainly the 1968 Act should have been amended before now, because it is possible that certain applicants for higher education grants have been inadvertently refused though being eligible.  I understand that the Department may possibly be liable to a court action by any such applicant.  I had hoped the Minister would introduce a more comprehensive Bill than this but he has been busy in his travels.</P>
      <P>The importance of higher education in the overall economy is well recognised. The future development of the economy is linked directly to the availability of higher education, especially in the new forms of higher education we have seen develop in the 1970s, in the colleges of technology, regional colleges and in the National Institute for Higher Education. That is a very welcome and necessary development in an economy which is striving to industrialise and which needs a good reservoir of trained industrial personnel.  Therefore it is unfortunate that the qualification for eligibility for the higher education grants is so high. The estimates of participation in higher education are, to a certain extent, frightening.  In the Government White Paper on National Development, 1977-1980 it is estimated that overall there will be about 33,000 in higher education, which is expected to increase to 45,000 by 1981.  Dr. Sheehan, in a report by the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, has estimated that there will be 42,000 people in higher education by 1981, which figure will increase to 50,000 by 1986.  In the higher technological sector it was estimated recently that in 1977 there were approximately 7,000, that this figure will increase to 12,000 by 1981 and to 18,000 by 1986, depending on participation ratios.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> The provision of these places constitutes an immense problem and is a challenge to any Minister for Education. We all accept that places must be made available and education provided if we hope to meet the challenge of the 1980s in education generally and certainly in technological education in particular.  In this respect the recent expansion of some third level places, particularly in regional colleges, is welcomed.  The tardiness in respect of the appointment of staff to these colleges is most unfortunate. However, I do not wish to go into that at present.  Delays of up to six months have been experienced which in some colleges have hindered the provision of parts of courses.  That is most undesirable.  The question of regional colleges administering a laid-down policy in respect of staff appointments would constitute a welcome development rather than relying on the present, very narrow sanction system operated by the Department.  If we are to have population involvement and participation in higher education, if we are to provide the places necessary, we must ensure also that there is open access to everyone both to universities and colleges of technology.  There is reason to believe that, for economic and social reasons this access has not been available to people in the less well-off sectors of the community.  I firmly believe that in order to have an equitable policy in relation to participation in third-level education there is need for reassessment of our approach in respect of the giving of grants both by vocational education committees and by the Department in respect of the higher education grants.  The recent development of colleges being assisted by money from the EEC Social Fund is a good one.  I understand that we are one of the few countries in the EEC utilising this money and I commend the Minister in this respect.  I hope this development will be expanded on a permanent basis in the third level sector.  The Minister omitted reference to it in his speech. However, I should like him to comment on the possibility of making this EEC money a more permanent part of our educational system.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would make some comment in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> Access to colleges of technology is far more democratic than that to our universities where the points system is rigidly and inhumanly exercised by university authorities.  That is in sharp contrast to the entrance procedures of regional colleges, especially where the entrance requirement is a mere D level in the ordinary leaving certificate, accounting for approximately 50 per cent of the entrance requirement.  Then there is an interview conducted by departmental staff, lectures and so on, which equate to about 30 per cent of the requirement. Finally, in certain cases, there is an aptitude test which accounts for about 20 per cent of the overall entrance requirement.</P>
    <P>That is a more human and flexible approach in regard to the intake of students to colleges.  I appreciate that the large numbers involved in universities makes this more difficult.  Nevertheless they have an obligation to implement a more equitable system than their present harsh and impersonal one.  They have also the two honours requirement, which will now have to be based on one leaving certificate examination result.  This is very harsh.  It is undemocratic.  After all, we who are interested and involved in education like to encourage participation and here we have an example of our universities discouraging rather than encouraging participation in education.</P>
    <P>This is an economy where we are looking for qualified people.  It seems to me that the universities are on the wrong track.  It has come to my notice that applicants who have a very high points level are doing subjects they never intended to do.  Some students, because they have honours, are doing medicine or engineering and they might be more happy doing liberal studies.  This is a crazy system.  The Minister should involve himself in the evolution of a proper human application system in university education.  I am well aware of his sympathy in this matter.</P>
    <P>The relation of the higher education grants to entrance requirements is bad. At present one must have four honours in the leaving certificate or one must have Irish, mathematics and two other subjects.  I would like to see that being reduced because I feel that participation <Col N="610" /> in education should be encouraged.  The higher education grants should be more readily available than they are now and should be based on a lower academic leaving certificate result than is the case at the moment.  It would be easy for me to say that we should do away with the four honours requirement but I do not wish to make that kind of politics.  I know it is a costly undertaking but I suggest to the Minister that participation in higher level education is something we should encourage.  We should reduce the four honours requirement for academic eligibility for the higher education grants.  Perhaps over a period of two or three years one honour could be taken off and the second honour could be taken off the next time.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look seriously at the case of applicants for higher education grants who, because of income limits, are not eligible in their first year of application but after possibly two or three years the father or the main breadwinner may retire and the income of the family is substantially reduced. On the current income scale that applicant might then be eligible for a grant but the regulations governing the higher education grants scheme state specifically that the income eligibility of that applicant is based on the first year the applicant applies rather than on the current year's income.  That is very wrong especially when it is viewed in an inflationary period.</P>
    <P>A number of people have not been able to participate in higher education because of this.  This seems to be a mechanism to bar people from coming into the scheme rather than one which would encourage them to be eligible for a grant under the scheme.  The Minister should have a look at that clause in the higher education scheme which is very undemocratic.  It is &ldquo;civil servicism&rdquo; in the bad sense because it is designed to keep people out rather than to help people come into the scheme.</P>
    <P>The income limit is very narrow.  The maximum income is £3,400 for a two-child family.  The maintenance disappears when that income is £4,250, that is within a figure of £850 one is entitled to the maximum maintenance grant in an adjacent and a non-adjacent area.  One is <Col N="611" /> going from a maximum maintenance grant to zero maintenance grant in that band, which is too narrow.  A sum of £850 does not put a family in the position where the full maintenance costs can be borne.  A maintenance grant of £500 is not generous.  The band should be extended.  The minimum parental income to get the grant should be increased and all the other figures should be increased so that the overall band system is increased substantially in respect of eligibility for the maintenance grants and for college fees.</P>
    <P>I believe that basically because of the income limit the number eligible for higher education grants has not increased substantially during the past decade.  In 1971-72 there were 4,333 higher education grant holders.  This figure increased to 6,168 in 1975-76 and has declined to 5,848 for the current year.  It must be stated, contrary to what the Minister has said, that the income limits were effective in 1978-79 but the figure has declined substantially.  The Minister's much vaunted scheme has not become as effective as the Minister and those on this side of the House would like it to be.  We would like to see more people being eligible.  The revised scheme, which the Minister brought in with trumpet blowing, has not resulted in a higher number of grant holders.  I would like to know the number who got grants for the first time this year, which I believe is a significant figure.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about a comprehensive grants scheme, both maintenance and fees, we will have to tackle the question of income eligibility.  In the present context it is too low and I say this with due respect to people living in university cities.  It is very hard on people in other areas to afford the cost of keeping a son or daughter at university or a college of technology.  Some figures are available with regard to the cost of keeping a student in a university city.  The Union of Students in Ireland have suggested a figure of £900 for an academic year.  The greater part of that figure is based on the cost of accommodation, approximately £20 per week.  I think the figure of £900, <Col N="612" /> as suggested by the USI, is reasonable. It exceeds only slightly the figure of £875 mentioned in February 1977 by the Minister.  He seems to have hit the target with that figure.</P>
    <P>The present maximum figure of £500 is too low and it does not give any credit to the previous Government either.  I admit freely that they were negligent on the question of the proper development of the grant system for higher education. We should not be complacent about the scheme in operation at present where the maximum maintenance grant is £500. That sum is not sufficient.  I am not suggesting any figure and I have merely quoted a figure produced by the USI.  If the Minister considers that is too high he is at liberty to give us a figure which his civil servants estimate to be a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>Even if we had a maximum grant of £900, the income eligibility requirement would rule out many people because very few would have an income of less than £3,400.  Families who are not well off could not afford to send their children to third-level educational institutes and the Minister is aware of that. The widening of higher education to include technical colleges and the National Institute of Higher Education will make it easier for more people to obtain the benefits of third-level education but I do not know to what extent this will happen. The Minister should look at this matter constantly from a positive point of view.</P>
    <P>He should give serious thought to the income eligibility limit because many people are being kept out of third-level education even though they may have the necessary academic qualifications.  I am presuming that the Government are serious about third-level education.  Our current expenditure on education as a percentage if GNP is one of the lowest in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very unfortunate. Our capital expenditure on education as a percentage of GNP is extremely low for a developed country.  I accept that national resources are limited but we have access to European <Col N="613" /> funds and I am satisfied we are not getting sufficient funds from Europe to develop our infrastructure, especially our educational institutions.  In his reply today the Minister should tell us the volume of financial aid from Europe in respect of education which has been received to date and what is expected to be received in the next five years.  We must know what funds will be available from the EEC before we say we will provide extended third-level places and thereby widen the net for such education.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin area there is a severe strain on the availability of third-level places because of population increases. The census of population that will be taken next year will point this out very clearly and will tell us something we know already.  The delay in providing third level places in the Dublin area is a serious problem and the delay in establishing the NIHE in Dublin on a practical basis is unfortunate.  The wrangle between the NIHE in Dublin and the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee is something that I am looking at with a jaundiced eye.  I should like the Minister in his reply to explain his attitude in relation to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Why is it necessary for the VEC to announce that institute? Is it that there is such an absence of third-level places that the vocational education committee in Dublin city are obliged to establish their own institute? What is its statutory basis?  Has the Minister sanctioned that institute as a last resort?  Where will it hold those courses?  Where is the finance coming from?  Has it the Minister's blessing? Where does it stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> Bolton Street or Kevin Street Colleges, University College Dublin or Trinity College?  I must confess to being somewhat perplexed on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not detract from the fact that Dublin is crying out for an increased number of third-level places and is not getting them.  There was a suggestion of a number of regional colleges circling the greater Dublin area.  I would like to hear that serious concept debated in public.  I would also like to hear the Minister's views on this subject because the Dublin area is being starved of third-level <Col N="614" /> education and the pressure on existing third-level education is something nobody likes to see.  I would ask the Minister to refer to this in his reply.</P>
    <P>What will be an approved institution? What will we mean by ministerial approval for a course?  Will the Minister extend the present courses he considers suitable for higher education grantees? For instance, the present system does not recognise evening courses for education grant purposes.  That is unfortunate because the many people who cannot afford to attend day schools, but who avail of evening classes, should not be penalised for improving themselves.  I would ask the Minister to review his attitude to this matter.</P>
    <P>What is the position in relation to adult education courses?  We do not seem to be getting anywhere on this question of adult education.  There has been tremendous enthusiasm about it in vocational education committees and a great response from people who want to participate, but the provision of these courses is being stymied by the Department. The fees paid to teachers for such classes are hopelessly uneconomic.  That is appalling.  If tackled properly, adult education courses being provided by vocational education committees could be self-financing.  The Department's attitude to paying teachers to take these courses is shocking.</P>
    <P>There should be a mechanism which would provide adult education courses. Apparently we are not going to have an open university and therefore we must provide courses for the adult population at a number of levels, including certificate and diploma level as well as degree levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant that higher education grants be given to people attending such courses.  Because of a <Col N="615" /> lack of development on our part these courses are not available here, unlike England where, as the people in the multi-channel areas see, there is an open university of the air in operation.  A few months ago I saw a number of people receiving their degrees from that university. We are frightened to tackle these developments in education.  My own party were frightened to tackle them when we were in government but I hope this Minister is more courageous and will be prepared to tackle these vast desert areas in education.</P>
      <P>The whole question of adult education recognised by the NCEA needs to be looked at.  The NCEA document on adult education is interesting and deserves more attention than it received to date.  Why not have a comprehensive adult education course which would be recognised up to certificate or diploma level?  Why not have properly developed evening courses for people who want to participate in higher education?</P>
      <P>It is we who are lax.  We are the politicians. We are supposed to be laying down policies in relation to education. We do not do our work properly because we tend to react and look at the scene as it is now.  Because of the paucity of financial input into education from successive Governments, our education is not as developed as that in other western European countries.  That is the major fault.  Our attitude is one of defence.  We seem to be happy with what we have and shy off from any new developments.  That is the wrong attitude. It is not an attitude that is prevalent in Europe.  It is not an attitude that should be prevalent in this House and it is not an attitude that should be adopted by a Minister for Education in a party which has a majority of 20 votes in this House.  It is most unfortunate that we have this negative attitude to further developments in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be putting down amendments on he question of ministerial approval.  I do not see why the Minister should retain he right to approve or disapprove of any course for higher education purposes, if the university have a course which is acknowledged to be of <Col N="616" /> academic significance and for which there is an academic award or if the NCEA, when it is established as a statutory authority, recognises courses to certificate, diploma and degree levels.</P>
    <P>The NCEA will be charged with the responsibility of setting down academic standards and recognising academic achievements.  Other professional bodies which might not have a statutory basis, for instance, the Institute of Chartered Accountants might run courses but we will leave them aside and deal only with those courses which are recognised and awarded by universities and the NCEA. If they are courses which are worthy of recognition by the NCEA or the universities and are of two years' duration, then they should be approved for higher education grant purposes.  I do not know why the Minister is retaining unto himself the requirement of approval.  It is unnecessary and will take from the standing of the NCEA in particular. Why not let the NCEA approve the courses?  Perhaps the NCEA or the universities, having consulted the Minister, might declare courses to be approved for the purpose of higher education grants.  I will be moving an amendment to the effect that this should be left to the universities or the NCEA or perhaps some other professional bodies.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a question in relation to the administration of the scheme.  The 1968 Act was based on finances being available from local authorities to the extent that they were in 1968.  Of course, they have become smaller because of inflation. The administration of the scheme should be left to local authorities under the overall guidance of a scheme as laid down by the Minister and approved each year by him.  In relation to the renewal of grants, the delays which occur in having to deal with Dublin are completely unnecessary.  Why not establish a scheme and leave it to be operated by the local authorities?  The present scheme is cumbersome in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain the position in respect of applicants who were refused grants and who, under this Bill, are entitled to grants.  I should like to have the Minister's views on this and also on courses which are recognised <Col N="617" /> now in respect of the higher education grants scheme.  I should like to know whether he has under consideration the widening of the number of courses to be included in the scheme.  I feel that the number of courses should be increased to take into account the academic requirements of a number of professional bodies and institutes which are not presently covered by the scheme, where courses are of two years' duration.  We must encourage by way of grants participation in higher technological fields, including business administration.  The Minister must review the scheme and include a number of courses which are now on offer in some regional colleges. Such courses may not be recognised by the NCEA but may have been established by colleges in response to regional needs.  I have in mind one such course in a particular regional college. Such a course can be just as important an educational undertaking for the participant as a national certificate course or degree course in a university.  We may have to widen the scheme to include these regional courses which are not available on a national scale.</P>
    <P>Income bands within the present scheme are not sufficiently wide.  The participation rate in grants is not high enough and the problem of the lack of third level places is not being tackled.  I freely admit that my own party in government have not much to be proud of in relation to the development of the higher education grants scheme.  I say that in the context of what is now acknowledged, even by Fianna Fáil experts, as a period in which there was a severe economic recession generated by the oil crisis and the budget was seriously out of balance because of that recession. I am not bringing that up as an excuse but it indicates the difficulties of the period when the Coalition Government were in office.  It is a reasonable but not a full explanation for the lack of development of the educational grants scheme, apart from a minor improvement during the last year of the Coalition's term of office.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will be more involved and more courageous in reviewing and widening this scheme, in making it more attractive and encouraging <Col N="618" /> more involvement.  I would hope that the increase to £500 in the maintenance grant will not be the last.  Perhaps it should be reviewed in line with inflation, although this would not remedy the present low maintenance grants.  It needs to be raised before being linked to the inflation rate.  We need a more courageous third level education policy.  We cannot afford delays in providing third level places if we are to succeed in the eighties in making Ireland a more complex industrial society.  If we are to have the expected higher participation, we must provide the places.  This Government are not spending the money, either current or capital, which is needed for this national priority.  The challenge ahead of the Minister and the House is a complex one which is not now being met.  The slowness in getting the NIHE in Dublin off the ground and in developing third level courses in the Dublin area, particularly in the universities but also in colleges of technology, is very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be assured he will have our full support in any measures he takes to provide these extra places. However, today I am disappointed because it seems to me his commitment falls short.  He will have my support in any positive measures he brings before the House and I shall deal with them in a constructive way from a merit point of view.  The Bill before us is not enough.  It does not make higher education attractive or give the impression of wishing to involve more people in higher education It merely extends an inefficient system. Let us hope the approach over the next three years will be more constructive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make just one very brief comment on one of the remarks in the interesting and, if I may say so, wide-ranging contribution by Deputy Collins.  It is in reference to his complaint about the apparent unwillingness of the EEC to give us sufficient funds to build up our educational infrastructure. In all conscience is it not surprising that they are not giving us any extra money for our educational infrastructure when they look at what we are doing with the money we have got? The chief sufferer from the policy pursued <Col N="619" /> is, of course, the Minister for Education and he will be even more so in the years that stretch from this point out to the next general election.  I believe he is already feeling the bite so far as he and his Department are concerned and things will probably get worse before they get better.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but with some bewilderment, and this for two reasons. The first is that it is such an insignificant thing in itself.  If I might comment in the language the Minister appears to prefer from time to time: <i>Laborant montes et parturiunt ridiculus muis.</i></P>

      <P>The second reason why I greet the Bill with some bewilderment is that its appearance at this time is in direct contradiction to the Minister's, his party's and the Government's own declared scheme of priorities for educational legislation.  At page 41 of the manifesto, paragraph No. 9 of the section dealing with education reads:</P>
      <P>Will immediately establish NCEA by statute and introduce legislation for the new universities.</P>
      <P>The Minister, speaking at the Union of Students in Ireland Annual Congress in Wexford on 14 January last, said:</P>
      <P>Beginning with the legislation for the NCEA, which I hope to introduce at the earliest possible date, I propose to introduce Bills for the NIHE, Thomond college and the new universities in turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospect of any of this legislation, including legislation promised immediately more than 18 months ago, is receding with the speed of the jumbo jet that carries the Minister to any one of his numerous foreign destinations.  We <Col N="620" /> all know of a time honoured political practice whereby factories are opened by different Ministers of different administrations twice, but I have rarely heard of the same exhibition being opened by the same Minister three times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would only comment that, unless the Minister's pronounced sense of aesthetics is overtaken by his sense of politics and economics, we cannot hope for a great deal of action in the administration of the educational area.  It is true this Bill is needed and the reason why it is needed is because of a fundamental deficiency in the Higher Education Grants Act of 1968 introduced by a Fianna Fáil administration. That fundamental deficiency confined effectively the award of higher education grants to students pursuing courses at degree level in universities and other institutions.  As there were in 1968 relatively few institutions outside the universities providing courses to degree level it was inevitable that one of the major effects of legislation should have been to increase the already somewhat over-inflated public appreciation of what precisely the universities were doing and inevitably should have increased the tendency of post-primary students to opt for university degree level courses rather than other courses, regardless of whether these courses matched their real individual qualifications or capabilities or, indeed, the economic and social needs of the country as a whole.  It is a matter of some importance that this situation was changed in 1974 and the Minister is, I believe, unwise, to put it mildly, to refer in somewhat sanctimonious tones to the delay in introducing the necessary amending legislation. To give the exact words he used, he said: &ldquo;These arrangements have been in operation since 1 August 1974 in anticipation of the relevant amending legislation.  This is not a practice which I would wish to condone or to take example by&rdquo;.  The Minister ended that sentence with a preposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Something up with which the Deputy will not put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from ending a sentence with a preposition, the fact is that the practice of establishing things without statutory authority and allowing them to continue for years before the necessary statutory instruments are enacted was pioneered, was followed and was condoned by successive Fianna <Col N="622" /> Fáil Governments.  This practice has already been referred to in the course of this debate especially in relation to the NCEA.  I am glad of the Minister's assurance about a timetable for the NCEA, because one would have thought that the graduates of that institution would be grandfathers by the time the thing finally arrived.  I do not say that this is altogether a bad thing.  It is much better that we should have had the NCEA even on a non-statutory basis than that we should not have had it.  But there is no call for the Minister to make this point about this amending legislation in the light of the record of his party in this area.</P>
      <P>The reference in the Minister's speech to the regional technical colleges somewhat misrepresents the situation. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The inclusion of the regional technical colleges for the purpose of tenure of higher education grants is also a commendable development for many reasons.</P>
      <P>So far as degree level courses are concerned the regional technical colleges have always been included under the terms of the original Act.  There is nothing particularly new about this Bill in relation to their inclusion for degree level course purposes.  Section 1, the definition section, in the original Act says that grants would be tenable for courses at</P>
      <P>... any other institution of higher education for the time being approved by the Minister for the purposes of this Act, either generally or in relation to any particular grant or class of grants under section 2 of this Act, in so far as that institution provides courses which in the opinion of the Minister are equivalent to university degree courses.</P>
      <P>If any Minister decided after the passage of the 1968 Act to recognise a degree course in a third-level college such as a regional technical college, he did not need this amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one development in this Bill to which the Minister did not refer in his opening speech, and I would be grateful if he would refer to it when concluding. <Col N="623" /> There is a major change in principle between the provisions of the 1968 Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act and this Bill in relation to universities.  In the 1968 Act an approved institution means:</P>
    <P>... a university or university college in respect of its courses which are of degree standard,</P>
    <P>The present legislation reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;approved institution&rdquo; means a university, university college, or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses of which the Minister approves for the time being, for the purposes of section 2 of this Act.</P>
    <P>The logic of that is that under the 1968 Act universities were automatically included in respect of any courses which they can which they declared to be of degree standard.  The implication in this Bill is that the Minister will have to make a positive administrative decision in respect of every university degree course which he wishes to designate for grant purposes.  Is that an accurate interpretation of the Bill?  Does the Minister intend to automatically designate every course which every university says is of degree level, or will he reserve the right not to designate such courses in any particular situation?  I do not know if the Minister will be attending the annual dinner of the Irish Federation of University Teachers this Saturday, but I shall be there and I shall be canvassing opinion on this proposition.  If the Minister would like the result of such a mini-survey I will give it to him in due course.</P>
    <P>A third reason why the Bill as introduced is inadequate to some extent is that it does not effectively deal with the problems of the students at diploma and to some extent at degree level in the institutions concerned.  The size of this problem was graphically illustrated by the Chairman of the Higher Education Authority, Mr. Seán O'Connor, when he spoke at the conference on the financing of higher education last September.  Mr. <Col N="624" /> O'Connor said that at present there were approximately 33,000 full-time higher education places in the Republic and that to achieve parity of participation with our European neighbours we would require not 60,000 places but between 70,000 and 90,000 places over the next five to ten years.</P>
    <P>Another way of looking at the problem is to look at the participation rates for third level education in various countries in the western world.  The Irish participation rate in 1975 was 7.9 per cent, by far the lowest participation rate of any of the major countries, including countries which are about the same size and have more or less the same population as ourselves.  The next lowest participation rate, that of Austria, was double the Irish rate.  The highest participation rate, that of Denmark, a country with virtually the same population as us, was almost three times that of Ireland. That is the size of the problem.  The problem will not be met purely by housekeeping legislation of this kind, however necessary it may be.</P>
    <P>The numbers of students in different categories of third level institutions have shown very interesting changes over the last four or five years.  In 1973 there were 20,500 students in our universities and in 1977 there were just under 22,000, a rise of only 2,000.  In the regional technical colleges, where as the Minister says courses are generally of shorter duration, there were 1,200 students in 1973 and 3,500 in 1977.  The expansion is taking place in the regional colleges not least because the savage realities of the employment situation are forcing more and more students and their parents into an acceptance of the fact that by and large many of the courses in these institutions provide a better chance for employment than many of the courses in what were traditionally more prestigious university institutions.</P>
    <P>The proof of that, if proof is needed, is contained in a paper on engineering education which was read by a former member of the staff of the NCEA in Belfast in September.  In the course of that paper he pointed out, in relation to engineering awards, that in general the holders of these awards were securing <Col N="625" /> employment which was directly related to their fields of study and that national certificates and diplomas in engineering were regarded by students and employers as ends in themselves and not merely as stepping stones on the road to higher rewards.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the enormous pressure on third level places in the regional technical colleges at a time when the arts faculties in virtually all our universities have empty places this autumn.  We should be doing more to try to turn around the pattern of participation in third-level education.  It is a matter for regret that the Bill makes no significant attempt, nor any attempt at all beyond legalising a certain situation, to do this thing.  The Bill does not make any attempt to cope with some of the anomalies in the grant system which have been referred to before now and which the Minister must be familiar with.  It is a simple obvious and antisocial fact that as between two children who are entitled to admission for a particular course&mdash;for example in a regional technical college&mdash;one with lower academic qualifications will be able to take up a place on that course for the simple reason that his parents can afford to pay while another student whose academic qualifications are higher but below the level on which a higher education grant becomes payable may find himself unable to continue his studies because of this basic anomaly in the grants system.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with a number of other anomalies, and they do not all concern the regional technical colleges.  In the course of his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The relevant provision in the published grants schemes is that the candidate must have obtained grade C or a higher grade in higher or common level papers in four or more subjects or, alternatively, have obtained grade C or a higher grade in higher or common level papers in Irish and in two other subjects or in mathematics and in two other subjects.</P>
    <P>Have we heard anything from the Minister since he took office about the disgraceful anomaly whereby the universities <Col N="626" /> treat all the common level papers, with one exception, music, as papers which are not fit for the award of honours points for their points entrance system?  The Minister may not have direct control over this but he has substantial indirect control and influence.  I would like to see a positive statement of policy from him on this matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the scholarship schemes referred to by the Minister today.  I should like to ask him whether it is the case, as has been alleged to me to be the case of one local authority, the North Tipparary Vocational Education Committee, that they have not been allocated enough funds by the Department to allow them to award first-year scholarships this year.  They have to effectively allocate all their resource allocation from the Department to the continuation of scholarships which are already in train.  If the Department are going to rely to this extent on the scholarship scheme as an alternative to the higher grants scheme they will have to ensure that it is adequately financed at all levels.</P>
    <P>There is one special category of student to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  One of the basic ideas behind the foundation of the regional technical college system, and the foundation of the NCEA, was to create a system whereby students, virtually regardless of where they entered the third-level educational system, would be able to transfer between courses and levels until they found one which was appropriate to their own intellectual, academic, practical or technological abilities.  There is a real problem in relation to students who may, at the age of 15, 16 or 17, have gone into apprenticeships or trade or technical-type courses and who discover at the age of 20 when they achieve the level of qualification appropriate to that course that they are unable for very real financial reasons to transfer into continuation courses for which they feel suited and in which intellectually they are entitled to take part.  For young people of that age the choice&mdash;when I explain what the choice is the House will see that it is not a choice at all&mdash;is between a wage of £50 per week which they will get if they <Col N="627" /> abandon their education and go out into employment or a maximum grant of £500 per year.  That is not a choice for these people.  There are very few of them and their loss to the educational system is a loss to the country, our economy and, of course, a personal loss to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look as favourably as he can at this special category of students in need.  The problem to which this Bill seems at first reading to address itself is not one with which it really copes, and that is the problem of devising now, after a decade of experience, a radical alternative to the present system of student financing.  The Minister has already informed me in the course of a reply to a Dail question that such a study is under way and has virtually been completed by the HEA.  If we give this Bill a relatively speedy passage, as I imagine we will, it is not because we believe that it will make any difference to the problems I have spoken about.  It is in the hope that this radical overhaul and reappraisal of the system which is due after a decade will be carried out by the Minister and will have action taken on it by him in the period of his administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Collins for his reception of the Bill and for his helpful comments on a wide range of third-level topics.  He mentioned the fact that the Ministers of the National Coalition had not come into the House with a Bill to get this power to spend money on grants for non-university courses.  I would emphasise &ldquo;courses&rdquo; more than anything else, because what we are really trying to do with this Bill is legalise the payment of grants to two-year courses with particular reference to regional technical colleges.  I know the reason they did not come with such a Bill&mdash;there was not one single piece of education legislation put on the Statute Book from 1973 to 1977&mdash;the unfortunate Ministers could not face the House because their colleagues in government, neither in the Fine Gael nor Labour Party, had a commitment to education; they just could not come in <Col N="628" /> with one hand as long as the other with this Bill, and that was that.  They were ashamed to come in with this little Bill when they had no news for the students by way of improvement of grants or of eligibility limits.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins quite correctly said we have a serious task ahead to cope with the provision of sufficient places for third-level education.  He used the word &ldquo;frightening&rdquo;.  I do not know whom it is supposed to be frightening, because it does not frighten the Government.  The Government know it is a very heavy task and are quite confident they will be able to deal with it and provide the necessary places.  The whole thrust of the Fianna Fail policy with regard to education was to increase opportunities for participation particularly for those at the lower end of the social scale, and we can be proud of our record in this regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins mentioned also the European Social Fund grants.  They are grants for training.  I did not mention them in my speech because there is a clear distinction between scholarship and this type of grant.  I want to put on record in the House that, in the technological sector&mdash;using the word in its widest sense&mdash;there is aid to over 40 per cent of the people whether from the Department of Education or the Social Fund.  With regard to the strong emphasis laid on the idea of four honours&mdash;or three if one of the three is Irish or honours mathematics&mdash;that, in so far as the scheme on scholarships applies to regional technical colleges, or other technological colleges the scholarships may be enjoyed by a pupil without any honour at all, in certain cases, again depending on the area chosen by the student concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather surprised at any mention of grants and income limits.  Deputy Collins did say that the National Coalition Government were remiss in this regard. In all fairness to myself, I must say that I have not been remiss and that, at maximum, I have increased those grants, in a time of falling inflation, by 66 and two-thirds per cent.  That is a substantial increase; I paid 66 and two-thirds per cent at maximum more than my predecessors were paying.  I want to point out also <Col N="629" /> that, with regard to the eligibility limits &mdash;and I will give the figures&mdash;at the lower end of the scale I increased it by 29.5 per cent and, at the upper end of the scale, I made an increase of 21.4 per cent.  I am not doing this by way of buaileam sciath&mdash;in fact I would not have mentioned it&mdash;had not both Deputies who spoke referred to this aspect of third-level education.  I want to put on the record that I paid 66 and two-thirds per cent more at maximum for higher education grants and increased the eligibility, at the lower limit, by 29.5 per cent&mdash;which is the important end of it really&mdash;and 21.4 per cent, again a substantial increase at the other end of the scale.  I might point out to the House that, as a result of this, there is an estimated increase of grant holders from 1,380 to 1,600&mdash;again a substantial increase&mdash;as between the academic years 1977-78 and 1978-79.  I should emphasise that it is estimated in so far as the academic year 1978-79 is concerned.</P>
    <P>To continue to take up some of the points Deputy Collins mentioned&mdash;I have referred already to the European element&mdash;I think that the Social Fund people are very chary about the education label being attached to whatever aid they are giving in the technological sector. I think they insist that the important word is &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  I know Deputy Collins is chairman of Waterford Regional Technical College, that he is aware of these delicate nuances, and we do not want to upset any inflow of funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is my opinion; I am fallible.  Deputy Collins was wide ranging at that stage&mdash;mentioning the <Col N="630" /> National Institute for Higher Education Dublin&mdash;and asked me to say something about it.  The House knows already that I am committed to the establishment of the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin, that we are proceeding with stage one of the building programme and that the other stages will follow thereafter.  He referred also to the Dublin Institute of Technology in terms that puzzled me&mdash;in fact I expressed that opinion while he was speaking-when he asked what statutory basis it had.  I understand that it is the work of the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee. I see no conflict between that and the idea of a National Institute for Higher Education.  I understood the Dublin Institute of Technology was organised in order to rationalise and better organise vocational education in the city of Dublin.  That is my understanding of it.  I am not aware of any conflict in that particular field.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of third level places in Dublin, which was referred to by the Deputy, I can assure him, the House and the country that the Government are quite confident that we will be able to provide enough third level places at university and technological levels and we are in no way frightened by the prospect.  We are not at this moment admitting that we will have any problem in meeting the demand.  It is very bad to talk of impossibility and our task being overwhelming because that kind of attitude does not make for creativity.  If the Deputy examines carefully the percentage of GNP spent on education, to which he made a passing reference, he will find that we are very much within the same band as the other members of the European Economic Community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins referred to the NCEA and to my retention of the power to designate courses in the Bill. When the NCEA approve a course that will be taken as a good indication by the Minister that this is a course which should attract a grant for a properly qualified student.  If I have time I will read a list of some of the courses that have been approved for grants.  There are other institutions, such as the Incorporated Law Society.  There has been a great outcry about increased expenses for people who want to study and qualify as solicitors.  That is one but that is not in NCEA territory.  There are other examining bodies and we have to retain some power in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am a little puzzled about the reference by Deputy Collins to students who did not get the grant because this Bill was not introduced and passed into law in 1974.  As far as I know, there are no such students but if the Deputy knows of any cases and brings them to my notice I will see if something can be done about them.  In regard to the question of new courses, as the Deputy rightly said, if the NCEA approve of a course that is a very strong indication to the Minister and the Department that that is one which should be approved of for grant purposes if a student chooses it.  I agree with the concluding words of the Deputy that there is a challenge but I also want to reiterate that it is one we are prepared to take up and deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan referred to a defect in the 1968 Act and said that that is what takes us before the House today.  I would like to remind him that this was the Act which for the first time brought a grants system into the country.  It was an Act in accordance with the social and educational principles on which our party have acted since its foundation. The Minister for Social Welfare referred to this at the end of the previous debate. It was out of that same philosophy and the desire to extend technician and technological education that the regional technical colleges were established by a Fianna Fail Government and it was their establishment which caused the amendment to this Act.  It is as well to put that on the record.  I am not particularly keen on the buaileam sciath bit but it is important <Col N="632" /> to put it on the record when some of those principles are challenged. I would like to say, as far as Deputy Horgan is concerned&mdash;I have told him this already&mdash;that he had a period in Seanad Eireann when many educational problems could have been brought to the notice of Ministers and between 1973 and the middle of 1977 not one single motion to improve grants and to improve eligibility limits came from him in the other House.</P>
    <P>I may deal with the participation rates in various countries later on.  I have not the exact document from which Deputy Horgan quoted but when it is available to me I am prepared to comment.  I want to reiterate that if the Members of the House want any kind of firm information on this, if they examine the percentage of GNP spent by me on education and the percentage of GNP spent by the other members of the EEC they will see that we are not all that much out of line.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan said that he was informed that the Tipperary North Riding Council did not have enough money for those who qualified for first year scholarships in that area.  This is piffle because any local authority get the full amount of the money they require to pay such scholarships or such grants.  I do not know if it was grants or scholarships the Deputy was referring to.</P>

      <P>I did not make a big thing out of this matter.  I was constrained to bring this Bill before the House because there was a legal lacuna.  I do not think that I could be accused of resembling a mountain in labour about it.  I brought it in in low key and I did not attach any particular importance to it.  Both Deputies made a reference to the NCEA Bill.  I should like to tell the House that the Bill will come before the House as promised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few suggestions that the Minister might <Col N="634" /> consider.  The Minister stressed the necessity for autonomy for the institute when he opened the debate on this Bill. Perhaps he would consider granting more autonomy to the new advisory body for the same reasons that he suggested in the case of the institute.  He should have spelled out in more detail what path agriculture should take in the future.  He said recently that he is going to involve himself in a new educational deal for farmers, and for young farmers in particular.  It would be better if the Minister gave this job to the new body, indicating his own views and those of the House with regard to education for farmers.  Our top priority should be to educate our farmers.  To date it has been a very piecemeal operation.  There is a scarcity of places in colleges and lack of finance has meant that many young farmers, even though they qualified, could not take up the places.  Many have to pay for the courses themselves and this imposes a strain on them.  The Bill should give some help in this area.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a highly specialised operation.  We cannot continue the situation where the agricultural adviser was a kind of general practitioner. The advisers will have to specialise in the future.  In every area there will have to be a man dealing with cereals, a man dealing with beef and dairying, another dealing with farm accounts and so on.  This will be necessary in the era of new technology, coping with diseases and so on.  I should like to hear from the Minister about the finance available to the new body.  It all hinges on finance.  The new body must have sufficient funds and autonomy to do their job.  I have no doubt that they will be capable of doing an excellent job if they are given a free hand.  However, if they are under the aegis of the civil servants and have all kinds of restrictions imposed on them it is possible that their powers will have limited scope.  They should be directed by the Minister and by the Dail to look at the situation in agriculture and to consider the future. We are in competition in Europe with the sophisticated farming set-up on the continent.</P>

In this age of subsidisation, is it not reasonable for an island farmer to expect the same price for his products as his more fortunate neighbour of the mainland?

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Am I right in thinking that land acquisition has practically ceased? The Minister gave a warning some months ago that he intended to introduce the legislation mentioned in the question, and though I appreciate it will be some time before it is introduced, does the Minister appreciate that the warning given by him is being availed of by people who are not farmers at all, or who are big farmers, to buy all the land that comes on the market against the interests of small farmers, and that in the <Col N="641" /> vacuum now existing small farmers are at the mercy of the wolves?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention that the present continuing purchase of land by unsuitable people is a new phenomenon by any means or that it has arisen from any warning I may have given&mdash;the situation has been like that for some time.  We have indicated that we are taking corrective measures and we are getting on with it as quickly as possible.  On the Deputy's suggestion in relation to land acquisition, a reply to a related question on the Order Paper will dispose of that argument very effectively.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period 1970/1976 the average yearly intake of land by the Land Commission was about 24,800 acres.  Last year 29,800 acres were acquired and it is estimated that in or about the same acreage will be taken up this year.  It will be seen, therefore, that current land intake is well up to the level of recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already announced the whole position in regard to land policy is being examined by my Department and I hope to bring proposals to the Government before the end of the year.  Pending the enactment of new legislation the existing <Col N="643" /> land policy of the Land Commission continues to operate, but from now on there must be increasing emphasis on distributing the 70,000 acres of lettable land already in the possession of the Land Commission and on finalising the acquisition proceedings which are at present in progress for a further 54,000 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Officers of the Land Commission seem to have indicated that they have been finding difficulty in placing land to suitable allottees in recent years.  If so, does the Minister agree that this difficulty may have arisen because the price is one of the difficulties from the point of view of the smaller deserving farmers?  Will he agree that a second difficulty is that small farmers who would be entitled to and would be deserving of additional allotments by virtue of acquiring new land from the Land Commission would be increasing their poor law valuations and that they would cease to benefit under the Social Welfare Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that market prices of land have gone extremely high in recent years and that the rentals charged to allottees of Land Commission land consequently must be proportionately high, even in western areas where the annuity is halved.  On the question of smallholders acquiring new land and at the same time expecting to retain social welfare benefits to which they were formerly entitled, it is a bit illogical in my opinion to raise a man's acreage considerably and at the same time to say that he is in the same condition of inability to earn his living as he ever was and that his dependance on social welfare benefits is the same.  This cannot be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if in the western areas such farmers have to pay only half the annuities, is the Minister aware that during the currency of these high cost repayments allottees are unlikely to be any better off for a considerable time despite their increased PLV?  In addition to spending money on getting employment in other ways, has serious consideration been given further to subsidise <Col N="644" /> the acquisition of land for distribution among congests so that we will retain them in the jobs they know best rather than put them on the labour market and seek to find alternative industrial employment for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy at the same time is seeking further subsidisation for a particular class of allottee it must necessarily mean that no matter how big the overall Vote for the Land Commission or the Department of Agriculture is, fewer people will be catered for than would otherwise be the case.</P>

      <P>Redundancies in manufacturing firms can be caused by various factors, including rationalisation measures, technological changes, changes in market demand, a fall-off in demand due to cyclical conditions and general economic recession, low productivity, industrial disputes, weak management and poor financial control.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the precise representations to which the Deputy is referring but it is correct to <Col N="647" /> say that trade unions have made representations to me and to my predecessor on a number of occasions in recent years about the levels of imports of textiles and clothing.</P>
      <P>As a result of our treaty obligations, in particular those arising from our membership of the Common Market, we are no longer free agents in the matter of imposing import controls.  It is not open to us to introduce import restrictions in relation to other member states of the EEC, which are the main source of imports of textiles and clothing.  Safeguard measures in relation to third countries are also a matter for Community action under the Treaty of Rome.  The Community, through bilateral agreements or autonomous measures, has recently imposed an extensive range of restrictions in the form of quotas or ceilings on all significant low cost suppliers of textiles and clothing.  These will in general apply until the end of 1982, and should introduce a degree of stability into the markets of the Community.</P>
      <P>The surveillance measures introduced by us in 1975, which still apply to certain textile and clothing products of third country origin, enable us to monitor effectively the flow of such imports.  During the present year we received authorisation on a number of occasions from the EEC Commission to restrict imports of clothing in &ldquo;free circulation&rdquo; in the Community, which we would otherwise have had to admit, outside of our quotas.</P>
      <P>An anti-dumping duty of 40 per cent introduced in 1975 in relation to ladies' shirts and blouses of South Korean origin is also still in force.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the employment maintenance subsidy should help the textiles and clothing industries to be more competitive with imports.</P>

      <P>We have obligations arising from our membership of the Community but is the Minister aware that within the Community the temporary employment subsidy scheme operated in Britain at the rate of £20 per week per worker in this industry, compared with our £5 per week subsidy to <Col N="648" /> employees in our industry, gives a very unfair advantage to the trade in Britain, that we import their products and that taking the average basic wage of textile workers in Britain their imports here constitute a very big threat to the employment of the 30,000 people in the Irish textile industry?  What does the Minister propose to do about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not quite as the Deputy puts it.  The employment subsidy payable in Britain is not payable to all workers in a particular sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be payable to quite a small proportion of them.  On the other hand, under the scheme which the Government here introduced this year providing for the payment of £5 per week the subsidy is payable to all workers in particular sectors and therefore possibly may be regarded as more valuable to the industry in the sectors concerned than the British payments. It is probably fair to say that we were forced by the action of the British to introduce this form of subsidy, a form we do not like.  We have constantly pointed out to the Commission that the British temporary employment subsidy, because it distorts trade as between Community countries, appears to us not to be in accordance with the spirit or letter of the treaty.  The present position is that the Commission have given a directive to the British that they must bring their subsidy to an end at, I think, the end of March 1979.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that even a small proportion of British industry, if their imports are coming to this country, could equal the entire extent of the Irish industry?  To that extent they are in a superior position. I do not wish to make it a question of the superiority of our subsidy versus theirs; theirs obviously means more money per worker and an unfair position is posed by their imports here and the Commission has been unsatisfactory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It should be remembered that the great bulk of our imports of textiles and clothing come from other Community countries and that the effect of third country imports in these areas is not as great at all as is sometimes suggested.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if any leathers or leather goods are imported; the value of such imports; and if any of this imported leather or leather goods could be produced in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14 and 15 together. Leather and leather goods valued at £32.7 million were imported in the year ending 30 June 1978.  This excludes certain leather goods for which separate figures were not available, but the amounts involved in those cases would not be very significant.  During the same period similar goods to the value of £38.7 million were exported.</P>
      <P>In the physical sense, no doubt some of the leather or leather goods imported could have been produced in this country.  I take it, however, that what the Deputy has in mind is viable and economic production.  Because of the wide variety of goods made from leather, of the different grades and quality of leather and the varying and, in some cases, conjectural market prospects, it is not possible to make any realistic estimates along the lines requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In regard to the export of hides, it should be mentioned that the Irish tanneries have not been complaining of any shortage of hides.  The significant imports of leather are attributable to the fact that the main Irish tanning group concentrate on the export market in the interests of maintaining long production runs, which, in their judgement, offer the best prospects for successful trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Import statistics are kept under continuous review by the State agencies concerned, as part of their continuing <Col N="651" /> research to identify products which might form the basis for successful Irish manufacturing enterprises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister whether we send out untreated or unprocessed hides, probably at very bad prices to the value of something in the region of £7 million?  In all probability we import some of the finished leathers that have been manufactured and processed from the hides we have exported. Has any realistic appraisal been made by the Department or any other agency to see whether we should not be seeking to utilise this raw material emanating from our meat factories in a much more realistic way with greater benefit to ourselves and the Community as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given the import and export figures to the Deputy.  Exports of leather goods exceed significantly the imports.  We do export hides but not, I think it fair to say, at very bad prices.  Those hides could be processed here if the tanneries concerned felt that there was any market for them. Unfortunately, that is not the position at present.  The leather market in Europe is in a weak position currently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a virtual monopoly in the taking up of hides and it may well be that this monopoly, like many others, is to the detriment of the Community as a whole in the development which might take place if there was little more freedom in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the taking of hides is concerned there is one main group who have a number of factories. In regard to dealing in hides there is no monopoly.  Numerous firms are engaged in that trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are sending out hides which are being stored in warehouses and distributed to tanneries in the European Community and elsewhere, and we are buying some of the finished leathers from which we make the goods quoted here in the £38 million exports that the Minister talks about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one supplementary question.  Is it not true that the whole problem stems from the fact that South American countries do not allow the export of raw skins and hides, referred to by Deputy Blaney, to EEC countries including Ireland?  Is this not the kernel of the problem?  If so, what do the Government propose to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that three of the larger South American countries do not allow the export of hides from their countries.  The result is that hides are sold to tanneries in those countries for little or nothing to the detriment of the cattle producers.  Those hides are, in turn, processed into leather which is being sold on the European market at extremely low prices with which European producers cannot compete. We, in common with several other governments in the Community, have over the past number of months, since <Col N="653" /> this situation became clear, made very strong representation indeed to the Commission&mdash;who are the only people who can do it&mdash;asking them to take steps to control the import of this cheap leather which is distorting the market in the Community and which we and the Community generally feel is an unfair form of competition for Community tanneries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the Government not immediately insist that an embargo be placed on imports of finished leather goods from the countries the Minister has mentioned if they do not allow us access to their supply of cheap skins and hides?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>No, the Deputy has got the matter wrong.  Irish hides are suitable for processing into only certain types of leather and for manufacture into certain types of leather goods.  We have to import those.  It should be borne in mind also, as I pointed out at the <Col N="654" /> start, that our exports of leather goods exceed our imports considerably.</P>

      <P>This morning I had a meeting with a deputation from Dublin Corporation on these matters.  One of the difficulties encountered by the IDA is the virtual impossibility of getting sites in central Dublin.  This morning's meeting was useful in seeking to identify ways of overcoming that problem. Notwithstanding the difficulties involved, and the extremely high costs involved, the IDA have now acquired some sites and are in the process of acquiring some further sites in the central parts of Dublin city.</P>

      <P>Quite apart from the current water shortage difficulties, is the Minister aware that only the western sector of Dublin is suitable for heavy industry? Will he consult with the local authority to ensure that these areas will be brought into service?  Apart from some light industries around the periphery of the city, heavy industry cannot be brought into Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that for many years the policy of the IDA, which I suppose seemed enlightened at the time, was to discriminate in favour of western and other areas which were said to be under-developed, to the detriment of the inner city of Dublin, does the Minister believe the time has come for the IDA to reverse that policy and to discriminate very positively in favour of parts of Dublin city which have a very tragic rate of unemployment?  The Minister referred to the difficulties encountered by the IDA in obtaining sites in Dublin city.  Would he turn his mind and the minds of his colleagues to the fact that there are at least 200 acres of derelict sites in Dublin city about which nothing is being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that at no stage in their existence did the IDA ever discriminate in favour of or against any area.  They never sought to force the promoter of any proposed industry to go to any particular place.  They gave varying levels of grants in varying parts of the country.  For the past two years or so, as a result of the situation which had arisen in Dublin in 1976, Dublin was brought in line with the remainder of the non-designated areas.  That remains the position at present.  I could not envisage any situation in which Dublin&mdash;if that is what the Deputy is suggesting&mdash;would get higher rates of grant than other parts of the country.  In any event I do not think it is necessary, because Dublin has a very considerable natural advantage over most other parts of the country in the attraction of industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past year there have been two changes in the delimitation of areas designated under the Industrial Development Act, 1969. In April 1978 because of the unprecedented loss of jobs as a result of the closure of the Ferenka factory, Limerick city and its surrounding areas were designated for a period of one year; and in September 1978 it was no longer necessary to continue the designation of the Ballingarry area, County Tipperary, which was originally designated for a period of one year in September 1972 following the closure of the Ballingarry coal mines.</P>
      <P>So far as the Limerick area is concerned, continuing efforts are being made to promote new projects there and the employment prospects overall for this area are expected to improve.  There have been a very significant improvement in the employment prospects of the Ballingarry area, arising from the proposed re-opening of the Ballingarry coal mines which have an employment creation potential of about 160 by the end of next year, and the construction by Bord na Mona of a briquette factory near Killenaule, which has an employment potential of over 100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industries in all parts of the country are eligible to benefit from export sales relief and from a very full range of other industrial incentives.  However, projects locating in designated areas may receive a higher level of capital grant towards <Col N="659" /> the cost of fixed assets&mdash;in the case of a new industry the upper limits are 60 per cent and 45 per cent in the designated and non-designated areas, respectively.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority in consultation with the forest and wildlife service of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are engaged on a comprehensive study of the timber processing industry with a view to identifying how the maximum return can be obtained from our timber resources.

      <P>Is it true to say that there are approximately 800,000 acres under afforestation and that with the proper development of the industry, with the labour intensive input that would be involved, it could produce about 30,000 jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not sure of the acreage but the processing of the timber on a large scale is not a very labour-intensive industry as the preliminary results of the IDA study have indicated.  One of the most beneficial uses of our timber resources which will be coming available in the years ahead in considerably increased quantities would be to pulp it for the manufacture of paper.  That is a highly capital intensive operation with the capital involved being in the region of more than £100 million while the number of jobs involved would be quite few.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the necessity for specialists in the agricultural advisory scene.  I pointed out that we were dealing with a very sophisticated area with a need for specialists in all fields.  Let us look at the area of finance.  For the most part the farmer depends on himself for guidance as to whether he should buy additional land, spend a great deal of money on an expensive machine or if he should change his system of farming.  The time has come when our advisory services will have to provide advice for farmers, not the advice of a company or of a particular group, but somebody who is trained, competent and independent, who will be able to advise the farmer that, in view of his circumstances, of the soil type and so on, he should spend his money along certain lines and then spell it out for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmer may already have decided to do that but he would now have the benefit of expert advice before venturing <Col N="687" /> into what is very often an area of imponderables. When a farmer needs to borrow the advisory services should be in a position to tell him where the best finance is available because, as we all know, the rates of lending agencies vary from time to time.  The adviser should be able to prepare an efficient and businesslike case for the farmer before he approaches his financier.</P>
    <P>The structure of the advisory services has not lent itself sufficiently to encourage the enthusiastic adviser to forge ahead, to take the initiative and branch out into new fields.  If such an adviser were to let everybody know that he was prepared, over and above the call of duty, to advise, encourage and get farmers to adopt new schemes, that endeavour could be rewarded by a better promotional structure.</P>
    <P>The advisory service of the future will have to involve themselves in land use study in co-operation with local authorities.  Sometimes figures show that dairying is the best way of making money but obviously one cannot accept that as a broad statement.  Up to now these statements have been coming from the advisory services.  Even from one farm to another there will be variations. The adviser in a particular area will have to be able to tell a farmer, bearing in mind the type of soil and so on, that he is better off out of a certain type of farming. That is the kind of advice that will have to be given in the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to see our advisers having more liaison with the co-operatives and the companies.  In this new structure the Minister should have involved more co-operatives and companies.  Co-operatives and companies involved in farming have their own advisory services and do their own thing but obviously there is a great deal of overlapping.  I would like to see the advisory services helping companies and acting as procurement officers.  For instance, the adviser could sit in with the creamery manager or the manager of a food plant and find out what his requirements for the future will be.  Does he need a 10 per cent increase?  If he does then the adviser should go to the farmers and have the <Col N="688" /> right quality grown.  This is important.  In the short-term, the farmer may not be interested in the best quality because the varieties he is growing are more productive but in the long-term we will have to rely on quality to sell our products.  In the long-term it is best for the farmer to get the right advice, which in future will have to come from our advisers.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there is vast potential here for more production in the newer areas of food, especially horticultural products.  The institute and Erin Foods have been doing a lot in this area but I do not believe we have a sufficient number of experts who can tell us in the long-term what the potential in these areas will be.  To date, we have a stop-go arrangement in horticultural products.  This has a discouraging effect. The Minister of State knows something about that from his own area, and I will not go into detail now.</P>
    <P>The advisory services would need to be tied in firmly with marketing.  The Minister is making a mistake by not having more genuine commercial people on the board because if we have the right people on the board, experts in their own fields of marketing, processing, and production, then we will have a board that will be competent to pass the word along the line.  This is something which is lacking.  Very often we produce something because there is a factory in an area and food is often produced because of a tradition in an area.  It may well be that our future lies in a different type of farming.</P>
    <P>Any board set up now should be competent to deal with growing problems, even the problem of land use.  With massive industrial growth in the future, we must look at the desirability of the acquisition of good land for industrial purposes. Lesser land would often be suitable for these purposes.  Once good land is under concrete it cannot be used again for agricultural production.  In the past reasonably good land was used for forestry, and this might be an opportune time to look again at that land to see if better use could be made of it.  The field is still wide open for the expansion of forestry in areas of poor land, but there are some areas in which I believe planting should not have taken place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> Agricultural advisers are dedicated men.  The evidence of their work is that Irish agriculture was in a position to take its place in the marketplace of Europe. We are very short of advisory help.  Far too much of the advisers' time is taken up in the office doing work which could be carried out by clerical staff.  Much work could be done by soil technicians. If a farmer wishes to know whether he should or should not spray a field he must rely on his own judgement or go to a commercial firm.  We need more technical experts who can give such advice. It is important that this advice should be available to farmers within a matter of hours.</P>
    <P>There was a misunderstanding between the Minister and myself regarding the money available in Cork.  I have checked on this and it is true that we are still short of money for advisers. We were holding a little fund to pay men whom we have already employed but who are not yet free to come to us.  The adviser in my own area is covering a vast territory and it is completely impossible for him to give the service he would like to give.  We are looking for two additional advisers but we do not have the money to spare.  The new board would be worth while if they did nothing else but put more men in the field.  They must realise the urgent need for more trained personnel to give advice on the various aspects of farming, and I hope that sufficient funds will be made available for them.  It might be possible to get from abroad the funds necessary for a first-class advisory service.  The EEC tell us they are prepared to help in deprived areas and in the field of social welfare but they are very inconsistent because, while saying they are prepared to help, they are trying to prevent us from producing more milk.  Their latest directive encouraging farmers to move out of dairying is disastrous.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is an area in which jobs can be created.  For years the Farm Apprenticeship Board have been training people but we now find that they have not enough funds.  That money should be provided forthwith.  More advisers should be put in the field to direct farmers along the correct lines.  The Minister of State should ensure that <Col N="690" /> farms are brought up to a proper acreage so that people can make a living. All this can create employment not only on the land but in co-ops, transport services and factories.  Agriculture is our greatest industry and we are dependent upon it whether we like it or not.  We have small resources of minerals and offshore gas and oil, but the real wealth of this country is the first nine inches of soil.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear in mind some of the constructive suggestions we have been making.  We now have to face up to the autonomy of the institute.  Why not give more autonomy to the new body?  It is being financed by State funds and so we should have supervision but the same applies to the institute.  They too have to rely on funding from some source or another.  Is it that we trust the one and do not trust the other?  I cannot accept that.  I ask the Minister to give the new body autonomy and let them do what they think they should be doing, as in the case of a commercial operation such as the Sugar Company.  Only then will we get results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill has afforded Deputies an opportunity of discussing not only the merits of what is contained in the Bill and its relevance to the needs of the agricultural community but also the present position of agriculture, its needs and its potential for further development. Deputies on all sides agree on the importance of a thriving agricultural sector and the contribution that sector makes in developing and expanding our economy.  Opposition Deputies may be critical of the policy-making end of agricultural development on the one hand and the operation of schemes and programmes on the other, but none can deny that great progress has been made in recent years.  Our farmers have shown that, given the right climate for development, they are capable of producing the goods.  Our entry into the EEC has opened up new horizons for them, made available markets that were never there before and in most cases has given them guaranteed prices for their products. But, in spite of all these pluses, there is <Col N="691" /> still a significant gap between the potential and the actual.</P>
      <P>Agricultural training, which was neglected to some extent in the past, is of vital importance to all farmers, particularly young farmers, in order to prepare them for the competition they must meet from their European counterparts. Until recently farmers depended mainly on their own practical experience and that of their predecessors to guide them in how best to work their farms.  I say &ldquo;work&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;manage&rdquo; because that is what most farmers did without considering seriously the results of their endeavours.  Perhaps this was due to the lack of adequate incentives. But no longer is this true.  Farmers have the incentives today.  They have the markets and it is up to them to avail of them.  Farmers must, of course, use modern techniques to achieve results. Young farmers must decide if their present farming systems are best suited to their circumstances.  The farm organisation scheme aims to help farmers plan their farming and to provide them with an income comparable with that of people working in industry.  I would hope that with proper training and education and given the right incentives more and more farmers would reach the comparable income and become development farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and most essential requirement for an efficient agricultural industry is a well trained and well informed farming community.  To get the best returns from their labour and investment farmers must have a sound grasp of the business end of their work as well as the skill to use modern techniques. This is true regardless of what system of farming a farmer is involved in, let it be dairying, tillage, sheep, or whatever.  It has been said time and time again that in future the farmers may have to rely on greater productivity and more efficient use of the resources they have in order to increase their incomes. Greater use must be made of the advisory service and our efforts in the research area must be constructive if we are to achieve the standards and keep <Col N="692" /> abreast of the pace being set by our counterparts in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House will have the function of providing the services required in agriculture and making available the scientific and practical knowledge required by the agricultural industry.  One of my reasons for welcoming this new Bill is that it provides for the retention of An Foras Taluntais as a separate entity.  Of course, I also welcome the extension of the scope of the activities of An Foras Taluntais to include basic veterinary and cereals research.  Those who hold that research must be conducted in a rarified and isolated atmosphere, detached from reality, will not find me among their ranks.  We require our agricultural research to be of a practical rather than a theoretical nature and we require results to be transmitted in realistic terms back to the producers and the processors to provide for the increase in productivity and added value so essential if Irish agriculture is to maximise its contribution to our national economic wellbeing.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that it is necessary for research to be conducted in a proper environment and An Foras has now the benefit of some 20 years in the field of research.  During that period it has built up a <i>corpus</i> of experience in research problems, in its approach to problems and in the discipline of applying itself to research projects to the extent that it is now a premier institute with considerable international repute.  By transferring the basic veterinary and cereals research functions to An Foras in its independent capacity we are not only providing an improved environment and a broader base on which to operate but we are also ensuring an interchange of expertise and allowing for the multi-discipline approach so essential if research is to be tackled in a comprehensive and realistic manner.  For example, research into calf mortality is not a matter for the veterinarian at the moment. This type of work also requires input from the husbandry expert and, perhaps, the geneticist.  To be successful it calls for team effort.  Similarly, in the case of meat, it is not sufficient to concentrate <Col N="693" /> research resources on the production of a high class animal and to ignore the need for improving the texture of the meat, the best cuts and the best possible disposal of the slaughtered animal through efficient processing and packaging. If An Foras Taluntais were to be subsumed into a body such as the National Agricultural Authority, which had responsibility for agricultural advice and training in addition to research, not alone would it lose its identity, its standing and its independence but, more importantly, it would also lose its objectivity. The advantages to the research area would, I believe, be such as to stifle completely the initiative and undermine the morale of those engaged in that area to the extent that it would be found necessary after a few years to revert to the arrangement which, luckily, this Bill will now bring about.</P>
    <P>In a National Agricultural Authority situation the research effort would be diluted.  Its importance would be relegated and resources would be diverted to more short-term applications. The fact must be accepted that, of its very nature, research cannot always be successful and those engaged in research often have to follow many false trails and persevere through failure.  Success, when it comes, takes time.  Considering the greater immediacy of the other areas to be catered for in such an authority, who could blame those involved if they adopted an attitude that research can wait?</P>
    <P>My second objection to having research in the same parcel with training and advice is of even greater importance, and relates to the need for objectivity and independence within the research area, when deciding on programme and priorities.  Deputy Bruton is reported as saying that research must relate to production needs.  I agree fully with him in this but I do not agree with his conclusion that this is an overriding reason for amalgamating An Foras with the advisory service.  Quite the opposite is the case. This is a relevant factor for keeping the two separate.  Research requires specialisation, it can also be costly having regard to the need for special equipment <Col N="694" /> or facilities and it can involve a different time scale to other types of work. Because of all this, programmes and priorities must be decided objectively without undue influence by any sector. In a national agricultural authority situation there would undoubtedly be undue influence from the other areas of the organisation on the orientation of research programmes.  Apart from the lack of objectivity in deciding on research priority, what little research would be carried out would more than likely be confined to the production aspect which, although of great importance, is not the only area of agriculture requiring research and development input.</P>
    <P>In this last quarter of the 20th century, the age of processing and packaging, it is not only necessary to produce a top quality basic product, it is also essential to ensure that quality is retained through the post-production process to the stage of final disposal.  With the ever increasing sophistication of processing and selling, and the strong competition at international level for disposal of agricultural produce, research into processing and the provision of alternative products is an ongoing and increasing necessity.  The result of this research will be seen not just in added value to the basic produce with consequent better returns and improved dependability of income, but it will also mean increased employment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Social research would virtually disappear under a national agricultural authority.  It certainly would not get equal consideration in the preparation of the authority's programmes.  In this context I draw attention to another vital factor regarding agricultural research.  The agricultural industry has on a voluntary basis donated very considerable sums to further the work of An Foras Taluntais and that is evidence of the confidence they have in that body, confidence in the usefulness of its research and the need to continue such work.  It would not only be short-sighted and foolish but it would be meaningless self destruction to dissolve the institute and to relegate their work to a subsidiary status in some other body where they would neither <Col N="695" /> have the confidence of the industry nor the investment to enable them to do a proper job.  The Agriculture (An Chomhairle Oiliuna Talmhaiochta) Bill will maintain the confidence of the industry in the agricultural research sector by continuing An Foras and giving them a more satisfactory financial operational base, in that they will have power to borrow and will also be able to use their endowment fund for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for what will be the optimum working relationship between An Foras and An Chomhairle. The provision in relation to common board membership will provide a formal basis for the improving relations between the advisory and training services and research.  I look forward to an expansion of this formal arrangement to the establishment of joint committees of the staffs of An Foras and An Chomhairle, or in the case of veterinary research of the staff of An Foras and the Department, to ensure the best possible co-ordination and flow of information between all those engaged in the industry.</P>
    <P>The structure now proposed is in the best interests of the farming community. It provides an opportunity of coordinating all the services in agriculture and will act as the cornerstone on which thriving agricultural industry will be built.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>):  This Bill deals with the most important sector of the economy. Its purpose is to make better provision for agricultural advice, training and research and for that purpose to establish a body to do the things which are set out in the Bill.  It has been said that the land is our most important asset.  We are scarce of raw materials, valuable minerals and that sort of thing, but we have the finest land in the world provided it is properly used, and worked in such a way that it will produce the maximum amount.  It is regrettably true that after nearly 60 years of self government most of the land is far from being in full production.  One has only to drive <Col N="696" /> through the country to see the differences between land that is properly managed and treated in such a way that it is producing its maximum, and land that is not being properly treated, that is being exploited to the full but is not being nursed or fertilised in return.  That unfortunately is the position.  If we look at the lot of the farmers over the last 55 years or so we will get the answer, because for the greater part of that period farmers got a very poor return for their efforts.  They were treated as second or third class citizens and were not paid enough for their produce.  They could not give their wives and children a comfortable living.  It is possible that the big farmers got a sort of a living from the land but the farmers with medium and small holdings were poor people indeed.</P>
      <P>Things have improved considerably since.  Part of our trouble for the last 55 years has been that we were dependent to a great extent on our neighbouring island as a market for our agricultural produce.  It was in the interest of that neighbouring island to arrange things so that the people living there would get their food cheap, but that was contrary to the welfare and interests of our farmers.  I do not begrudge our farmers any improvements that have come their way since, because they were long overdue. We have reached the stage now that many people are jealous of our farmers and begrudge them the improvements that have taken place.  Now, another type of small entrepreneur wants to enter into competition with farmers for land. Farmers who seek to increase the size of their holdings to make a viable unit find that they must compete against such people, the same people who 20 or 30 years ago when farmers had their backs to the wall and were standing between this island and destruction, could not be encouraged to look across a farmer's ditch never mind go in and try to make a living from agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the scene has changed, but we have a long way to go before our land is producing as it should be.  We need a lot more education, advice, training and research for our farmers before we reach such a happy state of affairs.  I <Col N="697" /> do not believe we will ever prosper from an economic or social point of view until every farmer gets the most out of his land.  It is a great pity that a Bill of this nature, which sets out to give farmers the advice and knowledge they require to progress, should have become a political football.  It should have been above political heat and political opportunism. A measure of this sort should have been an agreed piece of legislation, agreed between the Minister and the Department, the advisory service and the organisations which represent farmers.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the Bill was introduced in pursuance of an undertaking or a threat issued by the Minister when in Opposition.  His speech in introducing the Bill is littered with phrases such as &ldquo;as I said when the last Bill was introduced&rdquo; and &ldquo;as I undertook when in Opposition&rdquo;.  That was the theme of his speech, and it is unfortunate that the Minister on assuming office found himself committed to taking a certain stance, in regard to the 1977 Act before he had had an opportunity of consulting his officials or availing of any advice, advice which is not available to an Opposition spokesman.  I am not going to make a controversial political speech, but nobody can deny that the Minister was committed in advance to dealing with the 1977 Act, a piece of legislation which he violently and betterly opposed when it was introduced by Deputy Clinton as Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a pity for the agricultural industry that this was not debated above politics with all sections of the industry.  I believe I am correct in stating that the biggest change proposed in the Bill is to undo a provision in the Act which brought research, education and training together under one body and amalgamated An Foras Taluntais with the advisory service.</P>
    <P>I think I am also correct in saying that the former Minister had the agreement of the existing advisory service, the IFA and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Organisation in advocating that the proper approach was the amalgamation, as I put it, of all the services under the same body.  The only people who disagreed with that were An Foras Taluntais. <Col N="698" /> An Foras Taluntais have a vested interest in maintaining their independence apart and distinct from the other services. It would not be surprising to find An Foras Taluntais taking that stand &mdash;indeed it would be surprising if they did not do so&mdash;and they did.  The present Minister in Opposition, committed himself to undoing that if it was put through the House.  He has now introduced this Bill in furtherance of that undertaking and assurance.  I say that is a pity and is not in the best interests of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The next difference we find between this Bill and that of Deputy Clinton is that the emphasis in the present Bill appears to be on training rather than on education.  In practically every place the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; was to be found in the former Bill it has been struck out and substituted by the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; in this one.  Perhaps it is a fine difference; it is difficult to differentiate between them.  If there is no difference between education and training, if it is change only for the sake of change, if it is change only to present it here as a different Bill, then it is not so bad.  But, if there is real change, if the intention in the Bill before us is to lay emphasis on training, and if by using the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; there is meant only the perfection of existing skills as opposed to an education of the mind to a better approach or a different enterprise, then it is very serious and is to be deplored.  Training&mdash;if I understand it&mdash;means to train a man to do something he has already made up his mind to do, to train him in an existing skill.  On the other hand, education is the conditioning of the mind, the development of the mind to something.  Never before did agriculture need education, never before did the Irish farmer need to be educated to new enterprise than he does at present.</P>
    <P>If I am correct in my recollection, the Minister in his opening remarks said that to use the term education in relation to farmers was an insult to them and suggested that they were a lot of uneducated, ignorant people who needed to be educated.  That is not a good argument. If that is the only argument he can advance to uplift training and <Col N="699" /> downgrade education the Minister has a bad case in that respect.  In the EEC situation in which we are now competing intensively with the Danes and our other partners it is necessary that all young men taking up agriculture be highly educated in their profession and the work and lifetime of a farmer is as much a profession as any other activity.  It is absolutely essential that he be educated to the highest level.  That was why I intervened at Question Time the other day to inquire if there was no way on God's earth in which we could encourage young men who are educated in all our agricultural schools to go back and work the land rather than taking up much less rewarding occupations peripherally in agriculture.  If there are not sufficient places in Athenry, Ballyhaise and Gurteen and all the other agricultural colleges to accommodate young farmers who want to be educated there, to equip themselves to take up agriculture as a profession, more places should be made available.  In an age when we appear to be able to find money for this, that and the other thing, we could not spend it in a better way.  I thing additional accommodation is being provided at Ballyhaise. That is a good thing but there would need to be not half dozens, but thousands more places provided in agricultural colleges throughout the country, not to educate people to enter the advisory services, or the services of banks or lending authorities but rather to educate them to going back to their father's farms and producing double what their fathers produced; indeed even to trebling or quadrupling the production of their grandfathers.  That is what we need.  That is why education is so important. No farmer or farmer's son would be insulted by the offer of education. Before one can train a man to do something, to take on a certain enterprise, a different enterprise and train him in its skills, one must condition his mind to saying: &ldquo;what I am doing is not the proper activity or the most rewarding enterprise I could be practising on my farm; I am going to get out of what I am doing and get into that.&rdquo; That <Col N="700" /> is education.  That is not done in a mechanical way, rather it is done through a process of conditioning the mind.</P>
    <P>That is where I believe training and education are so very important.  I sincerely hope that the Minister is making the change from education of training merely for the sake of dressing up his Bill and making it different.  I hope education will still be regarded as absolutely vital in getting our farmers to indulge in and practise the best forms of agricultural husbandry available, ensuring that they will produce what is wanted.  Believe it or not, we are entering a situation in which prices will not continue to rise steadily; there has to be a ceiling some time.  What will matter then will be efficiency and quality.  The man who produces the highest quality in the greatest quantity will make most money and will get the best living out of it.  That is why what we are talking about these days is so important.  That is why it is such a pity it has descended into the political football arena.</P>
    <P>There is another change in this Bill as compared with that of Deputy Clinton. Under this Bill fees are to be charged for certain services which were not charged under Deputy Clinton's measure.  I do not know if the Minister for Agriculture has done that on his own accord or whether he has done it at the dicate of his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  I rather think it is being done on the instruction of the Minister for Finance. We know that recently the Government embarked on a policy of reducing and abolishing taxes.  They have to make up that money some way and I believe they are now embarking on a policy of charging for services which were formerly free.  The end result is the same.  People may argue that the commercial farmers are rich enough to pay for services and that they should not get them free.  That is a valid argument if it ended there but it does not.</P>
    <P>I believe that an administrative system under which one category of farmer will get services free and another category will have to pay for them will be cumbersome, costly and unworkable.  I believe that the amount of money which will be <Col N="701" /> collected in charging a small category of farmers for those services will be spent in getting this money in.</P>
    <P>I have another reason for disagreeing with charging for advisory services and so forth.  It will probably discourage a category of farmers who can best profit by those services.  Such men will not alone be poorer but the economy will be poorer.  My most convincing reason for opposing the proposal to charge for services is that since I was a child reared on a farm I have believed that the best way of educating a farmer and getting him to move from one type of enterprise to another, or getting him to do something in a different way from the way he had been doing it, was to see how the other way worked on a neighbouring farm. We had a system of pilot farms here and there around the country to demonstrate that a new way of doing things was the best way and that there should be a change.  I believe that example is the best way of educating and training.  If those services were left free farmers throughout the country would avail of them, and after getting advice on how to do things a certain way they would then do them that way and if they were successful their neighbours would follow in their footsteps and before long everybody would be doing the thing the new way.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that since the Minister introduced this Bill he has had second thoughts about section 12 (a) which sought to throttle the comhairle and place it at the mercy of the Minister for the Public Service in regard to the appointment of staff.  We know that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service is usually the same person.  The Bill, as introduced, differed from Deputy Clinton's Bill in giving very considerable authority to the Minister for the Public Service in regard to staff. The Minister has seen the light in regard to that proposal and has dropped it.  I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies.</P>
    <P>This Bill removes the guarantee of whether we had good times or bad times the comhairle would not suffer a loss of income in real terms.  The Minister thinks that was an insult to the <Col N="702" /> agricultural industry and showed a lack of confidence in the future of the country.  He said it was not necessary to give a guarantee that the money available for education, research and instruction would not be reduced in real terms and he cut that out.  He should ask the farming community, the advisory services and anybody else interested in agriculture if they would prefer the Bill with the guarantee that a Minister for Finance would never cut back on the necessary revenue or if they would prefer to be at the mercy of the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance, as this Bill places them.  There is no doubt what their answer would be.</P>
    <P>Where will the county committees of agriculture stand when this Bill becomes law?  What will their function be in regard to staff, advice and their general activities?  Will they have any powers? Will they become talking shops?  I know there is a section in the Bill to tidy up the method of electing county committees of agriculture and to eliminate fractions from the figure by which they are elected.  I would like the Minister to deal with those questions when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which I consider is very important.  I note from the Minister's speech that he considers that its main purpose is to detach from the operation of the Agricultural, Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977 the agricultural and research function, that is to detach them from An Foras Taluntais.  I welcome the changes in bringing the veterinary research and serious research within the ambit of An Foras Taluntais.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick considers it a pity that this Bill became a political football. I would generally agree with his view in this respect, but I cannot agree with it in this particular instance because there was a responsibility on the Government to reverse the situation.  The Government had to oppose it for very serious reasons.  It is also true that before the election Fianna Fáil made their views clear to the electorate in relation to this Bill and the measures proposed in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Bill proposed the abolition of An Foras Talúntais.  I ask why it <Col N="703" /> should be proposed to abolish or to subsume An Foras Taluntais.  If we look at the record of An Foras we must recognise that they were one of the success stories of Irish economic life.  If we look at the centres of An Foras Taluntais, in Fermoy where there is the dairy centre, Johnstown Castle, Grange Dunsany and Kinsealy, we will recognise that all of these centres and the many other centres throughout the country have shown a very high standard of scientific excellence with practical development and achievement associated with them.</P>
    <P>From the outset An Foras Taluntais set very high standards, showed tremendous dedication through the staff and personnel and have on record innumerable innovations that are of considerable importance to the industry. Not only were An Foras important at home in scientific achievement and developments but they also established a scientific standard internationally.  In addition to such a high scientific standard, at the outset An Foras established direct links with the advisers and producers, no matter what field they were in.  An Foras carried out quite a number of innovations, introducing &ldquo;open days&rdquo;, seminars and publications of various kinds to suit the needs of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>It is not as though An Foras Taluntais had ignored the producers or had been at a great distance from them.  In fact, they have always striven to be in close contact with farmers and the producers. If there is to be any criticism of the past, it should be levelled at those who prevented An Foras from reaching out to the most distant areas of agriculture and prevented greater development in association with the other services.  In this connection I speak from experience. I will not give examples but if anyone wants them at another time I will be happy to supply them.</P>
    <P>An Foras Taluntais were a unique body in many respects.  They were unique in combining research and development. The Opposition speakers have accepted that An Foras Taluntais was not an ivory tower.  The research workers did not take themselves away from the <Col N="704" /> practicality of the agricultural industry. An Foras developed a large scientific and technical staff and a tremendous body of expertise and knowledge.  Of course, after 20 years An Foras Taluntais need reassessment.  Of course they can do with a re-orientation.  Of course, there is scope for redefinition for the new intra-EEC needs of the agricultural industry. But there was never need for abolition.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the expansion and overhaul of the marketing arm of An Foras.  There is a need for the development of the food science and processing sector in relation to recent developments in the industry.  It is a fact that approximately only 10 per cent of our national budget on research and development is spent in the food science sector.  This area must be expanded urgently in relation to the needs of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to wonder what would have happened had An Foras Talúntais gone the road of the previous Bill and combined into a vast new bureaucratic body.  Studies were carried out following that Bill and I shall quote from one of them:</P>
    <P>It should be noted that integration of An Foras Taluntais with the advisory service in the proposed National Agricultural Advisory Education and Research Authority which will be primarily oriented to farm production problems could prove detrimental to the R. and D. output of the Institute and in this regard the food science and technology programme would appear to be at particular risk.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that it was not.  It is concerned with the assessment of the future needs of food science and technology.  I used it to illustrate the point that this is one of the directions that could have been influenced by the previous development of a broadly based institute in which the food science aspect and sector of the work of An Foras could be diluted.</P>
      <P>Research and development workers need stimulation but they also need freedom.  There is delicate balance between these two aspects in relation to research work because they are dealing with competitive innovation.  In my view this kind of work suits the semi-State type of organisation, especially when it is provided with links into farming, food science and industry.  It is essential that we maintain the links between research and development within the same organisation.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I consider An Foras Taluntais have made a valuable contribution in their present form.  I accept that after a period of ten or 20 years any organisation can do with an updating and reorganisation.  However, I think that the previous plan to divorce An Foras Taluntais, or to bring An Foras within this large body would have been disastrous.  It was an ill-conceived and ill-advised plan to abolish and subsume An Foras into this new vast bureaucratic organisation and for that reason I welcome the decision of the Minister to bring forward this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now fully in the EEC and naturally this alters the position in relation to our prospects and our future development.  Our gross agricultural output has increased by £1,023 million per annum since 1970.  Our EEC membership has given the expected opportunity for greatly increased production; but to get further benefit from the EEC and to make use of other markets <Col N="706" /> outside, we need higher production levels, new product development and more competitive marketing.  We have the land, the climate, the resources and the technology to make Ireland the food capital of Europe and simultaneously to develop a vibrant horticultural industry. If we are to do this we need a more dynamic approach to management, training and advice.</P>
    <P>If we look at some of the statistics prepared recently in relation to management and training in the agricultural industry, we find that in relation to existing farm managers in a national sample in 1974 only 21 per cent had special education in agriculture.  There were more on large farms than on the smaller farms.  In the category 15-30 acres the figure was 14 per cent; in the category 30-50 acres the figure was 22 per cent; in the 50-100 acres it was 32 per cent; in the 100-200 acres it was 39 per cent and over 200 acres it was 44 per cent.  The overall average of farm managers who had special education in agriculture was 21 per cent.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will let me continue with my speech I shall listen carefully to his contribution.  Only 33 per cent of farm managers had contact with the advisory services in the previous year.  Again, this was more common on the large farms.  In the 15 to 30 acre group, it was 16 per cent; in the 30 to 50 acre group, 37 per cent; in the 50 to 100 acre group, 49 per cent; in the 100 to 200 acre group, 63 per cent and in the 200 acre plus group, 74 per cent, giving an overall percentage of 33 of farm managers who had contact with the advisory services in the previous year.</P>
      <P>In summary, we find that only one farm manager in five had any education or training, if the Deputy prefers the two words in juxtaposition, in agriculture. Only one farm manager in three was in yearly contact with his advisers and only one in ten was working to a farm plan. In all cases the position was worse for small farmers.  That relates to existing farm managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> When we look at the position of new entrants, the national manpower survey shows that approximately 2,400 people enter farming as a career each year.  Approximately 370 students from the agricultural colleges go back to farms each year.  I appreciate the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick because he was appealing to young people with farm training and agricultural college education to go back onto the farms.  My understanding is that in recent years there has been an increasing trend for students to go back onto farms.  This is a welcome development and it is probably associated with the general improvement in agriculture since our membership of the EEC.  Taking the figures as a whole, 2,030 young people enter farming each year without any agricultural training or education.  Therefore, over 80 per cent of the new entrants have no formal training for the job.</P>
    <P>If we look at farm modernisation, we find the by now fairly well known statistics that up to 31 December 1977, of a total of 17,252 farmers classified, 4 per cent were in the commercial bracket, 16 per cent in development and 80 per cent in the transitional category.  It is the objective of all Members of the House to increase the number of farmers in the development and commercial categories, but the 80 per cent still in the transitional category indicates the size of the problem before us.</P>
    <P>In future the farmer will have to farm as a business, albeit a family business. He will be concerned with high capital inputs and high levels of technology.  He will be hungry for knowledge and will need better basic training, better inservice training and better advice.  In view of these statistics I welcome the Bill establishing An Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta.  I believe that the title is timely.  I believe it is timely to emphasise in an agricultural AnCo the desirability of training and further training within the industry.  If we look at industry in comparison, we find that almost 13,000 apprentices took courses in 1977, that 55 per cent of them were employed immediately in industry and that 80 per cent of them were employed within six <Col N="708" /> months.  We also find that the training costs of AnCo amounted to £12 million in 1977 and that the EEC Social Fund contributed 50 per cent of the training costs.  It is expected that 15,000 apprentices will be trained in 1978.  If we compare it with agriculture, we find that the colleges have 750 places per annum and that, under Directive 161, £286,117 was supplied from the Exchequer and £71,529 from the EEC.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating has been given permission to raise on the adjournment the question of the sinking of the <i>Cristos Bitas</i> and of the Government's involvement in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions to ask in relation to this issue. In the time that has elapsed since the difficulty first arose, particularly since the tanker was scuttled, it has become clear that there are a number of questions which have not been satisfactorily answered.  A number of organisations and many individuals have expressed dissatisfaction with the manner in which the matter was handled and with the shroud of silence surrounding it.  I am happy to provide the Minister with an opportunity of putting on the record the details of the case in question.  At the close of my remarks I will have a few questions which I hope the Minister will deal with in his reply.</P>
      <P>The dumping of a tanker of this size, and the philosophy behind it and the attitude of mind it reveals, to many people are most unsatisfactory.  It borders on an act of vandalism and in the normal course of events it is not any more justifiable than wanton dumping of any other material or any vehicle in any part of the country or off the coastline.  It does inevitable damage to our ecology and our environment.  It affects the civic standards we all want to encourage in our children and in our adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when a Government are <Col N="709" /> willingly party to an act of this nature they set a very low standard of civics and civic example, unless, of course, such an act has become inevitable, and I am not at all sure that this action was.  I do not think I need go into any great detail on the effects an incident of this kind has on the environment.  Basically, the impact of oil on marine and equatic life is major.  I am personally concerned about the effects it may have on the recreational and amenity outlets of many people in urban centres around the coastline.  Other members of my party are concerned about other elements of this major issue.  Therefore, I ask the Government to come clean on the whole issue by making a full comprehensive statement at this stage.  Such an incident has not happened before.</P>
    <P>The issue was raised by way of Private Notice Question by me on 26 October and in his reply the Minister indicated that he was satisfied that all necessary steps were being taken at that time.  That was before the unfortunate scuttling of the ship roughly half way between the point at which it had been agreed originally to sink it and where it eventually was sunk.  The Minister was quite clear it would be 500 miles from our coast and he based his complacency, if such it was, his happiness, that there would not be any environmental damage, largely on the basis that it was 500 miles from our coast.  I quote him from column 1407 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that 500 miles of our coast is on the Irish coast.  I studied this matter carefully and got all the expert advice that it is possible to get.</P>
    <P>Further on he said:</P>
    <P>As I have explained, it will be 500 miles from the Irish coast.  Even if some oil was to escape it would not affect our coast because of the distance between the dumping site and the coast.</P>
    <P>It is a reasonably logical consequence of that that if the distance of the dumping site from our coast were diminished to <Col N="710" /> any degree the Minister could accept there would be damage.  I want to know if he now agrees that a reduction of almost 50 per cent in that distance definitely increases the danger of damage to our environment and ecology in that area.  The effects of oil pollution can be summed up by quoting from a report on the environmental effects of oil pollution by Thomas A. Murphy:</P>
    <P>Oil is, gallon for gallon, if thrown out, the most destructive to aquatic life of all the foreign substances now entering our coastal waters.</P>
    <P>We must remember that this part of our coast has been the scene of a substantial amount of dumping in the past number of years.  It is reasonable to conclude that if the present trend continues this part of the sea will become the dumping ground of Europe.  Nuclear waste has been dumped near this place.  I understand that various chemical substances have been dumped there by some of our EEC partners.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that one of the few remaining natural assets which this country has, the environment, the quality of our waters and our general ecology, would be treasured and cherished by our Government as first guarantors of standards from this point of view.  I do not agree that it would be in the public interest or that the Government have a mandate to allow any deterioration of standards in this area or that they should in any way be less than 100 per cent vigilant and assertive about protecting the environment and the ecology.  I am confident when I say that I am speaking on behalf of the vast majority of our people.  Since this issue first arose I have not heard one individual expressing satisfaction at the manner in which it was handled by the Government.</P>
    <P>I will return to the Minister's answers in the Dáil on 26 October last when he expressed a degree of certainty and satisfaction, if not complacency, at the position.  It immediately became clear that all was not right despite the Minister's assertion that at no point would the ship come within 80 miles of our coast and that it would be towed 500 <Col N="711" /> miles away from the spot where the original discussions took place.  The ship went down very soon afterwards far away from the point at which it had been agreed to sink it.</P>
    <P>Another matter subsequently emerged as part of an alleged contingency plan. Attempts were made to represent the site in which the ship ultimately was sunk as being a better one than the first site.  I was most disappointed that the Minister was not forthcoming in his original reply, that he did not see fit to refer to any such plan in regard to the second site, knowing as he must have that this was a matter of extreme national importance, being of interest, among others, to the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and other such bodies.  At that time there was not a word about a contingency plan.</P>
    <P>I am now aware that not alone was there a second site apparently acceptable to the Irish Government but that there were almost an infinite number of points considered along a line from the first point at which the Dáil was told the ship would be sunk to the point where the ship was sent down, in other words, along a line joining those two points. That was apparently acceptable to the Irish Government&mdash;any point along that line, so long as it was a certain minimum distance from the coast.  Apparently an agreement was arrived at between the Irish and British Governments along those lines.  Such matters are obviously technical and I have neither the time nor the detailed information to go into them. However, I have been made aware by the British Agriculture Ministry that the agreement apparently thrashed out between this Government and the British Government was a lot more flexible and afforded a lot more room for mistake and was a lot less protective of the Irish coast than the Minister told the House on 26 October.  I believe that, whether by accident or design, the Minister misled the House on that day and that he owes it to us to tell us about the discussions that took place and the decisions arrived at.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ship itself, we have been given a figure of 1,000 tons of oil-cum-sludge as being the balance of the <Col N="712" /> cargo in the sunken vessel.  I now ask the Minister where the figure comes from and whether this figure has been verified by his officials through their tests on board the ship before it was sunk.  Is it the case that that figure was accepted by his officials from other parties who had taken tests, samples and so on?  My question is whether the Minister personally can stand over the veracity of that figure.  I ask this because a number of interests have put the point to me that there is considerably more oil and sludge in the boat than we have been told publicly.  If the 1,000 tons figure is as genuine and accurate as the reply given concerning the site, then perhaps those interests who mentioned this to me are accurate and that the Minister is not.</P>
    <P>At which stage did the second contingency plan emerge?  Was it there, and were other sites agreed, before 26 October, or did they arise suddenly over the weekend when the ship was scuttled?  If they had been there before 26 October, then the Minister gave us an incomplete answer.  I should like to know also whether the sinking of the ship was brought about largely by accident, or was it deliberate?  In other words, was it inevitable that the ship would have to be scuttled at that point?  If it was a deliberate act, in other words, if it was part of the agreement to sink the ship at any point along the line between the sites named Alpha and Bravo, then we have very firm evidence that the Minister was misleading the House.  If it was accidental, that also is extremely alarming because it means that the competency with which the whole affair was handled is seriously in question.  It means that the assurance the Minister gave the House about the 18 miles within which the ship would not come might not have stood the test at all and that the towing procedures involved, which apparently left something to be desired, and certain other means by which this whole affair was conducted were handled incompetently. If that incompetence existed, I am sure it is no reflection on the Irish Naval Service and the officers and men involved on the Irish side in the actual exercise on the sea.  I should be far more willing to believe&mdash;and I think the <Col N="713" /> evidence is there&mdash;that any incompetence would be found much closer to home if I pointed at the far side of the House.  The efforts of the men involved in the Irish interest on the sea have not been given sufficient credit and it may be timely to put that on record.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any idea whether the hull of the ship and the portion containing whatever oil resides there are in good condition?  How long will it take to rust and what will the result be when the oil inevitably comes to the surface?  Is there any monitoring of the wreck at present? What action will the Minister take if it becomes evident, as I believe it will, that oil will come to the surface?  When it does, it will inevitably come to shore because the vessel has been sunk in the path of prevailing winds and ocean currents which will mean that inevitably the Irish coastline will suffer.</P>
    <P>The essential point is that it is extremely difficult for the average Irish citizen to accept and comprehend why a Greek tanker, with a very dubious history, sailing with Ukranian oil, I understand, on business to and from the United Kingdom is now nestling off the coast of this country.  It will inevitably be concluded, unless the Minister can in some way contradict it, that the Irish Government in their handling of the whole affair were extremely weak, were not able to stand up to our European neighbours and point out that we did not need the ship, that we did not accept that dumping in the sea is a good principle <i>per se</i>, that we had no particular interest in the ship and no reason to accept it any more than any other country.  On the contrary, when we asked the Minister if he believed that other ports would accept the ship and what their attitude was, he gave the impression that he felt other ports would not accept it.  If that is so, I wonder why it was felt the waters of this country were adequate and that our people were entitled to inferior standards of environment and ecology compared with our European neighbours.  That is a valid and logical interpretation of the position because that is what would happen.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied either with the assurance the Minister gave us about his <Col N="714" /> capacity to supervise this matter.  I shall quote from inter-departmental environment committee report on pollution control issued just over a year ago.  In paragraph 7.7.2, where the capacity of the Government to contain and handle pollution threats at the present time is dealt with, the following appears:</P>
    <P>The existing commitments alone, not to mention the prospective increase arising from the developments referred to, are likely to prove quite beyond the monitoring and servicing capacity at present committed to relevant programmes in this country.  In this situation, and as vital national interests are at stake in the marine pollution issue, it is essential to develop a more formal and logical arrangement of Departmental responsibilities.</P>
    <P>It goes on to deal with other inadequacies of the Government's ability at that time&mdash;over a year ago&mdash;to handle existing commitments in regard to pollution. The many recommendations in that report, to the best of my knowledge, have not been implemented and it is reasonable to conclude that, if they could not cope with existing commitments a year ago, there is reason to question their capacity to handle the kind of threat which this ship brought into focus recently.</P>
    <P>To sum up, we have an issue here which is symbolic of an attitude to our environment and to civic standards which says that it is an acceptable thing to dump.  A famous Norwegian explorer once said that we cannot push our pollution off the edge of the world.  I subscribe to that.  We should have been far more responsible, not just the Irish Government but the British Government and all other interests involved.  We should insist that no dumping of any nature takes place in or adjacent to Irish waters if any feasible alternative exists.  An alternative existed in this case.  If it was acceptable that a ship could be towed hundreds of miles across the sea to an allegedly safe dumping site then the ship could have been towed back to port and dismantled responsibly.  Which of us would accept that a man who has finished with his old second-hand car is entitled to dump it on the roadside?  We condemn people who <Col N="715" /> do that.  It is wrong from all viewpoints and this dumping is no more right.  It is very difficult to accept that the Irish Government should have accepted this wreck any more than any other Government. If the Minister had been perhaps more forthcoming on 26 October and explained that there was a delicate situation&mdash;if it was that delicate&mdash;that there were contingency plans and that there was a possibility that the ship could have gone down much closer to the shore than in fact he said at that time it was intended to go down, this mini debate might not have been needed and some of the concern which has been expressed and is genuinely based need not have been experienced by people who were concerned in past weeks.</P>
    <P>If at this time we are unable to cope from the point of view of making representations to other Governments on an issue such as this, if we are so weak that we must accept the flotsam and jetsam of Europe I am worried about the integrity of our stand when it comes to arguably more important issues such as the European Monetary System and various other international issues of importance to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The <i>Cristos Bitas</i> saga began almost exactly four weeks ago when the vessel was damaged by hitting <Col N="716" /> rocks off the Welsh coast on the evening of 12 October.  At that time the vessel was sailing from Rotterdam to Belfast with 35,020 tons of crude oil.  The ship's master at first reported an oil leak.  Later he reported that the leak had stopped, that the ship was safe and that he was proceeding to his destination at Belfast. At that time he was on the high seas and there was no authority in a position to interfere with the vessel.  As it transpired, the vessel was much more seriously damaged than it had appeared and she was forced to stop about 40 miles north of the original incident on course for Belfast.  She was by that time a serious pollution hazard and indeed in danger of sinking.</P>
      <P>During the following 12 days every possible effort was directed towards the elimination of the pollution hazard.  That these efforts were, by and large, most successful is a credit to those involved in the operation.  I should not let this opportunity pass without paying the highest tribute to all concerned, the appropriate Irish and British authorities and agencies between whom there was at all times very close and harmonious liaison, the salvors and all those others involved, who worked round the clock, often in most difficult conditions, to avert what could have been a major calamity.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise the very active involvement of various Irish services throughout the operation, the Department of Defence, the Naval Service which had vessels constantly on the spot assisting in the operation and keeping us informed of the position, various other Irish spraying vessels, the army Air Corps, the Department of the Environment and the local authorities concerned who activated the action plan to deal with any oil that might come ashore and, of course, officers of my own Department who were in constant touch with all the operations.  The activities of all these agencies were co-ordinated and directed from a control centre located in the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the successful pumping-out operation, there remained about 1,000 tons which could not be extracted from the vessel.  There was the question of <Col N="717" /> what should be done with the <i>Cristos Bitas</i> and what remained of her oil.  The vessel was badly damaged; she was still a serious hazard to the environment; there was a risk of gas explosion with consequent danger to life and threat to navigation.  There were no ports within a reasonable distance which had the technical capacity to carry out the gas freeing, the cleaning and repair work necessary to make the vessel seaworthy again, if that were possible, and that I underline would be a dangerous operation in itself.</P>
    <P>As far as the Irish and British Governments were concerned, it was essential that the <i>Christos Bitas</i> be disposed of as quickly as possible.  It was clear that this could be done only by scutting the vessel in a selected safe location.  My personal concern was that any site selected for scuttling should be so far from the Irish coast as to present minimal danger of polluting to our coastline or marine environment. Representatives of my Department together with representatives of the appropriate British authorities and the other interests concerned, and I personally, with my opposite number in the British Department of Trade, discussed a number of possible sites for the scuttling of the vessel.  As a result of these discussions, a site 580 miles west of Fastnet in the north Atlantic was chosen.  It was agreed that on her way to the scuttling site the vessel would at no time pass nearer than 80 miles of the Irish coast and that she would be accompanied by Irish and British naval vessels.</P>
    <P>Although weather forecasts for the tow-out were favourable, these have limited reliability beyond about three days.  It was recognised that at this time of year weather and sea conditions might give rise to an emergency situation. In the consultations which I had with the British Minister it was suggested to me that we should designate an alternative sinking site for consideration in an emergency.  I was not prepared to confer responsibility in advance for any departure from our original plan and I insisted that if problems were to arise there should be a reference back to me, in which case I would base my decision <Col N="718" /> on all the circumstances, including particularly the report and advice of the commander of the Irish naval vessel on the spot.  Accordingly, it was agreed that if an emergency arose which made the choice of an alternative scuttling location imperative, the commanders of the naval vessels together with the salvage master would report back to the respective Governments for instructions.  In order to be ready for any such contingency, an alternative scuttling site starting about 280 miles west of Fastnet was identified, and my advice was that it would be perfectly safe.  I emphasise that there was no question of utilising this site except in the event of an emergency and under the conditions I had laid down. Both sites were selected taking account of the depth of water available and the prevailing winds and ocean currents, all of which together would virtually eliminate any risk of pollution of our maritime environment.</P>
    <P>Following these discussions I issued a statement anouncing the decision to have the vessel sunk at the 580 mile site. This statement was correct in every respect and I stand over it emphatically.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not want to listen to the facts.  The more distant one was chosen to make assurance doubly sure.  I will go back on that in case it has not been heard.  Let me repeat that all the expert advice available to me agreed as to the safety of either site and the more distant one was chosen to <Col N="719" /> make assurance doubly sure.  On 31 October I was informed that gale force winds 8-10 were imminent in the area which the vessel had then reached about 330 miles west of Fastnet.  There was danger to the salvage crew on board the tanker and the vessel was losing buoyancy.  There was also the danger of the tow-lines parting from the vessel, thus setting her adrift on the open seas, still a pollution and explosion hazard. The salvage master and the Irish and British naval commanders recommended scuttling in that position, which was within the alternative scuttling site which had been identified.  I accepted their recommendation.  It was essential that a controlled scuttling in a selected site be achieved.  The vessel was scuttled in 16,000 feet of water.</P>
      <P>Since the scuttling on 31 October aircraft of the Irish Army Air Corps and the Royal Air Force have carried out aerial reconnaisance over a wide area round the scuttling site on six occasions.  On the day following the scuttling two oil slicks were seen due north of the position in which the vessel had been sunk.  I want to underline that.  This sighting confirmed for me the soundness of the advice I had been given as to the direction in which any escaping oil would move.</P>

      <P>Let me repeat that in the area where the vessel was sunk the oil proceeded due north of the position. This siting confirmed for me the soundness of the advice I had been given as to the direction in which any escaping oil would move.  Since then, despite regular and intensive searches, no oil slicks have been seen and it is assumed that those identified originally have been broken up by the action of the very rough seas in the area exactly as I said in replies to supplementaries on the Private Notice Question.  The advice I was given is that the chance of any oil from the wreck of the <i>Christos Bitas</i> reaching our shores is extremely remote.  Everything that has happened has confirmed that advice and any suggestions to the contrary are highly irresponsible.</P>

      <P>I am not clear as to the precise meaning of the term &ldquo;standards&rdquo; as used in the question. Under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, extensive powers are available both to me and to the Director of Consumer Affairs to deal with misleading advertising practices.  Controls may also be applied to advertising in specific areas by me or by other Ministers.  The Deputy is perhaps aware, too, of the voluntary controls operated by the advertising interests themselves through the Advertising Standards Committee.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. 7 of 25 May 1978, I had the matter referred, at the Government's instruction, to the Garda Commissioner for investigation.  As the Deputy will be aware from my statement in the House on 1 November&mdash;Volume 9, column 1562&mdash;I have recently been informed by the commissioner that the investigation has been completed, without it being possible, however, for the Garda to establish the source of the unauthorised disclosure and that no proceedings are intended in the case in relation to either the disclosure or the dissemination of these documents.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that the Garda inquiry establishes that no suspicion attaches to any of the officers of my Department who had or might have had access to the documents, I am concerned to ensure that, as far as possible, such an incident does not occur again and all those concerned with the handling of confidential documents have been alerted to the need for intensifying precautions.</P>
      <P>In the interests of accuracy, I would point out that the documents to which access apparently was had, did not include a version of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1977, approved by the Government for circulation to Deputies, but an earlier draft which had not been submitted to the Government.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if the anomaly whereby pre-July 1973 local authority tenant purchasers who commenced purchasing by annuity, and subsequently bought outright, do not qualify for the cash rebate payable to those who <Col N="668" /> purchased outright in the first instance is to be removed; if so, when the repayments are likely to take place; if he will give an outline of the formula by which the amount of rebate will be reached; and if he will explain the reason for the anomaly in the first place.</P>

      <P>A concession to certain tenant purchasers under pre-July 1973 schemes was granted by the former Government in May 1977.  This concession did not, however, extend to outright purchasers or to tenants purchasing by annuity who had redeemed their annuity.  No doubt the Deputy is aware that I have already granted a concession to outright purchasers and I have recently advised local authorities that the same concession may be given to purchasers who had redeemed their annuities before March 1978.</P>
      <P>The effect of these concessions is that, where the price paid by a tenant purchaser under a pre-July 1973 tenant purchas scheme is higher than what he would have paid under the July 1973 scheme, he will now qualify for a cash refund equal to one-quarter of the difference between the pre-July 1973 price and what he would have paid under the July 1973 scheme.  These concessions should effectively remove any anomalies in the case of tenant purchasers under the pre-July 1973 schemes.</P>
      <P>I have also asked the authorities to complete the making of the necessary refunds as early as possible, but in any case not later than 31 March next.</P>

      <P>I do not see how the question of giving a directive arises.  Under law, local authorities are obliged to provide in their estimates for the amounts estimated as necessary to meet their expenses and provide for their requirements during the financial year concerned. I have no reason to believe that in discharge of this obligation local authorities have acted this year with anything less than their customary prudence and responsibility.</P>
      <P>I am aware of allegations made by the Deputy about the effects of certain wage increases on the finances of some local authorities.  I have already issued a statement refuting these allegation.  The Deputy will also know that with the overall financial position of local authorities now reaching greater clarification as the end of the year approaches, his particular allegations about the Dublin authorities have been shown to be unfounded.</P>

      <P>There are 19 stations operated by local authorities measuring concentrations of smoke and sulphur dioxide in Dublin of which eight are in the city centre area.  The local authorities have also set up six monitoring stations to measure concentrations of lead in the ambient atmosphere of which two are located in the centre city area.  Results for the winter periods October 1973 to March 1978 show that smoke levels have declined by up to 20 per cent in the past five years and that the sulphur dioxide levels have declined by about 40 per cent in the same period.  There are indications that smoke pollution levels have now ceased to decline and the position in this regard is being kept under review.  The lead levels at one location over the past four years have been fairly consistent and can be regarded as satisfactory.  The results from the other stations have only become available over the past few months and no definite trend has been established.  A general review of the existing air pollution control arrangements is being undertaken in my Department with a view to improving the existing system.</P>

    <P>I have examined the report on Irish Dental Laboratories carried out at the request of the National Prices Commission. The report consists of a very detailed examination of the dental laboratory trade and deals with a <Col N="675" /> number of issues which are the responsibility of other agencies such as the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála and so on.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health my concern is with issues affecting the organisation of dental services.  In this category the report refers to the question of dental prosthetists.  This term is generally applied to a category of dental technician trained to make and supply dental appliances directly for members of the public.  This arrangement is precluded in Ireland by the terms of the Dentists Act, 1928, and no facilities exist for training or licensing dental prosthetists.  Consequently I have no information on the number of prosthetists in Ireland at present and any who are here cannot legally practise as prosthetists.  Proposals to train and licence dental prosthetists have been made by the Irish Association for Dental Prosthetists.  These and many other issues referred to in the report will be taken into account in the comprehensive review of public dental services now under way and also in the context of the new Dentists Bill which I hope to introduce early in 1979.</P>

      <P>Recommendations made by visiting committees either at their meetings or in their annual reports receive careful consideration and frequently it is possible to adopt them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the visiting committee of St. Patrick's Institution for 1975 made several recommendations.  Some of the recommendations, such as those for improvements in the educational facilities, accord with the policy of the administration for the development of the service as a whole.  Progress in that development is <Col N="679" /> as rapid as possible having regard to the difficulties that exist.  Some other recommendations, however, represent a view of the respective roles of the visiting committee and the Governor and of the authority of the latter which I am not able to accept and which my predecessor did not accept.  For example, recommendations that would give the visiting committee appellate jurisdiction over the Governor and that would put members of the staff (including the Governor apparently) in the position of having to appear before the committee to defend themselves against accusations by a prisoner in the presence of the prisoner, who, moreover, according to the recommendations would be entitled to the assistance of a member of the committee as advocate, would, I have no doubt, lead in practice to the total undermining of the Governor's authority in the institution.</P>
    <P>I shall bear the individual recommendations in that report in mind but I do not consider it necessary to make any kind of formal record of any changes that may be decided on from time to time in areas of the administration of the institution which are dealt with in the reports of the visiting committee.</P>

      <P>In September 1977 the Government authorised an increase of 500 in the strength of the Garda Siochána.  Recruitment of the extra gardai has been proceeding as fast as possible and it is expected that the strength of the force will be close to the new target figure of <Col N="681" /> 9,500 by the end of the year.  The question of further increasing the strength will be considered as and when necessary.</P>
      <P>Various measures involving reorganisation of the force are either already being implemented or are under consideration with a view to improving Garda administrative efficiency.  Following a review of Garda organisation in the Limerick, Clare and Galway area, a new division of Clare was established in July of this year and I approved a consequential re-organisation of the Limerick division. I also approved a number of organisational changes in smaller centres.  Earlier this week, the Government approved the establishment of an additional Garda division and district in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and Garda proposals for the re-organisation of Cork division are at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>In addition, other measures aimed specifically at combating crime have been and are being taken.  One example is that the strength of the detective branch throughout the entire country is being substantially increased and the extra posts involved are already in process of being filled.  Another example is that the concept of specialised units to deal with particular categories of crime is being extended by the setting up of a special task force which will give the gardaí greater capacity to deal with terrorist type crimes.  The central detective unit already comprises a number of units specialising in particular types of crime.</P>

      <P>Local authorities were authorised by circular letter issued from my Department on 21 June 1978 to pay pension increases to former employees with effect from 1 July 1978.  The calculation and payment of the pension increases in each case is a matter for the local authority concerned, subject to the right of any pensioner to appeal to me if <Col N="683" /> he is aggrieved by the refusal or failure of a local authority to grant an increase or by the amount of an increase granted. From inquiries made by my Department, I understand that the pension increases payable by Dun Laoghaire Corporation will be paid, with arrears due, during the current month.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the reported statements made at a news conference to introduce a study of Dublin air quality sponsored by the National Board for Science and Technology.  The study was related to pollution by sulphur dioxide and smoke.  In the study itself, no comparison was made between the levels of these pollutants in Dublin and in other cities.  The actual position is that the available data shows that levels of sulphur dioxide pollution in Dublin have continuously declined since the early seventies.  Smoke pollution levels have also declined although at present the decline appears to have halted.  The Dublin levels of both pollutants can be considered to be generally satisfactory having regard to World Health Organisation criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the children concerned come in the main from a small number of travelling families.  The question of begging by travelling women and children was dealt with in the Report of the Commission on Itinerancy (1963), and a further investigation is unlikely to add to our knowledge of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In co-operation with the National Council for Travelling People, my Department have organised a variety of educational facilities in the Dublin area to cater for the needs of travelling children.  These include special classes in schools where the integration of the children in ordinary classes is not feasible. In the case of the more difficult children a special school and day care centre has recently been set up in Strand Street in association with the Eastern Health Board to which transport is provided from the various locations.  A residential centre has also been established outside the city for a number of such children who cannot be catered for on a daily basis.  It is hoped that in so far as action by the Department of Education can help to alleviate the problem to which the Deputy refers, <Col N="685" /> these measures may be to some degree effective towards that end.</P>
