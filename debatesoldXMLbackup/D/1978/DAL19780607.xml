      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 1, to insert the following section&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  &mdash;Section 142 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended, as respects the year 1978-79 and subsequent years of assessment, by the substitution for subsection (1A) of the following subsection&mdash;</P>
      <P>`(1A)  For the purposes of this section &ldquo;the specified amount&rdquo; means £944.'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to raise the income limit for the purpose of the dependent relative allowance to the level of the old age contributory pension.  The amendment does this by inserting a new section in the Bill fixing the income limit at £944.  This figure effectively incorporates the sum of the maximum of the old age contributory pension payable at the personal rate to persons of 80 years and upwards, which is £886 for 1978-79, and the living alone allowance of £1.10 per week provided for pensioners over 80, that is, £57.20 for 1978-79.  At the moment the upper limit is the amount of the maximum old age contributory pension plus the allowance to a pensioner over 80 living alone.  The change involved is to increase the amount so as to cover the maximum of the old age contributory pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It might be possible to do that, but for many years it was necessary to make this kind of change in relation to the non-contributory pension and within recent times a change was made for an automatic adjustment.  Some thought will be given to this next year but it is a new provision and we have to take it as it stands at the moment, as it was done for many years.  Thought will be given to a formula that would ensure that there will be an automatic adjustment.</P>

      <P>: The Minister indicated a few moments ago that it is his intention to adjust it according to the increases in the contributory pension.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 19 to 26 and to insert the following paragraphs:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  where the insurance or contract referred to in subsection (2)  was made after the 21st day of May 1953 with any insurance company or friendly society, being a company or society which is registered in the State and managed and controlled therein, <Col N="502" /> an amount equal to two-thirds of the premium paid by him;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Where the insurance or contract referred to in subsection (2) was made on or after the 6th day of April 1978 with any insurance company or friendly society, an amount equal to two-thirds of the premium paid by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Finance Bill, 1978, removes a right that had been there from 21 May 1953, that owners of Irish companies had preference over non-Irish companies for premiums in that one could deduct as an allowance two-thirds of the premium where the policy was with an Irish company as compared with an allowance of one-half of the premium where the policy was with a non-Irish company.  In his budget speech or when he was introducing the Finance Bill the Minister said that we would be unable to give preference to Irish companies because of an EEC regulation and that, consequently, as from 2 February he had to reduce the benefit to people who had policies with Irish companies to the same level as that obtaining with regard to non-Irish companies.</P>
    <P>I accept that we cannot give differential treatment in favour of people who have policies with Irish companies but I am suggesting in my amendment that instead of reducing the amount from two-thirds of the premium to one-half we should increase to two-thirds the deductions allowed to holders with all insurance companies. This would not differentiate between Irish and non-Irish companies as from 2 February, it would give them the same advantage as that given to those who had taken out insurance policies between 1953 and 1978 and at the same time, it would benefit people who have policies with non-Irish companies in allowing them to make a two-third deduction with regard to their income tax assessment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: As the Deputy has said, it is true that we are obliged not to differentiate between Irish and foreign companies in this matter.  It is also true that there are alternative ways of dealing with this question.  One is the <Col N="503" /> method provided in the Bill which effectively reduces the preference in the case of Irish companies to the same level as that obtaining in the case of foreign companies.  The other way is that proposed by Deputy Barry in his amendment, to increase the benefit to foreign companies to bring them to the same level as that obtaining for Irish companies.</P>
      <P>In making the choice as to which is the better method of doing this, a few things must be borne in mind.  First, the position for many years up to 1974 was that the preference existed in favour of Irish companies but the relief was given only at the standard rate of income tax.  The scheme operated so successfully that Irish companies now have approximately 60 per cent of the premium income but in 1974 a change was made.  I think it was consequential on a change in the income tax structure and its effect was to give relief at marginal rates of tax rather than at the standard rate, as had been the case. The cost of that change was £750,000. If we do what Deputy Barry proposes it would cost at least another £50,000 a year for each succeeding year in addition to the cost in 1974.</P>
      <P>Apart from the additional cost I see two objections to this approach.  One is that because the relief is given now at the marginal rate rather than the standard rate the effect would be to give what would probably be an over-generous measure of relief, particularly to the higher rate taxpayers as compared to the relief available to them up to 1974.  The other objection I see to it is that it is certainly arguable that from the point of view of Irish companies it would be better for them to do what is proposed in the Bill rather than what is proposed in the amendment. If the amendment were accepted it would give a new selling point to the non-Irish companies and would operate to the detriment of Irish companies. For these reasons I do not think the amendment should be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: Reading the change envisaged here it would appear that the advantages that adhered previously to the Irish companies are being removed, or at least are not <Col N="504" /> being maintained.  The fact that there was an entitlement to a tax deduction of two-thirds of the premium in the case of a policy taken out with an Irish company ensured a better competitive position for those companies but this advantage will be removed by virtue of this section.  Is the Minister satisfied that the time has come for this change?  Is he satisfied that the Irish companies will not be at a disadvantage? I take his point that a good deal of the market now belongs to Irish companies and that the previous advantages have benefited them to some extent.  I should like him to tell us what are the strong reasons that suggest a change in this matter which appears to disimprove the position of Irish companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I did not dwell on that point because Deputy Barry had mentioned it.  We are obliged under an EEC directive not to discriminate between Irish and non-Irish companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is no time limit in relation to that.  It is not absolutely incumbent on the Minister to remove the benefit on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am afraid it is; as it is we are behind time.  A step was taken in this matter a few years ago but we have to do it now.  The choice is between what is proposed in the Bill, namely, to reduce the Irish companies to the same level as the non-Irish companies or the alternative as proposed by Deputy Barry, to increase the non-Irish companies to the same level as the Irish companies.  For the reasons I have given, I think the preferable course is the one proposed in the Bill. As I have indicated, the Irish companies now hold the major share of the market.  The approach of bringing the foreign companies up to the level of the Irish companies rather than the reverse would perhaps provide unnecessary competition for the Irish companies, or at least give an unnecessary selling point to their competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: With regard to the selling point, of course, it is true that if the foreign companies were brought <Col N="505" /> up to the level of two-thirds they would have a selling point but they will have that anyway as a result of this Bill.  They will be able to say that there is no difference now between the amount of tax relief on premiums with Irish and non-Irish companies.  There are selling points either way and perhaps there is not a lot of difference in them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the effect on the higher income group the House will take note of what the Minister said, that in 1974 a change was made from the situation where premiums paid were only allowable for standard rate of tax to the situation where they were allowable against the marginal rate of tax.  It was quite open to the Minister and the Government to change that situation in the Finance Bill, to restore the pre-1974 position and to improve the position of people on lower incomes in relation to the amount of insurance premiums they can claim against tax and the value of such premiums to them in real terms.  The Minister and the Government have not done this in the Bill, so it seems they cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say that the effect of the amendment would increase the value of the concession to people in the higher income groups while at the same time a remedy for this situation is in their hands.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's estimate of the cost of this proposal: £50,000 on top of the £750,000 which he said the 1974 concessions cost.  I have already suggested that he has a remedy in his hands if he is worried about the 1974 concessions, but the £50,000 is absolute peanuts in terms of the premium income for life assurance policies in this country.  If we look at the balance sheets of the Irish Life Company alone we would not notice £50,000.  I feel sure that the positive incentive which would be maintained for Irish companies by a decision not to worsen their position would more than produce the kind of extra premium income of a margin which would make that £50,000 look quite irrelevant.  In the circumstances it seems to be a small amount to pay with a high probability of recovering it some way along the line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister made two points, one of which was the cost, to which Deputy Horgan referred, and the other the selling advantage it might give to non-Irish companies.  As Deputy Horgan said, the cost is ludicrous.  In a budget of almost £3,000 million, a sum of £50,000 is a grain of sand.  I presume that the original idea in giving the advantage to Irish companies was to help them to build up and get into a strong position so that they could compete with foreign companies. I believe they are in that position now after 25 years, particularly as they have 60 per cent of the market. I am sure, whether it is a 50 per cent deuction or a 66? per cent deduction, that they will be well capable of competing with any outside company.</P>
      <P>This deduction was allowed originally to encourage people to take out insurance policies because it is a form of saving.  Insurance policies are taken out for different reasons but they are all of benefit to the country indirectly, to the person involved immediately and to his or her relatives and family. Anything which diminishes that encouragement to taking out insurance policies is not good.  We should continue to encourage&mdash;no matter what band of tax they make the deductions at, the marginal or the standard rate&mdash; and be seen to encourage as many people as possible to take out insurance policies.  They are good for the companies and are extremely helpful for the country.  It is also an encouragement for people to look after themselves. The cost of £50,000 is something we should not even be discussing because it is so small.  I am very concerned that we should continue to encourage people to take out insurance policies to look after their future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I support the last point made by Deputy Barry, which is a very important one.  People should be encouraged to save.  It is well known that insurance policies are a form of saving.  I believe they are not as profitable as they were.  Perhaps inflation has something to do with this.  The insurance policy system of saving is a system of saving which one is very <Col N="507" /> loath to discontinue after one begins it because of the danger of losing what one has already saved or a portion of it.  Deputy Barry's proposal would add another incentive to people to adopt this form of saving.</P>
      <P>We all know that people liable for income tax will look around to find a legitimate way of avoiding paying it.  It is not unheard of for people to look for ways which are not legitimate.  They will certainly look for legitimate ways of reducing the burden of income tax.  This is a way by which they can do it through relief on insurance premiums.  It is of benefit to the individual who takes out the insurance policy and to the nation because it creates saving and employment. This is a very meritorious amendment and, like some other Deputies who spoke, I am surprised to find that the cost involved is a mere £50,000.  I believe that would be £50,000 very well spent and I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider the matter and accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: We will deal with it on the other amendment.  I suppose it is true that the figure of £50,000 is not an enormous sum in the context of a budget.  Deputy Horgan is mistaken when he talks of the accounts of the Irish Life Assurance Company and £50,000 in relation to that. Premiums which would be paid to non-Irish companies are involved here, not premiums paid to the Irish Life Company or any other company.  We are talking about the additional tax relief in respect of premiums paid to non-Irish companies.  Deputies may not recall that when the change was made in 1974, to which I referred it <Col N="508" /> arose because surtax was being abolished then.  It was necessary to make some change to accommodate this tax allowance within the system of income tax then being introduced which involved the abolition of surtax.</P>
      <P>The question of reducing the relief in all cases, Irish and non-Irish companies, through the standard rate of tax is not as straightforward as might appear.  It would be considerably complicated and I believe it would be very strenuously opposed by the Irish and the non-Irish companies as something which would operate very much to their detriment.  In practice, as I said at the beginning, the choice lies between bringing the Irish companies down to the level of relief at present given to foreign companies or bringing the foreign companies up to the level of relief given to Irish companies.</P>
      <P>It would be a mistake to imagine that the proposal in the section will have the effect of reducing life business or, alternatively, that the proposal in the amendment will increase life business.  I do not think either proposal would be true because insurance business of this kind is now firmly established and steadily growing.  What is really at issue here is the question of whether, as I said, you bring the preference in favour of the Irish companies down or the preference in favour of the foreign countries up and for the reasons I have outlined, I believe the best thing to do is what is proposed in the section.  I cannot say with any authority that this would be the choice of the Irish companies but I rather suspect it would be.  I am not saying I know that because I do not, but I rather suspect that would be the choice.  As far as the foreign companies are concerned, they can certainly have no complaint if they are put on the same level as the Irish companies and so I am not convinced of the merits, on balance, of this amendment as against the proposal in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, but the reason for the section, the Minister said, is as a result of an EEC directive.  Could the Minister tell us what is the date of that directive?  The Minister may not have that information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: As far as I know, the directive has been in operation for some considerable time and it would be unnecessary, therefore, to comply fully with the directive at this particular point in time.  No doubt the people in the EEC would welcome the Minister complying fully with the directive but I do not believe there is any evidence that the EEC would insist on the directive being complied with fully at this point in time.  The Minister states that 60 per cent of premiums are now with Irish companies and describes this as the major share.  But 60 per cent is not a major share.  It is a definite improvement but it is not major and, if the advantage is left with the Irish companies for some further period, undoubtedly that 60 per cent will improve.  Would the Minister not agree it would be possible to bring in the directive on a phased basis and that such a basis would be acceptable to the EEC?  We have seen many occasions on which other countries have ignored directives over a long period.  I am not suggesting the Minister should do that but I am suggesting that he should approach this with the clear objective of giving as much advantage and benefit as possible to the Irish companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Since the contemplated change was announced in the budget there has been no downturn in the business Irish companies are getting.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday, 15 April, it was reported that since the February budget companies up to then had experienced a 25 per cent growth in their premium policies and there had been no change in that.  They were still experiencing a 25 per cent growth.  The point that this change will make no difference in the amount of business Irish companies <Col N="510" /> are getting is, therefore, a valid one.</P>
      <P>There is an EEC directive giving foreign companies the right to set up here.  Directive 3/1/A1 refers to an insurance company registered in the state and managed and controlled therein.  If a foreign company set up here and a person had taken out a policy with that company between 1953 and February 1978 and the company is managed and controlled in the State will it then be possible for that person to get a two-thirds relief on that premium?  Suppose the foreign company bought out an Irish company or a share in it what would be the position with regard to the two-thirds relief?  This directive will come into effect this year or the year after and, if that freedom is given to foreign in surance companies, would the Minister clarify what the position will then be?</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a point about the selling of insurance policies. It is a good thing for people to make provision for the future and put some of their savings into an insurance policy against the rainy day.  There is the one-sixth of total income rule affecting the total amount of the premium. I think that one-sixth rule was in existence before the introduction of capital gains tax and it may have had a bearing then because there was a good avoidance measure open at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>: This particular rule applies to all insurance companies and perhaps the Minister would now consider allowing people to pay more by way of premium into insurance.  That would have a beneficial effect because it would encourage more people to take out insurance policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is, of course, understood that we cannot discriminate in favour of Irish companies as against foreign companies and the new section is designed to do away with the advantage enjoyed by Irish companies at the moment.  The Minister seems to think Irish companies would prefer a <Col N="511" /> levelling down of the premium allowance rather than a levelling up.  I find it hard to see how that will benefit the insurance market.  I do not mean the company now.  I mean the market generally because the effect of what the Minister is doing in the Bill is to make life insurance in general less attractive.  There can be no doubt about that.  At present a person can shop around and, if he opts for an Irish company, he can enjoy a two-thirds premium relief as against a 50 per cent premium relief if he goes for an English company.  The fact is that he can get the relief of two-thirds, and that is used and has been used as long as I can remember by the Irish companies in selling their policies.</P>
      <P>If life insurance in general is made less attractive, is it not natural to assume the pool of business will contract and become smaller?  If the general pool of life insurance business contracts and becomes smaller, surely there will be less of it for the Irish companies.  The thing to do is to encourage life insurance because it has merit in its own right.  It is a form of protection for the individual and for the family.  It is good for the nation in that it encourages and generates savings. Surely we should not do anything which would make life insurance less attractive than it has been over a good many of years.  In my respectful opinion, the thing to do is to make it at least as attractive as it was.  If we do what Deputy Barry wants the Minister to do, we will make it even more attractive because there will be more generous relief available over a wider range of companies.  That is in the interests of the individual, the family and the nation.  I really cannot see the Minister's objection to the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the last point, I made it clear I was not speaking with <Col N="512" /> authority with regard to the views of the Irish companies but that I felt this would be their view.  It is inevitable that they would prefer to maintain their differential.  By definition they would prefer that.  Given that the situation has to be changed I believe that, having weighed up the alternatives, they would favour the one in the section rather than the one in the amendment.  I repeat I have not got information from the companies to that effect.  It seems to be to be almost self-evident that if one were in the position of the Irish companies and had to choose between competitors being able to say: &ldquo;We are just as good as the Irish companies so far as the tax relief is concerned&rdquo; or &ldquo;We can now offer you a considerably enhanced tax relief&rdquo;, the advantage would lie with the foreign companies in the second one and, therefore, one would prefer the first.  I do not know that with certainty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: No, and that is another reason for assuming what is being done in the Bill would be the lesser of two evils from their point of view.  I may not have made it clear in what I said about the cost, that the cost is not an annual cost of £50,000.  It is an additional cost each year.  In other words, £50,000 the first year, £100,000 the second year, £150,000 and so on in each succeeding year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the loss of tax relief to the tax payer is concerned, a person on standard rate tax on an annual premium of £120 would have £7 a year less in income tax relief under the section.  It seems to me that, as compared with the accumulating figure for the Exchequer the position so far as the taxpayer is concerned is not unduly advantageous.  The suggestion that the section would operate to reduce life insurance business, which we all agree is a desirable business to encourage, is not well-founded.  The point made by Deputy McCreevy with <Col N="513" /> regard to Irish Life supports that contention.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the EEC is that EEC competition policy requires that there will be no discrimination on the basis of nationality.  It is true, as Deputy McCreevy said, that the EEC directive will allow foreign companies to set up in Ireland.  As part of this arrangement, the position between foreign and home companies has to be harmonised.  We may take it that something has to be done and the net issue is still, as I outlined at the beginning, which is better: to level up or level down?  I am still convinced it is better to take the levelling down course rather than levelling up course not only from the point of view of the Exchequer but, I suspect, from the point of view of the Irish companies.</P>

      <P>Strictly speaking, I suppose, since we are trying to achieve harmonisation between the two we should not distinguish, but I do not think it is any secret that by and large Deputies would wish to ensure that Irish companies were not damaged as a result of what was happening.

As this directive would appear not to be a very recent one, would it be possible to approach this harmonisation on a gradual basis over a period of time and still allow the Irish companies for some future period to have an advantage which, we hope, would increase their share from 60 per cent which is not a major share?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>: There has been a certain phasing of harmonisation if I may phrase it in that way&mdash;and I think it is a fair way to describe it&mdash;under the <Col N="515" /> previous Government.  The Irish companies accept that at this point the discrimination must be got rid of.  The question is which is the better way to do it.  I have not endeavoured to complicate the discussion by going into a number of the complications involved. It is accepted within the life assurance business that the point has been reached where we have to equalise the tax treatment, and the question is which is the better way to do it?</P>

      <P>: I do not know whether the Minister and the Government have made any approach along these lines, but if it is possible to have acceptance by the EEC Commission to have the phasing extended over a further period this would be far more acceptable to the Irish companies.  We all accept that there must be harmonisation and that we must comply with directives, but there is a certain flexibility which is allowable and which is acceptable to the EEC.  From listening to the Minister I get the impression that this is an avenue which has not been explored at all and that the Government went for harmonisation in one fell swoop. It may be possible to have this brought in over a period of time and this would leave the Irish companies in a favourable position for a further period, would allow them a chance to increase on the 60 per cent of the business which they now have and would do so without antagonising the Commission or having any tensions between the Commission and the Irish Government.</P>

      <P>: To put it mildly, I do not think it would be a good selling point for it to get abroad that a <Col N="517" /> policy with an Irish company is now going to cost five-and-a-half per cent more than the same policy for a person in the same circumstances would have cost last year, if this section of the Bill is not amended.  There are two separate but related points here.  There is the psychological point about the sales impact and the fiscal point about the amount of money involved.  The Minister clarified the £50,000 reference by suggesting that this would be a rolling sum, that it would be £50,000 a year.  On what total premium outflow assumption is the initial £50,000 costs in tax relief terms based?  In relation to the rolling nature of this £50,000, if that is going to increase by £50,000 a year, is this based on another assumption about the trend in the market?  Does it assume that as a result of this amendment being accepted the Irish share of the market would decrease, remain static or grow at a rate slower than the rate at which it might otherwise be expected to grow?  My impression is that the Irish share of the market has been increasing over the years, and I would be glad if the Minister could confirm this.  If its growth is strong it seems that there is every reason to hope that it would be able to fight off the challenge posed by the situation that would be created by the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that he has not received any representations from the Irish companies.  To put it mildly, I am surprised, not that he has not received representations, but that he has not made it his business to find out what the Irish companies thought. The Minister himself is a major shareholder in one of the major Irish companies, and one would have thought that with at least one toe in the insurance market he would be in a very good position to take authoritative soundings rather than the nonauthoritative ones with which he has come into the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the psychological point, rather than having the situation in the amendment, which the Minister has argued might confer a psychological advantage on Irish companies or the situation in the section which confers a psychological advantage on non-Irish <Col N="518" /> companies, would the Minister consider splitting the difference and establishing a new rate applicable to all premiums of say, three-fifths, so that neither Irish nor non-Irish companies would be able to claim that their position had been either worsened or bettered?  There would be simply a new standard rate for relief premiums of three-fifths.  It would not be the old non-Irish rate or the old Irish rate: it would be a new rate.</P>

      <P>: Regarding submissions from the insurance world, the Minister in his final remarks said that no representations have been received but was not the Irish section of the market informed by the Department of the Minister's intention? Consequently, their lack of representation is due to the impression conveyed to them that the Minister was going ahead in respect of the dictates of what he considered to be the imperatives of the EEC directive.  I have been informed to that effect by people in the Irish insurance part of the market.</P>

      <P>: Regarding the EEC directive, must the changes be implemented immediately or could an effort have been made by the Minister to hold over the proposals for a further period?  On 1 February the Minister told the House that the Irish assurance companies have achieved more than 60 per cent of premium income.  Would they have achieved this percentage of the Irish market if the benefits that are now being withdrawn had never existed?  The Minister mentioned that up to 1953 the proportion of the life assurance business held by Irish companies was only 50 per cent and that in an effort to develop the business the income tax concession was increased from a half to two-thirds. Having regard to the proposed changes is it the Minister's opinion that we will be able to retain our share of the <Col N="519" /> market or is there a danger of our losing it?</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us, too, that the non-Irish companies have invested more than 90 per cent of their Irish liability in our economy.  My third question is whether a date beyond that proposed for the change could not have been decided on.  I ask this because I am of the opinion that if a date such as 31 December this year had been specified people considering investing in life assurance policies would have opted for an Irish company, first, from the national point of view and, secondly, from the financial point of view.  Certainly, I would be influenced in such a situation by those factors.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Up to a short time ago this debate proceeded on the basis that the amendment inserted by the Minister in the Finance Bill was simply and solely for the purpose of complying with an EEC directive.  It was on that basis that the argument developed but the Minister has stated now that apart from that consideration it was the conviction of the life assurance industry that the differential would have to be abolished.  From the Irish point of view it is difficult to understand the necessity for this because the differential has helped build up the Irish part of the market.  The Minister should tell us what is the other reason.  Has he had discussions with the Irish life assurance industry in that regard?  He has told us that he has not received representations from the industry since the Bill was published but did he have discussions with them before the Bill was drafted?  Can he tell us also whether the section was included in the Bill as a result of any such discussions or at the request of the life assurance companies?  The Minister should let us in on the secret.  It is easy to understand the argument for abolishing the differential in order to comply with an EEC directive which lays down that we may not discriminate against other EEC companies and in favour of Irish national companies out before the debate goes further the Minister should give us whatever information he has on the other point.</P>

      <P>: Without wishing in any way to be discourteous to Deputy Enright, I dealt earlier in the debate with the first two points he raised.  The first point was pursued by Deputy Cluskey.  Regarding the third point raised by Deputy Enright I do not think it would be acceptable that we should provide a method whereby people could avail themselves, in the way suggested by the Deputy, of forthcoming changes in income tax arrangements so that they would have the remainder of the year in which to take out policies with Irish companies knowing that thereafter the benefits that would accrue to them would be discontinued.  That would not be an acceptable form of anticipation.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point raised by Deputy Horgan on the estimate of an additional £50,000 each year, I do not have here the basis on which the estimate was made but with due respect I do not consider the point to be relevant. We may accept that the estimate is the best that can be made but it is not relevant to the net issue involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt, too, with the question of EEC requirements.  I have outlined the requirements in regard to non-discrimination and to the right of establishment but I have indicated also that there are other factors involved, factors which have not arisen overnight. Some Deputies who have been members of a previous Government either may or may not be aware of what I am talking of but what is involved goes back quite a few years. The fact that I say that it is generally accepted in the insurance industry that the discrimination must be discontinued is bonne out by the lack of representations.  When I was in Opposition I received a considerable number of representations from the insurance industry regarding proposals being brought forward in Finance and other Bills but from what has been said it appears that on this occasion the Opposition have not received representations either, all of which goes to prove that it is accepted that the discrimination must be discontinued. The net issue is the question of which is the best way to do this.  None of what has been said so far would <Col N="521" /> lead me to the conclusion that what is proposed in the amendment would be a better way of dealing with it as against what is proposed in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: It makes it relatively more attractive to invest in non-Irish companies by comparison with the previous situation by making it less attractive to invest in Irish companies. The point I want the Minister to elaborate on is the extent to which these non-Irish companies reinvest the proceeds of their premium income in the Irish economy.  Is there a requirement on them, if they receive such premium income from Ireland, to invest it in Ireland?  My understanding is there is an EEC proposal&mdash;I do not know if it is more than a proposal&mdash; that income of this sort derived within an individual member state should be reinvested within that state.  If there was to be any removal of discrimination one would wish to ensure that there was a simultaneous requirement on such non-Irish companies who were now being put on an equal footing so far as receipts of income from the Irish economy was concerned and that they would be required to reinvest that money in the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister said that investment in the Irish economy by non-Irish companies now exceeds 90 per cent of their Irish liability.  That is not 100 per cent and I think we should aim at 100 per cent. Is there any requirement either in train or in existence in regard to that matter?  If investment in the Irish economy by non-Irish companies now exceeds 90 per cent of their Irish liability, what is the equivalent percentage for the Irish companies? Are they investing 90 per cent of their premium income in the Irish economy? If one were to find that non-Irish companies were investing proportionately more of their Irish income in the Irish economy, it would be almost a case for discrimination in <Col N="523" /> their favour.  Before we can adjudicate on the matter we should know where the money is going.  It is not enough to know the nationality of the company, it is what they do with their money that is important.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am sorry if this debate has gone on longer than the Chair thinks it should, but the person to blame for that is the Minister.  He introduced a new element into this debate in its latter stages.  It is incumbent on the Minister, who is amending the law by reducing the allowance in respect of Irish premiums, to tell the House why he is doing it and to give all the arguments.  He has not done that.  He proceeded on the basis that it was to comply with an EEC directive. We understand that.  Then he went on to say that apart altogether from that EEC directive, and if it were never there, the life insurance industry felt that this discrimination should be abolished.  Either there is some substance in that, and the Minister should tell us what it is, or he is imagining things.</P>
      <P>I must insist that the Minister tells us what this other argument is which apparently is in his mind, or in somebody's mind, and which is even more powerful than the EEC directive argument. In my view he has not been coming clean with the House.  He has not been frank with the House.  It is impossible to come to a clear decision on the amendment and the section without having the information which the Minister obviously has and will not give us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would like to congratulate the Minister on his choice of phrase.  His statement about discriminating against foreign companies is beautifully put.  Instead of discriminating against foreign companies this section is taking away an incentive to invest in Irish insurance companies.  If one looks at this matter from the point of view of an incentive rather than discrimination one will see the case in a clearer light.  The Minister's budget speech was interesting, I would like him to clarify the situation in regard <Col N="524" /> to total investment by non-Irish companies in the Irish economy.  I would like him to tell us approximately and in round figures how much they are investing in the Irish economy.  If we have this figure the House will know how much strength and muscle these companies have and what benefit they are to the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>I asked why we could not leave this matter over until the end of December this year.  The Minister said it would be bad budgetary strategy and so on. I want to know why not.  In my view, if we are to encourage people to invest in Irish insurance companies which employ Irish people and reinvest in the Irish economy, an incentive of that nature should have been encouraged.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Having sat through the debate I am satisfied that if the Minister had the will and wanted to do it, he could get over the EEC difficulty, and that if he could not get over it totally he could accept the proposal gradually.  In view of the importance attached to the matter I do not think I can be blamed if I say I am convinced that the real object is not to get over the EEC difficulty but so that State policy holders of Irish insurance companies will be deprived of this income tax benefit for some other reason and that the Minister will not give us that other reason.  That is clear to me and I am suspicious of the whole thing.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he will not tell us.  If this was going on during the period of the last Government and is going on now, the proposal still has the effect of penalising policy holders in Irish companies.  This is the net result of the whole thing and I suggest it could be avoided, notwithstanding the EEC directive, if the Minister had the will.  He could have it phased out in view of the state of the industry here.  This is not the proper way to conduct the business of the House.  It is not the way to treat the House or to make a case for putting this into legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish to make two points.  The Minister has answered me in relation to the investment of profits <Col N="528" /> from premiums in the Irish economy to the extent of 90 per cent and he said it is based on an informal agreement and that in return for that agreement he is giving away a statutory benefit available to Irish companies.  That seems to me to be a bad exchange. The Minister did not answer me on the question of whether there is an EEC requirement to do this or whether there is one in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is obviously not the reason although I thought there might be an EEC requirement along those lines.  My recollection, having been involved in the insurance industry in my official capacity for two years, is that there is such a requirement coming.  I am not sure whether it is in existence now or whether it is only a proposal.  I have no recollection from my contact with the insurance industry of the reasons the Minister is putting forward for this proposal. As Parliamentary Secretary I was involved with insurance for two years, along with a number of other matters, and I do not know what the Minister is getting at.  It is possible that this may have eluded me.  I make those statements in good faith and I am surprised that the Minister is saying that I, and people like me, should know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am the only Member present who had any official responsibility in relation to insurance and I presume the Minister was referring to me.  The fact is that the Minister suggested that anybody who had any interest in the insurance industry would know what he was getting at and there was no need for him to explain it.  That certainly does not <Col N="529" /> apply to me and in that case it does not apply to any other Member.  I am surprised that the Minister is using this argument because, as I said in an earlier intervention, it is treating the House badly and it indicates a sort of ministerial rather than a parliamentary form of Government coming into effect.  One is being asked to accept things on faith from the Minister rather than on the basis of facts and arguments adduced in open debate.  That is bad and the Chair, as the guardian of parliamentary privilege, should protect Members of the Opposition from the use of that sort of argument.  However, that is a matter for the Chair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the Minister is using an argument of that sort, namely refusing to give information although he says that other people outside the House know it, that to my mind is detrimental to parliamentary privilege. However, I do not wish to pursue that. The Minister has answered my question fully in relation to the investment of the proceeds of the premia by these life companies when he stated that there is an informal agreement and that there is no EEC requirement. He stated that for that he is prepared to trade this statutory protection of Irish companies.  I should like to know if there is any requirement in relation to what is known as establishment in the insurance world.  Is there any requirement that these non-Irish companies who are now going to be put on a par with the Irish companies must have what is known as an establishment in Ireland?  Must they have an established office staff with people who can make all the major decisions within this country? My recollection is that they must.  My recollection is that a life assurance directive was adopted which requires them to do this.  I should like to know exactly his requirements on the non-Irish companies which will now be put <Col N="530" /> on a par in relation to the number of staff they must employ here.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a point in relation to the argument the Minister adduced that there was an EEC requirement. It seems to me that if there was an EEC requirement it would be for non-discrimination as between member states and not as to non-discrimination between Irish companies and companies from anywhere else in the world.  If the Minister wanted to meet an EEC requirement on this matter he would have given the relief then being given to Irish companies to all companies from member states thus leaving American, African, or companies from non-Community states in the original position that EEC companies were in.  The fact that the Minister has chosen not to do it that way but to put, by removing a relief from the Irish companies, all-comers on the same basis as Irish companies in the Irish economy suggests that this is not an EEC requirement.  It suggests that the EEC factor is minimal. If it was an EEC factor the Minister would have dealt with this matter in a different way.  The way the Minister is dealing with this bears out clearly that the Minister's initial argument about the EEC was not a real argument at all.  In fact, it was probably a sham.  The real argument and the real matter that we have been discussing this morning is something which the Minister is not prepared to disclose to the House.</P>
      <P>We could go on repeating that point for another hour but it is manifestly clear that a Minister who comes late into the House and is not prepared to meet arguments from this side with rational arguments and facts is in a very weak position.  The point has been clearly made and I hope people outside will take note.</P>

He comes in here and tells us that it is for EEC purposes but that there are other more important arguments in favour of doing what he is asking us to do.

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wondered whether the Minister was interested in, or had had representations made to him, in relation to the existing total limit of premiums that may be allowable against income tax in respect of various insurance policies.  I am sure the House is aware that the present limit of £1,000 in terms of premium income was set in 1974.  Since then, as the Minister lost no opportunity to remind us when he was on this side of the House, inflation has been fairly severe in some years.  It is a least arguable that that limit needs looking at again in the light of what has happened since.  There is a particular aspect of it I mentioned on Second Stage to which, for obvious reasons, the Minister did not have time to reply in detail at that point.  Perhaps he would reply to it now in the context of Committee Stage, that is, that some people use life assurance policies as a form of collateral security when buying houses and that the premiums on these can be extremely heavy and come close to using up half, three-quarters or more of their £1,000 allocation.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not seriously consider at this point extending the relief, perhaps by a modest amount, sssin respect of total premiums which come to more than £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The limitation to which the Deputy refers of £1,000 was introduced in 1974 because, as I indicated earlier, at that time a change was made whereby relief was given at the marginal rate which, up to that, had been at the standard rate.  The reason for the limitation given by my predecessor was that because the relief was now at the marginal rate it was necessary to impose this limitation to avoid abuse of the relief then being given, and if there were no such limitation that there would be then over-generous allowances to people who were particularly well off.  I cannot object to that principle and do not object to it. As regards the amount involved, no case has been made to me to show that it operates to an unduly restrictive extent and so I have no proposals at present to increase it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would accept that the object of the limitation in 1974 was a just and fair object which was that of reducing the opportunities for tax avoidance.  How can it be that something which was just and fair and equitable in 1974 continues to be just, fair and equitable four years later? Objectively, circumstances have changed and while we on this side of the House would insist on a limit for the very reasons that the original limit was introduced in 1974, it seems to be <Col N="537" /> altogether reasonable that some kind of greater relief should now be given in respect of what has happened to the cost of living and money incomes generally since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>: The Minister said when I was in the House that this question, which he described as being in the national interest, was not a result of the EEC directive but was related to an informal agreement with the insurance companies.  That was the real purpose of his approach to section 1. By virtue of the fact that the Minister is a member of Fianna Fáil and I and my colleagues are members of the Labour Party, it could be safely assumed that we would not necessarily agree as to what is in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Not possible but definite.  If legislation is being brought before this House and we are being asked to consider it and express our views on it and possibly to vote on it subsequently, surely the House is <Col N="539" /> entitled to know the nature of the agreement that exists between the Government and the insurance companies. It has a direct bearing, according to the Minister's statement, on his approach in section 1 and it is impossible for Members on this side of the House and the public in general to evaluate what precisely the agreement is and how it could be in the national interest.  I understand it has been suggested that there has been a threat by some of the insurance companies to withdraw their investment from Ireland unless&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, outside the House, and that it is as a result of this pressure by the insurance companies that the Minister is taking this approach.  If that is the case, surely the House and general public are entitled to know that this is the reason why this approach is being taken by the Minister.  This raises a far more fundamental question than what is covered in this section.  It raises the question of whether companies operating in this country are successful in applying pressures to the Government and dictating the approach which the Government will take towards legislation which is placed before this House.  It is extremely important that the Minister should clear up this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Despite what Deputy Cluskey says, the fact is that I did not say that my attitude to this section was dictated by an agreement, informal or otherwise.  In response to a question &mdash;I think by Deputy Bruton&mdash;I indicated that the informal agreement related to the amount of investment in the Irish economy by non-Irish companies.  Deputy Cluskey says that there has been some threat by a non-Irish company to withdraw their investments.  I am unaware of any such threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The suggestion has <Col N="540" /> been made and what I am asking the Minister to do now is to indicate clearly and unequivocally to the House that that is not part of the informal agreement that exists between the Government and the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am totally unaware of any such suggestion but I would agree fully with Deputy Cluskey that if there were any such suggestion it would be a matter of the gravest import for the people of this country and I now invite Deputy Cluskey to tell the House what details he has of any suggestion, of which I am totally unaware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister has referred to an informal agreement between the insurance companies and the Government.  Earlier when discussing the amendment I asked the Minister the date of the EEC directive which was not available at the time, and I asked him if it could be phased. In reply to those suggestions by me when we were discussing the amendment the Minister clearly said that there were factors other than the EEC directive.</P>
      <P>He referred to an informal agreement between the insurance companies and the Government.  He refused to disclose the precise nature of that agreement and covered the whole thing in the general terms that he considered it to be in the national interest.  I do not think one would expect that on all issues I would agree with the Minister's interpretation of the national interest and in a democracy where you have this difference about what is in the national interest the only people who can ultimately decide and who are ultimately entitled to decide are the general public.  Surely the House and the public are entitled to make that decision on the basis of all the facts. All I am asking the Minister to do is to inform the House, and the public through the House, of the precise nature of the informal agreement which dictated the approach the Minister is making on this matter in section 1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The House will have noted that Deputy Cluskey, having said that there was a suggestion outside <Col N="541" /> the House of a threat of withdrawal of investment in this country by non-Irish companies, a matter which would be of the gravest importance&mdash;he said that and I agree with him&mdash;I invited him to tell us something about this suggestion of what I am totally unaware. He did not tell us anything. I now invite him again to tell us of this terribly important matter to which he has adverted.  Would Deputy Cluskey say if he knows anything of any such suggestion?  If so, what does he know?  Or, is he making this up out of whole cloth?</P>

      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;of this fundamental issue.  It is so serious that the Minister, who so obviously recognises the fundamental issue involved, will undoubtedly now tell the House the precise terms of the agreement reached between the insurance companies and the Government.  We are being asked to vote for or against a measure in the Finance Bill which only this morning the Minister informed the House is not as a result of the EEC directive but as a result of an agreement which has been reached between the Government and the insurance companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

The facts are contained in the terms of the agreement about which apparently we are not going to be informed. Surely that is a fundamental issue in itself.</P>

The section has been published for some time; people interested have been aware of it.  I think we have agreed in the House on all sides; there have been no representations about it.  But something new has been brought up this morning that was not in the Bill or in anything else, a matter of extreme importance and that is: the Leader of the Labour Party has told the House that there has been a suggestion outside the House of a threat to withdraw investment in this country by non-Irish insurance companies.  I have twice invited the Deputy to give the House information about this suggestion of which I am totally unaware and twice he has refused to do so.  Finally, I shall give him one further opportunity to do so, so that everybody concerned may draw his own conclusions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: It seems that certain controversial things have emerged from this discussion.  The first is that the EEC directive in relation to this, if it is relevant at all is only relevant in part.  There also seems to be an acceptance that an informal agreement arrived at between the Government and the insurance companies is also relevant in part to this section.  The Minister has rejected the charge that it dictated his attitude to the section. I am prepared to accept that rebuttal but if it is relevant to the section it is very difficult for us to know how relevant it is unless we know what the agreement contains.  The Government have not been so slow to publish details of other agreements.  The Minister as far as I am aware, specifically mentioned this agreement in the context of remarks about the investment patterns of companies, non-Irish insurance companies operating in the insurance market in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have an agreement between the Government and the insurance companies and it is in the general context of the investment pattern of these insurance companies. It stands to reason that even though we cannot have sight of this agreement or know what it is an agreement involves a <i>quid pro quo</i> and if the insurance companies concerned made some concession or gave some undertaking to the Government the Government and perhaps their successors are involved in some undertakings or concessions to the insurance companies. In itself, that is not necessarily a bad thing and in certain circumstances might even be in the national interest. But what we are talking about here is a trade-off between an informal, unenforceable agreement on the one hand <Col N="544" /> and a statutory provision of the Finance Bill on the other.  That is not equality of bargaining.  If there is any good reason that the Minister can tell us as to why this informal agreement which is relevant to the concession being made here should not be incorporated in domestic legislation so as to provide an adequate offset to the benefits which are being conferred on the non-Irish companies here in regard to improving their competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish companies, he should tell the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to ask the Minister three questions.  First, will he state definitely that there is no connection between the provisions of this section and the informal agreement or negotiations entered into under the informal agreement?  Did the Minister receive any representations from non-Irish companies for which provision is being made in this section and if so will the Minister state the content of these representations?  Did the representations contain any indication as to the contingencies that would flow from the failure of the Government to accede to the representations from the non-Irish companies if such representations were made?  Do provisions of this sort in relation to tax relief exist in any other countries with which Irish Life companies are likely to do business?  It may well be that in the future the Irish insurance industry will become a major exporter of invisible exports and if it does it is important that it be operated on the same basis in foreign territories as companies based in foreign territories are operating here.  Are there any member states of the EEC or any other countries with which Irish Life companies might do business on an export basis, which operate a discriminatory provision in relation to their tax in favour of policies sold by their nationals within their territory?  If so, has the Minister insisted that as a prelude to our removing the discrimination with which we favour our companies, other countries immediately remove the discrimination with which they favour theirs.  In answering that question I would ask the Minister not to confine himself to the EEC because <Col N="545" /> the European Economic Community might be prepared to remove any discrimination in favour of their national insurance companies in the tax code. This section removes the discrimination in favour of Irish companies as against all-comers so it is important that any <i>quid pro quo</i> we might get in terms of the statutory provision in other countries in relation to the removal of discrimination in favour of their nationals be not confined to the other eight members of the EEC.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister state that there is no connection between the provisions in this section and the informal agreement in relation to investment in the Irish economy or any arrangement or agreement entered into under the informal agreement?  Has the Minister received any representations from non-Irish companies in relation to the provisions of this Bill and if so what were these representations and were any contingencies indicated in them as to the consequences that might flow from the failure of the Minister to accede to them?  Can the Minister say if the provisions that have existed in Ireland up to the enactment of this section exist in any other states with which Irish life companies might do export business?  If they exist the Minister should insist that they be removed at the same time as ours are being removed so that Irish companies can operate on the same basis as other companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The answer to Deputy Bruton's third question is that this information is not available and it is not of significance at the moment.  If Irish companies develop their business abroad to any appreciable extent and any discrimination of this kind arises whereby reciprocal arrangements will be needed, the matter can be dealt with then.  In relation to the Deputy's second question.  I have received no such representations, and in relation to his first question I have already dealt with the informal agreement in so far as I am in a position to do so and I do not propose to go any further into that except to draw the attention of the House to two things that have already been adverted to in the course of the debate a number of times.  The <Col N="546" /> informal agreement relates to the amount of investment in the Irish economy by non-Irish companies and the level of that investment is now approximately the same as that of the Irish companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister saying that this section is the visible and statutory part of an arrangement of which the other part is non-visible, non-statutory and non-enforceable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister saying that there is no relationship between this change in the fiscal situation and the informal agreement?  Is this section merely like the visible part of the iceberg with the other nine-tenths of it under the sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not said either of those things.  What I said in that regard is that anything I have to say and can say I have already said and I cannot add to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is there a relationship between the two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I told the Deputy, I cannot add to what I have said.  Why are Deputies spending so much time on this matter as they clearly are not really interested in it?  If they were they would know what it is all about. Since they do not, the question of whether that story in the paper about the filibuster was true or not is raising its ugly head.  The Deputies should consider the implications of it in relation to the rest of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the Minister were forthcoming in answering questions put to him there would be no need for a long discussion.  The lengthy discussion arises because of the Minister's failure to give information, so that Deputies must explore a variety of different possible undisclosed reasons to arrive at the true reason.  If the Minister had given a true reason there would be no need for this process of exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the tax position of Irish Life companies engaged in the export market, the Minister said that he is prepared to remove from Irish <Col N="547" /> law this discrimination against non-national companies.  When I asked if similar discrimination existed in other states the Minister stated that he did not have this information.  That is an amazing response from the Minister. The Minister is prepared to remove a benefit in the Irish economy from Irish companies without knowing if other countries are doing the same.  It is not impossible for the Minister to find out the answer to this question.  There are compendia of international insurance law that can be consulted quite easily.  If the Minister or his officials wanted to find out what was the equivalent provision to that contained in section 2 in any other member state he could find out.  Why was he not able to answer this question?  If he is prepared to grant a concession to non-national companies in the Irish economy, why does he not know if such a concession exists in other countries?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: As the Deputy knows from his experience as a Parliamentary Secretary, the question of insurance law and operations between different kinds of insurance companies is one for the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It is not a matter for the Finance Bill which deals with the tax situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: My question is confined to the tax treatment of life insurance companies in other countries. Therefore, it is a matter for the Department of Finance, not the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The activities of Irish companies abroad are a matter for the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, as the Deputy knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the Minister is proposing to remove a tax concession so far as nationals are concerned by comparison with non-nationals, it should be common sense to find out if other countries are doing the same.  He should know whether Irish companies abroad will be under the same handicap that the Minister is now removing from non-Irish companies here.  Why is the <Col N="548" /> Minister not able to tell the House if the provision he is proposing exists in other member states of the European Community and in other countries where Irish life companies might be likely to do business?  Any Minister for Finance who was proposing to introduce such a change here should know the answer to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will say this once more.  More than anyone else Deputy Bruton should know the position with regard to insurance.  In relation to companies issuing policies, where those companies are legally established here or in Britain or who are lawfully carrying on a business in the State, under the latter category of lawfully carrying on a business in the State this matter is governed by the Insurance Act, 1936.  That statute is administered by the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and in so far as any Irish life company are carrying on business abroad and discover that their business is being affected by tax laws abroad, where reciprocity between that country and Ireland would be of importance in the first instance they would bring their case to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

If the company concerned came to the Department of Finance <Col N="549" /> they would be sent to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy in order to get that Department's assessment of the situation.  No such case has arisen to my knowledge.  No representations have been made.  This is not surprising having regard to the level of activity of Irish companies abroad. As I indicated a considerable time ago, if that situation develops and if it is necessary to take action in that regard that can be done.  The question being raised by the Deputy at the moment is one of pure speculation.  It has no relation with reality and I think he knows that.</P>

      <P>: The Minister is obviously sitting on those benches doing nothing.  He has four officials sitting beside him but he has not asked them to get this information.  His Department are approximately 200 yards from this House but he has not bothered to find out the answer to a question that was asked in this House two hours ago.  It is entirely relevant to this discussion.  The question I asked about the date of the directive regarding harmonisation is a fairly basic one and one would expect the Minister to be able to answer it. When I asked the question I accepted that the Minister might not be able to answer it immediately, that he might have had to ask one of his officials to check on the facts.  I wonder why he has not done so?</P>
      <P>I asked the question originally because it appears the directive has been in existence for some considerable time but there is no pressure from the EEC to implement the harmonisation provision immediately.  I asked the Minister if this could be done over a phased period in order to allow Irish companies to retain their favourable position and if this would be acceptable to the EEC Commission.  The Minister has told the House that they have a 60 per cent share of the market and they could increase that if they were allowed to continue in their present favourable position.  The Minister dismissed the EEC directive, after some discussion, as not being the main issue and he referred to an informal agreement between the insurance companies and the Government which he said was in the national interest.  After some further discussion of a protracted nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: If the EEC is not the reason why we should put Irish <Col N="551" /> companies in an unfavourable position there must be another reason.  The reason given by the Minister has been the question of this informal agreement between the insurance companies and the Government.  During the morning the Minister also said that the insurance companies had not made representations to his Department. Now I do not know how one defines representation but, if one sits down and hammers out an informal agreement, I think that could justifiably be defined as representation, representation being making the other side aware of what one wants with regard to the outcome of a particular issue.  Quite clearly, the provisions in this section detrimental to the interests of Irish companies is as a result of an agreement. If the British companies, or other companies, wanted to be put on a par with Irish companies and there was an informal agreement, then they must have been able to put forward not only some argument but something to back that argument up.  I said there have been suggestions outside this House.  One of the things that arose was that these companies may have put pressure on the Government by saying they would not maintain their investment here.  I have heard these suggestions made informally outside this House.  I make no formal charge but a few moments ago the Minister said that part of an informal agreement arrived at was that these companies would maintain a level of investment here and so it is quite clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: If there were an informal agreement which stated that harmonisation would come in to the detriment of Irish companies, and this is not being brought in because of any pressure by the EEC, then it is only being brought in because of pressure by the non-Irish companies.  The Minister goes on then and tells us that part of the agreement is the level of investment that will be maintained here by non-Irish companies.  Surely it is clear that, if that type of discussion took place and that kind of agreement was arrived at, then the other side of the coin is that, if these companies were not put on a par with Irish companies and this section, which is detrimental to Irish companies were not introduced, they would lower their level of investment.  I will now pose an extremely important question: are we now in the position that the Minister or his representatives sat down with non-Irish firms, negotiated an agreement detrimental to Irish firms on the basis that these firms were dictating to the Government what form of legislation the Government would introduce based on the level of investment they would maintain in this country?</P>

I have asked him three times already to do that and so far he has not done it.  All he has done is to repeat that there were suggestions outside the House.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Chair will not have any repetition from me.  The Minister in charge of the Bill came in here to convince the House it should vote in favour of this section.  He gave one argument, the EEC argument, in favour of the Bill.  He hung his hat on that for about an hour and at the end of that hour he said, apart altogether from the EEC argument in favour, in reply to Deputy Cluskey's argument that he should say what the matter is, there is a bigger and a better and irrefutable argument in favour of this.  That argument is that the industry say this differential must go and there is an argument in favour of why it must go.  He will not tell the House what that argument is.  That is a disgraceful performance.  This section has taken all morning to get through the House because of the <Col N="555" /> Minister's irresponsibility in saying he has an argument but he will not tell the House what it is.  He says his argument is known to everybody who is interested in insurance.

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the percentage increase in the seasonally adjusted output of the manufacturing industry between the second quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1977; and the percentage increase in the manufacturing industry as between the second quarter of 1977 and the fourth quarter of 1977, together with the annualised rate of increase of output deriving from the latter figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Based on the results of the monthly industrial production inquiry, the estimated percentage increase in the volume of output of manufacturing industry, seasonally adjusted, between the second quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1977 was 8.7 per cent.  The corresponding estimated increase in the seasonally adjusted index between the second quarter of 1977 and the fourth quarter of 1977 was 1.0 per cent.  The latest available information relating to the change which has actually occurred over a 12 month period in the volume of production in manufacturing industry is the increase of 10.6 per cent in the index between the three months ending January 1977 and the three months ending January 1978.</P>

      <P>: Perhaps my question was not well enough phrased but I do not think the Minister gave me an annualised figure based on the second of the figures, namely, the difference between the April-June 1977 quarter and the October-December 1977 quarter.  Did the Minister give me an annualised figure based on the figure for the difference between the second and fourth quarter of 1977?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers employed in the manufacturing industry between June 1976 and June 1977; and the increase in the same figure between June 1977 and December 1977, together with the annualised rate of increase derived from the latter figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>: Based on the results of the quarterly industrial inquiry, the increase in the estimated number of persons engaged in manufacturing industry between mid-June 1976 and mid-June 1977 was 5,800 on a seasonally adjusted basis.  The corresponding increase in the period mid-June 1977 to mid-December 1977 is estimated on a seasonally adjusted basis to be 700.</P>
      <P>The latest available information relating to the change which has actually occurred over a 12-month period is the estimated increase of 3,000 persons engaged between mid-December 1976 and mid-December 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I realise that the Minister is only responsible for the figures and not the facts behind them but would he agree that on the face of it the answers to the two questions which he has just given to the House show that the improvement in the industrial <Col N="560" /> picture over the last two years has most strongly fallen in the first of those two years, when the Government's predecessors were in office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would not agree. We had, as was pointed out in my reply, 3,000 more people engaged in manufacturing industry in mid-December last compared with mid-December the previous year.  That is indicative of the progress made since July last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Any restrictions that may be necessary on the evidence placed before me will be made by me. I have no hesitation in saying, and all sensible fishermen will agree, that that is the proper approach in the interests of the conservation of fish stocks.  That is my fundamental interest and it is also the fundamental interest of Irish fishermen who want stocks to fish in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is a matter of continuing scientific investigation. Reports come to hand from time to time of the measures that need to be adopted with regard to conservation. For instance, we have taken such a measure in relation to the Celtic Sea and the Community have taken such a measure in relation to the North Sea. Partial herring bans have operated along various parts of our coast.  That applies to other fish also when necessary. The whole effort of fishery policy at present must be geared towards the conservation of fish stocks and that is the only responsible attitude to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am glad Deputy Quinn raised this constructive supplementary question on this matter.  The Department are co-operating with the National Board for Science and Technology in drawing up a list of sites around the coast which are potentially suitable for mariculture.  We have received more than 200 applications already and these are being processed and examined.  The whole area of mariculture is being extended beyond the traditional activity under this heading, which dealt with oysters, mussels, periwinkles and cockles, to include all types of fish.  This will be provided for in the forthcoming legislation in which we will have an up-dating of the law covering mariculture so as to provide for all varieties of sea fish and salmon and to give legal title to people who are approved by licence after inquiry to fish in this manner around our coast, which is very suitable for this <Col N="565" /> purpose.  As part of the EEC fishery negotiations, I have got all the member states, apart from Britain, to agree to a grant of 50 per cent of the cost of all such mariculture ventures.  This 50 per cent grant is confined to Ireland, Scotland and Greenland.  The grant is being made available because of the favourable factors which exist for mariculture around our coast.</P>

Perhaps the Minister can clarify the division between the environment and mariculture as there is a considerable overlap?</P>

      <P>: There must be close co-operation between the Department of the Environment and the universities, the various research organisations <Col N="566" /> and my Department.  It is an area in which there are tremendous prospects in the immediate and long-term. Our climate, coastline and general conditions favour this type of mariculture.  A considerable amount of research has already been done by the ESB, BIM, the Salmon Research Trust and Arthur Guinness and Sons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Provision has been made for the licensing of 64 Spanish vessels to fish for hake only in the waters of EEC member states including Ireland coming within the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, statistical areas VI and VII in the period to 24 June 1978; not more that 41 of these boats may fish at any one time.  This, coupled with reduced quotas, represents a considerable cut back on the fishing effort of Spanish vessels in our waters over recent years.</P>
      <P>In the period 1-24 June 1978, licensed Spanish vessels may take a total of 419 tonnes of hake in ICES areas VI and VII with an associated by-catch of 838 tonnes of other species.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Spanish have traditional fishing rights within six and 12 miles.  It is our main endeavour in the present talks, both bilaterally between ourselves and Spain and between Spain and the Community, to ensure they are eased out of their <Col N="568" /> traditional rights.  These talks are going rather well up to now.  I hope a constructive approach will be adopted towards their eventual conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: They are subject to the Irish provisions.  One important matter is that we have gained an insistence by way of Community regulation that they shall not from now on fish with gill-nets in our waters.  We have prohibited the Spanish from fishing with gill-nets in our waters.  The importance of these negotiations can be emphasised by one figure: that it is estimated now that Spanish vessels fishing in Community waters have been cut down to half by reason of these discussions with Spain over the past 12 months.  That is a substantial achievement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: They have been doing so.  It is symptomatic of what I am saying&mdash;that they have been cut down substantially in regard to licences&mdash;that the Irish Navy has had substantial success in catching and apprehending unlawful and unlicensed Spanish boats fishing in our waters by reason of the fact that the Spanish fishermen themselves have not caught up yet with the very tough licensing régime which we have negotiated with their Government and which the Community have negotiated with their Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I answered the question a moment ago.  We have negotiated a cut-back in the number of Spanish boats fishing in our waters and in Community waters by half, so that there is a 50 per cent reduction. What I have just said to the Deputy if he was listening&mdash;and I want to say it now more slowly&mdash;is that by reason of <Col N="569" /> that regulation a number of Spanish boats have not yet got the message.  That accounts for the fact that the Irish Navy are catching a substantial number of unlicensed Spanish boats whose personnel have not yet got the message from their Government and the Community. But we have negotiated an arrangement which is now being enforced and, due to the prompt action by the Irish Navy in ensuring that the message has got home, I am certain that this policy is proving successful.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): I attended the 47th Session of the Council of Ministers of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) which was held in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The council discussed a wide range of topics in the transport sphere including questions related to international road transport and road safety.  It approved a report concerning new road traffic signs, and adopted resolutions related to better driver training and the wearing of seat belts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of particular interest to Ireland was the decision of the council to increase <Col N="579" /> by 20 per cent with effect from 1 January 1979 the number of multilateral licences for international transport of goods by road.  These licences enable hauliers to carry for reward throughout all the member states of the ECMT with the exception of Finland.  Since the increase amounts to only three additional licences for Ireland, I pressed the council to introduce some compensating allocation of licences which would reflect Ireland's disadvantaged position as an island separated from the European mainland. This view was supported by some other member states and I obtained from the council an undertaking that the basis of allocation of these licences between member states will now be examined by the ECMT.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the proposals he has to curb or eliminate the widespread practice of removing sand from beaches and foreshore around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): My responsibility for the control and prohibition of the removal of sand and gravel and other forms of beach material from the foreshore and seashore is confined to the provisions of the Foreshore Act, 1933.  Beach material, such as sand and gravel, and so on may not be removed from State-owned foreshore save under a licence issued by my Department under section 3 of the Act.  Before licences are issued it is customary in appropriate cases to consult the Garda, the relevant local authority, Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works, who are very much concerned about coast protection because of their responsibility under the Coast Protection Act, 1963. In recent years the general practice in my Department is to prohibit removals <Col N="580" /> by mechanical diggers and to restrict licences to small quantities and to short periods.  A statement showing details of licences issued by my Department in 1977 was presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on 9th May, 1978.</P>
      <P>Where unauthorised removals from State-owned foreshore come to my Department's notice the usual practice is to direct the attention of the persons concerned to the provisions of the Foreshore Act and to request them to give an undertaking in writing that they will not remove further material without a licence from my Department. This procedure normally has the desired effect.</P>
      <P>Where I am of the opinion that removals of beach material have affected or are likely to affect prejudicially any public rights in respect of any area of seashore or have caused or are likely to cause injury to any land, building, wall, pier or other structure, I am empowered under section 6 of the Foreshore Act to make a prohibitory order prohibiting the removal by any person of beach material from the area of seashore concerned, whether publicly or privately owned.</P>
      <P>It is a long established practice in regard to such orders to make them only on the application of the relevant local authority or some other body or individual who will undertake to be responsible for enforcement of the proposed order.</P>
      <P>I am also empowered, under section 7 of the Act, to have a prohibitory notice in writing served on any person prohibiting removal of beach material from a specified area of State-owned foreshore whenever I am of opinion that such removal should be restricted or controlled.  Contravention of a prohibitory order or a prohibitory notice renders a person liable to prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister has asked that this provision should apply in 1978-79.  I am speaking about the effect of this amendment on the Minister's proposals.  There is no part of the Bill that has caused as much controversy as the question of taxation of married women and their general position in relation to the proposals of the Minister.  This question was referred to as far back as 1972 in the report to the Minister by the Commission on the Status of Women.  Chapter 6 of that report dealt with the question of taxation of married couples.  They stated that this matter was referred to most often in submissions received by the Commission and they said that this area was one where there was a widespread sense of discrimination and grievance. After that there was a survey carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  That survey reported that 84 per cent of working married women considered that the most helpful policy to assist married women who were interested in working would be a change in the existing taxation laws.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that the present position where a husband is liable for payment of his wife's income tax would continue on the total joint income of the spouses. That theory of law based on the common law entitlement of a husband to his wife's assets continues unchanged in this Bill.  It does not apply in relation to property rights.  The Married Women's Status Act, 1957, made wide changes in the law ensuring that a married woman's property remains her own throughout the marriage and that it can be disposed of as she pleases.  Nevertheless in the area of taxation we adhere still to the concept that a married woman's income is deemed to be the income of the husband.  He is legally bound to show her income tax on his income tax returns and he is liable for payment of tax on their joint incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Earlier this year that led us to the rather strange circumstances where married women public servants who had been awaiting tax remission repayments were surprised to find that the rebates were made out to their husbands.  There is at least one case to my knowledge where in the case of a separated wife the cheque was made out to her estranged husband. That case has been referred to in the Press.  It stems from the concept that the husband is the person in law who is responsible.  We know that either spouse has the right to refer to the Revenue Commissioners to be separately assessed but the end result is that the married couple pay the same amount of income tax as if they had been taxed jointly.  The only difference is that the allowances are apportioned differently between husband and wife.</P>
    <P>The present system operates unfairly against a working woman because the two salaries are combined and are assessed on the basis of that combined income.  Therefore, they enter a higher tax bracket much earlier than if the two salaries were individually assessed.  There has been some controversy about this.  The Minister has made the point that he does not wish to discriminate against the married woman working at home as distinct from the married woman working in outside industry.  The solution here must be taxation assessed on an individual basis for married couples but the married woman at home should receive an allowance as in France&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: It would be much better if the Deputy waited and debated this matter on the section.  The amendment is a very limited amendment.  It is that the provisions of the section will apply in 1978-79.  We can dispose of the amendment and then the Deputy may make his case on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am speaking of the effect of this mode of collection applying in the year 1978-79 and I am speaking of these anomalies, anomalies referred to as far back as the Commission on the Status of <Col N="621" /> Women, and the inequities arising from them.  These inequities remain unchanged with this amendment and this section.  The Commission on the Status of Women said that the present difference in income tax treatment between the various conjugal categories discriminate against married women who have the right to expect that the same rate of personal allowance will be extended to them as to single persons.  They accordingly recommended that a standard rate of personal allowance be introduced to apply equally to all irrespective of status. They also made the point that earned income relief for a husband should be allowed only against income earned by him.  There is a bit of controversy about the relative costs involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already been in the wars in regard to the matter covered by this amendment and it would be helpful if he would clear the air early in the discussion, so to speak, with regard to his intentions in bringing in equity in the mode of taxtion covering this whole section because the section, even with the addition of this amendment, does not alter the situation to which I have referred. There is still inequity.  Even comparing it with the British system, which is largely similar, the fact is the British system operates more equitably in the taxing of married women.  All these submissions are in the possession of the Minister and one would expect that in dealing with this amendment he would indicate his general view as to what should be done in this area.  So far he does not appear to be responding to the submissions made over many years in regard to reform in this area.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is quite clear.  As Deputy M. O'Leary said, the Minister has been in the wars in recent months about the amount of tax paid by married couples.  What I am trying to do here is to start off on the road to reform.  I know the Minister will argue that he has substantially raised the allowance for married people in the budget.  In fact, as one moves up the scale from one rate of tax to another the gap between what a single person pays and what a married couple pay grows wider all the time.  As they move up the scale the gap becomes very much larger than the difference in their incomes.  A single person with £900 a year&mdash;I am not taking account of any other allowances for the sake of simplicity&mdash;will now pay £7 in tax while a married couple with £1,800 a year will pay £14 in tax. It appears reasonable that the tax on £1,800 should be twice that on £900 but when one comes to the single person <Col N="623" /> with £2,500 a year and the married couple with £5,000&mdash;these are not enormous salaries&mdash;the single person will pay £397 and the married couple will pay £1,005 a year.  That is almost 30 per cent more.  If one goes higher to the married couple with £10,000, whether composed of one or two salaries, that married couple will pay £3,257 while the single person with £5,000 will pay £1,270.  The married couple will pay three times as much tax as the single person.</P>
    <P>This is a cause of grievance and what I propose is that each rate of tax should be increased this year by 25 per cent, next year by 25 per cent and so on so that married couples with one or two salaries will not be paying a disproportionate amount of tax as compared with the single person.  If my amendment is accepted a single person earning £2,500 a year will pay £377 as against £397 under the Minister's proposal, a reduction of £20, and the married couple who at present are paying £1,005 will pay only £925, a reduction of £80 in their tax bill.  If the Minister does as I suggest he will get a great deal of credit from people who for various reasons have to go out to work.  They are not all in the well-heeled bracket by any means.  Every Member has had experience of numbers of married women coming to their clinics, telling them they are doing quite ordinary jobs simply because they have to work.  Husbands are not earning enough to keep the home together. These women are discriminated against because a far greater proportion of their salaries goes in tax as compared with the single person earning the same amount.  Deputy O'Leary touched on this and the case has certainly been very well made that in justice we must move towards giving married people, with two salaries coming in, a fairer crack of the whip where tax is concerned.</P>
    <P>At the moment the top rate of tax is 60 per cent.  I am proposing that that rate should be reduced to 50 per cent.  When we came into office in 1973 the top rate was 80 per cent. Over a certain figure, of everything a person earned 80 per cent went back to the State.  This was clearly a disincentive. <Col N="624" /> We had very strong representations when we were in Government from all sorts of bodies to have this penal rate of tax abolished and in the 1977 Budget we reduced it from 80 per cent to 60 per cent and took other measures to assist industry and encourage incentive as well as measures to encourage people to be inventive and create more jobs. This is one of the things we did in that budget which was beneficial in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am now proposing that incentives should be further extended by making the top rate of tax 50 per cent instead of 60 per cent.  Many people who are not earning great salaries are paying tax at the rate of 60 per cent.  This interferes with the amount of effort and work they are willing to put into their jobs.  I propose that the £500 rate of tax should be £625, the other rate should be increased by 25 per cent, and the top rate of tax should be 50 per cent.  Section 2, as drafted, does nothing to ease the tax burden on married couples.  What I suggest will be the first step on the road to bringing more equity into the amount of tax paid by single persons and by married couples where one or both are earning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy Barry said he proposed this amendment as a first step on the road to reform.  The fact is that the first step on the road to reform has been taken in this Bill.  I hope to deal with that in more detail on the section.  At the moment we are dealing with Deputy Barry's amendment, which would have the effect of increasing the rate bands and reducing the top rate of income tax for all married taxpayers.  The cost would be about £35 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the increases in the income tax allowances provided for in this Bill are costing almost £100 million in a full year, £97.6 million in fact.  The addition to that of another £35 million is simply not possible. It should be realised that the increases being granted and the bulk of them are going to all married couples&mdash;are very substantial.  In fact, the increase of £630 in the married allowance provided <Col N="625" /> for in this Bill is seven times bigger than the largest increase ever given in the past and that was last year.  The increase of £200 in the single allowance is about four-and-a-half times the increase in that category last year.  The married allowance is now double the single allowance for the first time since 1955-56.  At that time the allowances were £150 and £300 respectively.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to take into account the fact that the increase in the personal allowances, combined with a pay increase of 8 per cent, will give an increase in weekly after tax income of £7.88 or 13.2 per cent to a married man with two children who has average industrial earnings of about £70 a week.  As I say, I do not want to get into a discussion on the matters which arise on the section on this amendment.  Having regard to the fact that the increases in the allowances provided in this Bill are so very substantial and so vastly bigger than anything ever given before, and benefit every married couple, it is a little unrealistic to suggest they ought to be substantially increased.  In particular having regard to the extent of the increases being given a proposal which would cost an additional £35 million in a full year is not acceptable and I do not think Deputy Barry really expects me to accept it.</P>

      <P>: No.  We want to get into the position&mdash;and I think the Minister accepts this; it is the timing which is in question&mdash;whereby a married couple both of whom are working, and for argument's sake let us say they are earning the same salary, do not pay a greater proportion of their joint salaries in tax than they would if they were two single persons.  Obviously if what the Minister said about the cost is correct, it would not be possible or feasible to <Col N="627" /> do it all in one jump.  Therefore, we must move towards that position over a number of years.  The Minister says what I propose would cost £35 million in the current year.  If we wait until next year to start on this road&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: By increasing the allowances.  As the Minister knows, this is not where it bites hardest.  It bites hardest when they move from one tax band to another and where at a certain stage they have to pay over 45 per cent of the second income.  If married couples fell within the 20 per cent rate the problem would not nearly be so severe, nor would there be such an outcry about it.  There are about 70,000 homes with two incomes going into them.  The second income is liable to be taxed at 35 per cent, 45 per cent and sometimes 60 per cent.  It would be more equitable in the treatment of this second income to do as I propose in this amendment.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to take the whole lot in the one jump. I am asking him to do it gradually over a period of years.  I would like to hear him say that the increase of 25 per cent is too much in any one year but that he would consider half of that, a 12.5 per cent increase in the rate this year and another one next year.  I would be happy to withdraw my amendment if I could get an indication from the Minister that he would consider for this year an amendment less costly than the one I have put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy Barry may be overlooking the fact that the Bill as it stands goes a considerable distance along the road to achieving what will not be a fully satisfactory position but will certainly be more satisfactory than we have had.  It achieves this at a cost of £20 million in rough terms on the basis of the figures I have mentioned earlier to the Deputy.  Any proposal to go beyond that has to be viewed in the context that it is a proposal to go beyond that.  Deputy <Col N="628" /> Barry accepts that we cannot do it all in one year.  We have made a very substantial stride this year.  As far as the Government are concerned, that is what we promised to do in our election manifesto and that is what we are doing in regard to this allowance.  I certainly cannot contemplate going any further along that road this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate the fact that the allowance for married couples has been increased this year, but that is at the very bottom rate and it is the people at the upper rates who have the greatest cause for complaint.  Where both partners in a marriage are working the vast bulk of the second salary would be taxed at the 35 per cent rate. The provision in the section for splitting the allowances does not affect the total tax position.  A lot of these second salaries are taxed probably at 45, 50 and 60 per cent. Even though the marriage allowance has been increased in the Finance Bill of this year, the people affected most by this are not getting as much benefit out of it as would a single person or a married couple who are on the minimum scale of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: What Deputy Barry says is probably true, but is not this the right approach?  Are not the people most seriously affected those who are on the lower incomes?  They are more seriously affected by the extent to which tax is deducted from their incomes.  If one is taking steps on this road is that not the right place to take the first step?  That is where we have done it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is true, but I would like the Minister to consider a married couple with an income of £5,000.  The Minister will agree that in 1978 this is not a huge income; it is £100 a week, but that couple are going to have to give £20 of that in tax, whereas two single persons each earning £2,500 a year will be paying only <Col N="629" /> £16 a week in tax.  A married couple are £4 minimum worse off than two single persons earning the same amount of money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: In respect of what Deputy O'Leary said, I indicated that I intended to say something on the section in regard to the matter.  Firstly, to reinforce what I have just said in response to Deputy Barry, in our election manifesto we set out precisely what we proposed to do in regard to these various allowances in taxation. There is the question of discrimination in so far as it exists in the tax system and steps will have to be taken on this. In what we have done we have taken steps along what in rough terms could be measured as being about one-third of the way in dealing with the discrimination which exists.  That discrimination is not against women, married or otherwise, but in so far as there is a discrimination it is against married couples.</P>
      <P>The definition of discrimination in the tax system very often seems to depend on a person's circumstances. Many single people may regard the additional allowance given to widows as discrimination against themselves. Widows on the other hand may regard the much more substantial allowance given to married couples as discrimination against them, the widows.  Married women who have an income of their own, and particularly if they earn it outside the home, may regard the system we operate as discriminating against them.  On the other hand, when a division is made between the allowances of the husband and wife it is possible that some husbands will regard what we are doing in this section as discrimination against them because it will reduce the amount of their tax-free allowances while increasing those of the wives.  Therefore, a great deal depends on where you sit as to what is or is not discrimination in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> I stress that the tax-free allowance for a married couple contained in this Bill and promised in our election manifesto affects all married couples. As we said in the manifesto, reducing taxation on married couples not alone helps to maintain the living standards of families; it is also a major step towards ending discrimination in the tax treatment of married women.  That is the first step.  We are taking two other steps this year.  There has always been a provision whereby a spouse could apply for a separate assessment, but heretofore if that happened the allowances were divided between the husband and wife in proportion to their respective incomes.</P>
    <P>This section provides that an application for separate assessment may be made by either the husband or the wife without the consent of the other. In such a case where the application is made the basic personal allowances, instead of being divided in proportion to the incomes, will be divided equally between the spouses and the benefit of the balance of taxable income will also be divided equally between the spouses.  Expenditure-related allowances, such as relief in respect of life assurance premiums, will continue to be granted to the spouse incurring the expenditure, or where that expenditure is shared between the spouses it will be divided in proportion to each one's share of the expenditure.  In any case in which the income of a spouse is less than the allowance allocated to that spouse then the balance of the allowances would be transferred to the other spouse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is a problem that is common to every taxpayer under PAYE at the beginning of the year. On the basis on which it operates, and the assumption that the income of each spouse will be X and Y respectively, then the adjustment can be made at that time.  I would like it to be noted that either spouse may claim the separate assessment and that the consent of the other spouse is not necessary.  Secondly, it is important to point out that opting for separate assessment does not alter the total amount of tax borne by the couple.  It apportions the tax between the spouse and makes the individual spouse accountable for the amount of tax apportioned him or her separately.</P>
      <P>A claim for separate assessment for any year must be made within six months, before 6 July in that year of assessment.  It must be made between 6 January and 6 July.  For the current year an application would have to be made before 6 July 1978.  In the case of persons marrying during the course of the year of assessment if they make an application for separate assessment in that year they can make it at any time before 6 July in the following year.  Once the application is made it remains in force for future years until it is withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of married women in receipt of income in their own right is estimated to be about 100,000 and of these approximately 70,000 pay tax under PAYE.  There are about 250 cases of separate assessment outside of PAYE.  We do not have accurate information as to the number of separate assessments within PAYE but it is tentatively estimated that the overall number of separate assessments in this case is about 1,500.  Therefore, the first step this year is the substantial increase in the married allowance which is benefiting all married couples. The second step is the provision in this section enabling either a husband or a wife to apply for separate assessment with the consequences I mentioned. The third one is an administrative one.  I have made arrangements whereby notices are being or, as has happened in many cases, have been sent out to married women where the <Col N="632" /> Revenue Commissioners are aware of the fact that they have an income. That notice explains the provisions of this section and the consequences of making an application.  A simple application form is provided for people to apply if they want to have separate assessment.</P>
    <P>For a long time I have believed that although the law provided for separate assessment many people probably did not know this.  It is also true that many people will know about it as a result of these notices but may not apply because the circumstances in each case will be best judged by the couples themselves.  I want to make certain that anybody who may wish to do this will be aware of the fact that they can do it.  On this whole question which has been controversial for a considerable time I should like to make a few other points.  I do not claim to know the full answer to the problem that arises in this regard.  I have invited suggestions from people as to the best way to deal with this matter.  I have outlined a system of income splitting but I do not say, and never have said, that that provides the full answer.  It goes a considerable distance in so far as it would ensure equal treatment between husband and wife and at the same time it would not discriminate against the one-income family and in particular against the wife who is working at home without pay.  It would overcome that difficulty but a number of others still arise.</P>
    <P>I have never claimed that I have the answer to that because I have not. One suggestion that has been made on occasions&mdash;it was made today by Deputy Michael O'Leary&mdash;is that in order to overcome this problem we should treat the husband and wife who are out working and earning an income in exactly the same way as we would treat two single people.  It has been suggested that we should deal with the wife who stays at home by paying her a cash allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is not an answer to the problem.  There are a number of snags to it and I will not delay the House by going into detail about them but I should like to outline some obvious difficulties.  Leaving aside the most obvious difficulty of finding the money, the first difficulty is : at what level do we set the cash allowance? Another is : what criteria do we use to set it?  Should we pay the same cash allowance to all women working at home, irrespective of their family circumstances?  If we do, whatever else it is, it is no substitute for an income tax allowance which is related to the earnings.  Those obvious difficulties make me say that that is not an answer to the problem.</P>
      <P>I believe that most important progress can be made if we aim at a system of income splitting which in the past I gave some details about publicly. We have taken a substantial step in respect of this in the Bill.  Deputy Bruton asked whether we were committed to income splitting.  I regard this as an aim we should have.  We are working towards it and it is our intention to continue to work towards it.  I must stress that we cannot give and have not given a commitment as to when the very end of that road will be reached. It is our aim to move along that road on which we started this year.  I noted in some public comments that some people think that I first referred to income splitting after and as a result of the issuing of certain legal proceedings. I have no desire to comment on those legal proceedings.  All I want to say is that I was unaware that they had been issued when they were issued&mdash;not for some time after was I aware of it.  When I first made a reference to income splitting at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis the proceedings had not been issued.  Any suggestion that my reference to income splitting was brought about by the issuing of such proceedings is unfounded.  Deputy P. Barry referred to well-heeled women.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: We all know quite a number of well-heeled women.  Is it a criticism of them to say they are articulate? If anything, I would think it is a compliment.  What is a criticism is to say that they are pressing for a solution to their own problems which will discriminate against one-income families.  Is it not very strange how all these articulate people tried to convey that I was criticising articulate women or well-heeled articulate women and covered up the real criticism?  The whole point of what I said was that you could expect well-heeled articulate women to be fighting for their less well-off sisters.  However, they were fighting for themselves and to hell with their less well-off sisters.  That was the whole point of what I was saying.</P>
      <P>I do not accept, I have not accepted and I will not accept that it is a solution to this problem to discriminate against women who work at home. That is why what we have done here and what we will do in the future will be for the benefit of all married couples, not merely those with two incomes.  It was also interesting to note that, when some of the people who have been so vociferous in this regard finally took aim at what I had been talking about in regard to income splitting, they did not say, &ldquo;Well that is in the direction we want to go; hurry up&rdquo;.  They said, &ldquo;We made you say it&rdquo;.  Of course I had said it before they criticised me and they did not know what I had said.  It is very interesting to see the reaction and the cover up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that anybody who makes the case that I was criticising must explain why.  That applies in this House as well as outside it.  They should explain why we should treat a married <Col N="635" /> couple with two incomes better than a married couple with the same income which comes from one of the spouses.  It cannot be justified.  I would be interested to hear arguments justifying it.  I have heard one or two honest people trying to argue it and I was not convinced by their arguments. Most of the people I have heard on this topic have not attempted to justify that proposition.  Until it is justified the only line to take is the one we have been taking and intend to continue taking.</P>
    <P>What we have provided in this section does not alter the amount of tax payable by a married couple. What we have provided in the Bill does alter it by reducing substantially the amount of tax payable by a married couple. In this section all we are doing is to provide for what happens when there is an application for a separate assessment. Normally it would be by the wife but not always.  In such a case the basic personal allowances would be divided equally.  If there was any to spare on either side it would be transferred to the other spouse.  That is a departure from what has been done heretofore when the division was made in proportion to the respective incomes. Combining that with the substantial increase benefiting all married couples with the arrangements made for the notices to be issued to all married women with an income of their own of whom we are aware so that they know what is happening and what the consequences will be, we have taken a substantial step in trying to solve this extremely difficult problem.  I do not claim to have all the answers and I would welcome suggestions from any quarter, inside or outside this House, that would help to provide a full solution to the problem.  I can say it requires a good deal of thought even to recognise some of the problems that will arise, but even a great deal more thought has not so far yielded a solution to all of those problems.  In so far as we can see a solution, this section, in the context in which I have mentioned it, represents a substantial move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister's <Col N="636" /> own notorious remarks evoked the heat they did because the impression was conveyed to women that he was, for financial reasons, seeing additional difficulties.  The Minister makes the point that it is not a solution to give the married woman working at home an allowance; that there are difficulties there.  I readily concede there are difficulties but they are not insuperable. The matter could be made the subject of more detailed investigation so long as the principle was acceptable.  It is correct to say that the right to a separate assessment has existed up to now. I agree with the Minister that it has not been utilised in the past because women have not been generally aware that the right existed, or the right has not been sufficiently publicised.  The figures the Minister gives would indicate that there is not general awareness of that right.</P>
      <P>The basic injustice on which all the women's organisations have agreed is the aggregation of the husband's and wife's salaries for income tax purposes and that is not affected by anything we have here.  Therefore, the constant submissions which have been made by the Commission on the Status of Women onwards, by the more recent representations of the women's representative committee, still retain their validity.</P>
      <P>Under the present law a married woman's income is deemed to be that of her husband and he is the one who is liable to the payment of income tax on their joint income.  In the most recent switch over to PAYE in sections of the public service&mdash;teachers and so on&mdash;the rebates went to the husband because that was the legal position. That is the kind of absurdity obtaining in our present system.  There is no doubt that it is felt as a deeply resented injustice&mdash;and this movement will grow &mdash;by married women, that when they go out to work they, as they see it, are penalised by our system, their work is given a lower value than that of other people.  Obviously that kind of situation must be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our period in Government we took the first statutory steps to roll back the inequalities under which women laboured, as citizens at work, and so on.  Therefore, we had the Equal <Col N="637" /> Pay Act and the Equality in Employment Act; we now have a permanent watchdog over this whole area in employment, the Employment Equality Agency.  Of course, the reforms of last year will not satisfy the demands of this year.  This Government must move into the new area of equality on the question of taxation, difficult and complex though that area may be.</P>
    <P>The income-splitting approach of the Minister does not face up to the major issue, as I have explained it already. Indeed, if we were to look at income-splitting systems in other countries, if we were to take the near example of the British one, one could only say that that system appears to operate in a more equitable manner in regard to the taxation of married women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: They do not go in for income splitting, except to a limited extent, not in the way the Deputy is describing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: It appears to operate in a more equitable manner under the variant adopted in Britain. Under the British system a married couple may opt for joint or separate assessment, the total tax payable by a couple taxed jointly is less, except at the higher levels of income, than it would be if the husband and wife opted to be taxed separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the Minister comes up with an equitable system I agree that quite a lot of work will need to be done. The critics of the system may be eloquent in terms of their criticism of its present shortcomings.  The Minister may say : where are your proposals for operation in this area?  We would have less controversy, misunderstanding, a great deal less heat in this area if the Minister was ready &mdash;either by commission or otherwise&mdash;to indicate his agreement to the principle of separate tax assessment for people who are married. It would certainly end the situation so often referred to that, at certain income levels, two people living together without benefit of clergy, are in fact better off than the conventionally married couple.  But natural justice is offended throughout this system. <Col N="638" /> Let us take the case of the articulate woman, a well-qualified woman whose work is assessed on a different basis from that of her husband.  If the Minister could indicate his agreement to the ending of that inequitable situation, if this could be gone into by this commission, to void the question, as he sees it, of introducing further discrimination into this area as between the woman at home and the woman out at work, some progress could be made. The woman at home undoubtedly works also.  Perhaps for a society that has been so eloquent on the importance of matrimony and the family we have done too little to give the mother in the home, acknowledged as she may be in the rhetoric of the Constitution, too little by way of cash reward and benefit.  Clearly one of the elements in the final settlement of this matter should be consideration of an allowance for the married woman working at home to avoid what the Minister fears, the institution of further discrimination between that woman and her working sister outside in industry or the professions.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was willing to indicate broad agreement to an approach along those lines&mdash;having at its centre the question of giving absolute equality under the taxation code, to the married woman at work and all other people at work, a good deal of progress would be made.  But the fact that the Minister is seen to stop short of this commitment, that he does not acknowledge the natural justice of the points made by women's organisations accounts for a great deal of the misunderstandings created by his remarks in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I just want to say briefly&mdash;I thought I said it before but I may not have made it clear judging by something Deputy O'Leary said&mdash; the position is, as Deputy O'Leary stated it, in relation to a husband being liable for his wife's tax and so on.  The important point to understand is that where separate assessment is claimed, then the husband is liable for his tax, the wife for hers and, in the case of any refunds due <Col N="639" /> to the wife, they will go to the wife, or to the husband, they will go to the husband.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: For the purpose of assessing the tax, yes, and any other step is one that raises all the hares we have been talking about.  But it is particularly important that married women who are earning and who feel &mdash;and I understand why they would feel&mdash;a sense of injustice in this area understand that that whole problem can be avoided by applying for separate assessment.  That is one of the reasons I have instructed the Revenue Commissioners to send out a notice to all such women, of which we are aware, in order to bring it to their attention that they can obviate this fairly major difficulty&mdash;according to Deputy O'Leary; and I think he is right&mdash;by applying for separate assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are two points in regard to that.  Suppose one of them defaults on payment, is the other liable?  We should get it clear at this stage exactly what is meant by income splitting.  The Minister seems to have one idea and Deputy O'Leary another.  What I understand by income splitting is that the total amount of money coming into a house is divided equally, is halved between the two earners and they are both assessed as single people.  Is that the Minister's understanding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Not quite, but I will try and spell it out in a little more detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: At present a married couple earning say, £5,000 a year&mdash; which is not an enormous amount of money&mdash;whether it be one salary or two salaries are paying at the 35 per cent rate; £1,770 of their income is liable at the 35 per cent rate whereas in the case of two single persons in the same category earning, say, £2,500 each, only about £270 of their income would be assessable at the 35 per cent rate.  This is what gives rise to a sense of grievance all the time where both partners are working, that <Col N="640" /> so much of the second salary going into a house is taxed at the top rate. This is what causes the sense of grievance and resentment.  Of course, as the Minister says, there is more discrimination against married couples rather than against married women as such.  Perhaps it is because of the atmosphere in which we were reared that we accept that people make sacrifices when they marry, that they do not have the same amount of money available to them as they would if they were single.  But the wife who then goes out to work and sees perhaps 45 per cent, 50 per cent or even 60 per cent of her salary, of what she considers she is earning every week, being taken away from her feels a sense of resentment.  This is where all the resentment is felt.</P>
      <P>The reform to which the Minister refers in section 2 which allows for separate assessment is fair enough.  I wish the Minister better luck with it than we had when we introduced the modest reform whereby a house could not be sold without the permission of both spouses.  I thought this was a small step along the road to reform until I was abused one night at a party by a man who had no less than three houses but resented bitterly the fact that he had to tell his wife before he sold the house in which they were living.  He thought we were losing the run of ourselves in allowing liberated females into the male preserve of disposing of property without recourse to what should be the normal relationship between man and wife.  The Minister is right that this is good, but we must not think that it will mean any less tax being paid by married couples.  Separate assessment will be available for either spouse and in most cases the woman will be availing of this section to obtain a separate assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: My first point is on the informational aspect of the problem. When he began his remarks on the section the Minister pointed out that the number of married women who were assessable paying tax under PAYE or otherwise was 100,000.  This is the same answer which he gave me in reply to a parliamentary question <Col N="641" /> on Tuesday, 14 February 1978.  In that question I also asked the Minister to state the amount of tax paid by married women assessed under PAYE or otherwise in each of the last three financial periods.  The Minister had to tell me that that information is not available.  We would like to know whether this information can be made available in the future and whether he will instruct the Revenue Commissioners to so organise their statistical service that this kind of information, which is absolutely essential for the formulation of public policy in this area, is available.</P>
      <P>There is a very widespread suspicion among women in general, and married women in particular, that they are contributing a disproportionately large slice of the total income tax take to the Exchequer.  They are not able to put a finger on it because they are only so many individuals.  The Minister and the Revenue Commissioners have the information somewhere in the files.  If it can be obtained or if the information-gathering system can be organised in such a way that this information will be available in the future, we will be able to plan for the development of taxation and fiscal policy on a much more genuine basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry and the Minister have made the point, which needs to be stressed, that this is not a concession in cash terms to married couples.  After the Minister's speech in Dún Laoghaire on 11 March last there was a very widespread public belief that the changes which he would introduce in this Finance Bill, apart from those already announced in the budget, would involve cash savings for married couples and, in particular, for married women.  The practical results of this section can be easily spelt out.  The example I would give is not in the least bit well heeled.  I refer to a husband and wife who each earn around £3,500, which is as close as makes no difference to the average industrial wage.  On the assumption that each of these people qualifies only for the ordinary personal allowances&mdash;I make that assumption because the other allowances, such as allowances for dependants <Col N="642" /> and so on, can be claimed by people who are either married or single&mdash;their tax liability can be calculated roughly as follows : a single person earning £3,500 will pay £746 in tax; a married man whose wife is not working will pay £444.50; a married man whose wife is working will pay £364 if they opt for separate assessment; a married woman, if they do not opt for separate assessments, will pay £1,279.  In the case of a married man with a wife who is working, the liability is £821.50 each, if they do not opt for separate assessment.  In this example, which is not at a very high income level, the married man and his wife each pay more tax than single people or than their colleagues whose spouses do not work outside the home.</P>
    <P>The result of this section is that all the Minister has done is to lessen the tax burden for the working wife but it does not remove discrimination against her and it increases the tax burden for the husband with a working wife, especially if the wife opts for separate assessment.  The result is that husbands and wives who are both working are equally discriminated against, not equally privileged.  The net point&mdash; and this is what the discussion is about&mdash;is why a man whose wife is working should have a smaller take-home pay than all his other colleagues. The same is true for a married woman. We would hold that tax discrimination is a discrimination against working wives since the contribution which they can make to the family income if they happen to be married to another wage earner is less than that which can be made by any other person in the household, such as a son, a daughter or a lodger.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I do not know if the Minister has cleared up adequately, and this relates to liability for unpaid tax.  I have read the section with some care but to the best of my knowledge it does not seem to remove or to alter section 192 of the 1967 Act, which provides that a woman's income chargeable for tax shall in the case of a married woman living with her husband be deemed for income tax purposes to be his income. The Minister in his initial remarks <Col N="643" /> said that this section makes the individual spouse accountable for the amount of tax apportioned to him or her separately.  It is possible that I am not reading the section with sufficient assiduity but I do not see anything in this section which romoves or alters that aspect of section 192 of the 1967 Income Tax Act.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier on, and the Minister has spoken at some length, of income splitting as the goal towards which we should be moving.  It is true that when I spoke on the Second Stage of this Finance Bill I was under the impression, as were many other people, that this piece of window-dressing was income splitting.  The Minister corrected me at the time and I have since found out that he was right.  Even if we are to accept that the Minister is heading towards income splitting, we still have to ask ourselves whether this is the right way of going about it. The Minister was critical of the proposal from this side of the House that we should proceed towards a position of equality and attempt to equalise or to remove the anomaly that would thereby be created in relation to one-income families by introducing a family allowance.  He mentioned two difficulties in relation to such family allowance: the problem of deciding the level at which we should set that allowance and the problem of deciding the criteria to be adopted in deciding who should get it.</P>
    <P>With due respect, it seems that the problems the Minister has mentioned &mdash;no doubt he could mention others as well&mdash;although reasonably substantial are not as substantial as the rolling tiers of anomaly that one creates by aiming at any situation which does not achieve simple equality.  The answer to the basic problem that he outlined, that perceived discrimination depends on where you stand, is ultimately that of treating people as equals and of making special allowances to people in special circumstances and notably to persons with families.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 26 March shortly after the Minister's Dún Laoghaire speech, some of the problems about the Minister's solution <Col N="644" /> were raised in an article by William O'Dea, lecturer on law and taxation. Mr. O'Dea incidentally was also under the impression that income splitting was about to be introduced in the Finance Bill.  He argued, if I may quote, that:</P>
    <P>... the Minister's proposals will, if implemented, discriminate further against unmarried income earners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is another of the anomalies I have talked about</P>
    <P>&mdash;The fact that the unmarried earner is already discriminated against under our income tax laws does not provide its own justification and this proposal to increase the discrimination against unmarried income earners surely calls for some explanation.</P>
    <P>If it is felt that married workers, for example, should be paid substantially more than unmarried workers who do precisely the same job, then this should be done simply by introducing substantially different salaries for the same work according as to whether it is done by a married person or a single person.</P>
    <P>If this were proposed openly,&mdash;&mdash; so he says and I think he is right</P>
    <P>&mdash;I am sure that it would run into a great deal of difficulty and would be extremely hard to justify. Yet it is being done, in substance, through the back door.</P>
    <P>Finally, it may be asked how the Minister's plan is going to be financed. If it is to be financed through increased taxation then part of the benefit to married people will be claimed back and the single income earner will be further punished.</P>
    <P>If it is to be financed by increasing tax on the self-employed then these will presumably have to be taxed at higher rates than others. This is discriminatory and anyway would be in direct contravention of the stated intention of the government to rely on and encourage private enterprise as the main vehicle of economic growth.</P>
    <P>These are serious and reasoned criticisms of the direction the Minister <Col N="645" /> is taking aimed at reaching a situation in which some kind of income-splitting arrangement were to be created, an income-splitting arrangement&mdash;and this might be emphasised&mdash;which still does not concede any right to a married person to be taxed on his or her own income.  I should like the Minister to comment, first, on the informational side of the thing; secondly on the specific fact that this is merely window dressing but a little bit more than that in a negative sense which I hope to mention in a moment; and, thirdly, on the very reasonable criticisms of his plan made by this lecturer.  I wonder what kind of response the Revenue Commissioners' circular will have in 99,000 Irish households&mdash;I presume all of them will get it.  It is putting up, in this scheme as it is being presented to us here, to a married couple the option of a situation in which the wife will be given more money in her pocket and the husband will be given less in his.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were really serious about this, instead of making it an option, he would make it mandatory. As it stands, and if he made it mandatory, he would achieve this internal income transfer in the family or between married couples who may or may not have a family&mdash;that is a separate problem&mdash;if he believes it to be important and a step towards equality without causing any bad blood in the family.  As it is, if it remains an option, the Minister is creating a situation in which this may very well damage some marriage relationships.  I believe this is something the Minister has failed to take into account.  There is even the possibility that husbands whose wives opt for separate assessment under these circumstances and who find themselves with a lower take-home pay as a result may take such steps as are open to them to persuade their working wives to cease working and stay at home so that in certain circumstances their former personal take home pay might be restored.  This might be true in situations in which the husband's income greatly exceeds that of his wife.  It is an odd way of solving our unemployment problem and certainly <Col N="646" /> it does nothing for family relationships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to ask a short question about paragraphs (a) and (b), from line 22 onwards.  I gather that the reliefs under sections 143, 145, 151 and 152 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, are not to be included among the reliefs that can be divided in half on application.  I gather that these relate almost entirely to insurance contributions of one kind or another. I should like to know the <i>rationale</i> for allowing a division in half of the other allowances but not of these in relation to insurance.</P>
      <P>I have not an answer to the problem the Minister posed.  Perhaps I have not given it as much thought as most Members of the House would have given it, looking at it from their own point of view, perhaps; but would an answer to the problem be found in the area of introducing what might be described as a non-working spouse allowance?  At present we have a married allowance which is one allowance and is unified.  There is a good deal in what the Minister and others have said, that you do not want to create a situation where by remedying one injustice you create another&mdash;in this case an injustice against married women working at home.  We do not want to create a situation where they would lose out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that they be paid an allowance.  I take it that that allowance would be under the social welfare code, that it would be a direct cash payment to them unrelated to the tax code.  That is one solution, but it seems very clumsy to remedy what appears to be an injustice in the tax code through the social welfare code or some sort of income transfer system. It is getting into the area of circular transfers.  There might be a solution <Col N="647" /> in having a single allowance for every worker and a separate allowance for any person supporting a spouse at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Justice would be seen to be done if a non-working spouse category was created.  The existence of the unified married allowance leaves an area where direct comparisons are not as easy as they might otherwise be. The basic value system which we are trying to put into this Bill is not exactly clear.  If the tax code is based on the principle of non-discrimination, on the basis of equal pay for equal work, it should not discriminate between different people.  If discrimination is out, we cannot discriminate on the basis of need.  However, if we are to gear the tax code to the needs of individual householders, it is necessary to discriminate. One might argue that if we are to talk about meeting needs, that is a matter for social welfare and not the tax code; but it is very harsh to say that.  If the tax code is based simply on a mechanical non-discrimination approach, that is taking a very big step from what has been the traditionally perceived role of the tax code in relation to the various allowances. If we go simply on the basis of non-discrimination, we would in a sense be questioning the <i>rationale</i> of these allowances.  Is there any extra cost to the Revenue in the provisions of section 2?</P>

If there was a wife with a predictable income and a self-employed husband who could earn a lot or nothing in a given year and if they had to apportion their allowance between them at the beginning of the year, they could make a wrong decision either if the husband earns a lot more than anticipated on the basis of past performances or alternatively if he made nothing.  If people make a wrong decision here in good faith what provision is there for remedying that subsequently?</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry asked what I meant by income splitting.  In a speech recently I said that under an income-splitting system each spouse would be regarded as entitled to and chargeable on half of the couple's total income and would receive a single person's tax allowances and reliefs and that under income splitting the benefit of the lower rates would be transferable from wife to husband or <i>vice versa</i>.  Incidentally, as a result of this transferability of reliefs, in many cases where couples are both earning, income splitting would produce a better result than would treatment as single persons, which some people have been seeking.</P>

      <P>: As it came across to me it seemed to be different.  If this is the same thing I am sorry.  What the Deputy was saying was what I had in mind by income splitting.  A question was raised by Deputy Horgan <Col N="649" /> about whether it was true that if there was an application for separate assessment in such circumstances each spouse would be responsible for his or her tax and entitled to his or her refunds if there were any.  I refer the Deputy to section 197 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  It reads:</P>
      <P>If an application is made for the purpose in such manner and form as may be prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners, either by a husband or wife, within six months before the 6th day of July in any year of assessment, income tax for that year shall be assessed, charged and recovered on the income of the husband and on the income of the wife as if they were not married, and all the provisions of this Act in respect of the assessment, charge, and recovery of tax shall, save as otherwise provided by this Act, apply as if they were not married.</P>
      <P>A suggestion was made that the problems involved in this matter could be solved simply by making a cash allowance to the wife at home and treating husbands and wives who are working as single individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have mentioned some of the difficulties attached to the cash allowance.  I shall have another word to say about that in a moment.  I should like to make it clear that simply treating a married couple as two single people would not resolve the problem. If they are treated as two single people they will not be able to get the benefit of the transfer of allowances that is provided for here.  In most cases the transfer of allowances would arise and they would lose that benefit.  They would be worse off if that were done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The question of what it might cost the Minister is very far back in the minds of most people who discuss this problem, other than the Minister himself.  I said earlier that leaving aside the very important question of money, I was trying to arrive at what <Col N="650" /> would seem to be the most equitable solution and that having arrived at that stage the problem would be to find the money.  We have not arrived at that stage yet.  The line of approach I have indicated towards income splitting does not solve all the problems but it solves more of the problems than any of the other suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I know the Deputy suggested that and I am not ruling it out.  However, I am saying that one would want to think a little further before it is transferred to a commission who will run into the same problem unless there is some possible line of approach.  I have mentioned one of the problems that arises when considering treating husbands and wives as individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cash allowance, I referred to some of the problems that arise in this area.  If the level of the cash allowance to the wife who is working at home without pay is fixed at a certain level, in some cases that would be worth more than her existing share of the married allowance and in other cases it would be worth less. One would find that the problem was not solved.  The alternative is to have a cash allowance, the amount of which is related in some way to the husband's income, somewhat in the same way as the existing income tax allowance is related to his income.  Even if that were done, in the vast majority of cases the <Col N="651" /> wife's actual practical share of her husband's income is very much larger than the amount of the income tax allowance.  That may not be the position in some cases but it is so in the vast majority of cases and there would be a tendency on the part of many husbands, if there was an actual cash allowance of that kind being paid by the State, to say, &ldquo;That is your income, this is my income and we go on from here&rdquo;.  I do not think that people have really thought out the implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not aware of the cash allowance referred to by Deputy O'Leary.  We have examined the tax treatment of married couples in various countries including France and I must say that aspect did not emerge. However, I shall inquire further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have studied various systems and the best one that has emerged so far is income splitting. The question was asked by Deputy Bruton why we are proposing to split <Col N="652" /> equally the basic personal allowances and not other allowances such as relief on insurance premiums, mortgage interest and so on.  The reason is that the personal allowances that are being split equally are general and apply to all married couples whereas the other allowances apply only in particular circumstances.  The intention is to have this of general application in relation to the allowances that are of general application.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton posed the question &mdash;he was not claiming he had the answer&mdash;if we had a separate tax allowance for the spouse working at home and I said I thought we had. That is so.  I want to point out where the basic problem arises when the matter is approached in this way.  If there is an allowance that is half the present married allowance in respect of the wife working at home without pay, how can she get the benefit if she has no income?  As she does not come into the income tax code she cannot be given any benefit by way of an allowance.  Effectively the only way is to give the benefit to the husband who is within the income tax code.  That is one of the basic problems we are facing and that is why people came up with the solution of paying cash. I have outlined some of the problems that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I can see the problem. The other problem is where you get the circular payment if you do it the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is one of the difficulties involved.  Deputy Horgan thought that the issue of this circular, leaving it as an option to people to choose whether to be separately assessed, might lead to trouble in a number of homes and he said I probably had not adverted to this.  I did advert to it.  I am conscious of the problems that could arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister taking the problem on his own shoulders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  Some people may want separate assessment and others may not.  It is important that people should understand the position.  Take the case of a married man getting all <Col N="653" /> the allowances except that his wife, who is also working, is just getting the working wife's allowance of £230.  As a result his take-home pay is bigger than that of the man working beside him doing the same work and only getting a single person's allowance. On the other hand, his wife is in the position that, if she is working beside a single woman who is also getting the single person's allowance, her take-home pay is very much less because there is so much tax deducted from her.  In that case under this section the consequence of a separate assessment will be that the wife's pay will go up and the husband's take-home pay will go down.  It has to be a decision for the couple but, failing agreement between them, it has to be a decision for the individuals as to what way they want to do it.  It is not a decision for the Revenue Commissioners or for the Minister.  I am very conscious of the fact that this could have the effect referred to and we have endeavoured to point this out in the letter that was issued but it is the right&mdash;this is the whole point&mdash;of a married woman to be treated equally with her husband if she so wishes and I am anxious to let her know her entitlement. If she demands equality of treatment she and her husband will have to accept the consequences that flow from that.  That is inevitable.  In some cases it may be unfortunate but we cannot have this kind of equality without the consequences that flow from it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked what the reason is for subsection (8).  It provides for the passing on from the husband to the wife or <i>vice versa</i> of the excess of their allowances.  If their income is not big enough to use up all their allowances the balance will be transferred to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister confirm something for me?  One effect of this section is to allocate to each partner in a marriage in which both partners are working half an income band.  That is effectively the situation. Assuming there is no transfer of allowance each partner will get half the income band.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: So a husband will get only 50 per cent of what he might otherwise have as his right.  Another anomaly is the fact that the section actually creates a situation in which the working husband or wife is now entitled to claim half the married woman's allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: In relation to liability for tax the Minister has cleared up what happens when people opt for separate assessment.  The present arrangement involves no change.  Each separately will be liable for the amount of tax but, where people do not opt, the problem is not solved because the husband will still be liable for his wife's tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: If people are to be effectively liable for tax on their own income surely what is sauce for the couple who opted should also be sauce for those who have not opted.  I raise this because of a particular case brought to my attention the other day. A married woman consituent teaches part-time in the local school and her total income in the last tax year amounted to less than her tax-free allowance and she naturally assumed, and logically she would not have to pay any tax.  She is paid twice a year and after the beginning of the new <Col N="655" /> financial year a cheque reached her and from her income of £260 or £270 a total of £104 had been deducted because her married allowance had been divided by 12 and she was allowed to offset only one-twelfth of the allowance against the tax for the previous year.  She is entitled to a refund.  Now that money has not been lawfully deducted and, in order to get her refund, she has to leave her employment, to fill out only the Lord knows how many forms and get her husband to sign them and, in the heel of the hunt, the refund, if and when it becomes payable to her, without benefit of any interest, will be paid to her husband, if he so requires.  That seems to me to be a procedural inequality and, if the Minister believes that people who opt for separate assessment would also like to be separately taxed he should ensure that there is no room for inequality. I would like him to consider this very seriously.</P>
      <P>The Minister described some of the anomalies that will arise and he advanced solutions or half solutions to the problems we are discussing. He pointed out that there is a particular problem in relation to married couples where the wife is not working because she has no income against which allowances could be transferred and income splitting or separate assessment cannot be used to give her more cash into her hand. She has no cash to start with and, therefore, any one of a number of different solutions will not give her any more cash because they are based on the presumption that she is being taxed and is losing money and the belief that she should lose less than she is actually losing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section has introduced the idea of circular transfers within the family between two married people who are working.  I would be very interested to hear the Minister's comment on the suggestion that, if he is in favour of income transfers within the family, between two people who are working, there is no reason in principle why he should not be interested in income transfers between two people within the family one of whom is working <Col N="656" /> and one of whom is not.  The allowances for dependants have a cash value to the husband who is the sole income earner in a family.  If the Minister is to follow the logic of this section through, he should have no objection to a system in which the cash value of those allowances to the husband is converted to a cash payment to the wife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The whole or half of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Either.  If the Minister is interested in the principle, if he accepts the principle which he is introducing in the section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am trying to be clear on which principle the Deputy is enunciating.  Who is entitled to the cash value of these allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not talking about the entitlement strictly speaking, <i>per se</i>.  In this section the Minister is giving statutory force to a principle which lays down that, in relation to the present situation which we are now changing, there can be a transfer of cash income within the household between a husband and a wife.  This principle is based, apparently, on the fact that they are both working.  Could a case not be made for a similar cash transfer, of what magnitude or proportion I am not sure, between a working partner and a non-working partner?  I would have reservations about this.  We on these benches believe that the problems of family income and family income maintenance are more radically solved in the long term by direct subvention to families in need. Does the Minister accept that, having introduced this principle here, he could extend it to other areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: It would appear that, although we now have the statutory right to separate assessments, the end result is that the married couple will pay the same amount of tax as if they were taxed jointly.  The only difference is that the usual allowances are apportioned on a different basis. All we have said seems to strengthen the case for seeking the advice and help of a commission who would make <Col N="657" /> an examination of this entire area.  At least one of the women's organisations asked for such an independent examination of the subject.  Undoubtedly it is a very complex area and one in which theories abound.  At the end it is very difficult to come up with practical proposals for implementation.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister can be right when he says he believes the joint assessment procedure he now proposes to adopt is the best of those he looked at.  I do not think that statement can be accepted fully.  In other countries there are other methods of doing it.  Those methods should be examined and the best working model adopted here.  In the United States and Canada, individuals are taxed separately according to his or her income, and there is an obligation to make a separate return of income.  In the US a married couple can make a joint return of income, in which cases they are treated as one taxpayer, but their aggregate income attracts tax at a lower rate than if they were taxed separately.</P>
      <P>In Australia, the husband and wife must lodge separate returns and they are assessed separately on their respective incomes including their respective share of joint income.  In Sweden, the tax arrangements for married couples were radically reformed in 1971.  Joint taxation was abolished and individual taxation for both spouses was introduced. All these systems could be examined with profit.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would promulgate his belief that the area should be examined by an authoritative body, and his willingness in principle to consider the idea of an allowance being paid to the woman working in the home, this would obviate any danger of building up new walls of discrimination between women at work in outside industry, in offices, or in teaching, and women working in the home.  It is only by such means that advances can be made in this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the silly situation at present that highly qualified women at work in industry, and doing very valuable work, are treated disgracefully <Col N="658" /> in terms of the taxation levels which affect their salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the question of a woman's work in the home, perhaps the procedure should be that an allowance should be paid to her, the allowance to be decided on criteria which would have to be examined by the commission.  It would be unfair, in a sense, to consider such an allowance to be related to the husband's earnings.  This is not the last word on this matter.  It must be examined.  The women's organisations have made this point in their submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labour of women teaching, women in medicine, women in the factory, women in the shop&mdash;and this is a growing number of women in the workforce&mdash;should not be penalised as it is at present.  Less reward should not be theirs, and that is the case at present.  That is the injustice.  Male Deputies may congratulate each other on how reasonable we all are in discussing <Col N="659" /> this matter, but the fact is that women will no longer accept the kind of second-best treatment they have been receiving.  Sooner or later the Minister must meet this just demand of theirs.</P>
    <P>In our period in office we introduced legislation to roll back the prejudices and discrimination which existed.  We put two substantial Acts on the Statute Book.  Under the Employment Equality Act it was possible to set in motion an employment equality agency, an independent agency to see that equality of employment and equality of opportunity are given to women.  It would be illogical for this Oireachtas to enact legislation to bring about equality of opportunity in industry for women under the Equality of Employment Act and still adhere to an antediluvian approach to the idea of women at work and how they are taxed.  That is the problem we must address ourselves to.  We cannot get the final answer to that here this afternoon, but we can decide that a commission be set up to examine this area.  This would mean that we would get answers to certain questions that present themselves regarding what is done in France, how they operate in Sweden, how the system works in Australia and in the US.  It is not as if the Minister and the Deputies in this House had an insoluble problem on their hands.  It is not that this is so complicated a problem that mere mortals could not come up with a solution. There is a solution.  It costs money, of course.</P>

      <P>: The idea of a payment to the woman in the home should be examined, and there should be consideration of separate assessments for the husband and wife.  Anomalous situations created by the present system have been referred to very often. Advance in this area can be best brought forward by setting up a commission. <Col N="660" /> The Minister has said that he does not rule out the idea of a commission in this area.  He should announce here this afternoon his willingness to consider the idea of a commission to examine this area, to get at some of the facts eluding us at present on how this operates in other countries, and to dispel the great element of controversy that surrounds this matter.  Then let us see what will be the relative costs at the end of the day.  We are under no illusion; there are costs attached to this.  But when the Minister was on this side of the House he, very properly, was not deterred from urging in less favourable times that we press ahead with reform in this area.  We now say to him, in an economy which will reach 6 per cent growth this year, that the bill attached to reforms is no excuse now to delay them.</P>

      <P>: We have had a discussion the general thrust of which has been to try to get a fairer tax system for married couples whether the wife is or is not working.  I put forward one suggestion in amendment No. 2 which I thought would go part of the road towards that.  The Minister says that this is not acceptable because of the cost.  The Minister has never pretended that section 2, as drafted, is of any financial benefit to a married couple&mdash;we are all agreed on this.  It may be of financial benefit to a working wife who is paying a disproportionate amount of her salary in tax.  To the couple both of whom are working it is of no benefit.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary suggested that a commission should be set up to examine this area.  I gather that in the examples he read out&mdash;Sweden, Australia and the US&mdash;married couples pay less tax than do two single persons. In the example I gave earlier a married couple in this country pay nearly three times as much tax as a single person earning half their income.  That is obviously unjust.  I am not sure that I am keen on Deputy O'Leary's suggestion of a commission because this Government since they came in have established more inquiries, commissions and review bodies than a mongrel dog has fleas.</P>

      <P>Mr. Colley said that if women's organisations now claimed he had given in to pressure it was because they had not listened to what he had said in the past or had not understood what he said.  He had referred to this system of income splitting in his Ard-Fheis speech but this aspect of his remarks was not reported.  He could not recall now exactly what he had said then.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for those of us who were not in attendance at the Ard-Fheis to know what the Minister said if he was not reported.</P>
      <P>I would be attracted to the idea of income splitting.  I ask the Minister, if the amendment I propose is unacceptable to him, to assure the House that by the time the next Finance Bill comes in&mdash;preferably a long time before&mdash;there will be proposals made by the present Government that will redress, maybe over a period of years but preferably in one year, the situation whereby married couples now pay more tax, in some cases 50 per cent more, than would two single people with the same joint income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister, as reported in the Official Report of 24 May 1978, Volume 306, column 1744, <Col N="662" /> told me just I was quite right in saying then on Second Stage that this would not make any change in the total tax paid by a couple.  He has verified that here today.  We now have to think about the dialogue which we all took part in for the last year-and-a-half.  It was about an extra allowance for married working women.  The women's associations and the women involved were not interested in what the Minister has given.  They were interested in some further recognition of the fact that they went out in the morning to work, did their week's work beside somebody else who was single and did not get the same allowance.</P>
      <P>The situation in regard to families is difficult.  Our tax laws here are based on the income of the family.  Thanks be to God, here in Ireland 90 per cent and more of families exist on an income that is never divided between husband and wife.  There may be some arrangement whereby the wife tries to work on a certain household allowance, but when there is a problem it is the one income for the two people that counts.  This has not been changed one whit.  The dialogue was about an extra allowance for married women.  Women did not want what the Minister gave.  What he gave in respect of 90 per cent, or maybe 99 per cent of the families is nothing, because the income of the husband and wife, who may happen to have separate incomes, is pooled and used for the good of the family, the maintenance of the house and the furtherance of the children's education and everything that goes with it.  The women wanted an extra allowance and that has not been given to them.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto says, on page 6:</P>
      <P>Reducing the taxation on married couples not alone helps to maintain the living standards of families; it is also a major step towards ending discrimination in the tax treatment of married women.</P>
      <P>If my wife and I pool our resources completely, as 99 per cent of the families in this country do, not one whit of change has been effected.</P>

      <P>: It could not matter less if the husband comes home with slightly less and the wife with slightly more if the total income is unchanged. If there is an unhappy situation where the husband spends too much or has recourse to more money than the wife and does not give her enough to provide for the expenses that she has to bear, that is one of the 1 per cent of families whose income is not pooled.  There is no change whatever and that is not what the married working women wanted.  The ultimate paragraph to which I referred is another part of the confidence trick.  Women understood that when income tax allowances for married couples were raised, as happened, they would get an extra allowance if they were working. They have not got that and to that extent the Government have duped them.</P>

      <P>: No.  I said that this section would not reduce the liability for tax of a married couple.  The Deputy was quoting from the Fianna Fáil manifesto which stated that what we proposed to do would be a substantial step on the road to removing discrimination. It is precisely that and for the kind of married couples Deputy Donegan was describing they have got an increase in their tax allowance of £630 which is seven times bigger than the greatest increase in married allowance ever granted before.  That is what they got even though the Deputy said they got nothing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> That is all very well, but how much extra money does it give the husband and the wife?  What is the difference in the tax on the total income? My view is that it makes no difference whatever.  I should like the Minister in his reply to tell us what difference that has made to a couple having a joint income of £5,000.  I am suggesting that the answer is nil.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: The Deputy would be right.  I never suggested that these changes will change the total tax payable by a couple.  They alter the imposition of tax on one as against the other, but I never suggested anying else.</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan: We can take this, then, as a well-heeled window-dressing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to thank the Deputy.  That is what he said on the last occasion and it was correct in relation to section 2.  I was referring to what the Deputy said today, that the great majority of the married couples here are not getting anything.  He quoted from our election manifesto.  I pointed out to him that what they are getting is seven times greater than what they ever got before.  We are dealing with section 2 which does not increase the allowance for a married couple. Section 2 provides&mdash;this is important in regard to what Deputy Donegan and other Deputies said&mdash;that in the case of a working wife who chooses to do so under this section she can divide the very substantially increased allowances. For instance, she can get the benefit of half of the increase of £630 and more.  It is not true to say that her position has not improved but it is true to say that to the extent that her position improved her husband's position will disimprove.  Supposing her position improved and her husband's did not disimprove the consequence of that would be that they as a couple would be treated considerably better than their next door neighbours of whom only the husband was working but who had the same income as they have together.  That is the proposition. If Deputy Donegan or Deputy O'Leary feel that that is right they should say so.  I do not think it is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> In my view in doing that we are discriminating against the one-income family.  That is a wrong thing to do. That is where the whole problem arises.  I am trying to reach a point where we get equality of treatment in the tax code between a husband and wife both of whom are working without discriminating against the one-income family.  It is in that context that I said that the income splitting system seemed to offer the best line of approach and that is the way in which we have moved and the way we aim to move.  Because of something Deputy O'Leary said I should like to make it clear, in case there is any misunderstanding, that I do not accept the principle of cash payments to the wife at home as a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary mentioned this in passing and I got the impression from what he said that he thought I accepted this in principle.  I do not because I cannot see how it would work and it is outside the tax code.  It is an attractive approach and one I thought about.  However, when one examines it one must come to the conclusion that it is simply an effort to find an easy way out of the dilemma with which we are faced.  A cash allowance of that kind in its own right is one thing but as part of the tax code and the solution to the problem we are facing it is not on.  I would not like it to be thought that I said or indicated acceptance, even in principle, of this as a solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary, like Deputy Donegan, seemed to be saying that the working wife is being discriminated against but if the allowances are split, as she is entitled to do under this section, she is not being discriminated against.  She is being treated in the same way as her husband.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: They are both being discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Are they and if so why?  Are they not getting the same allowance between them as their neighbour where there is one income? The only people who can claim that they are being discriminated against in this context are single people and <Col N="666" /> they have a case.  I should like to make it clear that any suggestion that working wives are being discriminated against, given this section and what they can do with the allowances in it, is unfounded.  The working wife can apply for separate assessment without reference to her husband.  She has no liability for her husband's tax and he has no liability for hers.  If there is any refund due to her it goes to her and not to her husband.  She divides the allowances equally with him but she has the advantage that if some of her allowances are unused they can transfer to her husband or <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
      <P>Assuming she is using up all the allowances that are due to her under this system she is treated in precisely the same way as her husband.  She is not being discriminated against in that sense.  Her husband may feel discriminated against because his allowances will go down but if one thinks of that couple and the couple next door with only one income then to do anything else is to discriminate against the couple next door.  I do not want to follow Deputy O'Leary outside the tax code into other matters relating to women's rights but I want to reiterate that within the tax code we have taken a substantial step in cash terms on the road to elimination of discrimination. That is provided for in this Bill in the enormously increased married allowance. In addition, the circular which is being sent out by the Revenue Commissioners to all married women with income informs them of their rights under this section and what the consequences will be if they exercise them.</P>

    <P>Deputy P. Barry quoted from a report which said that my remarks on income splitting at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis were not reported and, therefore, how could they or he know what was said?  In so far as my remarks were not reported, what he says is true. Would he think for a moment about those who purported to attack me vociferously, some of them professional journalists, about what I said at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis if they did not know what I said?  If they did know what I said, what was the basis of the <Col N="667" /> attack except to cover up the criticism I was making and pretend that it was something else?</P>

If the people concerned like Deputy Barry, or journalists who wanted to write on the topic, did not hear it, that is all right, but they should not pretend I did not say it because they did not hear it if they were not listening.  Are they to rely on some newspaper reports, the lengths of which are decided by sub-editors depending on the space available, as evidence of what I said and if it does not appear in those reports then it follows that I did not say it and they are entitled to attack me even though I did say that I referred to income splitting?

      <P>: Hopefully not.  I want to reiterate that the clearest thing that emerges from this debate is that nobody has a solution to all the problems. There may be not be a solution for all the problems.  We must look for the best solution.  I am not ruling out the possibility of a commission, as suggested by Deputy M. O'Leary, but I do not honestly feel that a commission is the answer at present.  The problems are clear enough.  The solution is not one that can be worked out by a commission.  The solution is one that requires political will and understanding by different people that, when they feel they are being discriminated against, they have an obligation to look at what is happening to other people.  We know what the problems are but we do not have a solution.  It seems unlikely that a commission would be able to solve them.  Furthermore, the establishment of a commission at this stage would suggest that a solution to all the problems at the one time is possible.  As of now, that does not appear to be so.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure Deputy M. O'Leary that systems in operation in other countries are not being ignored. I am not aware that any country has found a solution to all of these problems. I believe the nearest solution that has been found is in relation to income splitting.</P>
      <P>If anybody thinks they have the answer to all of these problems I would be glad to hear from them.  I recognise that income splitting does not solve all the problems but I believe it goes further than any other solution that has been put forward. If anybody can produce a better solution, please let me know.</P>

The Minister's thinking on this matter is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the only means we have at present of making direct payments by the State to women working at home is through children's allowances and there was no increase in the children's allowances.  It is hard to reconcile the Minister's expression of concern for the woman working at home with his feeling that she should get a direct payment when the only means at present available were not availed of by the Minister in his budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The leader of my Party has said he finds it difficult to reconcile what the Minister said in one area with what he said in another. I have the same difficulty in relation to the Minister's statement that he does not see a cash payment within <Col N="670" /> the context of the tax code to the woman who does not work outside the home as providing a solution; whereas in this section&mdash;and I know the Minister will correct me if I am mistaken &mdash;what the Government propose should be done is that the cash value of a certain portion of allowances be transferred within the home as cash, or as cash minus some share of tax, to a wife or a husband, as the case may be, who works outside the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy said something similar earlier.  I thought I was misunderstanding him but, since he has said it again, I must be understanding him correctly and, in case he is under a misapprehension, I do not agree with his version of what this section does. It does not transfer any cash at all; it simply transfers tax allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The effect of the transfer of the tax allowance is an objective transfer of cash from one partner to the other which is based on the fact that there are x quantity of allowances and that both partners are working outside the home.  Therefore I am taking that a stage further and pointing out to the Minister that all women work&mdash;some of them work outside the home and get remunerated for it; some of them work inside the home and do not get remunerated for it.  What is the difficulty in following that line down the road and saying that the transfer of allowances, as cash, can take place equally to a woman who is working inside the home and is not otherwise remunerated for it? There does not seem to me to be any logical reason why the Minister is creating this situation in respect of one type of situation and that he should not, in principle at least, be open to the possibility of accepting it for the other type of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have already made it clear to the Deputy that I do not agree with his interpretation of what the section is doing.  I have pointed out to him also&mdash;and I should like to hear him on it if he has anything further to say&mdash;how he would propose to overcome the difficulties I outlined about the cash payment in the context of solving the problem of the tax code <Col N="671" /> we have been discussing.  In other words, how does one fix the amount? Can it vary with the husband's income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: If we were to take a rough rule of thumb, in the case of the wife whose work in the home is not remunerated&mdash;this is the example I am putting up for the attention and comment of the Minister&mdash;if the Minister believes that allowances should be shared one might make a case, although I am not necessarily making it, that the cash transfer within the household to the woman who is not working outside the home and is not otherwise remunerated for it should be equal to half the cash value of that allowance to her husband.  That is just by way of an example.  I do not see why the Minister does not see the logic in proceeding from one situation to the other.</P>
      <P>There are two other brief problems on which I should be grateful if the Minister would comment.  I raised them specifically and he did not comment on them in his reply.  I admit he referred to a lot of items in his reply, and that is possibly the reason.  The first is the question of the liability for the payment of tax in relation to couples who have not opted for separate assessment.  The Minister has argued very strongly that some couples may not wish to opt for separate assessment.  Why should the liability to tax of the individuals in that married relationship be different from the liability to tax of people who have opted for separate assessment? The total tax liability of the couples is the same; they are both working and earning outside the home.  Is it not logical that the overriding justice of assuming that tax liable on the income of one partner is collectible from that partner should apply equally to both cases regardless of whatever detailed arrangements are being made here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted with interest that the Minister said when we talked about the nature of the decision&mdash;that it should be preferably a decision of the couple. But, in this section he is ruling out that option; he is making it the decision of either of the couple.  If my understanding of it is correct, he is changing the statutory position in that previously the <Col N="672" /> statutory position was that it had to be a decision by the couple.  It is now an option available to one of them.  If the Minister believes that the preferable option is that it should be decided by the couple, not by one partner in opposition to or in ignorance of the wishes of the other, why does he not maintain that position?</P>

      <P>: I have listened to the debate for some time.  I should like to ascertain how the Opposition would deal with the problem within the context of the Finance Bill.  Are they not saying that the working wife should get an additional allowance and, if that is what they say, then there is an element of discrimination against the wife who stays at home?  It was always separate assessment that applied before this section but that implied separate assessment in proportion to the total income of each couple.  Section 2 gives the right to either of the spouses to opt to have the allowances divided in half, by whoever pays Voluntary Health Insurance, life assurance and so on. We must consider that in the context that the total married allowance has been increased from £1,100 to £1,730, which is an increase of 67 per cent.</P>
      <P>As was pointed out earlier&mdash;I think it was Deputy Donegan who put his finger on this point&mdash;in most homes the total income of husband and wife is regarded as one and is drawn out of the same pool.  Under this section the total tax payable will be exactly the same as heretofore but it must be looked at in the context of the increased allowances given in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a loss to ascertain what the Opposition are saying.  Are they saying they disagree with this section, that an extra allowance should be given to the woman working outside the home as against the woman working at home? Or are they saying that they do not agree with the section at all, that the old situation should obtain, that the allowances should be apportioned in relation to the total income of each individual spouse?  Under this section the allowances will be divided in half. The unexhausted bands of income will be handed over to the other spouse, as the case may be.  I consider that a very fair system.  Certainly the highlighting <Col N="673" /> in this debate of separate assessment will bring to the notice of more married couples that separate assessment exists and that they should apply for it if they wish.</P>
    <P>There is also the factor that wives who are out working will have disposable income at their behest; the husband will have less, but at least they will know about it.  The number of working wives who will fight for separate assessment are few and far between. In my experience it would be only women who had other income before they married, who are aware of this provision and who have sought advice on it.  I am not too sure about this but I think separate assessment must be applied for before 5 July in any income tax year.  If it could be brought to the notice of the ordinary working wife that she can apply for separate assessment, I am sure a lot of the grievances of working wives would be alleviated.</P>
    <P>The section is a very good one and the Minister has done a great job in introducing the splitting of allowances. I should like to be clear what Members of the Opposition mean.  Are they disagreeing with the section, or what are they saying?</P>

      <P>: The question of increased allowances, generous or ungenerous, gets rid of discrimination as far as the tax treatment of married women is concerned.  What I said, and I hold by it, is that no matter whether the allowances were generous or over-generous what has been done, in effect, has no advantage for the average family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the Minister wants to say that his extra allowances were generous then he can say so.  The manifesto states:</P>
      <P>Reducing the taxation on married couples not alone helps to maintain the living standards of families; it is also a major step towards ending discrimination in the tax treatment of married women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, that is untrue.  Many <Col N="674" /> women's associations and married working women believed before the election that they would get an extra earned-income allowance when they worked outside the home. That is what they believed and that is where they were duped.  Talk about whether the extra allowances were generous or ungenerous does not arise. The fact is that the married women's associations were convinced that an extra allowance would be given to married women who worked outside the home. The Government have not done that. They have created a situation which, in my view, will create more rows and more infuriated husbands than ever before. What nice, decent wife is going to take up a form like the one which my wife received the other morning and decide to fill in that form, with the result that her husband will get less money and she will get more?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree with the Deputy about the infuriated husbands, but is he now saying that there should be an additional allowance for married working women as against the women who work in the home? If wives apply for separate assessment I agree that there will be infuriated husbands.  Is the Deputy now saying that his party are advocating an additional allowance for wives working outside the home, thus discriminating against a single income family?</P>

I will not pursue him very far except to say that the statement in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto about this being a substantial step towards the removal of discrimination was, of course, correct.  Whether Deputy <Col N="675" /> Donegan accepts that or not, there is one thing he cannot deny.  If he looks a little further up that page he will see set out precisely what we said we would do in regard to income tax allowances.  It is what he will find in this Bill.  He will not find anything about an inceased allowance for working wives.</P>

      <P>: I will deal briefly with the point made by Deputy Horgan, that is, the question of the liability situation of those who do not exercise the option of separate assessment.  The legal position is not being changed in regard to liability if there is a separate assessment.  The position under this section is as it was before.  In other words, before if one made the option then liability for the husband's income rested on the husband and for the wife on the wife.  That is not being changed. If we were to do as I think Deputy Horgan is suggesting, that is, apply to every couple where both are working a separate assessment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: One cannot impose the liability for tax payment separately without separate assessment.  That is the difficulty.  Therefore, this would have to be done on a mandatory basis, even though the majority of people would not want that.  That is why people are given the option.  I do not think there can be any real objection to the option. The only objection that has been put up is that it may lead to trouble in some cases, not in most cases but in some.  If it does, it is simply because people will now have to face the reality that the husband has been getting <Col N="676" /> allowances over and above his workmates who are single and as a compensation the wife has been getting fewer allowances than her fellow workers who are single.  Now there is an evening up if they exercise this option.  It may be no harm if people realise that this is the position and that they are paying between them the same tax as their next-door neighbours with the same income.  I trust that it will not lead to too much difficulty in too many homes.  I do not think it will but I acknowledge that it may lead to some difficulty in some homes.  It is the right of the individual. I said that preferably the decision would be made by the couple. By that I meant that they would discuss it and agree and then the wife who is not separately assessed would apply. There is no change in the law on this position, as Deputy Horgan seemed to think.  The position has not been up to now that it had to be a joint decision.  It could be a separate one, as it can be under this Bill.</P>

I wonder why, when the Minister was going to the bother of introducing this miscellaneous provisions Bill he did not avail of the opportunity to have a more comprehensive updating of those Acts.  I have referred in Parliamentary Questions to certain deficiencies in the Acts in regard to the phraseology in one section which does not take account of air transport, which is one of the important means of conveying meat, and the fines have not been revised since 1930.  There are additional powers that I think the Minister should take in relation to the quality of meat and the export of meat and the contents of it, the existence of different antibiotics and so on in the meat which were not heard of and could not have been a problem when the legislation was introduced in 1930 or 1935.  I wonder why the Minister did not deal with these matters also when introducing this Bill. We know there is a great deal of trouble involved in bringing in a Bill of this sort.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 44, after &ldquo;£100&rdquo; to add &ldquo;in the case of a first offence and in the case of a second or subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding £300&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> This is a relatively minor amendment concerning the penalties which may be imposed under the Bill on somebody who fails or neglects to comply with the requirements of regulations under this section.  The section as it stands says that a person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.  The offences concerned would be offences against the new scheme of classification of meat which is to be introduced by regulation under the section.  Obviously, if somebody is involved in circumventing this classification scheme by some fraudulent act he is not just affecting himself but affecting the reputation of Irish meat abroad and affecting credibility in the classification scheme which is being used in respect of that meat.  I can well understand that this might be done by no more than neglect on one occasion and people might not realise that they were engaging in an illegal practice, but if people repeat that offence there is a strong case for substantially increasing the penalty.  It would undermine the whole purpose of the classification scheme if individual factories or others were engaged in this practice.  The Bill as it stands simply provides that if a person is guilty of an offence he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.  There is no provision for an additional fine in the event of a person repeating the offence.</P>
    <P>It will obviously be difficult to detect some of these offences.  My amendment is very modest and one would argue that it should go further. One should be liable in the case of a first offence to a maximum fine of £100 and in the case of a second or subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding £300.  This means that if a person offends a second time, having been caught once before, an increased penalty will be imposed.  Under this provision the maximum fine is £100 and there is no provision for increasing the fine for the second or subsequent offence.  One hundred pounds is not a lot of money these days and a great deal of money is involved in the meat business.  For a person engaged <Col N="680" /> in this sort of activity a fine of £100, if he is caught offending, is not a sufficient deterrent.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister will say that in relation to a meat factory it is possible to withdraw their licence and prevent them from operating, but it might not be a meat factory that is involved in the breach of the classification scheme.  The withdrawal of a licence from a meat plant is a very serious penalty which will affect the innocent and the guilty alike.  Executives of a firm might be involved in breaking the regulations on a systematic basis and if the fine can be increased for repeated offences that would more or less get at the people responsible but if the licence was withdrawn that would put innocent people out of work.  To say that if the fine is not enough we can use the threat of withdrawing the licence is not adequate because of the fact that the consequences, in terms of employment, of withdrawing the licence is so great that no Government will impose it for a breach of the classification scheme, no matter how systematic. We are left with a penalty of £100 for every repeated detected offence and that is not satisfactory. I would urge the Minister to accept my amendment which is very modest as it only increases the fine for a second or subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding £300.  If there is any criticism to be made of my amendment it is that it does not go far enough but if the Minister is prepared to go that far then he will be making some progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support the amendment in relation to a fine not exceeding £300.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Bruton that it might not be enough.  If there are some extenuating circumstances the upper limit of the fine is not binding but in the general sense a fine of £100 is too low.  As has been said it would not be practical to withdraw the licence which is the only other alternative if the regulations are being continually broken.  The amendment has merit and I would ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;In page 2, after line 44, to add the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The supplier of the animal or animals shall have the right to be present while the carcases of his animals are being classified.  This provision shall not apply to the classification of individual cuts of meat but only to the classification of whole carcases.</P>
      <P>(5)  In drafting regulations under subsection (1) of this section the Minister shall consult with all relevant interests in the agricultural and meat processing industries.</P>
      <P>(6)  Where regulations are proposed to be made under subsection (1) of this section a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
      <P>(7)  When draft regulations are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of subsection (6) of this section they shall be accompanied by a statement from the Minister setting out</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) the differences between the prescribed standard systems of description to be used under the regulations and the prescribed <Col N="682" /> standard systems of description in use in systems of classification of the equivalent fresh meat products in each of the Member States of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>(b)  the arrangements being made for the training and supervision of the work of the officers to be responsible for classifying meat or applying prescribed marks to meat under the draft.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is rather complicated. I would have preferred if each of the subsections was taken separately, but they are lumped together.  Each of them raises a separate issue.  The Minister might accept one of the suggestions I am making and not others but as it stands the Minister must either accept or reject the entire amendment.  If the Minister indicates in the course of his reply that he is prepared to accept part of the amendment, we can draft a suitable amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I propose that the supplier of the animal or animals whose meat will be classified shall have the right to be present while the carcases of these animals are being classified and that this provision shall not apply to the classification of individual cuts of meat but only to the classification of whole carcases.  There is a lot of merit in this proposal because naturally farmers will feel that they are not involved in the classification of their carcases. They will know that a classification will have a major bearing on the price.  I know there is no guarantee that a certain price will be paid for a certain classification of beef as to either fat content or the shape of the animal, but the reality is that the factory will, through time, begin to base the payments they are making to the farmers on the classification.  I suggest that the farmer should have a right to be present while his cattle are being classified by the inspector of the Department in the factory.  It might be suggested that this will create difficulties in the factory but my information is that in practice there would be only one or two farmers there at a time because only a certain number of cattle would be classified at any one time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> In the case of the classification of lamb for the French market, this has been a very controversial issue because there is a huge difference in price when the animals qualify for the French market.  In one of the lamb factories in the west that I visited the farmers were present when their animals were classified and they could ask questions if certain animals were not accepted for the French market. It would be beneficial for farmers if they could be present in the factory when their animals were being classified because they would see why some were not acceptable.  This amendment merely gives them the right to be present.  It does not give them the right to any kind of appeal mechanism that could delay the proceedings. The amendment merely states that they have the right to be present while the animals are being classified and, presumably, to ask questions in an informal way.</P>
    <P>The second sentence states that the provision will not apply to the classification of individual cuts of meat but only to the classification of whole carcases. Although the immediate scheme applies only to carcases, we may reach a stage where the powers of the section will be used to classify individual cuts by certain characteristics.  The Minister admitted during the debate on Second Stage that this was possible. As it would not be possible to identify the cut from a farmer's animal by the time the animal was cut, it would not be practical to give the farmer that right other than in the case of whole carcases.  The Minister should favourably consider the amendment and agree to it.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) relates to the consultations in which the Minister must engage in the drafting of the regulations. It states that the Minister shall consult with all relevant interests in the agricultural and meat processing industries.  That is a reasonably broad and flexible provision.  Probably the Minister will consult with the relevant people, but in a matter as complicated as this and where there are so many implications for many people it is appropriate that there should be a provision <Col N="684" /> requiring him to carry out consultations. Such a provision was incorporated in other Bills with which I was connected&mdash;for example, the Consumer Information Bill.  I inserted a provision there that consultations should take place and I hope the Minister will accept that principle here.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) states:</P>
    <P>Where regulations are proposed to be made under subsection (1) of this section a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>This comes back to a point I made during the debate on Second Stage that we were being asked to approve of theses enabling regulations for a classification scheme for beef carcases which the Minister probably has drawn up but yet he is asking us to give our approval to his making those regulations without laying them before us.  In a matter as important as this the regulations should be laid before the House and they should not take effect until we have an opportunity of discussing them.  I am sure the Minister will agree that a debate of this kind is of value and that constructive suggestions may be made by the Opposition.  The basic purpose of the classification scheme is educational and the more publicity that is given to it by means of a Dáil debate the better. Therefore, the Minister should agree to this proposal for that reason, in addition to any question of parliamentary control over ministerial action which is an important principle in itself.  The House should not write a blank cheque for any Minister to enable him to make regulations as he wishes without referring them to the House.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) states:</P>
    <P>When draft regulations are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of subsection (6) of this section they shall be accompanied by a statement from the Minister setting out <Col N="685" /></P>
    <P>(a) the differences between the prescribed standard systems of description to be used under the regulations and the prescribed standard systems of description in use in systems of classification of the equivalent fresh meat products in each of the Member States of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>During my contribution on Second Stage I pointed out that we are proposing to introduce a classification scheme for our beef carcases that is radically different from that operating on the continent.  So far as confirmation of the beast is concerned, we will have seven classes corresponding to the letters of the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;, whereas in France and in Europe generally there will be only six classes of confirmation in their schemes, namely, to correspond with the words &ldquo;France&rdquo; and &ldquo;Europa&rdquo;, depending on whether it is the French or the European scheme.  In addition, our classification scheme does not approximate to their schemes.  I understand that the first three letters of the Irish classification scheme&mdash;the best confirmation from a continental point of view&mdash;correspond with the first letter only of the European scheme.  Our remaining four classes correspond with the remaining five classes of the continental scheme.  That is roughly the situation and perhaps the Minister will contradict me if I am wrong.  Our scheme has a different number of classes and it is different with regard to the distribution of classes between different types of beast.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of the scheme? It is to assist exports to these countries but we are instituting a classification scheme that is radically different from theirs. That does not make sense to me.  I should have thought that if we wanted to sell cattle to continental countries we would have as nearly as possible the same kind of scheme which could be readily understood by our customers on the continent who are using another classification scheme and I, therefore, do not understand why this provision is being adopted. The purpose of my amendment is to <Col N="686" /> require the Minister to spell out, if such differences exist between the classification he is proposing and the one prevalent in the member states of the European Economic Community, those differences so that the differences can be clearly identified and the House can see clearly why there is a difference and what the difference is.</P>
    <P>Presumably, in the course of the debate, the Minister will be required to justify the difference between our scheme and their scheme.  The principle the amendment seeks to achieve, namely, the nearest possible equivalent between our scheme and the continental scheme, is a good one from the long-term point of view.  I know the short-term argument adduced against our scheme&mdash;a six letter scheme nearly the same, or the same, as the continental scheme as to the distribution of different classes and different types of animal&mdash;is that, if we were to adopt the continental scheme, very few Irish cattle would get into the &ldquo;E&rdquo; or, perhaps, the &ldquo;U&rdquo; classes which are the &ldquo;best&rdquo; scheme, the best types of animal on the continent.  This will show us in a bad light and therefore, we have a scheme not so easily understood by people on the continent so that we will not be shown in a bad light.</P>
    <P>This is a contradiction of what we are trying to achieve, namely, the greatest possible understanding between the producer here and the consumer on the continent as to what the latter wants.  If you bamboozle the consumer on the continent by having a scheme very different from theirs, not knowing exactly what the top grade Irish animal, namely, the one in the &ldquo;I&rdquo; class, corresponds to in their scheme you are not serving the purpose of the classification scheme at all. You are postponing the evil day if you do not succeed in fooling them&mdash; not fooling them exactly, but not letting them know exactly what you are talking about&mdash;and they will come to have less regard for your products because they will see that if they want an &ldquo;E&rdquo; category animal, they had better get it from the &ldquo;E&rdquo; category in the European classification scheme rather than <Col N="687" /> from the Irish scheme where they might get &ldquo;I&rdquo; or &ldquo;R&rdquo; and, where &ldquo;I&rdquo; is such a broad category, they simply would not know whether the animal coresponds to &ldquo;E&rdquo; or &ldquo;U&rdquo; or &ldquo;R&rdquo; in the European scheme.  If you do not succeed in codding them, it will have an adverse effect on the credibility of our scheme.  If you succeed in selling your animal on the basis that &ldquo;I&rdquo; is equivalent to &ldquo;E&rdquo; in the European scheme you will not have the effect of communicating the needs of the French or the European market back to the Irish farmer.  That is a real objection.</P>
    <P>Now, by virtue of our having a very wide &ldquo;I&rdquo; category&mdash;although we have seven classes our &ldquo;I&rdquo; category is very wide by comparison with the rather narrow &ldquo;E&rdquo; category in the European scheme&mdash;farmers will expect that, if the animal gets into the &ldquo;I&rdquo; category, they must automatically get the full continental price.  It may be that some animal classified &ldquo;I&rdquo; in the Irish scheme will correspond to &ldquo;E&rdquo; in the continental scheme and therefore the factory will be able to pay a price equivalent to the &ldquo;E&rdquo; price on the continent.  But there will be others who will get into the &ldquo;I&rdquo; category and will only correspond to &ldquo;U&rdquo; or the top half of &ldquo;R&rdquo; in the continental scheme and the factories will not be as keen to pay the price they would pay for the really good animal in the &ldquo;E&rdquo; category as they would be prepared to pay for the &ldquo;U&rdquo; or &ldquo;R&rdquo;; but, as far as the Irish farmer is concerned, the animals are all in the &ldquo;I&rdquo; category. He cannot see any difference and he believes he should get the top price. That will create difficulties because of the wide variety of animals within the &ldquo;I&rdquo; category.  If I am wrong in that I shall be happy to be corrected by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Finally, when preparing the draft regulations for the training of people engaged in the classification of animals, the Minister should indicate to the House, in conjunction with the regulations, the arrangements being made for the training and supervision of the work of the officers to be responsible for classifying meat or <Col N="688" /> applying prescribed marks to meat under the draft.  That is a sensible proposition. The Minister recognises, as we all do, that this will be a very complicated job with a substantial amount of money involved.  Reliance will be placed on the accuracy of a visual assessment.  Officers in different factories may be operating 100 miles apart and it is essential they should come to the same conclusion as far as confirmation is concerned.  They will have to be intensively trained and they will have to talk the same language in order to ensure uniformity of judgment. Secondly, their work will have to be very closely supervised and I propose the draft recommendation should contain an outline of the training and supervision arrangements.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept some part of this amendment.  He may cavil at some parts and, if he does, I would like him to indicate what they are so that we can put down amendments on Report Stage to incorporate those aspects he is prepared to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am afraid I cannot agree to this amendment. I do not propose to require factories to allow members of the public to enter their premises.  This will be strictlY a matter between the farmer and the factory.  In any event, I have grave doubts as to whether I would be entitled to make a provision requiring a factory to admit any individual other than the authorised officer of the Minister.  I would, of course, see no objection where a factory and a farmer agree that the farmer should be present while classification was taking place, but I cannot make this mandatory.  We must realise factories are not public places, and surely the owner should have a voice in the running of his own business.  It must be remembered that the factory management or staff do not perform the classification and, therefore, it is not necessary that the seller should be there to watch the buyer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards subsection (5), I do not consider this amendment necessary because, as I already indicated on Second Stage, it is intended to have consultations with all interested <Col N="689" /> organisations before the regulations are drafted and the scheme introduced. It is quite obvious that consultations will have to be held beforehand in order to ensure that the scheme will be a success.  In the circumstances, I consider the amendment is not really required.</P>
    <P>As regards subsection (6) I have considered this amendment and I am afraid I cannot agree to it.  The time of the House should not be taken up debating what will be very detailed and technical regulations.  The purpose of section 2, as it stands, is to provide for policy matters relating to beef carcase classification and the regulations will give effect to classification as approved by the House.</P>
    <P>As regards subsection (7) I do not propose to agree to this amendment. It is not really necessary.  Indeed, it is a new concept of Deputy Bruton's that the Minister should be compelled by law to give the Oireachtas information on what is being done by Governments abroad or in agreement between producers and meat factories abroad. I will always give whatever information I can, and gladly do so, but it would be wrong for me to accept an amendment compelling the Minister to do so at all times in the future.</P>
    <P>The classification scheme here will cater for the range and type of animals we produce, or are likely to produce, while the classification schemes in other countries are designed to cater for their type of animals.  I should say that a number of countries have voluntary classification schemes, such as the United Kingdom, and accordingly have not got regulations covering their schemes.  Of course we have studied the classification schemes in other countries and there is agreement in principle between our scheme and those of other member states.  Incidentally, some member states have not got beef classification.</P>
    <P>In regard to training and supervision, I have already indicated that the officers will receive adequate training in the theory and practicalities of classification.  There will be adequate supervision to ensure that standards <Col N="690" /> are uniform.  I do not propose to agree to an amendment of this nature.  As Deputies are aware, considerable numbers and different grades of staff are trained and supervised in various Departments without a statement being furnished to the Oireachtas by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister has not replied to the points I made about the classification scheme.  I pointed out that our scheme diverges very significantly from the continental schemes.  The Minister should tell the House exactly what is the correspondence between our schemes and their schemes.  For the Minister to say our scheme reflects the type of animal already being produced here is an illogical basis upon which to draw up a classification scheme.  The Minister's whole point in drawing up this scheme is to provide a language whereby the needs of export markets, namely markets for the consumption of beef products outside this country, can be reflected back to the Irish producer so that he can modify the the type of animal he is producing and produce, for example, more Charolais animals which will tend to get into the &ldquo;E&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rdquo; classification as the case may be, depending on which classification we are using.</P>
      <P>To use the argument that our classification scheme should reflect merely what we have already&mdash;an unmodified and I think all will agree a herd which is much in need of genetic improvement from the point of view of the markets we are seeking to serve now in continental Europe&mdash;is to deny, if you like, the role the scheme should have in improving our herd and bringing it more in line with demands for meat on the continent.  I do not understand why the scheme is based as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a grave disadvantage because we have not been furnished with a copy of the proposed scheme.  My original criticism on Second Stage is reinforced on this Stage.  The Minister has not supplied the House with a copy of the scheme he proposes to introduce under these regulations.  Is he prepared to give the House a copy between now and Report Stage?  Is he prepared to <Col N="691" /> give me the information I am looking for as to how our scheme compares with schemes on the continent between now and Report Stage?  He should make that information available to the House.  It is available to everybody else in the trade but the people who are ultimately responsible, the Members of this House, have not got a copy of it.  Perhaps if we had asked the Department we would have got it.</P>
    <P>The Department are very helpful in giving information to any member of the public and particularly Members of this House who want it.  From my own experience I know that to be the case.  The Minister should indicate formally in this House that he is prepared to make it available so that we can see exactly what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I should like him to answer the precise points made about the lack of correspondence between our scheme and the continental schemes.  I want to come back on two other points.  I did not propose in subsection (4) that any member of the public should be entitled to go in and watch animals being classified.  I merely proposed that the owner of the animals in question&mdash;one man, not anybody walking in off the street&mdash;should be able to go into the factory and see what is being done.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some play about the rights of factory owners in respect of their own factories.  The factories will benefit from the existence of this classification scheme.  It will help them to get what they want for the export markets.  It is being provided by the Irish taxpayer because the Department are paying for the scheme. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to ask that factories should meet a requirement to enable the producer to see what is being done.  If they do not like that requirement, they do not have to participate in the scheme.  There is no constitutional problem here.  If the scheme is being operated in their factory this requirement will apply, and if it is not it does not apply.  They have that freedom.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the time of <Col N="692" /> the House being taken up in a discussion of the regulations if the approval of the House were required. I do not think that is a problem.  It would be quite possible to get a debate for a limited time, say an hour or an hour and a half, on these regulations. It would not involve a huge discussion on the whole issues involved. There may be controversial matters in the regulations which will be made and there should be a provision for discussing them in the House.  The Minister is wrong to refuse to accept that the regulations should be laid before the House and discussed here before they come into effect.</P>

The reason is that the scheme has not been drafted yet and until such time as it is drafted we cannot make a copy of it available to the House or to anybody else.  Discussions have to take place between the farming organisations, the factories, the veterinary profession and everybody else involved before we can get agreement on this.</P>

      <P>As regards the classification scheme, Deputy Bruton has mentioned the idea of a common scheme.  This would be a matter for the EEC.  If there is to be some common scheme acceptable to all member states, the EEC would have to prepare such a scheme.  At the moment there is not agreement between the different countries on the different schemes and there are big differences between some of the schemes.  If there is to be a uniform scheme for the whole EEC, then naturally the EEC would have to prepare such a scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton queried on Second Stage why we should have seven classes as against six in Europe. The European scheme is matched by their type of animals, whereas our seven classes cover the broad range of Irish animals.  That is all the information I can give.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would like to know the Minister's intentions generally as far as introducing classification schemes is concerned.  He has indicated his intention to introduce a classification scheme for beef carcases. I would like to know if he has in mind introducing classification schemes for lamb, mutton or pigs.  Has he the intention of introducing a classification scheme for individual cuts of meat as distinct from carcases? This power includes the regulation of the classification of fresh meat.  I take it that that does not include a classification scheme for products containing fresh meat which are not themselves fresh meat, for instance, hamburgers or tinned meat&mdash;of course tinned meat would not be fresh meat &mdash;sausages and so on.</P>
      <P>There is a case for classification not merely for fresh meat but also for meat products.  If you are talking about processed meat products you are talking about something about which the consumer needs a great deal more information on what has gone into the product than he does in the case of a product which is fresh.  The consumer can see for himself what is there by looking at the carcase or the cut, whereas for products in tins, packets or hamburger form there might be any number of things in the tin, packet or hamburger and there might be need for a classification scheme there.  I would like to know the Minister's long-term intention regarding the introduction of classification schemes under this section. The power here can be used to introduce any number of different schemes for different products and different cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing the section as amended and it contains my amendment which provides for a fine of £300 for subsequent offences.  I ask the Minister to consider revising the fines generally under the Fresh Meat Acts <Col N="695" /> because the fine of £100 contained here is very much higher than the fines which exist in other parts of the Act. There is an anomaly there which should be dealt with.  I would like to know also what the section means as regards the standard according to which meat may be classified.  The section says:</P>
    <P>(a)  to be classified according to prescribed standard systems of description,</P>
    <P>Description as to what?  The proposal at the moment for beef carcases relates to confirmation of the carcase, that is the shape, weight broadly speaking, and the fat content of the carcase. I take it from that that it would be possible to introduce classification schemes for matters such as the presence of antibiotics, chemicals or any other matter that could be contained in meat as a result of certain agricultural practices.  Is it possible to have the classification scheme extended to other matters concerning the description of meat in addition to its shape and fat contents?  If so, I see considerable value in looking at the possibility of classifying Irish meat by characteristics other than mere confirmation and fat cover.</P>
    <P>We want to have a quality product sold abroad with maximum information being given to the foreign consumer about what sort of meat it is. One of the problems generally in relation to food products at the moment is this environmental concern about the presence in meat of matter which should not be there.  This is referred to in amendment No. 4 which has been ruled out of order and so I cannot deal with it at this stage.  But under this section it would be possible for meat to be classified for a number of characteristics, including those mentioned in amendment No. 4, in addition to the ones already envisaged. I should like to ask the Minister if he reads it that way also, that it is possible to classify meat according to any number of different criteria, apart from those immediately envisaged.</P>
    <P>When does the Minister intend to introduce the first regulation under this section?  Does he expect it will be <Col N="696" /> this year, next year or in two years' time?  This is important because the enactment of this legislation is raising an expectation on the part of a lot of people.  The fact that officers are being trained is also raising an expectation that this classification scheme for beef carcase will be introduced later this year.  Is that so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I presume the reason for the Bill is to improve our export potential in regard to meat and to ensure that we capture a bigger proportion of the market.  I presume it is the intention that we should try to produce the quality of meat that is in demand in European countries.  We must introduce regulations which will be easily understood by our producers and potential purchasers in Europe.  We must compare our regulations with those in existence in European countries because our producers will have to compete with those countries.  Before he makes regulations the Minister will have to compare them with European classifications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I found it difficult to follow Deputy Bruton but I shall try to set his mind at ease with regard to some of the points he raised, in particular the extension of the classification scheme to certain meats.  Fresh meat is defined in the 1930 Act and classification can be extended by regulation to any of the meats mentioned as the market demands.  That section states beef, veal, pork, mutton, lamb, horse flesh and goat flesh.  I do not suppose we will need the latter two but they are mentioned in the Act.  Pigs are graded already and lambs are graded for the French market.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 22 and 23 to insert the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where regulations are proposed to be made under this section a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
      <P>(5)  At least once every three years the Minister shall lay before the Dáil a report on the exercise of his powers under this section setting out <i>inter alia</i> in relation to the 3 year period</P>
      <P>(a)  the number of convictions for offences thereunder,</P>
      <P>(b)  the regulations in relation to non-white pigs then obtaining in the other Member States of the European Community,</P>
      <P>(c)  a summary of any representations he has had for the repeal or amendment of the section or of regulations made thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section proposes to allow the Minister make regulations to allow non-white pigs to be bred and fed here. In the course of his reply to the Second Stage debate the Minister indicated that he had no immediate intention of introducing such regulations, thereby implying that he was prepared to allow the present prohibition on non-white pigs to continue.  That prohibition was introduced in 1956 and the main reason for it was to have uniformity in breeding here.  It was felt that non-white pigs were not quite as saleable as white pigs.  Since 1956 there have been a number of improvements and some of the non-white breeds have come up with very good <Col N="699" /> records in terms of the production of meat from a given amount of food. They are a little like the Charolais in the beef sector in that they have a very high conversion of food into lean meat.</P>
    <P>The breeding situation which existed in 1956 and justified excluding such pigs wholly from our pig production industry does not apply with the same force now.  While I applaud the Minister for taking the power to make regulations I regret that he is not prepared to give more serious thought to using those powers to allow, subject to proper controls to ensure that there is no interference with the general quality of the breeding herd, purebred non-white pigs to be introduced at least on an experimental basis.  He should be prepared to make such regulations. My amendment seeks to get the Minister at least once every three years to lay before the Dáil a report on the exercise of his powers under this section setting out <i>inter alia</i> in relation to the three-year period (a) the number of convictions for offences, (b) the regulations in relation to non-white pigs then obtaining in other member states and (c) a summary of any representations he has had for the repeal or amendment of the section or of regulations made.  The purpose of that part of the amendment is to ensure that the powers we are now giving to the Minister to make regulations to allow non-white pigs will not remain a dead letter and that the Minister will have to continually and actively consider whether or not regulations should be made every three years to allow non-white pigs.</P>
    <P>The principle in the amendment is a good one in that it does not require the Minister to report every three years, but it does require him to justify why he is not reporting and to state how our regulations compare with regulations in other parts of the Community and also to indicate the number of convictions for offences.  I understand that no offences have ever been detected.  Nobody has ever been convicted for breach of section 6 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1956.  It would appear that either the section has been successful or that it has not been enforced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> By requiring the Minister to make a three-yearly report, we are ensuring by means of a statutory amendment that the Minister reviews the matter every three years.  That is a good provision and one which I hope the Minister will adopt.  It does not bind the Minister to do anything but it does require him to make a report.</P>
    <P>If the Minister makes regulations he should have them discussed in the House and not merely have them laid before the House and effected automatically. It is a bad principle to have legislation passed through the House by means of regulation.  I hope the Minister will accept those points in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <P>: I cannot agree to this amendment.  Deputies have already agreed that there is justification for allowing the Minister to have the option to lift the absolute ban.  The regulations which can be made by the Minister will be simple and straightforward and I do not consider it necessary that they should be debated and approved by the House.  The Minister has the power to allow the importation of certain breeds of cattle and sheep. As it stands, section 4 does not represent any departure from normal practice.  The essence of the matter is that there is no demand at present for the importation of that type of animal.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree to the other part of the amendment.  As Deputies are aware, the Minister is required to publish an annual report of his activities. It is not reasonable or necessary that he should be required to furnish a report of this nature on a specific area of his activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am intrigued by the arguments the Minister is using for refusing to have the regulations discussed in this House.  When he was talking about the regulations under the section relating to the classification scheme, he said the regulations would be complicated and that it would not be appropriate to have them discussed here.  He says the regulations under section 4 are simple and straightforward and that it would not be appropriate to have them discussed here.  The Minister seems to be using <Col N="701" /> arguments at will to meet the case. Regulations should be approved by the Dáil.  It is not appropriate to have law made by the back door.  As some important legislation is now made by regulations, I believe the House is not functioning as it should if it is not privy to the making of legislation.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to know if the Minister intends making regulations under this section to allow non-white pigs.  Has he had consultations with anybody on the need for such regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: My information is that there is a good case for the introduction of these pigs into the Irish market.  In France these pigs have been allowed and I believe that some good breeds have been developed on the continent.  The Pietron breed is one that is quite successful in France. In the USA, non-white pigs, or hogs as they call them, are more common than white pigs.  We shall obviously be trying to export our bacon and pork products to the continent and perhaps to America.  If we are not able to use breeds which they are using to satisfy their markets we are tying our hands behind our backs.</P>
      <P>I agree that there should be proper control on the introduction of new breeds but I would ask the Minister to initiate consultation with the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the various interests in the pig industry and with the factories to see if there is a case for making regulations at a reasonably early date under this section.  I cannot prejudge the results of such consultation but if the Minister gives an assurance to undertake consultation I will be happy that the matter is being approached in the right manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is no demand at present for the importation of this breed of pig.  I would have no objection to consultations with the Pigs and Bacon Commission or anybody else <Col N="702" /> if they thought there was a need to import this breed for genetic or any other purposes.  This is one of the reasons we are taking advantage of this legislation to remove the absolute ban on the importation of this breed of pig.  The removal of this absolute ban will make it easier for the Minister, for the Pigs and Bacon Commission, or anybody else who might feel justified in importing this particular breed of pig at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can the Minister give us any indication of why this change is being made?  Now that factories will have to pay fees on a monthly basis rather than on a six-monthly basis as had been the case before&mdash;I know that means the Department will get money somewhat quicker but it also means there will be a lot more paper work because there will have to be a collection every month rather than every six months&mdash;the argument in favour of that is that the money will come in quicker.  I wonder would it be possible to collect fees every six months but containing a partial element of collection in advance, on the basis of anticipated slaughterings or something like that, to avoid the necessity of having the major bureaucratic exercise every month of collection of these fees, an exercise that will cost the factories, and also the Department, money in terms of staff costs.  I should be glad if the Minister would give us any estimate he may have of the additional staff costs involved in the new system of collection.</P>
      <P>I am also curious about subsection (4) of this section, which is in substitution of section 28 of the 1935 Act.  It says:</P>
      <P>Every certificate of indebtedness</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is in relation to the fees&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>shall be sufficient evidence until the contrary is shown of all matters purported to be certified in the certificate and any document purporting to be a certificate of indebtedness <Col N="703" /> issued under this section shall, on production of the document in any proceedings to recover the amount certified to be payable by the document, be deemed until the contrary is shown to be a certificate of indebtedness duly issued under this section and shall be admitted in evidence accordingly.</P>
    <P>The effect of that subsection is to shift the burden of proof as to the existence of the debt to the purported creditor simply by producing a document, waving it in the court and saying: &ldquo;We have got a certificate of indebtedness here.  Therefore it is up to you to prove that you do not owe us the money.&rdquo;  The House will note that the subsection is very widely drafted in that it says:</P>
    <P>Every certificate of indebtedness ... and any document purporting to be a certificate of indebtedness issued under this section ....</P>
    <P>Even if a Department person goes into a court with a document which is not a certificate of indebtedness but which purports to be <i>ipso facto</i>, the burden of proof in the court proceedings will be transferred to the creditor and he will have to prove that he does not owe the money.  To my mind that is a bad sort of provision.  It puts the Department, who are already able to call most of the shots anyway in these type of proceedings because of the powers they possess, in an unduly strong position in these court proceedings.</P>
    <P>I know the answer the Minister will come up with is that this provision has existed since 1935 and presumably there has not been any problem or we would have heard about it.  The provision here is a direct copy of something that was contained in the 1935 Act, but that does not make it good law.  The fact that it has not been used or, if it has, has been only in a responsible fashion does not make it a good provision.  On the face of it it looks to me a very bad provision, an incursion into the liberty of the individual. I should like to hear the Minister justify it, telling us why this unusual provision is really necessary.  It may be that there are peculiar circumstances in the meat trade which make a provision of this sort, which would <Col N="704" /> not exist in normal proceedings for the recovery of debt between one individual and another, justified in the case of the Government looking for recovery of fees from a meat factory. If I feel that Deputy Bermingham owes me money it is not enough for me to go into court with a bit of paper and say: &ldquo;This is a certificate I can produce. It is now up to Deputy Bermingham to prove that he does not owe me the money.&rdquo;  I cannot do that in a proceeding of that sort.  It seems to me to be somewhat odd that the Government, who are in a stronger position in such court proceedings than I am <i>vis-à-vis</i> Deputy Bermingham or he is <i>vis-à-vis</i> me, should be able to wave this bit of paper and thereby shift the burden of proof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree with what Deputy Bruton has said.  In addition I see that subsection (6) says:</P>
      <P>Where any licensee fails or neglects to pay the amount certified by a certificate of indebtedness to be payable by him within four weeks after the service of a copy of the certificate on him, the Minister may revoke the licence in respect of which that amount is payable, ....</P>
      <P>I feel that the heavy hand is being used to a great extent in this section. There seems to be no liability for proof on the Department or the Minister. There seems also to be a threat that the licence may be withdrawn if the licensee fails or neglects to pay the amount certified&mdash;if he misses out his licence can be withdrawn.  That threat hangs over the licensee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Section 5, which we are discussing here, amends by substitution section 28 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935.  The amendment permits the monthly collection of slaughter fees at bacon factories with effect from 1 July 1978 instead of collection on a half-yearly basis as was contained in section 28 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935.  This would amend the various statute provisions relating to the collection of veterinary inspection fees at meat export plants.  The collection of fees on a monthly rather than on the current half-yearly basis is acceptable to everybody.  It will be <Col N="705" /> easier on the Department.  One of the arguments put forward by Deputy Bruton was that it would involve the hiring of additional staff and would be more expensive.  It would not.  It would be easier on the Department and no additional staff would be required. In this day and age it must be accepted by everybody that it is far easier to pay on a monthly basis than on a half-yearly basis as obtained heretofore.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bermingham's assertion that we are using the heavy hand on factories is not justified at all because it is on the factories' figures those fees are levied.  This was the case under the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935, and the 1930 Meat Act and it has worked satisfactorily.  I do not think there is any real problem involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister has not really answered the point as to why it is really necessary.  He has said it has operated without any problems.  That is not an answer to the question why it should be there in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The wording of subsection (6), even though it may emanate from a previous Act which has worked fairly well, is heavy-handed in that it spells out in a very clear way what the Minister may do if a licensee does not pay or neglects to pay, which could mean forgetting to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I hope the Minister will reply to the points made by Deputy Bermingham.  I have another question. If a factory ceases to pay fees and as a result the examiners are withdrawn, its licence for slaughtering for the export market is removed but that does not remove the ability to sell on the domestic market.  The veterinary examiners will presumably cease to go to that factory if that happens; therefore there will not be any check on the meat sold on the domestic market.  That seems to be a serious situation.  It behoves the Department to ensure that meat sold to the Irish consumer comes up to <Col N="706" /> proper veterinary requirements.  It seems we are prepared to be concerned about the veterinary standards of our meat only when it is being exported.</P>
      <P>The argument may be made that if the meat is only for the home market the health board inspectors will look after it.  The reality is that those fellows are not qualified veterinary surgeons and they are not able to do all those things that a veterinary surgeon appointed under the provisions of this Bill would be able to do.  They would not be able to check the same things. It seems that there are not the same checks on meat for domestic consumption that there are on meat for foreign consumption and I wonder about the justification for that.</P>
      <P>It would seem that arguably the veterinary inspection of meat is part of the proper responsibility of the Government for the protection of public health and that therefore it should be paid for by the Government. The argument that by the accident whereby we have been carrying out this inspection of meat products for export but not for domestic consumption we justify the fees being charged does not hold water.  We should be doing this for our own consumers and doing so without any fee because it is a public health function, which in my view is appropriate to any Government in any civilised country, whether one has a conservative or a radical philosophy.  I am posing two questions: first, what happens if the licence is withdrawn because of failure to pay fees and what sort of inspection is there of meat for domestic consumption; secondly, is it really appropriate to charge a fee since this is basically for the purpose of public health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Regarding inspection of meat for consumption on the home market, this will be done and is being done by the local authority vet.  He is responsible in that area, under the control of the county medical officer. There is no question of meat for home consumption not being inspected. There is a fairly rigorous test carried out by the local authority vet <Col N="707" /> who is under the control of the medical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Why have two systems, one for the export plants and one for domestic plants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The fact of the matter is that it is being inspected anyway. They are all responsible officers and I am sure they do a good job in ensuring that everything is kept in order.  Regarding fees, there are no fees charged for the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not entirely happy with the Minister's answer about meat for the domestic market. Am I correct that the vets who carry out inspections in abattoirs which are used for the domestic butchering trade are only part-time vets?  They are vets who have their own practices and are doing this work on the side; from time to time they drop into the factory.  The examiners which we are talking about are full-time employees of the Department.  It does not seem to be possible that the same degree of stringency would apply in abattoirs as applies in meat export plants if the men who are doing this job in domestic plants are only part-timers who would have more remunerative employment available to them in other aspects of veterinary medicine. If they have any freedom they might opt for work on the brucellosis scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case I would be doubtful if the inspection of meat for domestic consumpion is as rigorous as it is for meat for foreign consumption. It would seem on the face of it that there should be one system of veterinary inspection of meat, whether for foreign or for home consumption.  The Irish consumer of meat is just as important to the Irish industry as the foreign consumer.  A large proportion of our meat is consumed at home. If safeguards are necessary for what we export, safeguards are also necessary for what we consume at home. Perhaps the Minister would consider the extension of this system to the production of meat for the domestic market.  It seems quite anomalous that <Col N="708" /> there should be two separate systems, one for the export market operated by the Department of Agriculture with full-time people and a completely different system operating under an entirely different Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is not true.  There is a very stringent check on abattoirs and on meat in general by the local authority vets.  These people are employed full-time by most local authorities, so there is no question of part-time employees.  Even if they were part-time, I am still satisfied that they would be doing a good job.  Some of the vets employed by the Department are part-time and are still doing a good job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should be glad if the Minister would say something about this section and his intentions in relation to the appointment of detention officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The section empowers the Minister to appoint persons to be detention officers at meat export plants for the purposes of the Fresh Meat Act.  The section provides that the Minister may determine the conditions of office and remuneration of the detention officers with the sanction of the Minister for the Public Service.  It also provides that the Minister may, after consultation with the Veterinary Council of Ireland, determine the training and qualifications of detention officers and the arrangements for appointment and scope of duties.  The duties of a detention officer shall be to carry out inspection as the veterinary inspector is currently empowered to do.  The intention is that the detention officer would be supervised by the veterinary inspector and would detain suspect carcases for subsequent examination by the veterinary inspector.  These officers would be in the agricultural officer grade and would be specially trained. There are no proposals to employ detention officers at present.  Detention officers are used in other countries to assist veterinarians in meat inspection, in other EEC member states except Germany, the US, New Zealand.  Their purpose is to allow a better deployment of veterinary resources and minimise the cost of the veterinary inspection service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the section. I realise that the Minister has committed himself in it to not doing anything before having consultations with <Col N="711" /> the veterinary council.  That is appropriate. I understand the Irish Veterinary Association in paragraph 3.31 of their report on meat hygiene published in 1973 included a statement on the matter which is not unfavourable to the idea.  That is some time ago.  Probably a few worries would be felt about the employment of lay people.  One would be to ensure that they were operating properly under veterinary supervision.  It was suggested that it might be appropriate that they should operate within sight and sound of a veterinary surgeon.  If they had a problem they could be seen to call for assistance or advice from a vet and could get it immediately rather than operate entirely away from any veterinary advice.  Obviously, they would be making decisions all the time in passing individual carcases.  If they are not able to call on a vet for advice within shouting range, so to speak, the danger is that they would make decisions which would not be proper decisions. I wonder if such a requirement is envisaged.</P>
      <P>I gather that there is need for improved laboratory facilities in some of the factories to assist veterinary surgeons and detention officers if and when these are appointed in doing some of the more sophisticated analyses necessary.  Has the Minister any intention of meeting what I think is a genuine need in this area?  Finally, I should like to ask the Minister if and when he intends to engage in consultation with the veterinary association with a view to introducing regulations under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>: If detention officers come to be used they will be trained by the veterinary profession and supervised by veterinary inspectors.  I think there is nothing to worry about in that regard.  As regards facilities in the plants, there is no complaint at present about these facilities and if there are any complaints they will certainly be pursued as quickly as possible.</P>

Does he envisage a situation where they would be working without a veterinary surgeon, that they would not be directly under supervision?  They would be under supervision in so far as they could hold up a carcase until inspected by the veterinary surgeon but would not be working under supervision&mdash;would that be the position?</P>

I hoped the Minister would be able to convince me that it is not an absurdity. It is clear that in order to find the fee for a month something is multiplied by 1,000 because the appropriate number is the number of animals presented to the veterinary inspector in the premises.

      <P>The appropriate number is the number slaughtered in a month.  Section 4 says that as soon as the appropriate number is ascertained under rule 3 of this schedule, the appropriate sum for the licence, which is presumably the figure referred to at 2 (a), which is £50, shall be multiplied by the appropriate number and the appropriate number in accordance with 3 (a) is the number slaughtered.  If that is the case, taking Deputy Fitzpatrick's example we would multiply the appropriate fee, namely £50 by 1,000 which is the appropriate number, which were slaughtered in that month, and that is a fee not of £100 as the Minister suggested but of £50,000.

    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> Consultations with the food industry prior to the adoption of the EEC Directive indicated that manufacturers no longer used these colours.  The EEC directive deleting these from the permitted Community list of colours, therefore, posed no problem for the industry.  As no technological need existed for the colours, no independent toxicological evaluation was necessary.</P>
    <P>As regards orange RN&mdash;which Ireland has been allowed to authorise under the Treaty of Accession to the EEC&mdash;it was decided to prohibit the use of this colour following receipt of the Irish Food Advisory Committee recommendation that a ban be imposed, as research suggested possible toxicity associated with its use.</P>
    <P>None of the colours in question is permitted in the USA.  In the short time available it has not been possible to ascertain the position in Canada.  A further EEC directive adopted on 30 January 1978 will result in another three colours being prohibited in the Community with effect from January 1979, that is chocolate brown FB, violet 6B and orange G.  This action is based on the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Food that the colours in question are unacceptable because available data is inadequate to demonstrate their safety-in-use.  The Irish food industry have discontinued the use of these colours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>: It will be appreciated that, having regard to changing conditions, it would be difficult to estimate the acreage of land in the country that needs improvement, but I am satisfied that the figure quoted is grossly overstated. Clearly such an estimate would depend on whether the land in question required drainage or other forms of reclamation&mdash;for example scrub or rock removal and so forth.</P>
      <P>However it has been calculated that in the west there are at least one million acres which could be improved through drainage.  In view of the extent of the problem in the west the EEC, as part of their policy to help the more handicapped areas of the Community, have recently approved a measure providing £21 million Community aid to accelerate drainage in this region.  The programme will cover arterial and field drainage and the provision of grants to agricultural co-operatives for the purchase of drainage equipment.</P>
      <P>It is hoped to put the programme into operation as soon as certain procedural formalities are completed.  I am confident that this new programme will greatly accelerate land improvement operations in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is presumed that the grants referred to are those awarded under the FEOGA individual projects scheme (EEC Regulation 17/64) for certain structural projects aimed at improving agricultural production and marketing.  Grants for individual farms are not involved since they are catered for under the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
      <P>To recoup approved grants from FEOGA, applicants must follow a specific procedure laid down in EEC Commission Regulation 99/64. Successful applicants are advised by my Department of this procedure immediately the decisions on grant approvals are announced.  Detailed claims have to be certified by the appropriate national authorities and submitted to the EEC Commission for payment.  It is a matter for the applicants themselves to prepare and submit claims and in doing so every assistance is given them by the national authorities concerned.  On receipt of completed claims, the EEC Commission pay grants direct to bank accounts nominated by the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As many of these projects can extend over a period of time claims are normally paid in instalments. Despite encouragement to do so a number of successful Irish applicants have been slow to present completed claims.  However, under the EEC regulations a period of up to five years is allowed from the date of <Col N="602" /> approval to complete a project and present claims.  Of the £29.4 million allocated for Irish projects to date, some £15 million were approved within the last year and a half and claims for many of these would only now be in the course of preparation.</P>

      <P>: The postponement of the hydrocarbons support scheme means in effect that any funds which might be forthcoming thereunder for an Irish project will not now be available unless the necessary instruments are adopted at some future Council meeting.  Five measures relating to energy questions were presented to the Council on 30 May 1978.  These measures dealt with trade in coal for power stations, policy in the refining sector, energy-saving projects, alternative energy sources and related projects and finally the proposals for exploration aid to which the Deputy refers.  These measures were presented as a complete package. In fact two of the more noncontroversial items in the package were endorsed and follow-up action was approved.  The package did not command the support necessary for its adoption, various member states maintaining reservations on certain elements of the package.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: For some months the EEC Council of Ministers have been considering two proposals concerning power station coal.</P>
      <P>One proposed that grants would be made available towards the cost of building power stations based on coal. The second envisaged the subsidisation of Community power station coal to help to make it competitive with coal imported from outside the Community.</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers have so far been unable to agree to the adoption of either of these two proposals.</P>
      <P>Any Community aid system would apply uniformly throughout the Community and would carry with it an obligation on members to contribute to the financing of the appropriate fund.  This country, because of its relatively small coal deposits, would not be in a position to benefit substantially from such a fund.  Community coal production at present is around 250 million tons per year and there is potential for much higher production while this country's estimated potential workable deposits of anthracite amount to six million tonnes and of semi-bituminous coal to five million tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> Anthracite, which is the type of coal in the Leinster coalfield is not, under existing technology, regarded as a suitable fuel for electricity generation. The semi-bituminous coal of the Connaught coalfield is being used to generate electricity at Arigna and experiments in the combustion of low grade coal are at present in progress to determine whether more extensive use can be made of these deposits.</P>
    <P>A recent meeting of the Council of Ministers approved a general framework regulation on the granting of financial support for demonstration projects to exploit alternative energy sources.  The Council will be considering implementing regulations later this year.  One such implementing regulation is expected to deal with gasification of coal, including underground gasification.  The results of research carried out with such Community aid would be made available to all member states and could have implications for the use of Irish coal deposits which are difficult and costly to produce under existing methods of production.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, avail of any opportunities which may arise to obtain Community support for the development of this country's coal resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am informed that because of the present abnormally high demand for copper piping the principal manufacturer introduced an allocation system, based on deliveries in 1977, to ensure that available supplies would be distributed among its regular customers as equitably as possible. I understand that deliveries are now at a level well in excess of average monthly deliveries during the year 1977 reflecting the company's increased production in the current year.</P>
