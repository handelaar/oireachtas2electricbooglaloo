    <P>1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if unemployment was discussed at the recent meeting of the European Council; and if any measures were agreed to counteract the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my statement to the House on 11 April which dealt with the discussions at the European Council meeting, and also to Conclusions of the Presidency, in respect of that meeting, copies of which I have had laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we are now over half way from July 1977 to December of this year and unemployment was only reduced by 5,000 or one-fifth of the Government plan, have the Government any new policies in mind to create jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question related specifically to whether or not unemployment was discussed at the recent European Council meeting. If the Deputy would like to ask a specific question I will be glad to answer it at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the policies pursued by the Government and by the EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question and the Deputy is aware that this matter deals specifically with the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has already gone wrong.</P>
      <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's policies that have gone wrong.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the policies pursued by the Government and the apparent lack of policies by the EEC have failed and that an urgent reappraisal of policies is now due?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question related to the European Council's discussion on unemployment.  That question was discussed at considerable length and it was recognised that a growth of 2 per cent achieved over the last period was totally insufficient to maintain employment and that it might have the effect of decreasing employment. The European Council decided to achieve over a period of 15 months a growth rate of 4½ per cent which would, it is hoped, maintain employment. These are the answers to the questions which the Deputy asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach seen reports in the Press on the meeting of Ministers of Finance stating that there was apparent reluctance on the part of the German Minister to accept the logical argument carried through the policies agreed by the European Council?  I regret that our Minister for Finance was unable to attend the meeting but I am very happy to see him here after his unfortunate accident.  I am happy for him and his wife that the results were minimal.  Would the Taoiseach say whether he has had a report from whatever Minister represented us there and whether there is any truth in the Press reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is a separate question relating to a different meeting and to a different Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely on the point as to whether the 4½ per <Col N="781" /> cent target to which the Taoiseach has just referred is likely to be attained if one Government were to be already moving away from their commitment in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated to the Deputy last week in reply to statements made by him and by the Leader of the Labour Party that even on the figure of 4½ per cent and its attainability there was some disagreement.  I will not indicate which representatives of the European Council expressed the possibility that the 4½ per cent growth rate might not be achieved in 15 months but I indicated clearly the manner in which the objective of reaching 4½ per cent by mid-1979 might be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say in what way it will affect this Government's employment target if there is disagreement and a failure by the EEC to have a united approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Government will naturally have to rely on their own resources and policies to a considerable extent to achieve the growth targets we have set for ourselves but we cannot ignore the rate of growth in other countries, especially countries within the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is indicating that it would not affect the Government's employment targets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach say it would?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it would.  I gave the Deputy a fairly comprehensive answer to a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what the Taoiseach is saying.  Is the Taoiseach saying that it would or would not affect the employment situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that our growth rate will be dependent on our initiative and on our polices and programmes but that we cannot regard <Col N="782" /> ourselves as immune to world conditions in these areas, particularly conditions obtaining within the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Taoiseach is still confident that the Government can realise their targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will certainly strive as hard as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that when he was in opposition he discounted outside factors?  Will the Taoiseach tell the House whether, now that we are half way towards 1979, he is worried that only one-fifth of the employment target has been reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is trying to put across something I did not say.  I said that the outside influences, especially in relation to inflation, affect us as to some 50 per cent of our capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a new admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy can produce a statement from me either in the House or outside the House in contradiction to what I have just said, I will be glad to withdraw the remark. I do not believe I will have to, because I have never said anything other than what I have indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies of 7 February to a question by Deputy Ruairi Quinn regarding RTE's plans for community radio services and to questions by Deputies Ruairi Quinn and Jim Mitchell regarding an unlicensed broadcasting station.  This matter is still the subject of consultation between my Department and RTE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the problem appears to be that whereas there is a very strong demand for alternative radio the RTE Authority are unable to meet this demand because the Government will not provide them with money?  Is it not a fact that the RTE Authority did not get the money to finance their proposed programme and that inevitably there has been a growth of pirate stations?  When will the Minister make up his mind about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that RTE cannot provide for the demand. The position is that I am having further consultations with RTE on this and as soon as I clear the various aspects of it I will be in touch with RTE on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether test transmissions are being, or have been taking place, from Cairn Hill Station; if so, if such tests have shown that the establishment of RTE 2 will have an effect on the reception of BBC and HTV in Wexford and the south-east of the country in general; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the most recent indications regarding the effect of RTE 2 on reception of viewers in the multi-channel areas; if he is willing to offset the cost for viewers who are obliged to have their sets adjusted; the number of sets which will have to be adjusted to ensure that viewing is not interfered with; the total sum of money involved; if he is willing to give a guarantee that the quality of viewing of people in these areas will be as good as it now is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together. Two UHF transmitters are being established at Cairn Hill, County Longford, and two at Three Rock Mountain, County Dublin, to provide for reception of RTE 2 and to improve reception of the existing RTE television service.  All four are capable of giving rise to interference with reception of British television service in parts of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full power test transmissions commenced from the Cairn Hill transmitters in mid-January, 1978.  The existing RTE TV service is being broadcast from one of the Cairn Hill transmitters since 3 April 1978 and the other transmitter is carrying trade test transmissions. RTE have advised my Department that these transmitters have not affected reception of British signals in Wexford and the south-east of the country in general and that interference problems in the service area of the transmitters are being <Col N="785" /> solved by the use of filters specially designed for this purpose by RTE and available to the television trade at a cost of approximately £10.</P>
    <P>RTE say that the level of interference with multi-channel TV reception in the Carlow area is not such as to wipe out reception of the weak British signals and that the quality of reception from Presely varies greatly throughout the town.  They consider that the most effective solution to the problem is the installation of a cable system which would also have the effect of providing reception of British services in sections of the town where reception is either of poor quality or non-existent.</P>
    <P>RTE expect that the Three Rock Mountain transmitters will commence testing in August 1978.  They say that corrective action to be taken by the cable television operators concerned will eliminate any interference that may arise on cable systems.  Viewers not connected to cable systems may be affected but they will be able to use filters designed by RTE similar to those being used in the service area of the Cairn Hill transmitters to resolve the problem.  There is no statutory provision under which I could offset the cost to viewers who adjust their sets.</P>
    <P>RTE are not in a position to say how many sets will need adjustment as the strength of British signals is not of uniform quality in every area. Viewers receiving a good quality signal are less likely to suffer an interference problem than viewers receiving a poor quality signal.  Consequently it is not possible to give an estimate of the total sum of money involved.</P>
    <P>I cannot give a guarantee that there will be no disimprovement in the quality of multi-channel reception in the areas concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in the Dáil on 6 December he indicated that it would cost many people between £10 and £15 each to make the necessary correction to their set?  Does the Minister agree further that in some cases, on his admission, the cost would be substantially higher? May I ask the Minister yet further <Col N="786" /> whether on the basis of the information he has just supplied&mdash;which is basically that he has no idea how many sets will be affected&mdash;he would agree that his attention so far to this problem has not been adequate?  Surely the Minister would accept that there are some people who may not be able to afford the cost of the corrections necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out to the Deputy in my reply that a filter has been designed by RTE which would cost approximately £10.  I would point out to the Deputy also that, contrary to general opinion, probably at the time I gave the original reply, Wexford and the south-east have not been affected by the transmission from Cairn Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister define what he means by the south-east? We have an idea what the south-east means.  Does it necessarily include Carlow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>All Wexford and the surrounding areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister's reply that areas which have been receiving strong signals from British stations will not be interfered with in any way but there is a doubt about places like Carlow, Kilkenny and south-west Wicklow.  Would that be correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the town of Carlow is that part of the town was receiving a reasonable signal and part was receiving a very poor signal at the best of times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there not a promise given by the RTE Authority that if there was interference with reception from Britain the Authority would provide piped television, where people did not have it, at the expense of the Authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No, what was suggested was that piped television was the answer.  I understand that, in so far as Carlow is concerned, a firm got the contract but pulled out and I think they are looking for somebody else to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But did the Authority themselves not take on the responsibility&mdash;if there was not good reception&mdash;to provide a piped system at their expense?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting that the Minister acknowledges that the information given in his previous reply in early December may not have been fully accurate, or that circumstances may have changed since, am I right in assuming that the £10 to £15 cost for this filter, which apparently some thousands of people at least would have to bear, is the total cost?  Is that the cost of the filter wholesale, or does it include the cost of installation, the operators' charge and so on?  In other words, what is the total cost likely to be to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine that is the cost of the filter itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be reasonable to say that a service man would not instal that, that the whole cost would probably be of the order of £25 to £30, depending on how far the person resided from the transmitter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that funds for the transmitter network and the production facilities for the second channel are being provided by the Exchequer, by means of repayable Exchequer advances.  Apart from any other consideration it would be unreasonable to expect the Exchequer to bear the incidental costs as well.</P>

      <P>All I want is to be given the exact cost to a person who is now receiving a service&mdash;and we accept that people residing in single channel areas have a right to a choice. What is the total amount that the average person who may be interested in this discussion will have to bear to ensure that the quality of his viewing is not interfered with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy the information in relation to the cost of the filter.  I am sure any other costs will vary from one area to another so it would not be possible for me to give the Deputy that sort of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if the views which the Taoiseach expressed regarding the RTE series <i>The Spike</i> were conveyed to RTE prior to their taking the decision to cancel the series; and if representations of any kind were made to RTE by any member of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The view expressed by the Taoiseach was that the Director-General and the Authority were entitled to their judgment that there was a lapse in standards in this instance and that having arrived at that judgment their decision to discontinue the series was a correct one.  Obviously such a view could not have been conveyed prior to the decision.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, my Department brought to RTE's notice various complaints and criticisms which had been received concerning the series.</P>

More important, might I ask if the Director-General as editor-in-chief had agreed to this programme going out and then altered his opinion later having seen the programme?  Could the Minister explain the peculiar discrepancy in that situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>There are various forms of censorship exercised in Telefís &mdash;as Mr. Lemass called it, an arm of Government&mdash;in relation to politics and so on.  Are we to assume now that this is a precedent on which we will get censorship of a completely new kind in relation to the artistic merits of a programme, sexual morality and so on?

The system has been operating in Dublin for five or six years and <Col N="797" /> was introduced in several parts of the country since 3 April.  I believe the conditions of postmen demand the introduction of a five-day week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of postmen may demand the introduction of a five-day week but do the postmen want it?  That is a different thing.  Does the Minister recognise the fact that because something works in Dublin it may not work in the rest of the country? This is the problem with the Government, they think that because something is good enough for Dublin it is good enough for the rest of the country, but that is not the case.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): Agreement in connection with this matter was reached six or seven years ago.  The system will be introduced gradually along lines that will ensure there will be no redundancies. As certain retirements take place the five-day week will be introduced and I do not think anybody can disagree with that.</P>

The precise information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. The following information is indicative of the performance standards of the telephone repair service.  Normally nearly 80 per cent of telephone faults are cleared on the day they are reported or on the following day and about 97 per cent are cleared within five days.  The remainder are usually faults in underground cables which are often difficult to locate and repair.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> Nuair a bhíonn saothar tábhachtach le cur i gcrích ní haon rud nua é sa tír seo Bord Stáit a bhunú chun tabhairt faoi: is é sin atá á dhéanamh anois i gcás na Gaeilge.  Is iad Comhairle na Gaeilge, a cheap an Teachta Haughey sa bhliain 1969, a mhol go ndéanfaí amhlaidh sé bliana ó shin sa tuarascáil <i>Feidhmiú Polasaí Teanga</i> agus tá buíochas ag dul dóibh i ngeall air sin agus ar na moltaí fiúntacha eile a tháinig uathu.  Is maith liom gur ghlac an t-iar-Aire, an Teachta Ó Domhnaill, leis an moladh go mbunófaí Bord na Gaeilge cé gurbh fhearr fós liom dá mbeadh an bord curtha ar bhonn reachtúil ó thús.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach, tá an bord ag gníomhú ar bhonn <i>ad hoc</i> le breis agus trí bliana anuas.  Is cúis bróid dom féin go raibh ar mo chumas deontas £300,000 a chur ar fáil don bhord i mbliana: £125,000 a íocadh leo anuraidh.  Tá clár maith oibre leagtha amach acu don bhliain reatha agus b'fhéidir nár mhiste cuid dá bhfuil ar siúl a lua: Faoi scéimeanna forbartha teanga tá sé cheantar speisialta roghnaithe d'fhonn an Ghaeilge a leathadh i ngnéithe éagsúla den saol iontu; is iad sin Caisleán an Bharraigh i gContae Mhaigh Eo, Mainistir na Féile agus an dúiche máguaird i gContae Luimnigh, An Daingean i gContae Chiarraí, Cois Móire i gContae Phort Láirge, Dúiche Chrónáin in aice le Baile Átha Cliath agus comhluadar bunaithe ar Scoil Lorcáin i gceantar Bhaile na Manach i gContae Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Is ar chláir oibre a d'ullmhaigh muintir na gceantar sin iad féin atá na scéimeanna bunaithe agus táthar ag súil go mbaileofar eolas a léireoidh don bhord céard tá riachtanach chun tabhairt faoi straitéis náisiúnta forbartha teanga.</P>
    <P>Faoi phlean amharclannaíochta, a ullmhaíodh i gcomhar leis an gComhairle Ealaíon, tá compántas gairmiúil drámaíochta á bhunú d'fhonn a chinntiú go léireofar drámaí i nGaeilge i mBaile Átha Cliath agus ar fud na tíre.  Táthar ag súil go gcruthóidh sé sin saol amharclainne a bheidh mar thacaíocht ag buíonta amaitéaracha agus go bhfásfaidh gréasáin shóisialta Ghaeilge as.</P>
    <P>Faoi scéimeanna chun an Ghaeilge <Col N="842" /> a leathadh i measc daoine óga tá comhchoiste bunaithe chun áiseanna a sholáthar agus seirbhísí comhairle agus oiliúna a chur ar fáil do dhaoine a bheidh ag plé le naíscoileanna agus táthar ag iarraidh coistí Gaeilge a chur ar bun sna scoileanna íarbhunoideachais, sna coláistí oiliúna agus sna hollscoileanna d'fhonn go mbeidh níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt agus go gcothófar atmasféar agus ócáidí a bheidh fabhrach don teanga.</P>
    <P>Tá dianchúrsaí sa teanga labhartha eagraithe, i gcomhar le Gael-Linn, do dhaoine fásta, go háirithe sna ceantair fhorbartha.</P>
    <P>Tá scéim ceadaithe i gcomhar le Cumann Lúthchleas Gael chun an Ghaeilge a neartú i ngníomhaíochtaí an chumainn sin.</P>
    <P>Tá dlúthchaidreamh i gcónaí le Radio Telefís Éireann agus le dreamanna eile d'fhonn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus tá feachtas poíblíochta á ullmhú.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na ceantair atá roghnaithe ag an mbord chun feachtas speisialta a chur ar siúl iontu, bhí sé de phribhléid agam féin bheith i láthair i gcúpla ceann acu le déanaí&mdash; Caisleán an Bharraigh agus Ráth Cúil &mdash;nuair a cuireadh tús leis an bhfeachtas agus ba mhór an t-ábhar sásaimh dom an tslí ina bhfuil tacaíocht an phobail le fáil d'iarrachtaí ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, níl sé sin ach ag teacht le torthaí an taighde a rinne an coiste a cheap an Teachta Colley sa bhliain 1970 chun dearcadh an phobail a léiniú d'fhonn beartas a fhorbairt chun an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide i raon tábhachtach d'fheidhmeanna teanga. Is tuar dóchais dúinne, ar mór againn ár n-oidhreacht dúchais, an dea-thoil don Ghaeilge atá chomh forleathan sin i measc phobal na hÉireann.  Ach teacht ar bhealaí chun leas a bhaint as an deathoil sin i ngníomhartha praiticiúla ní fada go mbeidh rith an ráis linn.  Tá a fhios againn, ar ndóigh, nach bhfuil aon bhealach éasca ann chun an taoide a chasadh. Is léir, áfach, go mbeidh géarghá le comhordú agus comhoibriú san obair a bheidh ar siúl ag Bord na Gaeilge. <Col N="843" /> Ní foláir do na dreamanna atá ag saothrú ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge tarraingt le chéile in aon mhór-iarracht amháin chun an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Tá dualgas orainn ár neart a chur le chéile agus baineann sé sin leis an Rialtas, le Ranna agus comhlachtaí Stáit, le húdaráis oideachais, le húdaráis áitiúla, le heagrais náisiúnta agus leis na meáin chumarsáide chomh maith leis na heagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge&mdash;gan trácht ar Theachtaí Dála.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom ar an ócáid seo an moladh atá tuillte acu a thabhairt do na heagrais éagsúla atá ag caitheamh a ndúthrachta leis na blianta chun leasa don Ghaeilge.  Beidh deis acu féin agus ag an mbord comhoibriú le chéile feasta d'fhonn gur fearr fós an toradh a bheidh ar a n-iarrachtaí chun na críche sin.</P>
    <P>Obair ghríosaithe agus spreagtha is mó a bheidh ar siúl ag an mbord chun tuilleadh Gaeilge a chur á labhairt ag an bpobal.  Is beag duine sa tír seo anois nár fhoghlaim Gaeilge uair éigin ach, ó tharla nach bhfuil cleachtadh ag a bhformhór ar í a úsáid, is leasc leo í a labhairt.  Chun iad a mhealladh ní foláir deiseanna taitneamhacha a chur ar fáil dóibh chun feidhm a bhaint as an teanga agus, de réir a chéile, tiocfaidh feabhas ar a gcumas labhartha i gcaoi nach fada go mbeidh líofacht acu.  Faoi mar a luadh sa Pháipéar Bán um Athbheochan na Gaeilge sa bhliain 1965, caithfear an bhá atá go fairsing ag an bpobal leis an teanga, ach nach ndéantar beart dá réir go minic, a shaothrú ar dhóigh go mbeidh siad níos fonnmhar chun iarracht phearsanta leanúnach a dhéanamh le go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn aon mhíthuiscint a sheachaint, sílim nach miste a rá nach ionann an Ghaeilge a leathadh agus an Béarla a ruaigeadh.  Tá teanga idirnáisiúnta ag teastáil uainn agus tarlaíonn go bhfuil an Béarla againn.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh teangacha eile de chuid na hEorpa ag a lán againn freisin.  Ach ní bhaineann sé sin ón áit is dual don Ghaeilge&mdash;teanga dhúchais na tíre seo le cúpla míle bliain agus gnáth-theanga fhormhór mór ár sinsear anuas go dtí <Col N="844" /> an céad seo caite.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an mBille atá á phlé againn, is gnáthfhorálacha do bhord reachtúil formhór na n-alt ann ach b'fhéidir nár mhiste aird a dhíriú ar na pointí seo a leanas:</P>
    <P>&mdash;suas le dáréag a bheidh ar an mbord,</P>
    <P>&mdash;tréimhse oifige nach rachaidh thar sé bliana a bheidh acu,</P>
    <P>&mdash;ceapfaidh siad foireann dá gcuid féin, agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;féadfaidh sian aon ní is iomchuí leo a dhéanamh ag teacht leis an mbeartas ginearálta a bheidh údaraithe agamsa.</P>
    <P>Ar eagla go gceapfadh aon dream gur ar an mbord amháin a bheadh an cúram ar fad agus nach mbainfeadh feidhmeanna i ndáil leis an nGaeilge leo féin feasta, leagtar síos go leanfaidh Ranna Stáit agus comhlachtaí eile d'fheidhmeanna a bhfuil siad freagrach iontu a chomhlíonadh freisin. Tá deis iontach againne sa Teach seo chun ár ndea-thoil don Ghaeilge, agus an comhar atá chomh tábhachtach sin ar mhaithe léi, a léiriú.  Tuigeann na Teachtaí ar gach taobh meon an phobail ina nDáilcheantair féin agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh tuairimí maithe uathu le linn na díospóireachta seo.  Beidh an bord ag brath ar chuidiú uainne agus táim cinnte go mbeidh áthas orthu aon mholtaí a dhéanfar anseo a bhreithniú go cúramach.  Ní beag an tógáil a bheidh le déanamh ar an dúshraith atá á cur ar fáil ag an mBille seo a mholaim don Dáil anois.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille.  Tá cuspóirí an Bhille an-chosúil leis an gcuspóir a bhí ag an gComhrialtas agus ag an Teachta O'Donnell.  Measaim féin gur mhór an trua nach bhfuil Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta i dteannta leis an mBille seo.  Gan amhras ar bith, beidh Bord na Gaeilge agus an tÚdarás ag obair as lámh a chéile.  Is ana-bhotún é sin.  Nuair a chuir me ceist ar an Aire roimh Cháisc, thug an tAire geallúint don Teach go mbeadh Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta os ár gcomhair roimh Cáisc.  Níl sé mar sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le fáda an lá tá Fianna Fáil ag rá gurb iad féin cosantóirí na tenga. <Col N="845" /> Is fíor a rá gur éirigh leo dallamullóg a chur ar morán daoine.  Ansin, tháinig an Teachta O'Donnell mar Aire na Gaeltachta agus thug sé spiorad agus misneach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus spiorad agus misneach do na daoine san Ghallacht a bhí an Ghaeilge acu chomh maith.  B'é an tOllamh Ó Suilleabháin, Aire Fhine Gael, a thosnaigh na coláistí ullmhúcháin.  As na coláistí sin tháinig na mílte múinteóirí as na Gaeltachtaí, mar bhí 30 faoin gcéad de na háiteanna sna coláistí ullmhúcháin coiméadtha do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Measaim féin gur tháinig an tAire ó cheann de na coláistí sin&mdash;cinnte gur ó cheann acu a tháinig sé.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuir Fianna Fáil deireadh leis na coláistí ullmhúcháin thugadar buille trom don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht.  Níl na múinteoirí Gaeltachta ann anois chun na páistí a mhúineadh agus an spiorad ceart a thabhairt ar ais.  Agus arís, nuair a chuamar isteach sa Chomhphobal Eorpach i ndeireadh 1972, theip ar fhianna Fáil mar Rialtas aitheantas oifigiúil a thabhairt don Ghaeilge san Eoraip.  Sin botún eile.  Nuair a bunaíodh an bord i 1975 ní raibh polaitíocht ar bith ag baint leis. Measaim féin&mdash;agus sílim go bhfuil an tuairim céanna ag a lán Teachtaí eile&mdash;nach bhfuil sé ceart don Aire comhaltaí an bhoird a laghdú ó 20 go dtí 12.</P>
    <P>An chéad cheist a thagann dom ná an bhfuil aidhm polaitíochta ag an Aire?  Má tá, deirim leis, go macánta, bheith an-chúramach ar fad, mar ní bheidh sé in ann aon bhord a bhunú ar ghaineamh.  Is é mo ghuí go mbeidh an bord cosúil leis an sean-bhord. Chuir an Teachta O'Donnell beirt isteach ann agus d'ainmnigh an Taoiseach iad mar Sheanadóirí cúpla mí ina dhiaidh sin.  Ní raibh polaitíocht ag baint leis.</P>
    <P>Measaim féin gurb iad an sórt daoine go mba cheart bheith ar an mbord ná múinteoirí náisiúnta, múinteoirí meán-oideachais, múinteoirí gairm-oideachais, ceannaire Chumann na Sagart agus ceannairí eagraisí Ghaeilge eile.  Ba cheart Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta bheith ar an mbord chomh maith le Rúnaí na Roinne <Col N="846" /> Oideachais.  Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom duine ó Chonradh na Gaeilge bheith ar an mbord freisin.</P>
    <P>Le cúpla lá anuas bhí scéal sna nuachtáin go raibh fear ceapaithe mar chathaoirleach.  Bhí Ciarraíoch eile, Domhaill Ó Foghlú, ainmnithe.  Nach ait an scéal é go raibh an tAire leis an fear céanna ar chláracha teilifíse? Tá seanfhocal againn i gCiarraí: aithníonn Domhnall Domhnaillín. Táim ag rá leis an Aire arís bheith cúramach.  Ní féidir leis bord mar seo a bhunú ar ghaineamh.</P>
    <P>Taispeánann tuarascáil an choiste a bhunaíodh i 1975 chun dearcadh an phobail don Ghaeilge a léiriú go raibh furmhór de mhuintir na tíre ancheanúil ar an Ghaeilge.  Caithfimíd na daoine sin a ghríosadh agus a mhealladh. Uaireannta cuireann rud beag duine i gcoinne na teanga, go mór mhór ó thaobh deontasaí.  Tá fhios ag an Aire&mdash;táim cinnte go bhfuil an cás céanna ag daoine eile&mdash;cás fir as Contae Mhuigheo a phósann cailín ó Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Toisc go bhfuil obair ar fáil anois ins na Gaeltachtaí, buíochas le Dia, tagann an fear as Mhuigheo thar n-ais go dtí a dhuthaigh féin.  An chéad rud atá ag cur isteach ar an bhfear sin ná tig a thógáil dó féin.  Toisc nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge ag a bhean chéile agus toisc nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge ag na páistí, agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil cuid de na páistí ocht mbliain, níl an tAire sásta deontas a thabhairt don bhfear sin chun tig a thógáil.  Sin é an fáth go ndúirt mé i dtosach báire go mba cheart Rúnaí Aireacht na Gaeltachta bheith ar an mbord má taimíd ag iarraidh spiorad a chothú ins na daoine.  Toisc nach bhfuil an fear sin ábalta an deontas d'fháil, mar a deirtear as Béarla, bíonn sórt &ldquo;chip&rdquo; aige as san amach an fhad atá sé ag maireachtaint sa Ghaeltacht.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh an rúnaí, an bord agus an tAire, i gcomhluadar le chéile in ann féachaint arís ar na deontasaí, go mór mhór ar an bpointe sin a luaigh mé don Aire.</P>
    <P>Gan dabht ar bith, tá na coláistí samhraidh ag déanamh maitheas don teanga.  Mar sin féin, ba cheart stiúrúchán bheith faoi Bhord na Gaeilge i dteannta le Roinn na Gaeltachta, <Col N="847" /> mar tá géarghá le leanúint suas leis na páistí sin nuair a fhilleann siad thar n-ais go Chill Dara, Baile Átha Cliath, Ceatharlach, Port Láirge, Cill Mantáin, Loch Garman, Tiobrad Árann, mar is ar na páistí agus daoine óga atáimid go léir ag braith chun cothú na Gaeilge a leanúint agus a thabhairt don sliocht agus sleacht a bheidh ag teacht in ár ndiaidh.  Deirtear go bhfuil 50 faoin gcéad den daonra faoi bhun 30 bliain.  Caithfidh an bord béim a chur ar na daoine sin.</P>
    <P>Tá clú agus cáil ar fúd na tíre ar Radio na Gaeltachta, ach nach bhfuil sé in am don Aire féin agus dAire Poist agus Telegrafa teacht le chéile agus an craolachán a leathnú ar feadh cúpla uaire eile sa lá?  Do chasas féin agus taim cinnte gur chas a lán Teachtaí eile le daoine ar fúd na tíre agus tá sé de sórt religion acu éisteacht le Radio na Gaeltachta gach tráthnóna. Ba cheart ceangal de shaghas éigin bheith ag an mbeirt acu. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tAire nó an Rúnaí atá aige ábalta an ceangal sin a chothú mar tá Radio na Gaeltachta ag déanamh sár obair.</P>
    <P>Tá muintir Chiarraí an-bhródúil as &ldquo;Siamsa Tíre&rdquo;.  Tá géar-ghá le níos mó cabhair a thabhairt dóibh agus ba cheart don bhord siamsa a thógaint isteach i ngach contae.</P>
    <P>I ndeireadh an lae, gan dabht ar bith, is iad na múinteoirí scoile na daoine is tábhachtaí.  Muna bhfuil grá don Ghaeilge ar fáil sna scoileanna agus an grá sin á neartú, tá deireadh leis an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá géarghá freisin le textbooks a chur ar fáil do na páistí ar phraghas réasúnta.  Measaim féin go mba cheart don bhord sórt subsidy a thabhairt d'aon scoil atá i ndáiríre mar gheall ar an nGaeilge.  Sin é an fáth go ndúirt mé i dtosach báire go mba cheart rúnaí nó leas-rúnaí don Aire Oideachais a bheith ar an mbord.</P>
    <P>Ní dhéanfaidh sé aon díobháil don Rialtas ná don Fhreasúra gach rud a dhéanamh tré Ghaeilge lá amháin sa mhí.  Mura bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa ag cuid de na Teachtaí, bheadh sórt bilingualism againn agus ní <Col N="848" /> bheadh aon duine ag gáirí toisc nach raibh an Ghaeilge go maith aige. Mar a deirimid sna Ghaeltachtaí, bheadh sé maith go leor acu.  Ba cheart an rud céanna a chur amach ón Roinn Comhshaoil go dtí na comhairlí contae agus cruinniú amháin a bheith acu siúd as Gaeilge i rith na bliana.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaimís a bheith ag caint ó dhubh go dubh agus nuair nach bhfuilimíd ag tabhairt an deá-shampla, cinnte an chéad cheist a thiocfaidh isteach i gceann an duine ar an sráid ná, an bhfuil siad dáiríre nuair nach bhfuil siad ag caint Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé i dtosach báire, bhunuigh an Comhrialtas Bord na Gaeilge agus tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil sé á chur ar bhonnaibh ceart anois.  Níl fhios agam cén fáth nár thug an tAire comhgháirdeas&mdash;bhféidir gur thug&mdash;sa méid adúirt sé don bhord atá ann, mar measaim féin gur dheineadar sár obair le dhá bhliain go leith anuas agus caithfidh mé é sin a rá.</P>
    <P>Fadó fadó, mar adúirt Eamon Kelly, bhí sórt múinteoirí taistil timpeall caoga bliain ó shin agus measam féin go mba cheart don bhord cuimhniú arís ar sórt exercise a bhí ar siúl ag na múinteoirí taistil.  Ní dhéanfaidh sé aon díobháil in aon chor daoine a thógaint ón Ghaeltacht agus iad a thabhairt isteach go dtí cruinniú i mBaile Átha Cliath nó i gCorcaigh agus go n-éistfeadh na daoine ó Bhaile Átha Cliath leis na daoine ón Ghaeltacht ag comhrá le chéile nó ag comhrá le aon duine ó Bhaile Átha Cliath nó Corcaigh go raibh fonn air cúpla focal Gaeilge a labhairt.  Ba cheart don bhord costas a íoc leis na daoine sin. Tá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta macánta agus aon duine go bhfuil fonn air cúpla focal a labhairt labhróidh fear ón nGaeltacht ar ais leis an bhfear sin.</P>
    <P>Arís fiafraím den Aire an bhfuil a dhóthain airgid ag an mbord?  Measaim féin go bhfuil géarghá ag an mbord le public relations society. Is cinnte go raibh an bord ag obair go crua, ach is fíor a rá nach raibh  a lán daoine cad a bhí ar siúl go dtí gur tháinig sórt Press Conference ar an bpáipéar agus níor <Col N="849" /> tháinig sé go dtí cúpla seachtain ó shin.  Deirim leis an Aire níos mó airgid a thabhairt dóibh agus rud eile mar fhocal scoir, nuair atá an Rialtas ag ceapadh aon duine go hoifigiúil sna Gaeltachtaí is cuma sa diabhal cad atá ar siúl ag an bhfear sin, dlíodóir, breitheamh, nó státseirbhíseach, ba cheart an Ghaeilge a bheith go líofa ag an bhfear sin.  Ar an <i>Sunday Press</i> an 9ú lá d'Aibreán tá sé ráite mar gheall ar bhreitheamh&mdash; nílim chun ainm an bhreithimh a lua &mdash;gur Béarla teanga amháin cúirt áirithe sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Is i mBéarla a cuireadh tús le hobair an lae.  I nGaeilge a bhí an togharmach etc. ach is i mBéarla a ghlaodh an Breitheamh amach é.  Níl sé sin ceart. Ba cheart don Aire dul go dtí Gearóid Ó Coileáin, an tAire, agus a rá leis má tá sé ag ceapadh breitheamh sna Gaeltachtaí ba cheart an Ghaeilge a bheith aige.</P>
    <P>Deirim leis an Aire go gcuirim anafháilte roimh an mBille.  Iarraim arís air go macánta gan an pholaitíocht a thabhairt isteach sa bhord, go mórmhór daoine a bhfuil baint acu leis an bpolaitíocht.</P>
    <P>Measaim féin go raibh ar intinn an iar-Aire, an Teachta Ó Domhnaill, an dá Bhille maidir leis an Údarás agus Bord na Gaeilge a thabhairt isteach le chéile.  Iarraim ar an Aire seans a thabhairt dos na daoine, mar sílim gurb é seo an seans deireanach do gach duine againn an Ghaeilge a choimeád le haghaidh na mblianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa freisin fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille seo. Níl mórán difríochta, má tá an ceart agam, idir an Bhille seo agus Bille eile nár foillsíodh é ach a raibh ar intinn ag an gComhrialtas.  Má tá Gaeilge againn no leath-Ghaeilge, tá forbairt agus fás na Gaeilge ag teastáil uainn, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an Bord nua in ann obair mhaith a dhéanamh ar son na teanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl ach cúpla focail le rá agamsa ar an ócáid seo, ach ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don téacs os ar gcomhair.  Ní téacs amháin atá i gceist anseo ach cúpla ceann acu.  Tá an téacs oifigiúil as Gaeilge.  Maith go leor, ach féach <Col N="850" /> ar an téacs eile, téacs as Béarla.  Féach arís ar leathanach a h-aon: &ldquo;BORD NA GAEILGE BILL, 1978.  Official translation.&rdquo;  An aistriúchán oifigiúil é seo?  Cé dhein an t-aistriúchán seo?  An ndearnadh é i Roinn na Gaeltachta?  Cad 'na thaobh nach bhfuil sé clóbhuailte?  An rud nua é seo, aistriúchán nach bhfuil clóbhuailte a chur amach?  Is í seo an chéad uair, dar liomsa, a tharla rud den tsort seo san Dáil.</P>
    <P>Rinne an tAire trácht ar an obair atá déanta ag an mBord atá ann faoi láthair.  Is obair mhaith é, agus ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Seanadóir T.K. Whitaker agus an foireann a bhí aige maidir leis an obair atá déanta acu. Níl an obair sin le feiceáil go h-iomlán, go poiblí, fós, ach tá sé déanta, agus a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an Bord nua chomh neamhspleach agus chomh láidir leis an Bord atá ag imeacht as oifig.  Beidh ceannaire neamhspleach, ceannaire láidir, ag teastáil ag an mBord nua mar a bhí ag an mBord cile.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire go mbeadh deis ag na heagrais éagsúla atá ag obair go dúthrachtach leis na blianta chun leas na Gaeilge comhoibriú leis an mBord nua, agus tá an ceart aige.  Ach tá eagras eile tábhachtach ann, eagras nach bhfuil focal faoi san óráid seo. An Roinn Oideachais atá i gceist agam. Bhí Aire Oideachais ann cúpla bliain ó shin.  Ní raibh mórán Gaeilge aige ach bhí meas mór aige uirthi.  Donncha Ó Maille ab ainm dó agus dúirt sé uair amháin, as Béarla má tá an ceart agam: &ldquo;I do not wish to preside over the death of the Irish language.&rdquo;  Tá súil agam go bhfuil an intinn chéanna ag an Aire Oideachais atá ann faoi láthair agus go mbeidh an Roinn Oideachais ag comhoibriú go tréan leis an mBord nua.  Muna bhfuil seans maith ag na páistí an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim níl seans ag éinne.  Tá an obair tosnaithe ag an mBord atá ag imeacht.  Níl an obair seo críochnaithe. Beidh sé chomh riachtanach amárach agus atá sé inniu.  Ach má tá an tacaíocht ann ó thaobh an Rialtais agus an airgid, beidh an obair sin á dhéanamh agus beidhmidne ar an taobh seo ag cuidiú leis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Os rud é go raibh baint agamsa mar iar-Aire le bunú Bord na Gaeilge sílim go mba chóir dom cúpla focail a rá cé nach bhfuil aon rud ullamh agam.  Is í seo an chéad deis a bhí agamsa chun fáilte a chur roimh an Aire, an Teachta Donncha Ó Gallchobhair.  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis as ucht a cheapacháin mar Aire na Gaeltachta, agus gúim rath Dé ar an obair thábhachtach atá idir lámha aige.</P>
      <P>Is céim ar aghaidh i Bord na Gaeilge a chur ar bhonn reachtúil.  Dúirt an tAire in a ráiteas gur mhol Comhairle na Gaeilge go mbunófai bord Stáit chun cúram a thabhairt don teanga. Ghlac an Comhrialtas agus mé féin mar iar-Aire leis an moladh sin, agus cé go ndúirt an tAire Ó Gallchobhair go mbfhearr leis dá mbeadh an Bord bunaithe ar bhonn reachtúil ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liomsa a chur i gcuimhne don Aire gur mhol Comhairle na Gaeilge go mbunófaí an Bord ar dtús ar bhonn <i>ad hoc.</i>  Ghlac mise leis an moladh sin agus i gcás boird Stáit áirithe sílim gur rud maith é sin.  Rinneadh an rud céanna maidir le bord Údaráis um Ard Oideachas.  Thug an bord <i>ad hoc</i> faoi na ceisteanna a scrúdú, breithniú ar pholasaí, experiments a dhéanamh agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>Níl aon rud achrannach sa Bhille seo, ach tá imní orm maidir le rud amháin nach bhfuil i ráiteas an Aire, sé sin, mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Beaglaoich, níor ghlac se leis an ócáid chun an moladh ata tuillte ag an gcathaoirleach, an Dr. Whitaker agus baill an Bhoird a cheapadh trí bliain ó shin.  Tá ard-mholadh tuillte acu agus is mór an trua&mdash;b'fhéidir gur dearmad a rinne an tAire, glacaim leis gur dearmad a raibh ann&mdash;go measfá ó raiteas an Aire nach ndearna Bord na Gaeilge faic ar bith go dtí an bhliain seo.  Ní fíor é sin ar chor ar bith.  Rinne an Dr. Whitaker agus comhaltaí an Bhoird sár obair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labhair an tAire faoi na hiarrachtaí atá á dhéanamh anois chun an teanga a thabhairt chun cinn.  Tá áiteacha i nDaingean agus i gContae Phort Láirge in ar thosnaímear an obair sin cúpla bliain ó shin.  Chomh fada agus is <Col N="852" /> cuimhin liom, sé an chéad rud a rinne Bord na Gaeilge ná scéim nua a chur ar bun, scéim bunaithe ar fhorbairt phobail&mdash;community action for the promotion of the language.  Ba é sin an bun-phrionsabal a bhí ag Bord na Gaeilge.  Bhí an-áthas ormsa faoi sin agus tá áthas orm inniu go bhfuil an bun-phrionsabal céanna sin ag an Bord faoi láthair agus go bhfuil an scéim sin dá leathnú go dtí áiteacha eile.  Chonaic mé an obair a bhí ar siúl i bPort Láirge ina bhfuil scéim an-shuimiúil ar fad ag dul chun cinn le cúpla bliain.  Is é an rud is tábhachtaí faoin scéim sin in iarthar Phort Láirge ná go bhfuil pobal an cheantair páirteach ins an scéim.  Tá an Community Development Aid ag dul go hanmhaith, ach tá brón orm nach bhfuil aon rud ós ár gcomhair inniu ag insint dúinn go bhfuil áit eile in a rinneadh sár-iarracht le blianta beaga anuas chun an teanga a chur chun cinn seachas na háiteacha a luaigh mé.</P>
    <P>Sílim go mba chóir go mbeadh áiteanna mar sin chun tosaigh i scéimeanna mar seo.  Sé an chéad cuspóir a bhí agam agus mé ag éirí chun cainte anseo inniu ná moladh poiblí a thabhairt do Chathaoirleach agus do chomhaltaí an bhoird.  Feicim sa Bhille aon difríocht amháin idir é agus an Bille a bhí ullmhaithe ag an gComhrialtas, sé sin, go raibh orainn níos mó comhaltaí boird a cheapadh nó mar atá sa Bhille seo.  Bhí sé ar intinn againn trí áiteacha ar a laghad ar an mbord a thabhairt d'ionadaithe na Gaeltachta, ionadaithe a bheidh toghtha ag muintir na Gaeltachta. Sílim go bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an Ghaeltacht ó thaobh aithbheochain na teanga.  Sí an Ghaeltacht tobar agus foinse ár dteanga agus ár gcultúr.  Tá fíor-ghá freisin go mbeadh an teanga scaipthe idir an Ghaeltacht agus an cuid eile den tír. Dá bhrí sin tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh ceangail idir Bhord na Gaeilge agus Údaras na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam céard atá i gceist ag an Aire faoi láthair, mar níl Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta againn go fóill, ach tá súil agam go mbeidh cúpla comhaltaí, ar a laghad, ar an mBord a mbeadh le ceapadh ag an Aire ón <Col N="853" /> Ghaeltacht.  Muna bhfuil Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta ullamh aige fós, b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé in ann cúpla comhaltaí as Bord Ghaeltarra Éireann a chur go sealadach ar Bhord na Gaeilge go dtí go mbeadh Údarás na Gaeltachta bunaithe.  Ón tréimhse a chaith mise mar Aire na Gaeltachta, níl aon amhras agam faoin tábhacht ar leith atá sa cheangail sin idir an Ghaeltacht agus an chuid eile den tír.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith, ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt go poiblí d'fhoireann an Bhoird, an príomhoifigeach feidhmeannach agus an fhoireann bheag a bhí aige, mar chomh maith le comhaltaí an Bhoird rinne an príomhoifigeach Feidhmeannach agus a fhoireann sár-obair.  Obair nua go hiomlán a bhí le déanamh acu: Ní raibh aon Bhord Stáit cosúil leis an mBord sin ó bunaíodh an Stát agus rinne siad sár-obair.  Tuigim anois go bhfuil duine nó beirt den chéad fhoireann imithe, ach mar sin féin tá árdmholadh tuillte acu.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé go raibh sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh an ceangal ceart idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Bord na Gaeilge.  Aontaím go hiomlán leis an pholasaí atá bunaithe ag Bord na Gaeilge chun an teanga a chur chun cinn tré fhorbairt phoiblí, ach tá áit amháin gur cóir an bhéim a chur air thar aon áit eile, sé sin na breac-Ghaeltachtaí. Tá géar-ghá go ndéanfaí obair ar leith chun an teanga a aibheochain arís sna háiteacha ar a dtugtar na breac-Ghaeltachtaí.  Luaim an áit ina gcónaíonn an tAire agus áiteacha eile i gContac Mhaigh Eo&mdash;tá i gceist go háirithe agam Oileán Acla &mdash;ina bhfuil cuid díobh sa Ghaeltacht agus an chuid eile taobh amuigh. Tá aithne fada ag an Aire ar Oileán Acla agus tá a fhios aige go bhfuil deis iontach aige an teanga a thabhairt chun cinn ní amháin i nGaeltacht Acla ach san oileán go hiomlán.  Tá challenge mór ann agus tá scóp mór ann, chun beartas nua a chur chun cinn ionas go neartófaí an teanga in Oileán Acla agus sna ceantair eile.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, i dtaobh na Breac-Ghaeltachta agus an Ghaeltacht féin agus i dtaobh athbheochain na teanga, níl áit eile sa tír is tábhachtaí ná na Breac-Ghaeltachtaí mar is sna <Col N="854" /> háiteacha sin atá an teanga ag na daoine ach ní labhraíonn siad an teanga ach go hannamh.  Dá bhrí sin, caithfidh Bord na Gaeilge aghaidh a thabhairt ar cheantair mar Oileán Acla, áiteacha i nDún na nGall agus Conamara agus go deimhin ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Tá go leor dea-shamplaí ann, ceantair bheaga i gCondae Chiarraí a bhfuil aithne agamsa onthu ar imeall Chorca Dhuibhne.  Rinneadh sár-iarracht iontu staid na teanga a fheabhsú agus ba cheart aitheantas a thabhairt do na ceantair sin ó thaobh na teanga.  Tá an Ghaeilge ag na daoine sin ach ní labhraíonn siad í. Caithfimid tosnú nua a dhéanamh.  Tá súil agam go gcabhróidh na heagrais dheonacha Gaeilge, chomh maith le Bord na Gaeilge chun an teanga a neartú agus a leathnú sna ceantair sin mar, taobh amuigh den teanga, tá tabhacht ar leith ag baint leis na Limistéir Bhreac-Ghaeltachta.  Tá na ceantair Ghaeltachta scaipthe ar fud cósta an iarthair agus sna hoileáin. Is ceantair an-bheag iad ó thaobh forbairt eacnamaíochta, agus tá sé andeacair ar fad polasaí ceart a chur ar siúl ina n-aghaidh.  Tá deacracht mór, cuir i gcás, in oileáin áirithe, chomh maith, toisc go bhfuil cuid den oileán taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus an chuid eile taobh istigh.  Dá leanófaí an teanga ar fud an oileáin bheadh an tAire in ann polasaí eacnamaíochta agus soisialta a bheadh oiriúnach don oileán go léir a bhunadh.  Mar a fheicim an scéal, tá obair fíor-thábhachtach le déanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá tosnú ana-mhaith déanta agus tá brón orm nár admhaigh an tAire é sin go poiblí.  Glacaim anois gur dearmad a rinneadh sé.  Chomh maith leis sin, tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh polasaí Bhord na Gaeilge bunaithe ar an tuarascáil ón Choiste a bunaíodh chun dearcadh na ndaoine a léiriú. Rinne an Coiste sin obair an-thábhachtach ar fad.  Don chéad uair, tá eolas ar fáil againn ar dhearcadh muintir na hÉireann don teanga.  Tá eolas cruinn ann, eolas a bheadh cuideachtach ar fad do Bhord na Gaeilge ag bunadh polasaí nua.  Ón tuarascáil sin tháinig cúpla rudaí amach go soiléir: an taon rud, go bhfuil muintir na hÉireann nó an chuid is mó de mhuintir na tíre seo i bhfábhar polasaí chun <Col N="855" /> an teanga a chur chun chinn; go raibh an chuid is mó de mhuintir na hÉireann i gcoinne polasaí éigeantach; go bhfuil an chuid is mó de mhuintir na hÉireann i bhfábhar polasaí a bheadh bunaithe ar scéimeanna sasúil do mhuintir na hÉireann, scéimeanna chun an teanga a chur chun cinn a bheidh ceangailte le scéimeanna cúltúrtha. Chomh maith leis sin, tagann sé amach go soiléir ón tuarascáil sin go bhfuil an chuid is mó de mhuintir na hÉireann i bhfábhar forbairt eacnamaíochta agus soisialta na Gaeltachta. Deirtear san tuarascáil freisin go mba chóir don Rialtas agus anois do Bhord na Gaeltachta an bhéim a chur ar na breac-Ghaeltachtaí.  Rinne mé tagairt cúpla noiméad ó shin do thábhacht na mbreac-Ghaeltachtaí.  Tagann sé sin amach go soiléir san tuarascáil ar an taighde a rinneadh chun dearcadh an phobail a léiriú.</P>
    <P>Nuair a smaoinigh mé ar Bhord na Gaeilge <i>ad hoc</i>, rinneadh mé a lán smaoineamh ar líon na ndaoine a bheadh ar an mBord, ar chóir go mbéadh 12 daoine ar an mbord.  Dob é mo thuairimse go mba chóir bord mar sin a leathnú, that it would be as widely representative a board as was possible.  Bhí fonn ormsa eagrais a tharraingt isteach, cur i gcás, Bantracht na Tuaithe, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, daoine a raibh cáilíocht faoi leith acu.  Rinne mé sár-iarracht ag an am san bureaucracy a choimeád amach ón mBord.  Bá é sin tri bliain ó shin.</P>
    <P>D'aithnigh gach éinne ag an am san nach raibh aon political skulduggery ag baint le ceapacháin an bhoird sin, gurb iad ceisteanna teanga, ceisteanna Gaeilge, ceisteanna cultúrtha na Gaeltachta a bhí i gceist.  Má léann éinne na tuarascála ar na díospóireachtaí sin, feicfidh sé go raibh an chuid is mó den díospóireacht sin, taobh amuigh den Teach nó taobh istigh de, ceangailte le ceisteanna polaitíochta. Bhí iarrachtaí ann chun an teanga a cheangail le party politics.  Unfortunately, since the foundation of the State, the whole question of the revival of the language has been tied up with political ideologies and certain types of ideologies in particular, and this, in my opinion had the vastest implications <Col N="856" /> and repercussions on the whole revival movement.  Dá bhrí sin, bhí sé de phríomh fheidhm agamsa, ag bunadh Bord na Gaeilge nach mbéadh aon ionad ann ag páirtí polaitíochta, that not only was it not there but that it would be seen not to be there.  Tá súil agam, agus sé an taon rud atá á iarraidh agam ar an Aire ná, nuair a bheidh sé ag ceapadh an bhoird nua go ndéanfaidh sé an rud céanna. go gceapfaidh sé daoine a bhfuil a gcroithe san obair maidir leis an teanga.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile chomh maith.  Tá an t-éigeantacht imithe as an teanga anois agus táimíd go léir ag iarraidh an grá a chothú mar bhun-pholasaí in ionad an éigeantachta.  Tá mise sásta, as ucht an téigeantacht a bheith imithe, go bhfuil spiorad nua ann anois, go bhfuil atmaisféar nua ann anois, go bhfuil fonn ar dhaoine anois an cúpla focail Gaeilge atá acu a labhairt.  Tá sé sin go soiléir ón raidio is ón telefís.  Tá sé go soiléir chomh maith an iarracht a rinne Bord na Gaeilge chun coistí féile ar fúd na tíre a mhealladh chun cláracha Gaeilge a thabhairt isteach sna féilithe fán dtuaith.  Bhí an tAire féin i dTráighlí anuraidh agus chonaic sé ann an tslí ina raibh imeachtaí Gaeilge meascaithe i gclár na bhféilithe móra a bhí ann le imeachtaí cultúra, taispeántais Ghaeltachta, cheoil agus rince agus rudaí mar sin.  Sin é an saghas polasaí a chabhróidh go mór leis an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Is cuimhin liom go maith, 30 nó 40 imeachtaí Gaeilge agus cultúrtha ar siúl i rith seachtain Ghaeilge chathair Luimní.</P>
    <P>Cúis áthais agus gliondar croí dom cuireadh a fháil chuig Féile mór Thrá Lí.  Bhí na mílte daoine ann ón tír agus ó gach tír thar lear.  Bhí ár gceol féin le cloisteáil.  Bhí fonn ar dhaoine cúpla focal Gaeilge a úsáid i nith na seachtaine sin.  Bhí céilithe agus rinnce agus gach rud mar sin&mdash;an t-atmosféar Gaelach, an t-atmosféar ceart.  Tá sé an-simplí agus mar sin féin tá sé antábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Rud eile maidir le ceist na gcraolachán, ceist teilifíse agus raidio&mdash; agus rinne an Teachta Begley tagairt do cheist Radio na Gaeltachta&mdash;cé <Col N="857" /> nach bhfuil dualgas ar Aire na Gaeltachta maidir le ceisteanna mar sin, mar sin féin tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint le cúrsaí craolacháin ó thaobh athbheochan na teangan dhe.</P>
    <P>Dúras cheana gurb é mó thuairimse &mdash;agus tagann sé sin amach go sóiléir as an tuarascáil um thaighde ar dhearcadh an phobail&mdash;go bhfuil fonn mór ar mhuintir na hÉireann an teanga a chur chun cinn in atmosféar nua, atmosféar gan aon achrann nó searbhas go háirithe gan aon achrann polaitíochta.  Is cuma cén polasaí polaitíochta atá ag aon duine nó ag aon pháirtí sa tír seo, táimse ag rá go poiblí anseo gurb é mo thuairimse go bhfuil an chuid is mó de mhuintir na hÉireeann i bhfábhar na teangan.</P>
    <P>Tá feabhas tagaithe ar chúrsaí na teangan le blianta beaga anuas.  Is é mo thuairimse gur tháinig an feabhas sin de bharr an pholsaí nua gan an t-éigeantas&mdash;polasaí níos suimiúla, níos cáirdiúla.  Tá clár amháin, &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; agus tugtar a lán moladh don chlár sin beagnach gach seachtain.  Rinne an Teachta Begley tagairt dó.  D'éirigh thar barr le &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; mar tá an t-atmosféar ann an-cháirdiúil.  Bíonn deis ag duine a bhfuil &ldquo;cúpla focal&rdquo; aige na &ldquo;cúpla focal&rdquo; sin a úsáid. Tá eolas an-shuimiúil agamsa go bhfuil a lán daoine ins an single channel area ag féachaint ar an gclár sin gach seachtain.  Tá aithne agamsa ar chuid mhaith daoine a thosaigh ag foghlaim na Gaeilge arís ionas go mbeadh siad in ann an clár sin a thuiscint i gceart.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, inseoidh mé scéal duit atá an-oiriúnach. Cuimhin liom go maith cúpla mí ó shin, bhuail mé isteach i dteach cara atá agamsa i Luimneach.  Tá an fear sin pósta le cailín a rugadh agus a tógadh i Sasana, agus tháinig sé ar ais nuair a fuair sé post in Aerfort na Sionna.  Tá sé ina chónaí i gcathair Luimní.  Rugadh an fear sin i gContae an Chláir.  Chuaigh sé go Londain, phós sé cailín agus tháinig sé ar ais. Chuaigh mé isteach sa teach cúpla uair.  Bhí bean an tí ann agus <i>Buntús Cainte</i> ina láimh aici agus í ag foghlaim na Gaeilge, ag déanamh iarracht feabhas a chur ar a cuid Gaeilge <Col N="858" /> ionas go mbeadh sí in ann níos mó tairbhe a bhaint as &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo;. Sin scéal fíor, ach tá moral ann má táimid chun an teanga a chur chun cinn le polasaí réalaíoch agus tré beartanna réalaíoch cosúil leis na scéimeanna phobail atá ag Bord na Gaeilge.  An príomh-aidhm a bhí ann i gcónaí ná muintir na hÉireann a mhealladh chun an t-eolas atá acu nó an líofacht atá acu&mdash;is cuma beag nó mór&mdash;a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Is mar seo atá an scéal mar a thuigimse é.  Tá timpeall suas le 15 faoin gcéad de mhuintir na hÉireann a bhfuil an teanga líofa acu.  Tá 85 faoin gcéad cosúil liomsa, cosúil linne go léir sa Teach ach, b'fhéidir an tAire&mdash;rugadh agus tógadh i gceantar Gaeltachta é. Chaith na gnáthdaoine sa tír seo sé nó seacht mbliana sa bhunscoil agus cúig bliana i scoil iar-bhunoideachais.  I rith an dá bhliain déag sin bhí an teanga acu.  Bhí ceachtanna Gaeilge acu gach lá ar feadh dhá uair a chloig. Bhí onóracha acu sa Ghaeilge nuair a d'fhág siad an scoil.  Sin í an fhadhb is mó.  Sin é an tragedy de i stair na teangan.  Stopann daoine ag labhairt as Gaeilge.  Sin é an cás le 80 faoin gcéad de mhuintir na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Conas a tharla sin?  Tá cuid den freagra le fáil san tuarascáil um thaighde ar dhearcadh an phobail, ach níl an freagra go léir ann.  Cé go bhfuil an bord laghdaithe anois go dtí dosaen tá súil agam go mbeidh na daoine céanna ceapaithe arís nó an chuid is mó daoibh, agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh an foireann céanna agus an príomh-oifigeach céanna leis an mbord. Bord nua atá ann anois, bord atá neamhspleách gan baint ar bith le cúrsaí polaitíochta.  Sa chaoi sin beidh siad in ann polasaí réalaíoch a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh Bord na Gaeilge as seo amach a pholasaí a bhunú ar an tuarascáil um thaighde ar dhearcadh an phobail.  Mar adúirt an tAire&mdash; agus caithfidh mé aontú leis&mdash;cé go bhfuil bord Stáit bunaithe anois chun an teanga a chur chun cinn beidh dualgas fós ar na Ranna Stáit eile agus go háirithe ar an Roinn Oideachais, an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Is maith an rud é sin.  Mar adúirt an Teachta Begley tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint le <Col N="859" /> cursaí oideachais ó thaobh na teangan. Ach tá dualgas amháin ar an Aire.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil an dualgas sin ar na Ranna Stáit eile agus go mbeidh bord Stáit nua ann chun an teanga a chur chun cinn, tá dualgas ar leith ag Aire na Gaeltachta.  Chomh maith leis bheith i gcúram na Gaeltachta tá an tAire, mar a dearfá, ina Aire le Gaeilge&mdash;is é sin, tá cúram eile ag Aire na Gaeltachta.  Mar a bhí agamsa nuair a bhí mé i gcúram Roinn na Gaeltachta, tá an t-ádh leis an Aire foireann an mhaith a bheith aige i Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is é seo an chead ócáid a bhíagamsa chun moladh poiblí a thabhairt do a lán daoine, don Aire, do Bhord na Gaeilge agus do Roinn na Gaeltachta agus an fhoireann an-bheag atá ann. Le blianta beaga anuas, tháinig méadú mór ar an méid oibre atá le déanamh acu agus tá súil agam go méadóidh go mór air sna blianta atá le teacht. Ar feadh an tréimhse a chaith mise mar Aire is féidir liom a rá go raibh gach ball den fhoireann sin i mBaile Átha Cliath agus ar fud na Gaeltachta i ndáiríre.  Bhísiad sásta i gcónaí obair a dhéanamh above and beyond the normal call of duty.  Mar sin, tá áthas orm moladh a thabhairt don fhoireann sin.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, mar a dúirt mé i dtosach, guím rath Déar an Aire.  Is féidir leis bheith ag súil le gach cabhair agus tacaíocht ón taobh seo den Teach i leith aon pholasaí réalaíoch chun an teanga a thabhairt chun cinn, ach ní bheidh aon tacaíocht le fáil aige d'aon pholasaí a bheidh bunaithe ar phointí polaitiochta.  The Minister can be assured of the full support of this side of the House in any steps he takes&mdash;and that goes too for Bord na Gaeilge&mdash;towards realistic, honest policies to promote our language and our culture and to develop our Gaeltacht.  If these policies are to succeed and command the respect of both sides of this House, an essential requirement if the people are to em-brace a policy, the Minister must make absolutely certain there will be no political overtones or undertones in the promotion of these policies.  I hope Bord na Gaeilge will succeed.  It <Col N="860" /> represents a new dimension in the promotion of the language and I wish the board well.</P>
    <P>Beidh scans againn an tseachtain sco chugainn nó an tseachtain ina dhiaidh ceisteanna a chur ar an Aire ar an Tríú Staid den Bhille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá an mBille seo ach ba mhaith liom labhairt as Béarla mar níl an Ghaeilge chomh líofa agam go fóill agus bheinn ró-mhall.  Aontaím leis an Aire nuair a deir sé go bhfuil dualgas orainn uile ár neart a chur le chéile, na Ranna Stáit, na comhlachtaí Stáit, na h-udaráis áitiúla, na h-eagrais náisiúnta chomh maith leis na h-eagrais dheonacha Gaeilge, gan trácht ar Theachtaí Dála.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on the Bill and because I would speak very slowly as Gaeilge ba mhaith liom labhairt as Béarla.  I am glad the Minister is providing an additional sum for this new board.  One of the matters he might bear in mind in regard to Deputies is the provision here of suitable refresher courses for Deputies.  I emphasise &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; because the work burden on Deputies is a very onerous one and it is not so easy to avail of outside courses.  If we are serious and honest in our intention to restore Irish then let us start here in Leinster House and design a course available to Deputies at times convenient for them.  I have tried to avail of courses but they unfortunately clashed with my work as a Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the vast majority of the people support the spread of the national language and the national culture.  I regret that the emphasis in my time was very much on the academic side and consequently I could attain A marks in the leaving certificate without being able to speak the language go flúirseach.  In the current leaving certificate examination something like 20 per cent or 25 per cent of the marks are allocated to oral Irish.  If we are serious in making Irish a spoken language then better percentages should be accorded to oral Irish in the leaving certificate examination. The minimum should be 50 per <Col N="861" /> cent.  We all understand the practicalities of the examination and the gaining of the requisite points.  I have one boy sitting for it this year and another sitting for it next year so I am quite familiar with the situation.  I have a few more who will be sitting for that examination later.  It is a fact that if the marks are very low for the oral Irish the time will not be given for oral Irish in the schools.  The response will not be there in that direction.  As soon as the marks are increased, for instance to 50 per cent, I believe that immediately there will be a greater emphasis on spoken Irish.</P>
    <P>I won a few prizes in <i>Inniu</i> in my day for written Irish and, I suppose, if I was given the time I could probably do that sort of thing again.  That would be of no avail to me if I could not speak comfortably and easily the language which we all have such an interest in.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider my points.  I want him to consider the question of providing suitable courses in association with Leinster House for Deputies who are interested and I want him to look at the possibility of increasing the marks for spoken Irish in the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>I note from what the Minister has said that the Gaelic Athletic Association have been working closely with him in relation to the promotion of the language.  That has been my experience in my community.  It is extraordinary the interest there is in the language and in Irish culture.  I am aware that in the revival of Irish music on the north of the city the accordion has come into its own.  In fact, three members of my family play the accordion extremely well.  Quite a number of children are also interested in Irish music.  The work being done in this respect in conjunction with the GAA is well respected.  We also have an upsurge of activity in association with the GAA generally and we are experiencing that in the north side of the city.  This is a well-directed aspect of the work the board propose to undertake.  The colleges, such as Coláiste Pádraig, Balbriggan, to which many children from the north side of the city go on summer courses, should <Col N="862" /> receive the support of the board.  Those colleges do a great deal to generate an interest in the language and to increase the spoken language.  I could not let the occasion pass without giving some credit to those who organise the courses for Dublin children in Gaeltacht areas.  My children have benefited from such courses.  I welcome the Bill and I promise the Minister my full support in relation to its provisions. The Minister told us that the board would be relying on our support and I believe they will give careful consideration to any recommendations made here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is féidir le gach duine sa Dáil agus le gach duine san tír Béarla a labhairt ach ní féidir le gach éinne san tír Gaeilge a labhairt.  Dá bhrí sin ní féidir linn bheith ag súil go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar an t-aon teanga amháin san tír.  Caithfidh an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla maireachtáil taobh le taobh.  Cúis eile le seo go bhfuil an Béarla mar theanga idirnáisiúnta faoi láthair, agus gur mar sin a bheidh sí.</P>
      <P>Is eol dúinn go léir conas mar a cuireadh an Ghaeilge faoi smacht in Éirinn.  Blianta ó shin cheap Gaeilgeoirí gur cheart an Béarla a scrios amach ar fad agus an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais mar an t-aon teanga amháin.  Is soiléir dúinn anois nach mbeadh an gníomh seo praicticiúil ar chor ar bith.  Da bhrí sin, is i thuairim féin agus is é polasaí mo Pháirtí gur cóir dúinn an dá theanga d'úsáid, polasaí dá-theangach.  Chuige sin chuir an Teachta Ó Domhnaill Bord na Gaeilge ar bun on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis agus é mar chuspóir aige an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a úsáid mar theanga beo a leathadh i mease an phobail, mar a deireann an Bille.</P>
      <P>De bharr na tuairimí sin agus, níos nó ná sin, toisc nach bhfuil mo chuid Gaeilge ró-láidir, tá mé chun labhairt san dá theanga ar an mBille seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that he has thrown out the challenge to everybody, in particular, to Members of this House.  He said that an effort should be made, example set and a lead given.  As one who is in the broad category <Col N="863" /> of having a lot of goodwill towards the Irish language but little fluency, I will speak to this Bill on a billingual basis.  I hope the House will excuse me if I stumble over words. The first thing that occurs to me in relation to the Irish language is that we must examine the philosophy behind it.  We must see cén fá gur mian linn an Ghaeilge a bheith mar theanga bheo.</P>
    <P>Ní foláir dúinn fealsúnacht soiléir a bheith againn chuige.  Chun furmhór na ndaoine a spreagadh caithfimid a thuiscint cad a spreagann an dream go bhfuil dea-mhéin acu don Ghaeilge. Beidh an tuiscint sin fíor-riachtanach chun go neireoidh linn díogras a scaipeadh go foirleathan.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether enough emphasis has been put in the past on isolating the philosophy behind the language revival.  I believe there are many streams involved here.  I would put a lot of emphasis on isolating the philosophical base behind it.  Later I will deal with the question of arousing this interest, of working on the goodwill which I believe is there.</P>
    <P>Is mó sruth smaointe atá le feiceáil san bhfealsúnacht seo.  Ní hí an teanga féin an t-aon chomhartha amháin den naisiúnachas.  Tá ár gcultúr Gaelach le mothúin ár gcuid ceoil, in ár rincí, in ár bhfilíocht, in ár litríocht.  In a way nach suimiúil an rud é go bhfuil clú agus cáil ar fud an domhain ar scríbhneoirí Éireannacha toisc go bhfuil teanga na Gaeilge mar chúlra dá gcuid smaointe agus dá gcuid oibre as Béarla?  Sin toradh iontach eile as an dátheangachas.  We shall have to look at the whole question in the broad picture of our Irish identity, our nationality, our Irish culture and fit our philosophy and our thoughts on the Irish language into this broad picture not merely in isolation.  Many other people look to the historical background for interest in Irish.  Tá daoine sa tír a cheapann nach gá ach feachaint siar sa stair, agus conas a chuir Sasana an Ghaeilge chun bás tré na leanaí scoile a bhualadh agus tré pionós a chur ar na daoine. Is fíor sin, ach táimid neamhspleách <Col N="864" /> anois.  Nuair a bhí Troid na Saoirse ann dúirt Eamon de Valera agus Mícheál Ó Coiléan, an bheirt acu&mdash;I am quoting from John McNamara, Professor of Psychology at Magill University, author of &ldquo;Bilingualism in Ireland&rdquo; where he says: &ldquo;Both Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera stated to them that the restoration of Irish was at least as important as political independence.&rdquo; To many people the historical background is important: may be that is the motivation for them. It is another stream of thought that has to be considered.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that must be considered is our position in relation to Sasana, Eoraip, na Stáit Aontaithe agus an domhan uile.  Im thuairimse ba cheart don tír seo bheith oscailte don tionchar iasachta chun ár ndearcadh féin a leathnu.  Dá mbeadh ár náisiúnachas láidir go leor bheadh toradh maith as seo; dá mbeadh sé lag bheadh droch bhail orainn de bharr an tionchair seo.</P>
    <P>It is very important indeed that we should be entirely open.  The stronger we are in our own identity and culture I believe the more open we can be. From that position of strength the influence of outside culture will be to broaden vision and outlook and not to wash it away altogether.  Without the inner strength one would have from a national identity and culture this country could become merely a cultural backwater, a province, an outpost of the English-speaking world. We then come to the need for national identity, and I think now more than ever this need is obvious.  We are becoming part of a larger world because of our membership of the EEC and of other international bodies.  For that reason I believe there is all the more need to have a national identity, to remember our national traditions and encourage separate national cultural activities; and in that context encouragement of the Irish language forms a major part.</P>
    <P>Other aspects one would consider in looking for the philosophy here would include the question of the ultimate unity of the country.  My belief, which I think is shared by many now, is that such an aontacht must be an aontacht <Col N="865" /> idir daoine de gach tradisiún san oiléan seo&mdash;different cultures, for example.  If we are serious about the question of the unity of the people of this island we will accept that there are many different cultures, outlooks and traditions here and that any such unity must incorporate all these different standards, that we must find a place for all these different cultures. In that context, muna mbíonn ionannas náisiúnta againn, ní féidir linn tairiscint mar seo a dhéanamh. We have nothing to offer unless we have some strong cultural tradition here.  We would have a lot more to offer in the context of unity if we had this individual identity.  Again the encouragement and revival of the Irish language fits into this philosophical approach.</P>
    <P>It is important that Bord na Gaeilge should, whether by surveys, analyses or otherwise, think of the basic question: why Irish and what is the philosophy behind it?  Only in the light of that knowledge will the board be able to motivate the entire people of the country.</P>
    <P>The next question that occurs to me in considering the Bill and the encouragement of the Irish language is the question of how.  One must look at a number of different sections.  First we have na daoine agus líofacht Gaeilge acu, na daoine atá sna baill de chumainn Gaeilge agus cultúra. What can you do with these people who are committed?  First, there should be níos mó cabhair do na cumainn sin.  B'fhéidir gur mhaith an rud é bord comhairleach a bhunú i ngach contae le timire lán-aimseartha. If such an advisory board were established in each county with a full-time professional organiser, it would help the work of Bord na Gaeilge considerably and would ensure that there would be complete liaison from top to bottom.  The professional organiser initially would take steps to look at the existing organisations within each county and see how the people heavily committed to the revival of Irish can be encouraged further in their efforts and, where such organisations have become a little weak, cabhair agus cúnamh could be given to get them <Col N="866" /> off the ground again.  The advisory board with a full-time professional organiser would be of assistance in tackling another major area.  They will have to concentrate most heavily on this important area and section if they are to succeed in their effort.</P>
    <P>Creidim go bhfuil tromlach mór na ndaoine an-báúil chuig an Ghaeilge. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil ach cúpla focal acu, but the difficulty is that with those few words and goodwill, they do not use those few words.  This section of the country constitutes the majority of the people.  We are possibly talking about 75 per cent of the population, people with goodwill, with cúpla focal Gaeilge but without fluency and no practice.  Chun an teanga d'aibheochaint go héifeachtúil, caithfear spreagadh a thabhairt do na daoine seo, san slí go mbeidh siad toilteanach úsáid a bhaint as an cúpla focal Gaeilge atá acu.  Má thosnaíonn siad mar seo, creidim go leanfaidh labhairt na teanga go tapaidh cosuil le liathróid sneachta, mar a deirtear as Béarla.  We will have to try to achieve this snowball effect.  It is my belief that if this section of the population, the majority with goodwill, can be aroused and encouraged to start using the few words they have we can get this snowball off the ground. Creidim féin gurb í seo an tslíis fearr chun tabhairt faoin obair.</P>
    <P>I believe that in tackling this area a very professional approach will be involved.  The services of really professional people, in the line of market research and so on, will have to be used, firstly, to isolate what motivates them at the moment and secondly to isolate what could motivate them to start further efforts.  Having done that, there would have to be a feachtas on Radio Éireann, Telefís Éireann, nuachtáin agus nar sin de ag míniú dúinn go léir na thanna gur cóir dúinn ár teanga féin labhairt.  Having aroused this enthusiasm you would then have to continue with the campaign chun go meallfar na daoine an cúpla focal Gaeilge atá acu a chleachtadh i ngach áit, sa bhaile, san áit oibre, i gcomhluadair shóisialta agus mar sin de.  Má éiríonn leis an mbord an méid seo a dhéanamh, beidh obair déanta le haghaidh na hathbheochana.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> The third area which will have to be looked at is educational methods.  There have been changes in recent years, since I was at school, and that is not so very long ago.  During my time at school, over a period of 12 years learning the Irish language, there was no emphasis on the spoken word. The result was that I and my schoolmates never spoke Irish but we did a lot of filíocht fiannaíochta agus mar sin de but this was no good for bringing out any fluency which was there. In fact, one could say that concentration on the written word killed of any hope of fluency in the spoken word.</P>
    <P>The present situation has changed considerably but there is need for further change.  I have been reading works of people like Padraig Tyres which are a total reversal of what was taught in my time.  It is a complete concentration on the spoken word.  Initially there is no emphasis on the correct grammar and so on.  This might not be to the liking of the fíor-Ghaelgeoirí.  The Minister should monitor carefully the work being done by people like Padraig Tyres.  If it seems that certain experiments being conducted in that area are successful, he should consider very carefully an extension of that type of approach to the language.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, having planned a campaign that will deal with these and many other areas, the existing Irish speakers, Irish speaking groups, Glór na nGael and Conradh na nGaeilge, and working through them, having in particular directed their attentions towards this spreagadh among the broad mass of the population who have this goodwill, and having looked at this entire educational approach to the Irish language, the board, hopefully would consider establishing a Year of the Language, Blian na Teangan, in conjuction with the Minister.  The preliminary work having been done properly and professionally and this spreagadh having being aroused, the co-operation of state and semi-State bodies and of voluntary and community bodies could be considerable help in the effort to encourage the revival of the <Col N="868" /> language through the establishment of the Year of the Language.  If we could obtain a broad-based support for this and remove the embarrassment felt by the majority of people in using their few words of Irish, this effort might snowball and develop into a major impetus towards the achievement of the overall aim of bilingualism.</P>

      <P>It would need to be over a long period, but perhaps a week or a month might be better as a start.  There might be a more concentrated and dynamic effort over a shorter period.  The idea of a year of the language occurred to me because of various projects announced by the UN and various other organisations.  I would be quite open to the idea of a shorter period.  I am very much in favour of some period being set aside but I would emphasise that the basic work would have to be done first and a huge effort would have to be made to get the co-operation of all sections of the population.  It would be helpful if we could get this snowfall moving, turning it into an avalanche.</P>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte mór roimh an mBille seo.  Gúim gach rath ar Bhord na Gaeilge agus ta súil agam nach mbeidh aon bhaint le polataíocht ag baill an bhoird.  Tá súil agam freisin go mbeidh daoine os na cathracha agus na bailte móra, na sráid-bhailte agus faoin dtuaith páirteach ann.</P>

    <P>The number, I understand, on the statutory board is somewhat less than was envisaged when the board were set up on an <i>ad hoc basis.</i>  I am not sure whether there is a possibility of getting a representation which is broad enough with this limitation on numbers.  Everybody agrees that the basic aim must be that the board are and are seen to be non-political and that the various outlooks amongst different sections interested in the language must be represented on the board.  The county advisory groups might help in achieving this broad representation.  The only thing one would look for amongst members appointed to the board would be go <Col N="869" /> mbeadh aislingeachta agus samhlaíocht acu.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>One could say that history is being made in this House today in that a debate of this nature is taking place in both languages. Many members speak the language very fluently or have a reasonable knowledge of it, while others, like myself, do not speak it at all.  Normally it would be a source of embarrassment for one who does not speak the language to take part in a debate of this nature, but the mature kind of debate which is taking place and the kind of contribution we have heard from across the floor give one a tremendous sense of encouragement and hope for the future of our language.  I agree completely with the sentiment that our language must never be made a political football.  This is the most damaging thing that can happen to the language. I welcome the setting up of this board and I have a number of suggestions.</P>
      <P>People like myself are frequently embarrassed by those who could be described as fanatics for the language simply because we do not speak it. Sometimes someone says to me that he supposes I do not speak any Irish and I reply that to my shame and embarrassment I do not; I am then told I am right to be ashamed and embarrassed. My only come-back is to say that when my father was fighting for the independence of this country he did not speak Irish either.  Nobody asked him whether he could speak it but many who were able to speak Irish were not to be seen.  I have tried to equalise in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember during the presidental election campaign one of these fanatics accosted Erskine Childers in Grafton Street and attacked him because he did not speak the language. This sort of thing harms the language; these are the intolerant people who are the real enemies of the Irish language. Perhaps the Minister would consider having on this board someone who does not speak Irish or who has only a smattering of the language.  I appreciate that the committee meetings and debates will generally take place in <Col N="870" /> Irish and my suggestion may be impractical. All the people on this board will already speak Irish and it would be helpful to have someone there who knows the feelings and sensitivities of those who do not speak it, not that those who speak Irish are at all insensitive. It would be helpful to understand the deterrent effect of people who speak the language fluently on those who wish to learn it.  A former Member of this House once said to me that some of the greatest patriots did not speak Irish and he cited Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet as examples. Someone else then said that a person who really loves his country knows its language.</P>
    <P>That is a very fair and moot point. I did not love my country less because I did not speak its language, but there are people who believe that you do not love your country truly if you do not speak its language.  This is untrue and therefore encouragement here must be the priority of this board when it becomes statutory and when the Minister is either renewing or making appointments.  It is important for people like myself who do not speak the language to encourage our children to speak Irish.  I am doing everything I can through private extra lessons to help my children to speak the language.  Many former Members of this House did not have a good knowledge of Irish but they saw to it that their children did, and those children grew up to speak Irish as fluently as anyone could wish.</P>
    <P>My experience at school was a sad one.  Like many people I had a teacher of Irish who had no love of the language. He may well have been one of those who was forced to embark on a course of learning Irish in order to teach it and had therefore a resentment of the language.  He did not have any love for it and therefore could not impart any love of it.  What has emerged from this debate is that in the far past&mdash;I am talking about my school days&mdash;the emphasis was on grammar and on the written rather than the spoken word.  Again, no encouragement was given to people to speak Irish, no matter how poorly they spoke it.  Then there would be <Col N="871" /> the jealousy and the various attitudes to different dialects and disputes as to whether the Munster dialect or the Connaught dialect was the real Irish.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to that excellent programme &ldquo;Trom agus Éadtrom&rdquo; which has a smattering of English throughout.  The programme &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; is entirely in the Irish language and it would be helpful if occasionally somebody who was not able to speak Irish could appear on that programme without being embarrassed. I know from certain Members of this House who do not speak Irish that interviewers on the media do not embarrass them by asking them questions in Irish, knowing that they will not understand these questions.  There has never been an attempt by members of the RTE team of interviewers to embarrass people in that way, and this is commendable.  If there were any such attempt it would only take from the person who would try to embarrass the participant in the programme. Another excellent programme watched by adults and children is &ldquo;Amuigh faoin Spéir&rdquo; which is largely in Irish and yet maintains the interest of the viewer.</P>
    <P>The desire to learn Irish is there. The fear is also there; the mental block is also there.  I often feel that I have this mental block about learning Irish because of my sad experience with a bad teacher whose attitude was to ridicule the pupil and make him feel inferior. That kind of teacher is somebody out of the last century.  Such teachers can cause their pupils to have a resentment against the language. Thank God I do not have a resentment against the language.  I have a desire to learn it.  Deputy Woods referred to the possibility of having special classes here for Deputies who would like to bring their Irish up to a higher standard.  The problem is that there are so many different levels of understanding of the language that it is very difficult to start.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, and it is an encouragement to Deputies who do not speak Irish as freely as they would like to, to come in and speak on this and make a useful contribution which, no doubt, the members of the board will read in the Official Report.  They can get the feelings of people like myself who stand up here, maybe slightly embarrassed and taking their courage in their hands speak on this.  I am satisfied however, that there are an increasing number of people who speak Irish today and a tremendous number of people have an understanding of the language.  This is due to the teaching methods.</P>
      <P>In placing the board on a statutory basis the State gives the members of the board an idea of what is going through the minds of people who do not have the language and of the encouragement that they need.  Someone with a very limited knowledge of Irish should be encouraged to go on the board.  No doubt he will have learned a good deal of Irish after a short time.  It is important that people on this board should have a sensitivity for these people who do not speak the language and who have had to put up with insults from time to time from people who do not bring any credit at all to the case they are trying to promote.  Members of this House who speak Irish to one another have a great sensitivity towards people who do not speak the language.  Many times when I bump into my colleagues speaking Irish in the corridors they switch to English so that I will not be embarrassed because they know I do not speak Irish.  No one who does not speak Irish should be embarrassed on that account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> We are talking about encouraging people to speak Irish.  Holidays in the Gaeltacht have been referred to.  The board should liaise very actively with Bord Fáilte in getting a growing number of holiday places where young children can go to learn the language. It is no use sending children to Ballyferriter or other places if English is going to be spoken in the houses there. They are going there to learn to speak Irish and the best way to learn quickly to speak a language is to disappear into the Gaeltacht for three, four or five months.  In this way one can learn very quickly a good smattering of Irish.  The trouble with people like me is that the older one gets the more difficult it becomes to learn a language. However, it has been done by many people in the past and I have not by any means given up hope that some day I will be able to make a speech here in Irish.  The board when considering proposals for encouraging the use of the language should realise that the language has to be brought out to the people and the greatest encouragement is a quiet encouragement, not an aggressive attack.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe, if I understood him correctly, referred to a special time for speaking Irish.  He suggested a month or a year, some special time set aside to encourage people to use the few words of Irish they know.  This would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>Irish speakers abroad have a tremendous sense of pride when they speak Irish and people in those countries turn to each other and say: &ldquo;What language is that?&rdquo; Up to quite recently when Irish people went abroad they naturally spoke English and were taken to be English.  When Irish people speak Irish abroad they express their individuality and show that we are a nation, that we have our own culture and our own language.  This has encouraged people to learn Irish when they return home.</P>
    <P>The new board will have a very important task in making sure that they emphasise to the people who are very fluent in the language that they must not be bigotted, that they must avoid looking down on people who do not <Col N="874" /> speak the language very well.  It is possibly easier for me to stand up and speak on this Bill without any Irish than it is for somebody who has a few words of Irish and who is afraid to take the chance of speaking in case he is not understood.  It would take more courage for such a person to stand up and say &ldquo;I do not speak Irish but I would like to&rdquo;.  This appeals for an understanding from those who are fluent in Irish.</P>
    <P>I believe that many Deputies from all parties, if they saw the turn this debate has taken, would have come into the House and gladly taken part in the debate.  Many Deputies may be avoiding this debate because of their lack of confidence in speaking the few words of Irish they know.  It is good that the debate has become bilingual. I do not believe that tomorrow the Press will mock this and say that certain people came in and spoke in English in what should have been a specifically Irish debate.</P>
    <P>RTE should be encouraged to put on bilingual programmes, some English programmes with a sprinkling of Irish and some Irish programmes with a sprinkling of English.  The board should be able to work with the RTE Authority to ensure that the amount of Irish on their programmes is increased in a palatable way, not shoved down people's throats.  I have discovered that I know more Irish than I realised because there are many words that I see every day but they have become like English words I am so used to seeing them.  When I see the word &ldquo;bóthar&rdquo; for &ldquo;road&rdquo;.  I do not think of it as an Irish word.  We all have a certain amount of Irish but we have not confidence to use it.  The new board will have an important task in encouraging people to use the Irish they have.</P>
    <P>It is important that the board should stress that everybody, irrespective of his age, despite what I said about doubting my own ability to learn to speak Irish at my age, has the capacity to learn the language.  It is very important to stress that learning the language is not an insurmountable obstacle.  As I said at the outset, this is possibly the first time a debate on <Col N="875" /> the Department of the Gaeltacht has been conducted as much in English as in Irish.  This is a very healthy sign.</P>
    <P>I believe that our children are the key to the future of the Irish language. I am quite sure there are many Deputies here who feel that their knowledge of Irish is not what they would like it to be but who would feel very proud if some day their children could speak the type of Irish they would like to be able to speak. It is my intention to inculcate into my children a love of the Irish language, not that they have to learn it because they will not be regarded as Irish men or women if they do not.  Our young people should be encouraged to speak Irish because it is so much bound up in their environment, their culture and their country.  Encouragement by parents is very helpful in this regard. It is most important that the board give encouragement to the parents who do not speak Irish to encourage their children to learn the language.  I am greatful to your predecessor in the Chair for his indulgence in allowing me to stray from the Bill before the House but I believe what I said is constructive.  I hope it will be followed by other speakers who are reluctant to speak Irish because they feel they know so little of it.</P>

      <P>Os í seo an chéad deis a fuair mise fáilte a chur roimh an Aire mar Aire sa Teach, ba mhaith liom traoslú dó agus a rá go mbeidh mé ag súil go n-éireoidh an tádh leis in a phost.  Táim cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé cion fir ar son na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mian liom fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo.  Mar adúirt an tAire sa ráiteas i dtús na díospóireachta, bhí Bord na Gaeilge bunaithe ag Tomás Ó Domhnaill mar Aire ar bhonn <i>ad hoc.</i>  Is é an tuairim a fuair mise ó bheith ag éisteacht le ráiteas an Aire ná nach raibh mórán measa aige ar an saghas coiste seo, comhairle <i>ad hoc.</i>  Tá seisean á chur ar bhonn reachtúil anois.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an ceart aige a thuairim a bheith aige, agus tá an tuairim sin agam féin, go <Col N="876" /> deimhin, gur ceart an bord a bheith ar bhonn reachtúil.  Ach tá buntáistí faoi leith ag baint le bord a bheith ar bhonn <i>ad hoc</i> ar feadh tamaill, toisc go mb'fhéidir go bhféadfaí féachaint ar cé'n saghas téarmaí oibre a thabharfaí dá leithéid agus, b'fhéidir, earráidí a rinneadh i dtosach a ghlanadh as sul a gcuirfí ar bhonn reachtúil é.</P>
    <P>Tá taithí ag an Aire, taithí trí bliana, le breathnú siar orthu, agus tig leis an bord a cheapadh agus téarmaí tagartha a thabhairt dóibh atá bunaithe ar na taithí atá aige agus ar an obair a bhí idir lámha acu ar feadh trí bliana anuas.</P>
    <P>Bá mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do na moltaí atá i ráiteas an Aire maidir leis an obair ag súil go mbeadh láimh ag an bord ann, ach sul is féidir tagairt cheart a dhéanamh d'obair an bhoird, ba mhaith liom tagairt ghearr a dhéanamh do staid na Gaeilge faoi láthair.  Is cosúil agus is fíor go raibh agus go bhfuil suim ag an Teach seo sa Ghaeilge mar theanga náisiúnta na tíre seo.  Bhían tsuim sin ann i gcónaí ó bhunú an Stáit.  Tháinig Rialtas i ndiaidh Rialtais agus tionscnaíodh polasaí i leith na Gaeilge agus i leith athbheochaint na Gaeilge, agus tar éis trí scóir bliain beagnach caithfear a admháil gur beag an dul chun cinn atá ann.  Go deimhin, is féidir a rá go bhfuil teipthe ar na polasaithe seo i leith na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Anois, tá sé de bhuntáiste againne inniu i 1978 gur féidir linn breathnú siar ar trí scóir bliain.  Tá an buntáiste céanna ag Aire na Gaeltachta inniu. Leis an buntáiste sin aige tá súil agam nach ndéanfaidh sé na hearráidí céanna a rinneadh le trí scóir bliain, sé sin, nuair a bhéas sé ag tabhairt téarmaí tagartha don bhord seo, nach n-iarr-faidh sé orthu rudaí a dhéanamh nuair atá sé soiléir gur theip ar na tionscnaimh seo san am atá thart.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta Briscoe ag caint cúpla nóiméad ó shoin agus dúirt sé go raibh sórt faitís air seasamh suas agus labhairt as Béarla i ndíospóireacht a cheap sé a bheith as Gaeilge. Tá dhá shaghas ainmhithe sa tír seo. Bhí siad ann i gcónaí agus is dóigh go mbeidh siad ann chomh fada agus <Col N="877" /> a bheimid ann agus in ár ndiaidh. Ceann acu isea an fanatic agus an ceann eile an grammatical purist, agus tá an Ghaeilge agus na daoine go bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge damanta ag an dá shaghas ainmhithe seo leis na blianta anuas, ó tháning Dubhglas de híde leis an scéim chun athbheochaint na Gaeilge a bhunú.  Sé an fáth go bhfuil cúthaileacht ar dhoine an beagán Gaeilge atá acu a labhairt ná go bhfuil na daoine seo ann ag caint futhu agus ag gáire futhu agus ag déanamh cúis mhagaidh dhóibh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an oiread sin céille ag an daoine a bhfuil beagán Gaeilge acu nach dtabharfaidh siad áird ar bith ar an saghas sin duine a bhíonn ag gearán faoi ghramadach agus rudaí eile nach é.</P>
    <P>Bhí séde nós agus de pholasaí go gcaithfí an Ghaeilge a choinneáil taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht&mdash;sé sin, go dtógfaí claí na muice duibhe thart ar an Ghaeltacht, go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta taobh istigh agus muintir na Galltachta taobh amuigh ag breathnú isteach orthu, ag stánadh orthu, mar a déarfá, mar a dhaoine ó Mars ná áit éigin eile, mar a deir an Teachta Begley anseo, sórt Indian Reservation.  Is féidir a rá go bhfuil cúl tugtha againn ar an saghas polasaí sin, mar sé a tharla ná go ndearnadh dearmad nach ar Ghaeilge amháin a mhaireann na daoine seo, go raibh ar chuid mhór acu glanadh leo amach as an tír seo agus aghaidh a thabhairt ar áiteanna trasna an Atlantaigh agus áiteanna i Sasana le slí bheatha a bhaint amach.  Ansin, tar éis bánú na Gaeltachta, rinneadh iarracht iompú ar ais agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, mar ceapadh ansin gur cheist eacnamaíochta í ceist na Gaeilge agus ceist na Gaeltachta, agus tagaim leis an dtuairim sin.  Bhí a lán díobhála déanta sul a tháinig daoine ar an dtuairim sin: nach mbeadh teanga ann gan daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Ansin rinneadh iarracht an Ghaeilge a athbheochain agus daonra na Gaeltachta a mhéadú trí fhostaíocht a chur ar fáil agus deontasaí a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus scéimeanna a bhunú lena leithéid de rud a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá sé aisteach go leor&mdash;agus seo rud <Col N="878" /> nach bhfuil freagra agamsa air&mdash;áit ar bith ina ndearnadh iarracht fostaíocht a chur ar fáil agus forbairt eacnamaíochta a bhunú, gur chuir an fhorbairt sin le meath na Gaeilge.  Seo ceann de na rudaí contrártha.  Sé an fáith atá leis, ceapaim fhéin, gur tugadh daoine ón taboh amuigh, ón Ghalltacht agus áiteanna nach é, isteach mar theicneoirí, bainisteoirí, agus sé an toradh a bhí ar sin ná gur leathnadh úsáid an Bhéarla sna ceantair sin.  Tá an taoide ag iompú, ach tádíobháil déanta ar imeall na Gaeltachta in áiteanna a tugadh forbairt cacnamaíochta dóibh.</P>
    <P>Go deimhin tá daoine sa Teach seo a cheapann go fóill gurb é an bás atá in ann don Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní aontaím leis an tuirim sin ach tá an tuairim sin ann.  Níl a fhios agam cé'n toradh a thagann as forbairt eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta. Tá an toradh le feiceáil.  Meath na Gaeilge an toradh a bhí ann.</P>
    <P>Teastaíonn uaim teacht go dtí stáid na Gaeilge maidir leis an lá atá inniu ann.  Teastaíonn uaim a rá leis an Aire gur cheart dó úsáid a bhaint as na dearmadí agus an díobháil atá déanta mar gheall ar na polasaithe a cuireadh i réim ag Airí a chuaidh roimhe, agus Airí ó gach uile Rialtas. Níl mé á rá go bhfuil an locht ar Fhianna Fáil.  Tá an locht ar gach uile Rialtais.  Ní thuigfidh mé choíche cé'n fáth nár fhoghlaimíodh i gceart agus nár baineadh úsáid ag Ranna Stáit as na ceachtanna a d'fhoghlaim Airí eile a chuaigh roimhe na hAirí atá anois ann.  Níor baineadh úsáid ar bith as an taithí a bhí ag Airí roimhe seo.  Muna n-éiríonn le rud, ní chuirtear in úsáid arís é.  Maidir le Roinn na Gaeltachta, tá faitíos air leanúint le polasaíthe nár éirigh leo.  Táim cinnte nach ndéanfaidh an fear atá go díreach ós mo chomhair anois a leithéid an fhad is atá sé 'na Aire.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ráiteas an Aire, feicim go bhfuil scéimeanna faoi leith ar intinn aige.  faoi phlean amharclannaíochta a ullmhaíodh i gcomhar leis an gComhairle Ealaíon: scéimeanna chun an Ghaeilge a leathadh i measc daoine óga.  Feicim go bhfuil comhchoiste bunaithe chun áiseanna a sholáthar agus seirbhísí comhairle <Col N="879" /> agus oiliúna a chur ar fáil do dhaoine a bheidh ag plé le naíscoileanna. Chuaidh sé ar aghaidh le caint faoi iar-bhunscoileanna agus scoileanna eile.</P>
    <P>Maidir le athbheochaint na Gaeilge agus fás na Gaeilge mar theanga dúchais, is iad na daoine óga atá tábhachtach faoi láthair.  Níl mé róchinnte gur féidir a rá go bhfuil an oiread sin suime ag aos óg na tíre i ndrámaí as Gaeilge.  Níl mé ag rá go bhfuil sé sin fíor ach cuirim an cheist. Tá sé go soiléir go bhfuil suim acu i ndrámaí as Béarla&mdash;daoine a théann go dtí Amharclann na Mainistreach, mar shampla.  Is mionlach an-bheag iad san.  Faoin scéim seo atá faoi bhun ag an Aire, táim cinnte go bhféadfaí an scéim seo a leathnú ar fúd na tíre, i ngach uile réigiún, don aicme Gaeilge. Aontóidh an tAire liom, nuair a bhí an tolltoghachán ar siúl naoi mí ó shin, gur bhain a pháirtí féin úsáid as cleasanna faoi leith chun an aos óg a tharraingt isteach mar thacaíocht dóibh féin.  Anois, nach n-aontóidh an tAire liom gur éirigh leis?  Bhí T-shirts le &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil&rdquo; orthu.  Cad mar gheall ar T-shirts le &ldquo;Labhair an Ghaeilge&rdquo; orthu?  Ba chóir rudaí beaga mar sin a úsáid.  Is é an toradh a bheidh ar rudaí den tsort sin ná an fhadhb a réiteach.  Dá bhféadfaí scéimeanna bheaga mar sin a chur i gcrích imeasc an aois óig, ar feadh seachtaine, ar feadh míosa, nó ar feadh bliana, séard a thárlóidh ná go mbeidh labhairt na Gaeilge mar &ldquo;The in thing&rdquo; mar a déarfá.  Má tharlaíonn sé go nglacfar le labhairt na Gaeilge mar &ldquo;the in thing&rdquo;, tá mé ag rá leis an Aire go mbeidh an Ghaeilge á labhairt sa tír seo sar i bhfad.  Is é an t-aon rud amháin atá le teastáil saghas plean a thabhairt isteach ionas go bhféadfadh an t-aos óg bheith páirteach ann.  Tá mé ar cur ceiste ar an Aire: an nglacann sé féin go ndéanfadh drámaíocht in amharclann, leis féin, an gnó go mbeadh toradh éifeachtach leis maidir le aos óg na tíre?  Ní dóigh liom fhéin é.  Aontaím go bhfuil áit faoi leith ag an drámaíocht i gcultúr agus in aithbheocaint na teanga ach tá na rudaí beaga eile i bhfad níos éifeachtaí maidir le hathbheocaint na <Col N="880" /> teanga.  Tá formhór na ndaoine fábharach don Ghaeilge agus deigh-mhéin acu i leith na Gaeilge.  Bíonn cuid acu ag rá, &ldquo;Ní féidir liomsa mórán a dhéanamh faoi&rdquo;.  Cé go bhfuil bá ag daoine don Ghaeilge, go bhfuil grá acu uirthi agus meas acu uirthi, ní thuigeann said gur féidir leo aon rud a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú. Is é atá á rá acu ná, &ldquo;Do anything but do not ask me.  I will be with you all the way&rdquo;.  Tá grammatical purists and fanatics ann.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin nach dtuigim, agus nach dtuigfidh mé choíche, ná an méid daoine adeireann leat: &ldquo;Níl aon Ghaeilge agam; is Béarlóir mé&rdquo;.  Déanann siad leithscéal faoi nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu.  Ar an dtaobh eile, deireann an purist nach bhfuil Gaeilge aige ar chor ar bith.  Maidir le Béarlóirí agus Gaeilgóirí, cé mhéid Béarlóirí atá in ann &ldquo;Ulysses&rdquo; a léamh agus ciall a bhaint as?  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an oiread sin daoine atá in ann sin a dhéanamh.  Ní fédir a rá gur Béarla caighdeánach atá i Ulysses ach caithfear glacadh gur obair do ghná-scoláire atá ann.</P>
    <P>Ar an dtaobh eile, cé mhéid Gaeilgóirí atá sa tír atá in ann &ldquo;Cré na Cille&rdquo; le Mairtín Ó Cadhain a léamh agus ciall a bhaint as?  Diabhal mórán. Sé an rud atá ann faoi dheireadh ná an kettle calling the pot black.  Rud amháin a chuireann fonn múisce orm ná na daoine&mdash;tá aithne ortha ag éinne a bhfuil baint aige le údaráis áitiúil&mdash;nuair atá siad ag cur fógra i nuachtáin, adeireann: &ldquo;Má chuirim é san <i>Irish Times</i> ní léifidh éinne é&rdquo;. Sé an tuairim atá acu na, &ldquo;Más Gaeilgóir thú ní léann tú an <i>Irish Times</i>,&rdquo; an tuairim céanna atá ag daoine, &ldquo;Más duine de Fhine Gael thú ní léann tú an <i>Irish Press.</i>&rdquo; Nó, &ldquo;Más ball de Fhianna Fáil thú ní léann tú an <i>Irish Independent</i>&rdquo;.  Tá daoine ann adeireann go bhfuil daoine faoi leith a labhraíonn Gaeilge agus daoine eile nach labhraíonn í agus nach labhróidh riamh í, cuma céard a thárlóidh. Tuairimí amaideacha iad seo agus caithfear iad a chaitheam amach.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt na Teachtaí Begley agus O'Donnell, beidh le fáil ag an Aire ón taobh seo den Teach aon tacaíocht atá uaidh chun cur ar fáil aon <Col N="881" /> scéimeanna beaga ina mbeidh deis ag an ghná-dhuine bheith páirteach.  Níl mé ag caint anois ar na coláistí Gaeilge nó ar ranganna.  Tá siad sin ann agus an-obair dhá dhéanamh iontu agus páirt acu san scéim iomlán.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire agus ag cách nach bhfuil athbheochain na Gaeilge ag dul chun cinn chomh láidir agus atá sásúil.  Níl éinne sa Teach atá sásta le léibhéal labhairt na Gaeilge.  Is mór an trua é, agus más féidir leis an Aire smaoineamh ar aon scéim chun feabhas a chur ar an scéal sin beimid leis sa taobh seo den Teach.  Más féidir linn aon rud a dhéanamh a chuireas ar chumas daoine páirt a ghlacadh san athbheochain, agus fios acu go bhfuil rud éigin beag&mdash;is cuma cé chomh beag is atá sé&mdash;á dhéanamh acu ar son na Gaeilge, beidh an-obair déanta againn.</P>
    <P>Tá cineál straitjacket maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Chomh maith le bheith practiciúil tá sé in am againn a bheith radaiciúil, mar níor éirigh ró-mhaith, go deimhin níor éirigh ar chor ar bith le cuid mhór de na polasaithe ar feadh trí scór blian.</P>
    <P>Tá orm tagairt a dhéanamh do rud amháin eile.  I gcoirnéal den Tí seo tá monstrcsity le Béarla a chur ar Ghaeilge.  Níl fhios agam an bhfuil a leithéid in aon pharlaimint eile ar domhain, agus is mór an náire domsa agus do chuile dhuine anseo go bhfuil gá lena leithéid i 1978, os cionn trí scór bliain tar éis Cogadh na Saoirse.  Níl mé ag fáil locht ar dhaoine sa Teach seo go bhfuil gá acu úsáid a bhaint as an seirbhís sin, ach caithfear admháil nár cheart an rud sin a bheith ann dá mbeadh an meon ceart agus na polasaithe cearta agus na tuairimí cearta á chur i grích againne mar dhaoine, mar Ghaeil, le trí scór bliain anuas.  Cén tuairim a bheadh againn mar dhaoine, cuir i gcás, dá mbeadh scéim i dTithe Parlaiminte Westminster agus daoine ag labhairt Fraincíse inniu agus Béarla dá chur air do Theachtaí Westminster?  Ní móran measa a bheadh againn orthu.</P>

Níl mé ag tabhairt achasain d'éinne sa Teach seo nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu, ach deirim go bhfuil rud éigin mí-cheart leis an scéim a leagann orainn go bhfuil gá leis an rud san sa lá atá inniu ann.  Anois mar mhúinteoir&mdash;agus táim cinnte go n-aontóidh an tAire liom sa mhéid seo&mdash;ghlac mise páirt sa scéim ar feadh 17 mbliana.  Tá rud amháin nach dtuigfidh mé choíche: aon pháiste a chaitheann suas le dhá bhliain déag ag foghlaim teanga mar theanga ar scoil go foirmeálta agus ag deireadh 12 bliain nach bhfuil teanga labhartha ar a chumas aige.  Níl ar an pháiste atá an locht, ach ar an módh múinteoireachta. Ar ndóigh mar a dúirt an Teachta Woods, tá an fhadhb i bhfad níos leithne ná sin.  Bhí éigeantacht againn maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Bhí ort an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Bhí ort scrúdaithe a dhéanamh agus bhí ort pas a fháil sna scrúdaithe.  Sin é an t-éigeantacht.  Ba é an t-éigeantacht a rinne an-díobháil chomh fada is a bhaineann liomsa don Ghaeilge.  Ní sa chiall gur chuir sé bac ar dhaoine ach gur bhagair sé ar dhaoine Gaeilge a fhoghlaim, mar muna bhfoghlaimeodh siad í ní éireodh leo job a fháil, céim a bhaint amach, nó aon dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ina shaol féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa stair, rinne na Sasanaigh mealladh, breabadh agus bagairt.  Níl mé ró-chinnte cén Rí a rinne iarracht sinn a mhealladh ach níor éirigh leis. Rinne sé iarracht sinn a bhreabadh: níor éirigh leis agus sa deireadh bhí air bagairt orainn.  Anois i leith na Gaeilge rinneadh bagairt ó thús.  Muna mbeadh Gaeilge agat ní bhfaighfeá this, that or the other.  &ldquo;Is seoinín thú.&rdquo; Baineadh iarracht as breabadh agus bhí gach taobh den Teach fábharach don bhreabadh chomh maith, agus caithfear an fhírinne a rá.  Cuir i gcás scéim an deich bpunt.  Sin breabadh agus ní féidir é sin a shéanadh. Scéimeanna, cuir i gcás, a chuireann <Col N="883" /> ar chumas daoine sa Ghaeltacht deontais níos mó a fháil ná daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, sin breabadh. Anois tá ceist shóisialach ann chomh maith nó tá argóintí ann go bhfuil siad ina gcónaí in áit iargúlta agus le go bhféadfadh siad fanacht ansin go gcaithfidh siad deontais níos mó a fháil. Sin breabadh.  Ó thaobh speisialta de aontaím leis.  Tá an rud céanna ann inniu.  Cuir i gcás tá an cattle headage payment scheme ag muintir na tíre, mar deireann an EEC gur cheart leanúint leis an breabadh sin le muintir a choinneáil ann, rud nach bhfuil ar fáil, mar shampla i gContae Bhaile Átha Cliath, Contae na Mí, Contae na hiar Mhí nó i gContae Chill Dara.  Sin breabadh.</P>
    <P>Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le ceisteanna sóisilta éireoidh leis ach ní fédir a ghlacadh gur éirigh leis an breabadh ó thoabh na teanga.  Ní dhearna sé pioc maitheasa don Ghaeltacht nó don Ghaeilge mar theanga agus chomh fada agus a bhaineann liomsa, 'sé an t-aon rud amháin atá fághta ná mealladh, sé sin, a rá leis na daoine, &ldquo;Is Gael tusa.  Tá tú anois mar bhaill den Chomh-Phobal Eorpach. Caithfidh tú aitheantas náisiúnta a choinneáil mar bhaill den Chomh-Phobal Eorpach agus faoi láthair níl aitheantas practiciúil, réalaíoch tugtha don Ghaeilge mar theanga san Chomh-Phobal Eorpach agus chomh fada agus a bhaineann le teanga, níl aon difríocht idir tusa agus fear as an Bhreatain agus sibh araon amuigh sa m Bruiséil&rdquo;.  Sin e an cineál argóna Ní leor é sin a rá.  Ach chomh fada agus a bhaineann liomsa, theip ar an mbagairt, theip ar an mbreabadh agus níl ach slí amháin fághta, sin é an mealladh.  Tá cúpla scéim anseo agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil a lán eile tuairimí ag an Aire ar scéimeanna a chuirfidh sé faoi bhráid an Bhoird as seo amach, ach ba mhaith liom rud amháin eile a mholadh dó, sé sin, an chontúirt atá ann&mdash;agus tá díobháil déanta san obair seo leis na blianta &mdash;gur cuireadh an iomarca béime ar an gcultúr, sé sin, go gcaithfidh fios a bheith agat ar fhilíocht Gaeilge, damhsaí Gaeilge, drámaí Gaeilge, cluichí Gaeilge&mdash;all or nothing.  Ní aontaím leis sin.  Cén fáth, cuir i gcás, <Col N="884" /> nach mbeadh fear ag obair i monarchan Fiat, nó fear ag obair i Guinness, nó fear ag obair i Ringsend, i CIE&mdash; agus an Ghaeilge á úsáid aige i rith an lóin sna h-áitecha san?  Ní gá go mbeadh sé i n-ann amhrán ar an sean-nós a chanadh chun go mbeadh sé Gaelach.  Táimíd ag caint faoi athbheochaint na teanga.</P>
    <P>Tiocfaidh an cultúr agus tiocfaidh a lán rudaí eile má bhíonn an fonn ar dhaoine an Ghaeilge atá acu a labhairt, bíodh siad ar bheagán nó ar mhórán, agus má bhíonn an Rialtas agus muidne ar fad sásta daoine a mhealladh.  Is féidir linn sampla a thabhairt sa Teach seo.  Nuair a chuirtear an cheist ar an ghnáth-dhuine faoi athbheochaint na Gaeilge&mdash;ní maith liom an focal &ldquo;athbheochaint&rdquo;; b'fhearr liom athnuachan na Gaeilge; níl sí marbh fós, buíochas le Dia, agus ní bheidh&mdash;deireann sé leat, &ldquo;Ah, sure, why should I bother?  You are in Dáil Éireann.  You do not worry about it. &lsquo;Do as I say but do not do as I do&rsquo; kind of thing.&rdquo;  Tá sé sin fíor.  Táimid anseo agus bá chóir dúinn sampla a thabhairt agus aon seans a bheidh againn Gaeilge a labhairt a thógáil.  Tá udaráis eile taobh amuigh den Teach&mdash; comhairlí chontae agus comhairlí baile. Ba cheart sampla a thabhairt do dhaoine agus an Ghaeilge a labhairt chomh minic agus is féidir.  Tá tionchar ag fórsaí taobh amuigh den tír seo orainn agus beidh an tionchar sin ag dul i méid ó lá go lá ach ag an am chéanna tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ar ár gcumas seasamh i gcoinne an saghas tionchair sin agus ár n-aitheanas náisiúnta a bheith againn, is cuma cén brú nó cén tionchar a bhíonn orainn ón taobh amuigh.  Ba mhaith liom mar focal scoir traoslú arís leis an Aire, agus tá mé cinnte má oibríonn sé chomh crua mar Aire na Gaeltachta agus a d'oibrigh sé in áiteacha eile ina raibh sé mar mhúinteoir agus in áiteanna eile go mbeidh rath ar a chuid oibre agus go n-éireoidh go geal leis agus lena bhord san scéim atá roimhe, agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh deireadh leis an scéal faoi láthair agus go mbeidh fear sa cúinne anseo thuas, muidne ag caint Gaeilge nó ag caint Béarla agus seisean ag cur leagan Gaeilge ar an mBéarla do mhuintir an Tí seo.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas ormsa go bhfuil an Bille seo os ár gcomhair inniu.  Cé go bhfuil Gaeilge agam agus cé gur mhaith liom caint ar an mBille seo i nGaeilge, is mór an trua é nach bhfuil an méid sin Gaeilge agamsa chun é sin a dhéanamh, agus mar sin caithfidh mé caint i mBéarla cosúil le Teachtaí eile.</P>
      <P>Dealing with any Bill relating to the Irish language, first of all, one must congratulate the various organisations that have worked so hard to foster it over the years.  When one speaks of organisations that have done so much for the Irish language, Gael Linn is one which comes to mind immediately. A number of these organisations have worked strenuously in difficult circumstances. Indeed it would be fair to say that at times obstacles were placed in their way which did not help.  However, they preserved and have had a fair amount of success.  Whilst these organisations did preserve and work very hard they have not achieved their original aim.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to note that the Minister is allocating a grant of £300,000 towards the restoration of the Irish language.  Even were that amount doubled I would say that the money would be well spent if it achieved that goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from the Minister's remarks that he has selected already six areas for special attention.  I am particularly pleased to note that these areas have themselves opted for this scheme.  It is my view that it is tremendously important that efforts are not made to force people to speak the Irish language.  Perhaps that tendancy contributed to our lack of success in achieving those aims over the years. We all accept that there is widespread goodwill towards the Irish language but, unfortunately, that is insufficient unless it can be converted into practical application.  This is where the problem lies.  Deputy O'Toole touched on this when he said there has been a lot of criticism over the years of the way in which the Irish language was taught in our schools. There was the feeling&mdash;to use the pupils' own words&mdash;that the Irish language was being pushed down their <Col N="886" /> throats.  That in itself created a certain amount of resentment.  It is fair to say that that had a bad effect and did not encourage children to learn the language, never mind speak it.  In olden days it was accepted that Irish was spoken in the home.  Parents were able to speak the language quite fluently to their children which, in turn, had the desired effect.  But, in more recent times, it is fair to say that that situation no longer obtains.  Parents no longer speak Irish to their children and, unfortunately, the children themselves do not speak it in the home.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I am particularly pleased to note that the Minister is making provision for the teaching of Irish in nursery, primary and post-primary schools.  I would hope that that would have the effect of Irish being spoken again in the home.  We can can speak it outside the home; we can speak it at functions; we can go to the Gaeltacht and speak it there, but, until such time as it is spoken in the home, we will not have achieved our aim.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole touched also on the subject of speaking Irish in one's place of employment.  Some eight or ten years' ago I endeavoured to put this into operation in my place of work. I suggested to the people in the office that we speak Irish for the last half hour of the evening.  For the first couple of days there were all types of jokes made about it but I want to make it quite clear that, within a week, that half hour was taken very seriously. Not only did those people working with me improve their knowledge of the language in that half hour&mdash;and I mentioned at the outset that I am not a fluent Irish speaker; I love the Irish language and I like to speak it when I can&mdash;but I also improved my knowledge of Irish in that period.  Unfortunately a trade dispute took place and that terminated those half-hourly sessions&mdash;I think some other type of language was spoken to me then.  Unfortunately we never did go back to it. Irish can be spoken at work.  I have had personal experience of that and it worked.  This is something that should be encouraged.  Speaking Irish in one's place of work applies to Members of this House and there is <Col N="887" /> an onus on Deputies to avail of every occasion that offers to speak some few words of Irish.  If that is practised in a very short time it will become the &ldquo;done&rdquo; thing.  Those of us who represent the country in the EEC should speak Irish on every occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the Gaelic Athletic Association and the use of Irish in the affairs of that organisation.  In point of fact the Irish language was always associated with the GAA.  In my day at meetings and functions one had to speak Irish some of the time.  Correspondence had to be in Irish.  Meetings always opened and closed in Irish.  There was always a certain amount of Irish spoken at the GAA meeting I attended in my younger days.  Unfortunately that situation has changed and, whilst I welcome the Minister's scheme, it is a pity that it should be necessary at all.  Irish was allowed to lapse and that was something that should never have happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister also talked about liaison with RTE.  I believe RTE have not given enough time to the Irish language.  There is one programme I watch on every occassion I can though, as a Deputy, one does not have a great deal of time in which to watch television.  I refer to <i>Trom agus Eadrom.</i>  It is an excellent programme. I enjoy it thoroughly.  It has been taken off and, whether or not it will come back again, I do not know but it was partly in Irish and partly in English and that made it easy for people to understand.  I hope that it will be back again in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I do not criticise the various organisations for not pulling together over the years.  Had they pulled together more could have been achieved. Deputy O'Toole talked about the tee shirt with &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil&rdquo; on it. It would be a good idea to have tee shirts with &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; and perhaps &ldquo;Speak Irish&rdquo;.  The fáinne has gone out of fashion.  An effort was made five or six years ago to bring it back.  The Fáinne Nua was introduced.  One does not see so many of these even.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> I welcome the Bill and I wish the Minister every success in achieving what he is setting out to do.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  I welcome the appointment of the 12 members of the board by the Minister. I have a few reservations.  My main reservation is that I hope this will not be a purely politically appointed board.  Knowing the Minister, I am sure he will do the right thing and appoint those best suited. Too often in the past Ministers have picked people because of their political affiliations.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann requests the Government to immediately avail of the EEC aid which is available for the purpose and introduce a comprehensive scheme for the provision of milk and milk products in schools.</P>
      <P>We should avail of this aid for a number of reasons.  Basically, the EEC makes available 50 per cent of the cost of milk provided in schools throughout the Community.  One-third of that 50 per cent of aid from the EEC will come from the FEOGA fund and the remaining two-thirds from the proceeds of a levy to be raised by the EEC from all milk producers in the Community, including Irish milk producers.  Therefore, Irish milk producers, through that levy, make a contribution to a fund to provide milk in schools.  As milk producers proportionately form a higher share of the population here than in most countries it is possible that the Irish are making a larger proportionate contribution to the fund that is being used in part to provide milk in schools than any other member state.  However, we are the only country, with the exception of Italy, not availing of this scheme even though we make a substantial contribution towards it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between September 1977 and January 1978 almost £1½ million was collected <Col N="889" /> from Irish farmers to be put into the co-responsibility fund.  The collection was at the rate of .9 of a penny per gallon and it will continue for five years or more.  In spite of that we are not availing of one of the important forms of service being made available by the fund, namely a scheme for the provision of milk in schools. Some people might say that as the majority of Irish people are reasonably well-off school-going children get a reasonable breakfast before going to school in the morning. Those people may ask if there is a necessity for milk in schools from a social and educational point of view.  In fairness, it is probably true to say that the majority of the children do not need milk in school but we are not talking about the provision of social services necessarily or of majorities.  We are talking about the less fortunate in our community who do not constitute the majority but who are the primary concern of our social services, namely the least well-off in our society.</P>
    <P>I collected some figures which indicate that a substantial number of children go to school undernourished and are unable to derive maximum benefit from our educational system because of insufficient nourishment. This arises partly because of lack of means on the part of the parents to provide a breakfast for their children, partly because the children, particularly those in rural areas, must leave very early&mdash;in some cases as early as 7.30 a.m.&mdash;to get a bus to bring them to school, and partly, and most significantly, because of the fact that in a small minority of families the parents are not competent to provide adequate nourishment for their children.  This happens through alcoholism on the part of one or both parents, through lack of education or severe subnormality of one sort or another on the part of either parent.  They do not see it as their duty to provide adequate nourishment for their children before going to school.  The result is that a substantial number of children, children about whom we should be concerned, go to school without adequate nourishment to enable them face the day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> In the course of a small survey which I carried out I asked a number of teachers what percentage of the children in their school would fit into the category of undernourished and not able fully to avail of the educational programme because of undernourishment. I was told that between 2 and 4 per cent of the children in the schools concerned fitted into this category. When one considers the total number of school children in the country the figure of 2 or 4 per cent is not that small because it accounts for many thousands of children.  I should also like to give details of a survey which was carried out in a Dublin vocational school.  In this connection I should mention that the school meal service which exists in Dublin does not extend to vocational schools; it applies only to primary schools.  The survey in that school&mdash;I can give the Minister the name of the school concerned if he doubts the veracity of my statement&mdash; showed that of a school population of 250, 22 of the children did not have a breakfast.  If the parents were not able to provide them with a breakfast it is unlikely that they were able to provide them with a lunch either and those children would have had to go through the day without any nourishment.  It is hard to imagine how children who may have had their last meal at about 6 p.m. the previous evening could hope to concentrate on their lessons the following day without any nourishment.</P>
    <P>That survey was a random one and was not done for the purpose of proving anything.</P>
    <P>The third statistic I should like to cite for the Minister is that quoted in a study prepared for the Bishops on the meaning of poverty.  That study shows that 2.9 per cent of the families surveyed by the sociologists engaged by the Bishops to carry out the survey&mdash;obviously, this is a larger sample than one vocational school and covers a substantial number of families&mdash;did not have any breakfast.  Roughly 40 per cent of the families surveyed had a breakfast which consisted of nothing more than bread, butter and tea.  There was very little protein content necessary for the maintenance of the body, in the diet of 40 per cent of the children <Col N="891" /> in the families surveyed.  That survey was not of the total population or of a cross-section.  I do not know what precise method of selection was used but I presume the families were in the less well-off socio-economic groups generally.</P>
    <P>That survey indicates that there is a problem of under nourishment in our schools.  It behoves the Minister to seek every means possible to meet this problem.  It behoves him to seek means, using our native resources to solve such a severe problem.  However, when it transpires that another agency, the EEC, to which we are making a substantial contribution, is prepared to make available 50 per cent of the cost of a scheme which will provide the most balanced and complete food of all, milk, in our schools it certainly behoves the Minister to avail of that aid.  It behoves the Minister to ensure that all children are provided with some means of nutrition during the day and in particular that the problem of the children I mentioned earlier is dealt with.</P>
    <P>The aid being made available by the EEC in this case is by no means ungenerous.  The usual pattern for EEC aid, as instanced in the case of the farm modernisation scheme in the case of aid to eligible farmers, who are only a small minority of the total number of farmers, is 25 per cent or one-quarter and the remaining 75 per cent must be provided by the Irish Exchequer.  The rate of aid in this scheme for the provision of school milk is far more generous.  It is proposed that the EEC provide £2 for every £1 provided by the Irish Exchequer, the idea being that for every £ provided by the Irish Exchequer, £2 would be provided by the EEC and £1 by the child using the milk.  Even if one dispensed with the child's contribution the EEC would still be providing £ for £.  In terms of rates of contribution from the EEC this is comparatively a much more favourable scheme than the farm modernisation scheme where the EEC provide £1 for every £4 provided by the Irish Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The argument for school milk is <Col N="892" /> primarily based I think on considerations I have already mentioned&mdash;the fact that there is a significant minority of children who actually seriously need this milk so that they may be able to avail of the education they are getting and so that they may develop physically and avoid starvation which will exist in any society, even in those more prosperous than ours, because a minority of parents, even though they may have the money, are not able, because of alcoholism or some other problem, to use it to provide nourishment for their children.  There are other arguments but I again assert that this is the main one before going on to other arguments which also deserve consideration but do not take from the importance of the main one.  The main consideration originally in the EEC's mind, though not in ours in availing of the scheme, in introducing it was to relieve the Community of the surpluses of milk products which have grown up over years in the EEC. They have decided to levy milk producers to create a fund which is being used for this and other means of promoting greater consumption of milk products throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in proportion to its total population, has the largest milk production and therefore one would expect the Irish Government to be in the lead if a proposal is made to find means of expanding milk consumption so that the product we produce and from which we derive a substantial proportion of our total national income would be consumed to a greater extent. One would expect Ireland to give an example to other countries as to what can be done so that they would be encouraged to follow suit.  There is need for this because there are substantial surpluses of milk products in the Community and this is leading other countries to propose drastic curbs on the common agricultural policy which provides a floor under our agricultural industry which provides a basic income for our farmers. Other countries are proposing, because of these surpluses, to undermine the intervention system and to reduce the common agricultural policy which was such an important reason <Col N="893" /> for our joining EEC in the first place. Obviously, one would expect Ireland as a dairying and agricultural country to be in the lead in providing a scheme such as this, for which EEC aid is available, to increase milk consumption.</P>
    <P>It has been calculated that about ten million extra gallons of milk would be consumed as a result of this scheme. That figure was produced by another agency; I have no figure but I have heard other figures which are less; some suggest three million gallons. I am not sure what the net extra consumption would be but I think it would be significant.  Yet, despite these arguments the Irish Government is the last Government with the exception of Italy, to make any move to avail of this scheme.  This is regrettable because we are trying to get other countries to do things which are inconvenient for them such as, in the case of some continental countries, the reintroduction of daily milk deliveries. We take daily deliveries for granted here but they do not exist in many continental countries.  They play a large part in ensuring that we consume more milk per head than most other EEC countries.  Germany and some other countries do not have daily deliveries.  Their people must go to the supermarket to buy milk.  We, along with the EEC Commission and others concerned about milk surpluses, are trying to encourage these other countries to introduce daily milk deliveries because it would obviously help to remove the surpluses.  If we want to carry conviction in getting other countries to do something that may be inconvenient for them, it is only sensible to expect that we should do what is in our power to increase milk consumption in our own country. We can scarcely expect others to make efforts we are not prepared to make. The one thing we can do to increase milk consumption here is to introduce this comprehensive scheme for the provision of milk and milk products.  We are not doing it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has objected that the provision of free school milk would cost the Irish Exchequer an extra £6 million.  If so, there would probably be another £6 million coming from <Col N="894" /> the EEC to this country.  The Minister may dispute the figure; it may be £4 million or £5 million.  He may produce his own figure, but his estimate of the cost of £6 million is based on certain assumptions not all of which are necessarily valid.  First, it is based on the assumption that there will be no charge for the milk to the pupil. Secondly, it is based on the assumption that it will be introduced in all schools, national and secondary, including schools which, perhaps, have no great need of it.  For instance, if, as an initial measure, we were to introduce it only in national schools, that would significantly reduce the £6 million.  If, on the other hand, one were to have a small charge which could be paid either by the parents or in the case of home assistance recipients who are the people we want to get at most, could be paid by the health boards to the schools.  The fact that a charge would be levied from some of the pupils could be used to reduce to some extent the £6 million the Minister alleged would be spent.</P>
    <P>In talking in terms of a global figure of £6 million the Minister is perhaps adopting the wrong approach.  He should think rather of the benefits which would be given to a large number of children by the provision of this scheme.  Existing schemes in this area&mdash;the provision of milk and school meals to children&mdash;are not exactly <i>per capita</i> the most expensive social service in the country.  In terms of benefit to a large number of people they have the lowest rate of cost to the Exchequer.  I have been informed that the existing school meal service which is available in 50 per cent of the urban areas and not available at all in the rural areas&mdash;one of my endeavours in promoting this matter is to get it extended to the rural areas and to get at least the milk products extended to the remaining 50 per cent of the urban areas&mdash;in 1975, the date for which the latest figures are available, cost 3.92p per meal per child.  It is very hard to imagine a meal being provided less expensively even in 1975, and granted that there has been significant inflation in the cost of food since then, this indicates that we are not talking about a social service the unit cost of which <Col N="895" /> is astronomically high and that there is a danger of people getting away with something or of children abusing the service.  If in 1975 a meal cost less than 4p, at its most generous it would probably cost 7p or 8p now.  We can see from that that the meals service is not the most expensive of the social services being made available at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer to my argument as to why we should introduce a scheme of this nature has been that he could see no great need for it.  He declared himself to have been, I hope I am not misquoting him, initially, sympathetic to the idea but as a result of his personal investigations he did not see the need for it.  One of the reasons for that was that 50 per cent of the urban authorities who already had the statutory powers to introduce a school meals service had not chosen to do so or to apply for EEC aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister is expecting urban authorities of their own accord to come forward and seek to avail of this scheme&mdash;for instance expecting the Trim Urban Council to apply to the Commission in Brussels without the Minister asking for this aid&mdash;is being unrealistic, even assuming that the money could be obtained in that way, that they have contacts in Brussels and that they were able to process their claims.  Even more important is the fact that this year it is not possible for local authorities to introduce new services, whether it be a school milk, school meal or any other service.  They have been told that they may not levy any rates on houses, because of the abolition of the rates on houses.  They must rely on collecting rates to pay their share of this scheme, on the one hand, from the non-domestic rates properties, such as factories and shops, and, on the other hand, from a rate which would be paid by the Exchequer as a rates grant in respect of the domestic rates which have been abolished.  It is not possible for local authorities to increase the rates, to &ldquo;print money&rdquo; by simply increasing the rates on domestic dwellings by 20 per cent and hoping the Government will come up with the money to enable them to introduce new services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> They have been told by the Minister for the Environment that they may not increase the rates being paid by commercial ratepayers or the rates being paid in lieu of domestic rates by the State by more than 11 per cent.  That 11 per cent barely covers the maintenance of their existing service. It certainly does not allow them the possibility of doing as the Minister for Health seems to believe they would spontaneously do, and that is seek to introduce new services such as school meal or school milk schemes, particularly when to get the EEC contribution towards the cost they would have to negotiate with Brussels themselves because the Minister is not interested in the matter.</P>
    <P>This scheme was introduced in a directive in May and this Government came into office in July.  From July until December the Government could not make up their minds which Minister was responsible for availing of the EEC aid for school milk.  I raised the matter originally by way of a variety of questions to all the Ministers who could be responsible, and in reply every one said that he was not responsible and that he had had talks with the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Education and so on, but that he was not primarily responsible for the scheme.  No Minister was responsible.  There is no such thing in proper Government circles as a scheme for which no Minister is responsible.  Invariably some Minister has primary responsibility and others may be involved in a secondary capacity.  From the questions I put down in November 1977 it transpired that although this scheme had been in existence since the previous May, no Minister accepted that he was responsible for negotiating with Brussels.  Is it any wonder no decision was taken up to that?  As a direct result of my raising the matter on the Adjournment the Minister for Health, who was in the House, refused to take it and said he was not responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>The Minister carries <Col N="897" /> both responsibilities.  For &ldquo;Health&rdquo; read &ldquo;Social Welfare&rdquo; in all cases. He disclaimed responsibility.  It was impossible for the Adjournment Debate to be taken on that day because no Minister would accept responsibility. I raised the matter the following Tuesday.  Who came into the House to answer the debate and say he was responsible?  The Minister for Social Welfare, although the previous Thursday he had said he was not responsible. It was speedy decision-making on the part of the Government which would never have taken place had I not raised the matter on the Adjournment in the first place and created what must have been significant embarrassment for the Minister for Health and his colleagues at the usual Government meeting the following day, Friday, at 11 a.m., when they had to decide which Minister was responsible. Was the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Social Welfare going to accept responsibility?  For once the Minister for Social Welfare seems to have lost the battle.  Evidently he did not want to be responsible for this matter.  He did not want to be responsible for the provision of school milk and availing of aid from the EEC. He evidently lost the battle and was responsible, as he has to answer for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have introduced that scheme in September 1977 and it would have been in existence for the 1977-78 academic year, but because the Government could not make up their minds until they were forced to do so by me in December they did not even apply, presumably.  As a result of my applying the pressure on the Government to make up their minds as to which Minister was responsible, the Minister for Social Welfare apparently decided that he would apply to the EEC for aid.  But what did he apply for.  As is contained in his own amendment to my motion today, he applied for aid to have the EEC subsidy for the supply of milk and milk products under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1080/77 made available for existing school meals schemes.  What in effect he was proposing to do was simply to use EEC money to save cash which <Col N="898" /> the Exchequer is already having to provide for these school meals, instead of using that money to expand the consumption of milk and to provide better meals for children who are already getting school meals.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to deny this when he comes to speak on the debate and if he does I will be delighted.</P>
    <P>The EEC will provide money which up to now the Irish Government have been providing.  If that is what the Minister has in mind it will be hard to think of a greater abuse of an EEC scheme.  I remember hearing people from these benches when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition condemning the then Government&mdash;of which I was a member&mdash;allegedly using EEC Regional Fund money to prop up schemes which the Government were going to introduce anyway with their own money, and for not introducing new schemes with the EEC Regional Fund money.  This is precisely what the Minister for Social Welfare proposes to do himself in relation to school milk.  Instead of expanding the scheme, as is intended when we are given money from the EEC, he is proposing to use the EEC money to save money which the Irish Government are already spending on these schemes anyway.  That is an abuse of the EEC scheme.  If that is not what the Minister has in mind I will be happy to change my tune to that extent.</P>
    <P>I would like some information about the Minister's application for the EEC subsidy for the supply of milk and milk products under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1080/77.  First, I would like an answer to the question I have posed already about what it is being used for.  Secondly, when was it made?  Thirdly, when is it likely to be dealt with?  Is it not true that other countries already have commitments to get aid of this sort from the EEC? Why is it that we are talking only about a mere application on which apparently there has been no decision yet?  Inquiries were made from the EEC Commission about this application by the Irish Government for aid under this heading and the EEC Commission official who answered the question seemed not even to have <Col N="899" /> heard of the Irish Government's application. The application is there if the Minister says it is, but when a reasonably serious inquiry of a reputable organisation elicits the response that the application had not been heard of it seems that at the very least the Minister for Health is not over to Brussels and back every week seeking to have the money paid out and a decision taken on the scheme. Even though this will save money for his own Exchequer he seems to be pursuing the matter with remarkably little force.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one further point about this scheme, and it is an important one.  It seems that many children are not attracted by simply getting milk in its natural state, cold milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, that is quite adequate.  They would prefer some other milk product which would be more attractive.  Lest some people might think that the milk products scheme implies only milk and that that is all that the EEC are prepared to make aid available for, and that this would not be very attractive and the children would not be prepared to take it, let me say that this EEC aid can be made available for cocoa, for hot milk involved in chocolate, for yoghourt, and I am sure if the Government were to press hard enough it could be made available for cheese, although that is not provided for in the scheme.  There is something for every case.  If a child does not like cold milk he can have hot milk.  If he does not like unflavoured milk he can have cocoa.  If he does not like any form of milk product of that sort he can have yoghourt.  All of those schemes can be provided under this with substantial aid from the EEC to which the Irish farmer in less than half a year has already provided £1½ million and he will continue to provide money for that fund.  Yet the Irish Government apparently are not prepared to avail of this scheme except merely to defray <Col N="900" /> the expenses which they otherwise would be incurring.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable, but I do not wish to approach this matter in a partisan manner.  My motion, although the Minister has seen fit to amend it, has been very moderately phrased.  I hope the Minister will respond in the same manner, and will be able to tell the House that he has reconsidered the matter and that he will be introducing, if not a comprehensive scheme, at least a scheme in some areas which would give the children who want it the option of availing of it, even at a charge.  Let us try it out.  Do not let the Minister decide for the people whether or not they want it, as he seems to be doing, by looking into his own heart.  Make it available to them and let us see whether it works.  Until you provide the option for them you have no way of knowing whether or not children are interested in this. I ask the Minister to do that at least so that they can see who is right as to whether or not there is a need for a scheme of this sort.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves the Government's decision to seek to have the EEC subsidy for the supply of milk and milk products under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1080/77 made available for existing school meals schemes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Bruton first raised this matter on the Adjournment early in December last I expressed certain views about the EEC scheme which is the subject matter of this motion. I think that the views I expressed on that occasion are still valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I asked the House to look at the details of the EEC scheme and what were offered.  Under the Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1080/ 77 of 17 May 1977 and EEC Commission Regulation No. 1598/77 of 15 July 1977 the Community contribution is payable for a period of at least five years from 1 May 1977 for the financing of member states' programmes for the supply of milk and <Col N="901" /> certain milk products at reduced prices for school children.  The Community will pay 50 per cent of the target price of the milk on condition that the member state pays at least 50 per cent of the rest.  The balance may be charged to the schoolchildren. Up to 18 April 1978 50 per cent of the member states' contribution may be in the form of a grant towards equipment for storing and distributing the milk, and the amount of milk supplied to each pupil is limited to a quarter of a litre or approximately half a pint per school day.</P>
    <P>I want, first of all, to have a quick look at the background to this and to sketch very briefly our national situation in regard to milk.  Deputy Bruton painted a picture of the Community and the various countries and urged that we should set a headline for other countries in the Community in encouraging the consumption of milk.  That is patently absurd.  We are the highest consumers of milk in the entire Community.  We are such high consumers of milk that it is doubtful if there is any capacity to expand the consumption of milk here.  We consume 44.4 gallons of milk per head per year.  That figure may not mean much to everybody, but we must compare it with the figures for the other Community countries.  In Germany they consume 12.5 gallons of milk per head per year; in France the figure is 14 gallons; in Italy 15 gallons; in the Netherlands 15 gallons; in Belgium 13 gallons; in Luxembourg 18 gallons and in Denmark 15.69 gallons.  There is absolutely no basis of comparison between our consumption and that in other European countries.  It is absurd for Deputy Bruton to suggest that we should take the initiative, take the lead, in promoting increased milk consumption for the purpose of being good Europeans and advancing the cause of our own agriculture and particularly our milk industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton ignored the fact that milk consumption is already heavily subsidised.  The economic price of milk is 11.5p per pint and already the Exchequer contribute a subsidy of 3.5p so that the retail price is 8p per pint. <Col N="902" /> That 35p by which the taxpayer is already subsidising every pint of liquid milk amounts to £25 million a year. In addition, approximately £16 million goes towards subsidising the consumption of butter.  Between these two milk products the subsidy is over £40 million per year from the taxpayers. These are two significant points which Deputy Bruton did not put before the House.  We are already well ahead of the rest of Europe in the consumption of milk <i>per capita</i> and we are heavily subsidising every pint of liquid milk consumed in this country, as well as butter.</P>
    <P>I refer to another very minor point which is partly relevant.  There is a minor milk distribution scheme operated by the health boards for expectant mothers and certain families, and this scheme costs another £400,000 a year. That is not of any great significance in the overall context.</P>
    <P>I will relate the figures to the ordinary pint of milk, as that is the point that will concern the ordinary Deputy. The economic price of milk is 11.5p per pint and the State is already subsidising that to the extent of 3.5p, making the retail price 8p.  Under this great new generous offer by the EEC, they would subsidise milk in so far as it is consumed by schoolchildren by a further 3.8p, leaving 4.2p to be paid by someone else.  I am very adamant that this 4.2p should not be paid by the schoolchild.</P>
    <P>I want to reject completely something which Deputy Bruton said in his approach to this matter.  He suggested that the milk need only be provided free for certain children, those who could not afford to pay, and that the rest should pay.  That would be reprehensible. It is bad enough having to have means tests later on in life for old age pensions and things of that sort.  I feel that any Deputy who thinks about it would not like to see a means test in the school between one child and another.  The only way would be to give free milk to the children.  There are other technical difficulties concerned.  I think teachers would not be prepared to collect the money and there would be <Col N="903" /> a difficulty there.  The idea of collecting 4p per day from each child for each pint of milk consumed is absurd and ridiculous.  It would be unworkable and, apart from that, it would be completely undesirable in principle.</P>
    <P>If the State were to pick up the tab for the 4.2p per pint and if the scheme were extended to all the 800,000 children in primary and secondary schools, the extra cost to the Exchequer would be approximately £6 million.  That is the calculation.  If the scheme were confined to the 500,000 children in primary schools, it would cost £4 million.  If we had an all-party committee of sensible Deputies from all sides of the House and if I told them that the Minister for Finance was prepared to make available to me £6 million for some new social welfare scheme and asked them how it should be spent, I would wager that additional free milk in the schools would not be their choice.  They would think of all the various demands and pressures for additional welfare and community services and so on.</P>
    <P>This offer from the EEC is a whited sepulchre, to use a metaphor which in this context might be frowned upon. It is not an offer that we can accept in the present circumstances.  I think there is not a demand throughout the community for a scheme of this sort, and I want to give the House some other figures in this context.  We have an existing free school meals service, such as it is.  It is confined to urban areas and is operated by the local authorities, but the Department of Social Welfare pay the bill.</P>

      <P>The figures in this connection are very interesting.  Of 89 <Col N="904" /> urban authorities in the country only 49 operate the existing free scheme. Only 49 think it worth while to adopt the existing scheme.  Of them, only 27 use milk in their scheme.  That is indicative of the fact that milk in this context is not what most people want and there is not any particular pressure or demand for it.  It is not awarded any sort of high priority by the urban authorities or schools concerned.  That reinforces me in my view that if we were to spend £4 million or £6 million extra this is not the area to which is should be directed.  There is no doubt of that.  There is no doubt that the extension of free milk along the lines suggested by Deputy Bruton, across the board throughout the country, confined to primary schools, would involve very considerable administrative difficulties.  Apart from the difficulty I have mentioned, the problem of trying to collect 4.2p or 4p a day from each child concerned would be a considerable difficulty.  I doubt if it would be administratively possible to have it right across the board throughout the country for various technical reasons.</P>
      <P>I come back to what I said earlier, that I do not think there is any demand for it.  The schools to which it is already available do not avail of it to any considerable extent.  I hear different reports about the existing scheme, whether it is satisfactory or not.  Very early in my examination of the different social welfare services I set up a small group in the Department to look at the existing scheme to see if it was satisfactory, if it was giving value for money, if it could be improved, and generally to look at it and see what we should do about it That group are looking at this matter. We will ask them if the existing free meal scheme, including milk, can or should be extended in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interesting thing about the existing scheme is that it is possible to include milk in it, but only 27 of the 49 urban authorities use milk as part of the meals provided.  This scheme extends to the Gaeltacht areas as well as the urban areas and nowhere in the Gaeltacht areas, which are rural areas, do they use milk.  No school in the Gaeltacht areas use milk <Col N="905" /> in their free school meal scheme.  The conclusion is inevitable, that in rural Ireland and to a great extent in urban areas milk is not in demand and there is no pressure for it.  That is directly related to the fact that we are already consuming enormous quantities of milk per head compared with any other country in Europe.  Deputy Bruton gave a figure of 2 per cent to 4 per cent of schoolchildren being undernourished.  This is the result of a survey which he carried out, and I commend him for doing that.  I personally thought that the figure was perhaps a bit higher but taking it at 4 per cent that means that four children out of a school of 100 pupils are under-nourished, and presumably according to Deputy Bruton they would avail of this free milk scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would regard four children out of 100 as being in special need of milk.  I do not think we would be justified in introducing an overall scheme for all the children at the cost that would be involved and the administrative difficulties just to cope with either two or four of those children.  Deputy Bruton wants the scheme across the board.  He would certainly be giving milk to a very high proportion of children in the ordinary schools which they did not want and which they would not take in order to cope with two or four children.</P>

      <P>I admit I have not and I admit that there are statistics which are disconcerting in this area. I established this committee to look into the school meals scheme, to see where it is falling down, to see why only 49 out of the 89 urban authorities <Col N="906" /> are availing of it and to see why in those 49 cases only 27 of them are using milk.  When I get the answer to that I will perhaps be able to take a further look at the situation.  I am quite satisfied that as of now what I said on the occasion when we last discussed this matter, on the Adjournment in December, is still perfectly valid, that this scheme put forward by the EEC to us is not acceptable and is not the sort of scheme from which we can derive any benefit.  It would not enable us to meet some present demands as far as I am concerned as Minister for Social Welfare.  If I had £6 million, £4 million or even £3 million, this is not the way I would use that money.  As I said, we are already very high consumers of milk.  I do not believe there would be any real increase in the consumption of milk if any of those schemes were adopted.  I believe there would simply be a switch and milk would be made available in schools under this scheme which is already being consumed in the households in the normal way.  This is not a scheme, taking everything into account, which I believe would be beneficial to our services at this stage or which would give us value for money.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's speech.  Some of the points he made deserve further consideration. I find it difficult, however, to follow some of the logical connections between some of the factual statements he made and the conclusions in argument he drew from them.  Of course, it is true that we are the highest consumers of milk in the European Economic Community at present.  It does not follow from that as a simple statement like night follows day, that it is impossible, unnecessary or unwise to increase the consumption of milk in this country.  I suspect one of the reasons why we are the highest consumers of milk in the EEC is that we produce more milk proportionally than anybody else.  We produce milk very well.  It is a comparatively cheap and instantly available source of protein for many people.  It is not the least bit surprising that our consumption of it should be so high.  It is not necessary to assume that because it is <Col N="907" /> high that it cannot or should not be increased.</P>
      <P>It is true, as the Minister said, that the consumption of milk is already heavily subsidised but I would point out to him that the amendment in his name and the motion in the names of Deputies Boland, Bruton and D'Arcy does not refer to milk alone but to milk and milk products.  One of the prime milk products in Ireland is cheese which is considerably less subsidised now than it used to be under the previous Administration, so subsidy cuts both ways.  I am very puzzled by the Minister's logic in proposing this amendment in the terms in which he proposes it.  He costed a scheme which would give effectively a half pint of milk to every primary school child in the country at approximately £4 million a year.  He said that he was adamant that any sums which were not to be paid by the EEC should not be paid by the school children themselves.  I agree with him about the need to ensure that schemes like this are nondiscriminatory. I am sure he will also agree with me when I say that spending money on the children, particularly those at primary and national schools, is one of the most effective forms of social investment that we can carry out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was astonished to hear the Minister say that he assumed that some all-party committee of wise men given £4 million or £4.2 million to spend would almost by definition come up with some other scheme rather than this one to spend it on.  Of course we do not have an all-party committee.  The priorities for the social expenditure of the Government in this area are determined by the Government as a whole and by the Minister for Social Welfare in this instance.  The Minister cannot fob off on some non-existing all-party committee the job of deciding whether or not £4 million is to be spent on this scheme or on some other scheme, because it is his job to decide or to recommend to the Government as it will be the electorate's job to decide whether or not he made <Col N="908" /> the right decision.  Regardless of how he argues, I think it will be very difficult for him and his colleagues to persuade the electorate that they were doing the right thing in turning down a scheme of this kind at this time, because it will be seen by the electorate as a refusal to take up funds which could be expended for the benefit of children in our primary schools.  They may not be in touch with the Minister's arguments and may not appreciate some of the finer points that he makes, but they will see that this money was available to benefit the children and they will see that the Minister did not choose to avail of it. They will be asking why and we will certainly be asking why.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued to hear the Minister say that he was totally opposed to the idea of having a school meals service introduced in primary schools on the basis of a means test which would discriminate between one child and another.  There is already a major scheme introduced by a Government of which he was a member which does discriminate between school children, and that is the free school books scheme.  If the Minister were to be logical he would be as critical of that scheme as he has been on the proposal of Deputy Bruton.  Quite a high proportion of the complaints about the administration of the educational system&mdash;and they come not just from parents but from teachers as well&mdash; relate specifically to the invidious nature of this discrimination.  So the Minister must take this into account if he is to criticise the proposal that children pay for milk.  He must also take into account the fact that there is also such a means testing scheme in schools in some other communities.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see him introduce a free books scheme than to change his mind and favour discrimination in the area of school milk.  The fundamental inconsistency in the Minister's case is that he is arguing very strongly in favour of a hypothetical situation, but if this kind of scheme is worth bringing in at all it must be brought in on a universal basis and on a free basis.  Yet his amendment sharply limits the area in which the scheme <Col N="909" /> would have application because it reads: &ldquo;approves the Government's decision to seek to have the EEC subsidy for the supply of milk and milk products under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1080/77 made available for existing school meals schemes&rdquo;. As he has been at pains to tell us, the existing school meals scheme operates in only a minority of local authority areas.  So while criticising the scheme, as advanced by Deputy Bruton, which would distinguish between children on the basis of means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's correction.  While criticising the possibility advanced by Deputy Bruton that a distinction might in certain circumstances be made, he is introducing another distinction based on geography. Not only that, he is seeking to bring the benefit of this subsidy into operation via a scheme, the scheme referred to in the Government amendment, which is out of date, inadequate, under-financed and under-researched. Some of its main defects have long been evident.  The first of these defects, and one which is serious enough to enable us to oppose this amendment, is that only 49 of the 89 local authorities operate the scheme at all.  These are the local authorities in the urban areas and in the Gaeltacht areas.  The reason that the other 40 authorities do not operate the scheme is not that they have never thought about it but that they are not entitled to do so.  It is quite misleading to suggest that the reason why only half of the local authorities operate this scheme is that there is no demand for it from the other half.  Not only that, even the basic idea behind this scheme has been rendered very much out of date by the growth in our urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so long ago, under a previous administration, that the free school meals scheme was extended to the 60,000 people living in Ballymun because that administration realised that the school meals scheme, as it operated, was excluding many thousands <Col N="910" /> of people.  Technically, if you like, they should have brought in legislation to change the scheme to include the larger urban areas.  In fact, they persuaded the City Manager to extend the boundary to include this populous area, but there are other populous areas in Dublin which, because they fall outside the boundaries of the city as defined, are not entitled to benefit from this scheme.  Tallaght is one of the most obvious examples I can think of.</P>
    <P>As the growth of our cities continues, it is obvious that there will continue to be a further geographical discrimination between needy children from identical urban deprived backgrounds who are entitled to the free meals scheme, and children who are not.  The answer to that is to revise the whole basis of the scheme.  The Minister said a working party is looking at this.  I can only hope, for the sake of the children concerned, that they will be speedy in the completion of their work.</P>
    <P>The second main reason why this scheme which the Government amendment seems to regard as an approppriate vehicle for the distribution of milk is inadequate, is that it is based on local option.  It is up to the manager in each individual school, in present circumstances the management committee, to apply for the free meals service to the local authority or not to apply.  In the past, I have no doubt at all, there were children in urban areas, and perhaps also in Gaeltacht areas, who needed the kind of sustenance which could have been provided by this scheme who did not get it, either because of an oversight or I do not know what.  In any event, if the local application by the individual school was not made those children did not get meals, regardless of what the local authority thought, regardless of what social workers thought, regardless of what the school attendance officers thought.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear, if the figures are there on the Government side, what proportion and percentage of schools within each of these 49 local authority areas who operate the scheme are actually taking it.  I suspect <Col N="911" /> even that percentage is low, and I believe very strongly that the small percentage in no way reflects the real need.  One of the reasons why this scheme is inadequate is that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the figure.  I am sure he would be the first to admit, as I would assert, that it is unthinkable that 85 per cent of the total need occurs in the urban area of the centre of Dublin.  I should certainly hope that is not the case.  While it indicates that the urban centre of Dublin may be comparatively well provided for in terms of this scheme, it hints at considerable gaps elsewhere in other urban areas and perhaps in the Gaeltacht as well.</P>
      <P>I should be glad to hear from the Government side if any research is being carried out into what precise form of nutrition is regarded as being most appropriate.  I have often thought that the debate about school meals, school lunches, should be replaced in some areas by a debate about school breakfasts.  The problem in many areas is not so much that the children are hungry in the middle of the day but that they are hungry coming to school. This may be a graver source of educational deprivation even than the physical condition of the schools.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister, if he is going to confine this scheme to the areas at present covered by the free school meals scheme, to investigate the possibility of using this milk not served cold in the middle of the day but served hot or as cocoa or something at the beginning of the day, especially in the winter when it is likely to do most good.  This is the form in which it is likely to do most good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> So far as the administration of the scheme is concerned, I agree with the basic motion that it should be a national scheme and should not be confined to the areas covered by the present free school meals scheme.  I make the Minister a present of the following suggestion.  If he says it is too expensive to compulsorily administer half a pint of milk every day to half a million primary school children, let him offer to every school in the country and to every child in the country the option of having a free half pint of milk every day.  We are very hung up sometimes about the provision of services because we fail to think in terms of options.  We tend to think in terms either of being compulsory or being banned.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to offer an option of milk to every child in every school and eventually adjust the supply to meet the demand, it might or might not cost him a great deal less than his £4 million.  If he were to take that kind of scheme into account he could look at it this way, and I suggest to him that he should look at it this way.  If it is true, as he said, that we are already drinking enough milk, if it is true that it is impossible to push up the consumption of milk, if it is true that local authorities and schools in the local authority areas are not interested in providing milk, then he can offer this scheme nationally and it will not cost him more than a couple of quid.</P>

The Minister said he felt there was no capacity for the further consumption of milk.  It was unfair of him to say that.  That statement was completely off balance, because the Minister did not tell the House why we have almost the highest milk consumption in the EEC countries.  We have one of the best milk distribution systems not only in Europe but in the world.  Even remote country areas in this nation have a door to door delivery of milk.

We have one of the best milk distribution systems not only in the EEC but perhaps in the world.  Even in remote areas that may be as far as 20 miles from a depot milk is delivered in bottles.  That is one of the reasons for so much milk being consumed, but it is unfair for the Minister to say that we are consuming too much milk.  Another reason for so much milk being consumed is that we are a milk-producing country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would disagree with that figure.  From my contact with schools I am aware of the demand there is for the type of scheme we are advocating.  The previous speaker referred to a situation to which I have drawn attention on numerous occasions, a situation that I have heard the principal of a large school refer to within the past six months, that is, the question of children leaving for school either without a breakfast or having had a very poor breakfast.  That may not be the fault of the children but of the parents.  This is a situation relating to deprived families and is something that the Minister should bear in mind.  In referring to this matter Deputy Bruton mentioned a figure of 3 or 4 per cent, but the situation is much worse than that.  A survey of which I am aware showed that because of children from remote areas having to leave home very early in the morning and because of other social factors, the figure is as high as 25 per cent.  The Minister may shake his head, but as Chairman of the VEC in Wexford and as a member of two school boards I have a fair knowledge of the situation.  With the co-operation of teachers in the schools a survey was taken quietly and this revealed that up to 25 per cent of children start the day either without a breakfast or having had a very poor breakfast.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that if the scheme as presented by the EEC were offered to all schools it would be availed of to the extent of about 90 per cent. Parents are demanding of every school board that there be some facilities provided for hot meals especially during the winter months.</P>

Agreement was reached in 1976 for the purchase by the Commissioners of Public Works of the De La Salle Monastery at Navan with a view to its adaptation as a Garda station, but the vendors were unable to proceed with the sale pending resolution of certain title difficulties which have taken a long time to resolve.  The way is now almost clear for the execution of the contract for sale, and subject to the agreement of the vendors, the commissioners would be prepared to take over the building at that stage.</P>
      <P>A sketch scheme of adaptation works has already been prepared and discussed with the Garda authorities.

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that only two complaints about incidents of the kind mentioned <Col N="827" /> have been received by them in the recent past.  In one of these cases there was evidence of assault on a tenant by the landlord and proceedings were duly brought by the Garda.  In the other case the facts did not disclose any evidence of a crime.</P>
      <P>In general, the relationship between landlord and tenant is regulated by the civil law and the Garda have no authority to intervene unless in a particular case the question of a criminal offence arises.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that speed checks that have been carried out from time to time on Kill Lane over the last three years have disclosed very little evidence of any tendency to ignore the speed limits.  I am informed, however, that it has been decided that a portion of the road in question that was heretofore subject to a 40 mph limit is in future to be subject to a 30 mph limit but that the necessary signposting has not yet been completed.  Periodic speed checks will continue to be made.</P>

Allocations notified for commitments include provision for (<i>a</i>) balances on the local authority housing capital account at 31 December 1977, (<i>b</i>) expenditure in 1978 on completed schemes and (<i>c</i>) expenditure in 1978 on schemes contractually committed in 1977 but not started until 1978.</P>
    <P>3.  Allocations for new works notified are in respect of housing schemes, cottages etc., expected to start by 31 July 1978.  In the division of the resources available for new work the many factors, other than the level of claims, which were taken into account included the current level of work in progress and the stage reached in the planning of proposed new work, the comparative urgency of housing needs to be met by the proposed new schemes, the need to maintain a good spread and reasonable continuity of employment and contracting resources and the level of allocations in each area for the last three years.  A general review of expenditure on the local authority housing construction programme will be made during the Summer, and additional allocations may be made, within available resources, for starts later in 1978.</P>

      <P>On 21 March 1978 I sanctioned borrowing by Kerry County Council to the extent of £37,500 to enable them to contribute towards the cost of the scheme.  Borrowing of £17,500 had been sanctioned for the purpose in 1974 but was not taken up as the scheme did not proceed at that time.  My understanding is that 75 per cent of the cost of the work was to be met by the Department of Fisheries and the scheme was to be carried out by the Office of Public Works.  Accordingly, it will be appreciated that approval of the scheme was not a matter for my Department.</P>
