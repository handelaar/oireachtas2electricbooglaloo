      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), to delete lines 25 to 29, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" />&ldquo;(a)  a society, including a credit union, registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1971,</P>
    <P>(b)  a society registered under the Friendly Societies Acts, 1896 to 1977, and</P>
    <P>(c)  a society established under the Building Societies Act, 1976; or&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these two amendments jointly is to put building societies in the same position as industrial and provident societies and friendly societies and to make them subject to the controls proposed in the Bill.  The Building Societies Act, 1976, does not give the registrar the necessary powers to prevent a merger which would be undesirable or a take-over of a building society which would be undesirable. If the various regulations set out in that Act are complied with, the registrar has no discretion but to register a merger or a take-over of such societies.  The phraseology used in that Act is not &ldquo;merger or take-over&rdquo; but &ldquo;union of societies or transfer of engagements&rdquo; which amounts to the same thing.  I think the House would agree it would be desirable in the public interest that unsatisfactory mergers or take-overs of societies such as this should be avoided in the same way as the Bill applies to companies, friendly societies and industrial and provident societies.  In the normal course of business, there will be many unions or transfers of engagements as between building societies which would be desirable and would be encouraged by the registrar and by me.  Indeed, some of these have happened in recent years and no doubt will continue to happen in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> In page 3, subsection (1), line 39, after &ldquo;basis&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, but does not include any enterprise at least 90 per cent. of whose output is exported from the State or any enterprise at least 90 per cent. of whose output comprises components for products which are exported from the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is self-explanatory. Some concern was expressed about the effect of the inclusion of totally export-orientated companies in this Bill and some organisations who made representations to me suggested that the possibility of such companies being controlled by the Bill or being regarded as a potential monopoly in the Irish market might have a detrimental effect from the industrial promotion point of view.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that these companies are not selling in the Irish market for the most part.  I thought it as well to amend this definition of &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; at the end of page 3 by adding these proposed words to it which would have the effect of excluding companies manufacturing here, 90 per cent of whose output is exported, or 90 per cent of whose output comprises components for other further manufactured products which, in turn, are exported from the State. The output of these companies would not affect the internal market situation in Ireland.  For that reason I do not think it is necessary that they should be included within the Bill.  In view of the possible disincentive effect of technically classifying them as a monopoly&mdash;a disincentive effect from the industrial promotion point of view &mdash;it is as well to exclude them and I hope the House will agree to that approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly would agree with that, but the fact that the Minister has seen fit to introduce this good exemption in favour of companies of this kind leads me to ask him whether he would not consider a string of other such exemptions?  My feeling about this Act is that it is not really dealing with the kind of enterprise at which it is principally aimed. There are a couple of kinds of enterprise particularly in mind and in order <Col N="653" /> to catch these kinds of enterprise, which I accept it is proper and right to do, the Bill is so framed as to be a potential nuisance and millstone to a very large number of other enterprises. I am glad that the Minister is excepting by this amendment enterprises which are very largely export oriented. That leads me to wonder whether he might think of recasting the Bill in such a way as to relieve the apprehension of a very large number of enterprises of all kinds, the mergers of which might be beneficial even though they are not so heavily export oriented as the ones envisaged in the amendment. However, I certainly accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the major amendment which the Minister has tabled and the rather tentative manner in which he has explained the reasoning behind the amendment, I should be glad if he would elaborate. I, too, have received representations along the lines of the amendment which the Minister has introduced.  One might ask why the amendment should stipulate 90 per cent.  What is the <i>rationale</i> behind that?  It is conceivable that a company can set up in Ireland and reexport and they can be in a substantial monopoly situation, even in the export field.  I am a bit concerned with the definition here.  One will have some difficulty in policing it.  The Department will have to make sure that 90 per cent of a company's output is exported.</P>
      <P>By and large the amendment is unsatisfactory. One can see the gist of the Minister's intention.  In my relatively limited knowledge of this field, I have not seen similar domestic legislation relating to mergers, takeovers and monopolies. I do not think one would find it in UK or American structures.  What were the views of CTT and the IDA on this issue or is this simply a response to a particular comment?  There is need for greater elaboration.  We have quite a few such companies here and, while I have not any particular objection to their not being given the exemption, it is in the national interest that there should be more elaboration on why the change of heart came about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the definition of a monopoly. The Bill proposes to extend the powers which I have in relation to monopolies beyond the powers already contained in the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 by giving power here in certain cases and subject to a great many safeguards and delays, including the necessity to legislate through this House, the power to break up a monopoly.  Monopolies would be broken up by me or any other Minister only as a result of the fullest inquiry and my being satisfied and the Oireachtas being satisfied that the monopoly was not in the public interest and that it had undesirable consequences for the Irish consumer.</P>
      <P>In the case of many companies which are here now and which I am glad to say will be establishing here in the years to come, if their virtually exclusive interest is in markets outside Ireland and if they are selling the great bulk of their output outside this country, then they have no significant effect on the Irish public interest, though many of them might be the sole producers in Ireland of the goods they are selling.  I do not see any point in seeking to control them.  The point of controlling monopolies is to see that the Irish market is not distorted or abused in any way by the holder of a monopoly.  These companies would not affect the Irish market because the great majority of them do not sell anything on the Irish market.</P>
      <P>Rather than put the percentage figure at 100 per cent, I thought it fairer to put it at 90 per cent.  There are some companies which sell a small proportion of their output here and it would be wrong to catch them simply for a small percentage.  It would exclude from the Bill about 90 per cent of the companies about which we are talking.  These companies are in the vanguard of our job creation programme and have been for some time in the past and will be in the future.  The IDA and CTT welcome this amendment.  The figure of 90 per cent is the fairest one that we can arrive at in the circumstances, bearing in mind the various interests concerned.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 39, after &ldquo;basis&rdquo; to add &ldquo;but shall not include any enterprise, or any two or more enterprises under common control, which is or are the sole user or users within the State of any material produced within the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to put it to the Minister that, where an enterprise absorbs the entire output of raw material or processed material in the country and is in that situation not in consequence of having destroyed competitors but because it was never in a different situation, where its appearance on the Irish industrial scene was explained only because of the availability here of a product either raw or processed which would not otherwise have been exploited, it is technically a monopoly but not in the potentially detrimental sense of dominating the market and keeping other people from doing business.  In an instance of this sort the exclusion of such an enterprise from the provisions of this Bill might be appropirate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain that I fully see the point of the amendment. I am not saying that in any derogatory way.  It seems to me, if I understand Deputy Kelly correctly, that the great majority of the kind of cases which he mentions in this amendment have been covered by the previous amendment which the House has accepted.  The only difference I can see is that this would apply to the sole users of a particular commodity on the home market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be right to exclude such companies from the jurisdiction of the Bill. They are not in a fundamentally different situation to the companies we talked about in relation to the previous amendment, inasmuch as their activities could well be the cause of difficulties for the consumer and might be seen in certain circumstances as being contrary to the public interest here. There would not be very many companies <Col N="656" /> in this situation, but such as there are are precisely the kind of companies in respect of which one should have the power to control a monopoly, if I and the Oireachtas considered that the monopoly was not in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was aiming at a purchasing monopoly, not a selling monopoly. I was making the point that the purchasing monopoly&mdash;a situation that has been achieved not by driving competitors out of the market but because there never was anybody else in the business on the purchasing side&mdash; is not a monopoly in the pejorative sense of that term, namely, somebody who can dictate terms, thus creating unfavourable conditions of business for somebody else.  When I put down my amendment I had not seen the Minister's amendment No. 2.  I am inclined to agree that the kind of enterprise I have in mind which absorbs the total output of a concern is equally likely to be the kind of enterprise that is covered by amendment No. 2.  I should like the permission of the House to withdraw my amendment and shall see if I can contrive another amendment for Report Stage if that is considered justified, which will describe in a more acceptable way the kind of enterprises I have in mind, if they exist in substantial numbers or if there is a prospect of this, and which are not exempted by amendment No.2.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), after line 39, to insert the following: &ldquo;&lsquo;nett assets&rsquo; means gross assets within the State less current liabilities, loans and loan capital, taxation (including deferred taxation), repayable grants, and any other deferred liabilities;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This hinges on the notion of gross assets in the first subsection of section 2.  I put it to the Minister and the House that the gross assets situation in an enterprise that will be brought under the control of this measure may not give a fair picture of the economic power of that enterprise in that the gross assets may be scarcely capable of covering the liabilities.  It would be more reasonable and rational in order to bring under the control of the legislation enterprises of a certain economic weight, which is what the Minister is aiming at, if the gross assets were net assets.  It was in connection with the amendment which I had envisaged in section 2 (1) that I proposed a definition in the definitions part of the Bill, to define nett assets in such a way as to exclude the conventional liabilities that would reduce the actual value of the enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed to accept this amendment.  I see the point the Deputy is getting at but I consider that gross assets reflect a reasonably true picture of the strength of a company and that to employ the term &ldquo;nett assets&rdquo; would have the effect of reducing considerably the scope of application of the Bill and would be tantamount to increasing the threshold in relation to assets that are set out in subsection (1) of section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An examination of the definition which Deputy Kelly now proposes shows that nett assets would approximate to share capital and reserves and could be as much as 50 per cent smaller than the amount that would be concerned if we were to use the term &ldquo;gross assets&rdquo;.  The chapter of the United Kingdom Act dealing with fair trading concerned with merger control includes a provision for the valuation <Col N="658" /> of assets taken over.  However, that definition could be described as a definition of capital employed in the enterprise and is more in line with the use of gross assets rather than nett assets. In the circumstances, the proposal to substitute the word &ldquo;nett&rdquo; for &ldquo;gross&rdquo; and the consequential suggestion that nett assets should be defined should not be accepted by the House. If the House were to take the view that an even greater number of companies should be excluded from control of this Bill, the appropriate place to press that point would be on the figures contained in subsection (1) of section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be the case that one could argue the same point on the other amendment.  No matter how high one places the money threshold one is describing a situation in which a company if they have become heavily indebted are likely to be that much more heavily indebted.  If the gross assets are that much higher it may well be that the liabilities will have climbed up in the same proportion.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the object of this Bill and that of the previous Bill in 1974 and the measure that was mooted in 1972, is to protect the public against the effect of concentration of economic power in too few hands.  The machinery by which that is to be effected is to bring under the control of a measure such as this associations of big concerns. Surely the power of such concerns is measurable not merely by the amount of gross assets but by the amount of nett assets.  To bring under the control of a measure such as this concerns where the thresholds, in any case, are arguably too low, and to discount in doing so the amount to which an enterprise may be indebted is not a rational way of doing business.  Even if the Minister is not disposed to accept this, I think the definition section should contain some definition, even if it is only of gross assets.  The definition section is defective in not defining some of the terms that are central to the use of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not agree with the Minister that it is irrelevant to the purposes of the Bill or that the same point can be <Col N="659" /> dealt with adequately by proposing to raise the threshold.  No matter how big a firm may be on the money threshold level, the possibility that liabilities will be catching up&mdash;to the 50 per cent mark, as mentioned by the Minister&mdash;moves up in proportion.  I suppose this is a question of principle.  I cannot argue the point with too much emphasis because our own Bill was at fault in the same direction, if it is a fault.  However, as the thresholds in any case are arguably too low, they are now going to reach a point where relatively small businesses&mdash;ones that are not visible in European terms under the expression &ldquo;big business&rdquo;&mdash;are going to find themselves brought in.  This amendment is one of a pattern which I put down with the intention of relieving relatively small concerns from the control of this measure.</P>

      <P>I have some reservations about the criteria introduced by Deputy Kelly.  On Committee Stage there has been some dilution of the Bill and Deputy Kelly is proposing a further dilution.  The view of my party is that the net impact of the Bill in the long term will be seriously affected.  For that reason I think Deputy Kelly would be unwise to dilute the Bill any further.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of imposing my point of view on you. These are two quite separate issues.  In the early amendment I am trying to suggest to the Minister that the Bill should contain a definition of &ldquo;turnover&rdquo;. In the later amendment I am trying to propose that whatever the definition of &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; may be the threshold of turnover should be raised. These are two quite independent matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7.</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 25 and 26 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;turnover&rsquo; means sales within the State less (i) Value Added Tax paid; (ii) excise duty paid; but does not include sales to another enterprise which is already under common control with the enterprise in respect of which turnover is to be calculated.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point here is simply that as in the case of assets but, of course, it is a more troublesome problem: the question of turnover is not defined in the first subsection of section 2.  &ldquo;Turnover&rdquo; is a common commercial term but I believe it should be defined.  In view of the Bill with which we are dealing and about which so many apprehensions have been expressed that we will catch enterprises which would be laughably small by European standards, &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; should be defined in such a way as to have the effect of pushing firms out of the operation of the Bill rather than pushing them into it.  I believe that &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; should be defined in such a way as to exclude from it the liabilities which I have mentioned <Col N="662" /> here, VAT paid, execise duty paid and so on.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise in this regard that in failing to define &ldquo;gross assets&rdquo;, if that is what the Bill is now going to contain, and &ldquo;turnover&rdquo;, we are leaving undefined two of the most important elements the Bill contains. We are leaving people who may apprehend that they will be under the control of this Act unable to be quite certain, if they are anywhere near the border line, whatever it ends up with when the Bill leaves both Houses, whether they are within or without the application of the Act.  It is perfectly arguable that there are several ways of estimating turnover and that turnover should perhaps be estimated at any rate less the tax elements in it.</P>
    <P>I put forward this amendment partly with the intention of making the thing clear one way or another.  The later part of it is with the intention of trying to put smaller firms out of the control of the Bill.  I remind the House that there have been other examples.  The best known example in which turnover was used here legislatively was in the imposition of turnover tax in 1963, a time which we all remember.  At that time although &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; was defined in such a way as not to exempt these tax elements, at least it was defined. Part VI of the Finance Act, 1963 spoke about a charge of turnover tax and said in section 47:</P>
    <P>With effect on and from the 1st day of November, 1963, a tax, to be called turnover tax, shall, subject to this Part of this Act and the regulations thereunder, be charged, levied and paid&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on moneys received in respect of all or any of the following activities.</P>
    <P>There then followed a list of activities, the sale of goods, the hire of goods, the provision of services, acceptance of bets and four or five further ones.  At least somebody knew for revenue purposes what he would be charged turnover tax on.  That was as good as a definition of &ldquo;turnover&rdquo;.  I agree that Part VI of that Finance Act does not include for revenue purposes the exemptions I am seeking here.  At least the Act was clear about what &ldquo;turnover&rdquo;<Col N="663" /> meant.  There is nothing in this Bill, so far as I can see, which will tell anyone who may possibly be caught by the provisions of the Act if he is or is not caught by it.</P>
    <P>The amendment aims to do two things.  First, it defines &ldquo;turnover&rdquo;.  I would like to urge that point on the Minister, irrespective of whether he thinks there is any merit in my suggestion of defining it in such a way as to tend to push companies out of the control of the Bill.  The intent is partly to urge him to incorporate in the Bill some definition of &ldquo;turnover&rdquo;.  If it is not mine let it be his own.  Secondly, the amendment seeks to define &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; in such a way as to subtract from the understanding of turnover tax elements of the kind I have detailed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the concept of turnover is one which is well known in commercial circles and about which I do not think there is any doubt.  This is one of the terms used in the Bill like a lot of others in common commercial use which are not defined because it is considered (a) that it is unnecessary to define them and (b) that if one set out to define them one is liable to cause difficulties that would not otherwise arise.  As far as the amendment is concerned, the Deputy suggests deducting VAT and excise duty for the purpose of arriving at turnover.  I understand that is not the normal commercial practice.  Certainly, as far as excise duty is concerned, which would be the major element in regard to some companies, there are only three categories of companies I can think of offhand that would pay significant amounts of excise duty. They are oil companies, tobacco companies and distilling or brewing companies. I believe it is true to say that in virtually all of those they would certainly be well over any threshold which might reasonably be fixed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think very much would be gained by excluding excise duties or VAT.  In regard to the amendment generally the definition would not cover non-manufacturing or non-selling of goods activities, and all the various services, for example, which <Col N="664" /> are not excluded under section 1 would be excluded for the purposes of turnover if the Deputy's definition were accepted.  For example, the provision of some service which is not one of those ten which are excluded there would be excluded by the definition of turnover, because the turnover of such a service for the purpose of this Act would be its gross income before payment of salaries and various trading expenses.  The Deputy will appreciate that this definition which he proposes now would exclude completely all non-manufacturing enterprises and all enterprises which did not deal in selling something which was physically in existence, and I imagine that that was not the Deputy's intention.  I would not be prepared to accept that because it would mean that we would exclude from the Bill not alone the ten sets of services which are set out here but also all services, and &ldquo;services&rdquo; is a very wide concept, as the House will know.  That would not be desirable, and I think the House generally would agree that it would not be desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised several points, some of them a distance away from the point I was trying to make, but I will give the Minister my reactions to them off the top of my head.  I hope I am not spilling any beans by saying that I understood this Bill to be aimed primarily at controlling mergers of enterprises which are trading in goods and which, because of merger, tend to monopolise the market, particularly a retail or distribution market, in such a way as could injure possibly the consumer, the person who goes out with a shopping basket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another potential target of the Bill which is not expressed is the merger of newspapers or the taking over of organs of the media.  I endorse the idea that newspapers have a dimension which is more than a commercial one and that it would be in the public interest that the bringing of all these organs of opinion under the control of too few hands is undesirable and would not be in the public interest. When we come to that section I will say that the right way to do this is to <Col N="665" /> express what we are after in so many words.  Both these prime targets of the Bill, the newspaper empires and the supermarket empires, fall within the categories which are envisaged by my amendment.  I agree that the services which do not pay excise duty or VAT would be excluded completely by my definition of turnover, and I accept that if there are services the amalgamation or merging of which does threaten the public interest, then this amendment would require redrafting or resubmission in some form.  A fault which this Bill has, and had when the National Coalition introduced it, is insufficient particularity and insufficient frankness in regard to what was being aimed at.  When you have in mind a couple of flies you want to swat, to construct an enormous, cumbersome machine through which every kind of insect and creature must pass in the hope that now and then you are going to find the fly you are after is a bad way of going about legislation.  While the Minister's Bill, like all Bills of which it is very nearly a photocopy, mentions services in the same breath with other enterprises, I am not too clear which services the Minister or his Department have in mind as being potential targets for the operation of this control.  Perhaps they exist, and I do not say it in any polemical sense because I am not aware of what services they have in mind.  I do not, therefore, regard this objection by the Minister, technically correct though he is in saying my amendment should be rejected, as very weighty.</P>
    <P>The Minister enumerated the kind of firm who would normally be paying excise duty, such as oil companies, tobacco companies and drink companies, and said that these companies tended to be too big anyway and that they would be over any threshold that this Bill is likely to wind up with. That may be so, but that is not the way to bring a company over a threshold nor is it the proper way to deal with the point I am trying to make.  It is a mere accident that in practice oil companies are large concerns with plant and assets of various kinds which will exceed any likely threshold we are trying to adopt here.  I am not sure <Col N="666" /> whether the same is true of tobacco companies.  It may be true of drink companies.  That mere fact is an accident and it is not inherent in the nature of the oil, tobacco or drink business. There seems in any case to be a discrimination. I do not want to make too much of it as it is not very sinister, but it seems to be to a degree discriminatory that companies, because of the accident of the kind of trade they are engaged in and the accident that the State has chosen to levy excise duty on their operation, will find included in their turnover for threshold calculation purposes a very high degree of money which is by-passing their pockets and passing to the State again. That would be true of big companies. If you compare them, on the other hand, with operations which are free not only of excise but of VAT as well, it seems that the threshold is operating in, what I am sure is unintentionally, a discriminatory way.  That discrimination could be avoided and the definition of turnover could be achieved in such a way as to let out the smaller kind of concern, if the Minister will accept amendments as those I have proposed.</P>
    <P>Even if he is unwilling to accept any amendment along the lines which I am arguing, I urge him very strongly that the Bill ought to contain some definition of turnover.  I accept that if you start to define something you may wind up in more difficulties than you anticipated, but that is no reason for ducking the definition.  That means that you are leaving it to a court at some later stage to tangle with the question of what is a turnover.</P>
    <P>This House refusing to grapple with the problem of deciding and putting into a paragraph what a turnover is, means that some judge in the future will have to do it, and we may wind up with a definition which is far from the Minister's present intention.  I mean this not simply in respect of turnover but of anything which is left undecided.  I urge the Minister then that it would be sensible to have a definition of turnover, whatever that definition is.  By refusing to do it we are making difficulties for the courts later and they may solve those difficulties <Col N="667" /> in a way which the Minister's Government or any Government would not find welcome.  On the other hand the definition of turnover which I am urging here will eliminate any possible discrimination between firms paying excise duty and firms who do not pay excise duty at all, and again firms who do not pay even VAT on a substantial part of their trading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go this far with the Deputy, that it is undesirable to give or attempt to give a positive definition of a normal commercial concept like turnover.  I hope he will agree that you would create more difficulties than you would solve by it. But to meet many of the points he has made I would be prepared on Report Stage, subject to the views of the draftsman, to put in in a negative way that turnover for the purposes of this Bill shall not include value-added tax or excise duty, without at the same time attempting to enter the potential morass of defining it in a positive way which could be dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that this Bill was aimed mainly at firms trading in goods and he mentioned also the newspaper situation.  Those items are two of the primary concerns of the Bill but it is concerned also, and properly so in the public interest, with all forms of services other than the ten excluded at the top of page 4.  There is a wide variety included.  A surprising number of items is included, one of which is shipping, but it is proper that shipping be covered because it is an area in which one could foresee much detriment to the public good in the event of certain take-over or merger situations.  If, for example, a monopoly situation in shipping were ever to arise here, although I do not see any such possibility in the foreseeable future, there could be a serious situation so far as the public interest was concerned.  Shipping is a specialised type of business.  Also included in the Bill is all banking other than banking licensed under section 9 of the Central Bank Act.  Certain aspects of that type of banking give rise to much concern and we are trying <Col N="668" /> to do something about it at present.  All transport services are included in the provisions of the Bill other than those licensed under the 1932 and 1934 Acts.  Included also are numerous other services of that kind.</P>
    <P>Even in the strictly professional area there have been considerable mergers down through the years.  On the whole these mergers are desirable and they have been beneficial publicly, but should the situation be taken a step further and the stage were reached, for example, where there was only one stockbroking firm in Munster, I would begin to wonder whether such a situation was in the public interest. To take another example: if, say, there were only two or three firms of solicitors in Limerick I would begin to wonder also whether that situation was in the public interest.  The time must come when those mergers and take-overs would reach what I would call an optimum limit.  It should be possible to have control in this area under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, some of the situations I have been talking about are remote possibilities but ten or 15 years ago one could not have foreseen the kinds of mergers that have taken place since then.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="669" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister for Transport and Tourism can control them.  They must renew their licences every year and the Minister must approve, for example, of the transfer of licences under the Road Transport Acts.  It is not a simple matter of two people agreeing to either buying or selling a licence.  The Minister must give his approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Minister has had legal advice on this but in my opinion he would be on very poor legal ground because what has been happening for the past 50 years is that the approval of the transfer of a licence has been automatic.  In a situation in which a licence changes hands illegally, a sum is paid in consideration of the transfer but the person selling the licence goes then to the Department involved with transport and the Department under the guise of transferring the business agree to the transfer of the licence so that theoretically the person concerned has bought a business and not a plate.</P>
      <P>There are many precedents that could be quoted.  Since the war years very big transport companies have been built up by way of people continuing to acquire licences and thereby building up fleets of lorries.  Under the provisions of the Transport Bill that went through this House within the past month, these people on the basis of their existing licences will be able to build up much bigger companies because a company with, say, ten licences and operating 20 trucks, will be able to operate more than 100 trucks.  Therefore these companies can become very big concerns.  Obviously, CIE should be excluded.  When I was Minister I had a similar Bill but my successor was of the opinion that that Bill would allow companies that were too big to merge.  He limited the number of companies to six but it will be possible under his Bill for a company operating up to 100 trucks to be built up.  I can think of two firms in particular who, if they combined their licences and then merged, would have a considerably greater proportion of the road freight business than CIE have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of <Col N="670" /> questions I should like to put to the Minister.  First, though, I am grateful to him for accepting the sense of what I said and of proposing to introduce an amendment at Report Stage to meet what was sought by me in the first part of my amendment, that is, to take excise duty and VAT out of the understanding of turnover.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's reluctance to define turnover but perhaps he will have second thoughts about it now.  However, further questions remain in relation to the amendment. Has the Minister a scheme in mind or have the Department any idea of how turnover is to be defined in connection with certain kinds of service, for example, I mentioned jocosely the question of solicitors' turnover? For all I know there may be some way of interpreting this in the solicitor's profession but which would need a good deal of explanation in regard to computing turnover of a solicitor's firm.  For example, would the turnover include money passing through the solicitor's hands in a purely fiduciary way which of course is the way solicitors are supposed to handle virtually all money except their costs?</P>
      <P>I do not ask this contentiously.  I merely wonder whether it would add a dimension of sense to my pressing the Minister to define &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; itself. For example, how would he define &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; in connection with the operations of a rental company, one which rents cars, television sets or plant?  Will it be the total rents which they collect? Does it correctly express the dimensions of their economic operation in the way that total sales would in the case of an ordinary trading firm not engaged in rental business but in selling? These are things about which I should like to inquire.  How will &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; be computed in the case of firms doing something else, providing a service or doing something other than selling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter I wanted to mention is something which had not occurred to me until the Minister spoke a few minutes ago.  It is that I think there will be a good deal of worry amongst some of the professional <Col N="671" /> services mentioned here after the definition of &ldquo;services&rdquo; in the Bill.  I think there will be a certain amount of worry amongst the Minister's own profession, amongst accountants, architects and so on on hearing that their amalgamation of relations will, on some standard which is not here defined in regard to their turnover, potentially be within the ambit of this Bill when it becomes law.  I accept that these features were present in our Bill as well but that is water under the bridge; I have to make this point.  I am sure the Minister, as a solicitor, will accept&mdash;in fact he said as much a few minutes ago in connection with banks&mdash;that there are many solicitors in the country making a lot of money and there are many of them pulling the devil by the tail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In what respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the sense of not making a living commensurate with the effort they are putting into it. There certainly were until recently, although things may have changed since I stopped practising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unhappily for both of us things have changed.  We were in at the wrong time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think and have reason to believe that there are solicitors who are not making all that much of a killing out of their legal profession and for whom it may very well be the case that amalgamation is a sensible step.  I am sure the Minister realises this very well, that a large solicitors' firm&mdash;and I am certain the same is true for accountants and architects&mdash;can offer the public a service which is infinitely better than the service which a large number of small firms can offer.  The amalgamation of professional firms makes it possible for individual members of the firm to specialise to a degree which is not possible if he or she has to look after everything, such as running down cases, district court appeals, wills, conveyancing and everything else in a small under-equipped office.  I am sure analogous illustrations could be given <Col N="672" /> from the world of accountancy, architecture and all the other professional services.  I know perfectly well that this Bill does not intend to call a halt to amalgamations of practising members of any particular profession.  But it will be felt by many of them to be an unnecessary irritant that they should be even nominally subject to the control of the Bill in trying to rationalise their operations.  I must accept some blame for not having spotted this point before now.  It has occurred to me only since the Minister spoke.  I can see there will be a lot of difficulty in trying to construct any system of exclusion for various professional services but it will lend more weight to an amendment I will be introducing later intended to clear the way for an informal system of clearances whereby amalgamations or mergers can go ahead quickly and without the invocation of the cumbersome machinery of this Bill, even though the Minister has introduced amendments to make it less cumbersome.</P>
      <P>I simply wanted to draw attention to what I think would be disquiet on the part of some professions on finding that their operations will come within this Bill under the heading of &ldquo;service&rdquo;. But that makes it doubly important to define, for the purpose of services, how exactly a turnover is to be computed.  I shall not hold up the House making this point any longer. The Minister might bear it in mind, and his Department also between now and the next Stage.</P>

My Department are assured by the Department of Tourism and Transport that that latter Department are satisfied that they can exercise adequate control over the transfer of licences under the 1933 Act.  The transfer is not in fact automatic.  I have seen cases in my own practice where a Minister of the day&mdash;15 years ago&mdash;refused to allow transfers of licences.</P>

      <P>There are limitations under this new Bill which has passed this House and is now in the Seanad. There are limitations on the number of vehicles that can be operated.  I think the present Minister took a different view from that of his predecessors in regard to that.  He was right not to allow absolutely enormous conglomerations of licences together in a small number of companies.  It is better to try to spread it, which is in the public interest from the point of view of maintaining and, if possible, increasing competition.</P>

      <P>The point of the Bill is to liberalise the existing situation but one wonders how far one should go in liberalising it.  The present Minister has taken a somewhat more restrictive view than his predecessor for valid reasons. However, that is peripheral to what we are discussing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turnover for the purpose or a professional service, or indeed any service whether professional in the limited sense, is gross income.  A rental company's turnover is its gross rentals, whether it be a car rental company, television rental company or whatever. Similarly with a shipping company it would be its gross charter fees or the gross amount paid to it for the carriage of goods.  Similarly in regard to solicitors, accountants, stockbrokers or whatever, their clients' money which passes through their hands continuously would not be regarded as part of their turnover but their gross income would be.  I do not want anybody to get the impression that I am setting out to try and control mergers of solicitors or accountants.  For the most part one would encourage these because they have been very beneficial. They have been beneficial for the reasons that Deputy Kelly mentioned. But it is proper that we put the matter <Col N="674" /> in perspective lest anything that Deputy Kelly said might cause a scare or apprehension amongst people of that kind.  The only firms of solicitors or accountants who would have the possibility of their merging with some larger firm, subject to scrutiny and approval by me, would be firms of solicitors whose gross income&mdash;their own personal gross income, not anything to do with their clients' money&mdash; would exceed £2½ million.  There may be a few firms of solicitors or accountants in this country whose turnover would exceed £2½ million but I do not think there are very many. It is only when they are taken over that the question would arise, not when they take over somebody smaller than themselves.  Therefore, it is not a very real problem from their point of view. There probably are some accountants, and there may be some solicitors, but they would be very few.  Certainly 99 per cent of each of those professions would not in any way be affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I should like to join the Minister in quietening any apprehensions I may have raised. The Minister has only mentioned one other criterion.  As it stands, his Bill treats the various criteria disjunctively. This Bill has no inbuilt multiplier on its thresholds corresponding to the rise in the cost of living or anything like that.  If the Minister persists in treating these criteria disjunctively, it is not inconceivable that firms will step over one or other of those thresholds and will be surprised to find that their amalgamation plans are subject to Ministerial control.  I accept that the danger is not a very proximate one.  It is like a cloud on the horizon no bigger than a man's hand at the moment but I think that the professions will still be a bit surprised to see it there at all.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister say anything in regard to amendment No. 7 about the status for the purpose of turnover calculations of a sale made by a company to another company which is under the same control as itself&mdash;not one with which it is going to be amalgamated but one which is under the same control as itself on the outside, so to speak.</P>

      <P>It is quite likely that it will cover a lot of them.  I had been thinking of putting down an amendment along the lines of amendment No. 10 but I decided not to because, with great respect, amendment No. 10 is superfluous for a reason which I will explain later.  Even if it is necessary and does make sense, I am not sure that it entirely meets this point, because amendment No. 10 is related to section 1 (2).  It refers to two enterprises which are to be amalgamated.  I am only talking about one of these enterprises. Suppose there are two enterprises which are to be merged.  If one of these enterprises is doing business with a third enterprise and it and the third enterprise are under common control, sales between it and the third enterprise ought not to be reckoned in the calculation of turnover.  It is not as between itself and the firm with which the amalgamation is proposed but as between itself and another firm with which it shares a common control.  If the Minister misunderstood the amendment I do not mind leaving it.  He might think about it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I feel that amendment No. 8 is slightly unspecific.  I think I know what is meant by &ldquo;an offer capable of acceptance.&rdquo;  What we are talking about is an offer capable of acceptance which, if accepted, will affect the merger or the takeover, not just any old offer at all.  I realise that commonsense ought to tell us that that is not necessary, but the Minister knows perfectly well that a statutory provision which is left in sufficiently specific is a breeding ground for litigation. While accepting his amendment, I would ask the Minister to look at it again to see whether he considers the phrase &ldquo;an offer capable of acceptance&rdquo; should be expanded to make it clear that the offer relates directly to the two and, if accepted, will affect the merger or the takeover that the Bill is supposed to cover.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was made in response to a suggestion from more than one of the groups that made representations to me&mdash;the merchant banks or the Stock Exchange, I think. The point was made that the corresponding figure in the city takeover code is 30 per cent.  It was felt by the Stock Exchange that it would be preferable to have the same figure in the Bill as in the city takeover code.  I accept that this is a valid point for purposes of administrative convenience and so on.  The figure was 20 per cent <Col N="677" /> in the 1974 Bill.  I changed it to 25 per cent because this figure would be the amount needed to block a special resolution under the Companies Act, 1963.  If one had more than a 25 per cent holding in a public company, one could be said to have substantial control because the power to block a special resolution is a very real one, particularly in a public company.  I am suggesting&mdash;and obviously Deputy Kelly agrees&mdash;that we make it 30 per cent in order to make it compatible with the city takeover code.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly has already referred to this amendment.  It was represented to me that this Bill, as originally drafted, would catch, as it were, transactions of nominal merger or nominal take-over between two companies, each of whom was a wholly-owned subsidiary of a parent company.  Since they are merged anyway if they are wholly-owned subsidiaries, there is no point in seeking to control any proposed merger or takeover between them.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the amendment.  I have received the same representations as the Minister did.  Originally, I drafted an amendment with the same purport as the Minister's amendment, but I tore it up as it seemed unnecessary.  Subsection (2) (a) is the portion with the teeth in it.  The reason I think this is unnecessary is because that provision contains the words &ldquo;come under common control&rdquo;. The use of the word &ldquo;come&rdquo; leaves us with the understanding that the merger or take-over did not already exist.  It did, so the amendment is redundant.  I have no objection to the amendment.  My purpose is to explain why I did not put down one <Col N="678" /> of my own in the same sense.  Though the Minister's amendment will not do any damage, the intent has been achieved already.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), between lines 24 and 25 to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h) This subsection does not apply to a case where an enterprise which carries on business in the State makes any such acquisition as is contemplated by paragraph (c) of this subsection in another enterprise which carries on business wholly or substantially outside the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This speaks for itself.  I see the point of the Bill generally as did the Government of which I was part, but at the same time Irish businesses are small on the European scale and more so on the world scale, and they are being continually urged by the IDA to rationalise, to become more competitive and so on.  For that purpose, amalgamations, mergers and take-overs are encouraged.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate I drew attention to the apparent conflict between the anxiety of the IDA to have businesses rationalised and a Bill which will subject mergers to controls and which the CII and other interests feel will be seriously inhibited by legislation.  The Minister has gone a fair distance to meet the objections raised in those quarters but I am surprised to find that the Minister's amendment did not cover the case of the enterprise being acquired outside the State.  I cannot see the detriment to the Irish consumer in such a situation or how that would have to be guarded against.  If a company here makes itself more competitive and wants to acquire a foot for itself in another country, I regard it as a piece of inadvertant busybodying to be trying to interfere with an Irish company which tries to strengthen itself by acquiring a company that does not operate in this jurisdiction but which will be equally caught by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> My amendment is designed to take out of the application of subsection (2) an enterprise which carries on business in the State which makes the type of acquisition contemplated by paragraph (c), of a business essentially outside the State.  Rare though such an occurrence has been, I hope it will become more common in the future and I cannot for the life of me see where the danger for the Irish consumer would lie.  I ask the Minister to remove this aspect from the Bill either by accepting this amendment or by drafting one himself to the same effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The old question of whether I could stop an Irish company acquiring a foreign one is a matter of some doubt.  The laws of this Parliament extend only as far as the jurisdiction extends, at the moment to 26 counties of this island.  I am not certain whether I have effective powers to prevent an Irish company acquiring a foreign one, but in so far as I might have it is desirable that I should maintain such powers under this Bill.  One could see a situation in which a proposed foreign acquisition by an Irish company might have objectionable features, such as the transfers of the Irish company's manufacturing activities to the foreign company abroad with consequent effects on employment here.  In so far as one could seek to control that situation, it is only right the Minister should have those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the type of amendment the Deputy proposes here, not just this one specifically but this type generally would seek to discriminate or differentiate between Irish companies on the one hand and non-Irish companies on the other, is no longer acceptable in the EEC because it is in contravention of the Treaty of Rome. There is no point in this Parliament legislating on such lines from now on, whether in this field or in any other.  It would be a little strange that Irish firms would be discriminated against in their own country but not abroad. That would be the unexpected and not very desirable result of this amendment. Anyway, whether we thought it desirable or not, it is no longer legally <Col N="680" /> allowable within the Community and therefore it could not be accepted.</P>
    <P>There have been quite a number of acquisitions of foreign companies by Irish enterprises.  It is a trend that is increasing and I hope it will continue. Generally one would encourage it, but there could be a situation where an Irish company would acquire a foreign one for the purpose of transferring all its business out of the State and that would have undesirable results from the employment point of view, if no other.  I hope the Deputy will not follow all those hares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like a man who thinks he is plucking up a harmless weed and finds himself holding a mile of root. If the Minister is now revealing for the first time in this or the Second Stage debates a Government intent to prevent Irish companies from transferring their manufacturing business and employment elsewhere&mdash;I do not want to introduce here a note we have not had before&mdash;we can say it is a laudable national objective to maintain employment here, but to try to achieve it like this is a bad way to do business.  There is a dimension here that had not occurred to me until I heard the Minister and I will see that it is in order if I can devise some amendment to meet the point before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of discrimination as between Irish and foreign firms.  I cannot see really where the discrimination lies.  We are not trying to give an advantage to our own firms as against others.  Surely the discrimination the European Communities are death on is the discrimination which would give an advantage to Irish firms and not prejudice foreign ones.</P>
      <P>You cannot, of course, put Irish firms at a disadvantage either because, if you do you are discriminating in favour of eight other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> That cannot be allowed.  The Minister is saying there is no control in the eight other member states whether they acquire firms outside or inside the respective country.  That may be, but I would be interested to know whether the other eight, so far as they have controlling legislation, which I presume they have in some shape or form, impose control on acquisition by their own firms or firms completely outside their jurisdiction.  It may be so, but I would be interested to know whether a French or a German firm is inhibited by French or German law from acquiring an Irish firm and whether the same kind of control is applied by them to acquisitions as is applied by them to acquisitions and mergers within their own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is also the point in regard to discrimination that some account must be had of the purpose behind this legislation.  This Bill has been presented to us, and rightly so&mdash;we presented a somewhat similar Bill&mdash;as essentially something to protect the public interest.  Now we hear it has a subsidiary objective of a quite different kind.  The public interest so far as this Bill ostensibly goes is the public interest in not being held up to ransom and made to pay an excessive price because of the cornering of a market in the supply of goods or services. That legislative attempt, unexceptionable as it is, and completely as I agree with it and support it, is in no way served by an inhibition or a control exercised on the acquisition by an Irish firm or a foreign firm.  In what way is the interest of an Irish consumer prejudiced by that?  It escapes me and I am surprised to hear the Minister defend it in the way he did.</P>
    <P>His last point he must have been making literally on his feet because it is not the case that our law takes no account of what goes on beyond our shores.  A simple instance which flashes into my mind is the provision of what, I think, is called the Exchange Control Act of 1956 which makes it an offence for an Irish citizen to maintain a bank account in some other country. In other words, if the Minister goes abroad and earns fees lecturing in, say, the United States or Germany and <Col N="682" /> banks the fees he earns there he is breaking the law here notwithstanding that his activity did not take place within the boundaries, as the Minister says, of this State.  I am not speaking here, remember, about exporting money.  The Minister described these points as hares and he will forgive me for spending five minutes now chasing them.</P>
    <P>These are large issues which I must go into so far as they are relevant to this Bill on Report Stage.  I could not possibly accept that the object of the Bill, which is the protection of the Irish public interest from exploitation by the cornering of a market, is being in any way served by the application of a Bill seeking to control an acquisition by an Irish firm of a company which does all its business abroad.  If the Minister wants to prevent manufacturing industry from pulling up its roots here and going elsewhere then that should be done by some other means, if it can be done constitutionally at all, or if it can be done within the very EEC about which the Minister talks, an EEC dedicated to the free movement of capital.  I doubt very much if what the Minister says is the object of the interpretation of the Bill, according to him, is lawful. I shall have to think about it, but, if it is, it has certainly nothing whatever to do with the main object of the Bill and an objective like that, even if it is lawful, ought not to be achieved by a backdoor method.  I shall have to stand on my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), between lines 24 and 25 to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) This subsection does not apply to a case where, in any acquisition such as is contemplated by paragraph (c) of this subsection, the assets of the enterprise in which the acquisition is to be effected consists solely or substantially of property not used in the production or distribution of manufactured or processed goods or the provision of services.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> What I have in mind here, and possibly this was part of the submissions the Minister received&mdash;I forget which body put it in&mdash;is that a body made the point that a purely property acquisition, an acquisition by an enterprise, for possible tax purposes or investment purposes, of another enterprise, which does not engage and could not be made to engage, because it is not of the nature that could engage, in the manufacture or processing or distributing of goods, ought not to be caught by this Bill.  It was suggested, and it is a point the Minister should at least deal with, that an acquisition of an enterprise which contained nothing, for example, except an office block, or a set of office blocks, or a farm of land might well be left out of the application of this Bill.  In a sense an office block or a farm produces something but nothing of the kind the Minister is here going to control.  I may be interpreting the Bill more narrowly perhaps than the Minister intends but he should deal with the point in regard to an acquisition which is merely acquiring capital of a kind not employed in the production of goods or the provision of services and so ought not necessarily come within the control of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>The object of this amendment is to exclude from the provision relating to the acquisition of assets, assets of an enterprise which are not employed directly in the production or distribution of manufactured or processed goods or the provision of services.  The reason for this suggested amendment is not entirely clear.  It has been argued that assets which are not directly connected with the business being carried on by the enterprise which owns them should be excluded on the grounds that the acquisition of these assets will not affect the continued operation of the enterprise which sells them in the business in which it is engaged.  If this is the case then the reason for concern is not clear because section 1 (2) (e), which is the section concerned with the acquisition of assets, provides that the acquisition will only constitute a merger for the purposes of the Act if a <Col N="684" /> result of the acquisition is that the purchasing enterprise replaces or substantially replaces the selling enterprise in the business in which that enterprise was engaged immediately before the acquisition.  In effect, the main consideration here is that a merger will only be deemed to occur where, as a result of an acquisition of assets, one enterprise is replaced or substantially replaced by the purchasing enterprise in the business in which the former was engaged.</P>

      <P>The Minister has taken me by surprise by directing me to paragraph (e) and I would like to read it more carefully in the context of this amendment.  Suppose a supermarket chain wants to invest its surplus and goes into the property business and <Col N="685" /> acquires the Setanta complex.  That does not appear to be threatening the public interest in the sense this Bill is trying to prevent because it is not contracting the number of choices offered to the public in getting their goods and services and it is not creating anything more of a corner than previously existed.  I am not too happy with the Minister's explanation that the acquisition of a farm does not necessarily fall outside the scope of what he is talking about.  I realise there are inhibitions of a kind which arise from our land laws about acquiring agricultural land for the purpose of investment but we could leave the land out of this.</P>
      <P>Let us take the office block across the road.  Suppose that was acquired by a supermarket chain simply as a mode of investing a surplus and making money, which is the kind of enterprise this Bill is aimed at, in what way is the acquisition of that purely profitmaking investment element putting that supermarket <i>vis-à-vis</i> the consumer in a more commanding situation that it previously was?</P>

My point is that paragraph 1 (2) (e) leaves them out because unless the existing business being carried on by the vending company is replaced by a business of the purchasing or taking over company, then a merger does not take place for the purposes of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment speaks for itself.  I wanted to urge on the Minister that the threshold in regard to the gross assets should be raised.  I have already argued unsuccessfully that gross assets should be net assets.  I do not accept the Minister's argument in favour of leaving it gross assets, but we passed from that.  That only makes the point more important that the threshold at which the gross assets are to be computed should be raised. I propose that they should be doubled. As far as I can recall the then Fianna Fáil spokesman on Industry and Commerce when our Bill was before the House&mdash;we never got a chance to debate it&mdash;put down an amendment on similar lines.</P>

There are nine major differences between this Bill and the 1974 Bill to which the attention of the House should be drawn because nobody seems to have adverted to them either here or outside the House, notwithstanding the many commentaries. One of those nine major and significant differences&mdash;I hope I will not be asked to give the other eight because I cannot remember what they are&mdash;is that subsection 2 (1) which deals with these thresholds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So far as subsection 2 (1) is concerned the 1974 Bill was drafted in a way that, irrespective of what may have been the intention of the Minister or the draftsman at that time, the effect of it was that if either the taking over company or the taken over company, or in merger terms, the dominant or the servient company, exceeded the threshold, the Act applied.  The way section 2 (1) is now drafted it relates only to thresholds and it is only if the taken over or servient company exceeds the threshold that the Bill applies.  The net result has been that perhaps 90 per cent of the cases that were caught under the old Bill are not caught now.  If, for example, in 1974 Guinnesses proposed to take over a pub worth £100,000 which was owned by a company. Guinnesses being worth £100 million or whatever, that case is a trivial transaction in commercial terms, a trivial transaction in Guinnesses terms.  However, that was caught under the 1974 Bill, but it is not caught here because the company owning the pub is well below the threshold.  The threshold in the 1974 Bill, as drafted, applied to either company.  This only applies to the servient or taken over company and therefore a large number of transactions of a quite trivial nature which would in many cases have been caught under the 1974 Bill are not caught here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> When one comes to discuss the question of the thresholds here, one has to read these figures in the context of what this subsection means today as opposed to the context of what it meant as proposed in 1974. It is quite invalid to compare these two threshold figures with the corresponding thereshold figures in the 1974 Bill, because the 1974 Bill thresholds applied to either company and this applies only to the taken over or servient company.  &ldquo;Servient&rdquo; may not be the proper word, but Deputy Kelly knows why I am using it.  It relates to property and it is the only word I could find that nearest expresses the sort of thing that needs to be expressed. The two figures are not comparable at all.  A huge number of transactions which would have been caught, perhaps unwittingly, under the proposals as published in 1974, are not caught here.  A whole lot of transactions of that kind, which would have had to go to the Minister if the 1974 Bill had been passed, have not to go to the Minister now.</P>
    <P>One of the other major differences in relation to these thresholds is that, unlike the 1974 Bill, the Minister has power only to increase these figures but not to decrease them, as he had in 1974.  I cannot conceive of a case where one should in the future decrease them.  One should increase them at least at the rate of inflation, and perhaps more.  These figures are larger in real terms than the figures that were proposed in 1974.  They apply only to the smaller or taken over company and therefore apply to a much smaller number of transactions than what would have been caught in 1974. For that reason it is not necessary or appropriate to increase the gross assets figure of £1¼ million which is proposed here because it is the gross assets figure of the taken over company.  The corresponding figure in 1974 was £½ million and applied to either company. Inflation has been bad in the meantime but has not totalled 150 per cent, so that in real terms this is a much higher figure.</P>

      <P>I will again inform the House that amendment <Col N="689" /> No. 14 is before the House, but we are discussing Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 together and we will dispose of them all after this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor, at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate in 1974 or 1975, introduced but never had the chance to discuss a large number of amendments in response to points made at the time by Deputy Brennan&mdash;then the Industry and Commerce spokesman&mdash;of which the matter just mentioned by the Minister was one.  The Minister's predecessor introduced an amendment that had the effect of subjecting to control a situation only where both of the enterprises concerned were involved. I accept what the Minister says about the Bill in its original form: he is right to draw attention to the potential absurdity of making subject to control a situation in which Guinnesses are acquiring a public house.</P>
      <P>The Minister's assertion that he was looking for some credit for the fact that his power to vary the figures in these thresholds was only a power to vary them upwards and not downwards is an amazing assertion in view of the provision in a later section of the Bill which empowers him, where he thinks the exigencies of the common good require it, to ignore the thresholds altogether.  That is a most amazing provision which we will discuss when we come to it.  If it is aimed at certain kinds of business, the Bill should say so.  To some extent all this holy restraint evidenced by subsection (4) of section 2 is redundant, because the Minister is empowered by a later section to exercise control over any kind of a merger irrespective of thresholds if he thinks the exigencies of the common good require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four conditions envisaged in subsection (1) of section 2 to be met. Each of the two enterprises involved must have gross assets more than £1¼ million and each must have a turnover of not less than £2½ million.  These four requirements are not cumulative, they are disjunctive.  In other words, they do not have to be met simultaneously. Only two of these conditions have to be met in order to bring the transaction <Col N="690" /> under control.  One of the amendments I have proposed is to subsitute &ldquo;and&rdquo; for &ldquo;or&rdquo; so as to make these criteria cumulative and not merely alternative. The Minister has just admitted that he has been subjected to the same submissions as the Opposition.  He knows perfectly well that the unanimity among the business interests whose view has reached his desk is that the thresholds, whether they are Fianna Fáil or National Coalition thresholds, are too low, that they will impose a potential control on enterprises which, measured on the European scale are Lilliput size, absolutely trivial enterprises by comparison with the kind of enterprises whose merger might cause concern in any of our partner countries.  I believe that not one of the top 200 European companies in terms of assets is an Irish company.  We rank below that level, even with our biggest, even with Guinness, the instance which the Minister gave.  It does not figure in the top 200 European companies&mdash;very wounding to the national pride, but that is a fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That certainly is so but the Minister mentioned it and it is a household word in comparison with some of the other even bigger companies which are not.  In any case, it does not figure anywhere there.  Our top 200 companies contain scarcely one that would not fall within the potential provisions of this Bill when enacted.  The Minister is as well aware of the misgivings which the Confederation of Irish Industry have and which the banks and the commentators have in regard to the necessity for a Bill of this kind.  Of course I accept that bodies of that kind cannot be absolved of the suspicion that their judgment is distorted by their own natural and praiseworthy interest and the Government must withstand pressure of that kind; <Col N="691" /> they do not have to take everything handed out by way of even the most carefully argued submission.  At the same time the case made that the thresholds here are too low or that they will bring within the control of the Act too many enterprises that are very small on any world or European standard needs to be carefully met.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that matters could be improved by raising the thresholds. The Minister has been willing to raise the threshold under subsection (2) but, leaving that aside for the moment, I think that under subsection (1), there is a strong case for raising the threshold and for limiting the applicability of the Act also by striking out &ldquo;or&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, the alternative element as between the assets and turnover criteria&mdash;and substituting &ldquo;and&rdquo; which would mean that both companies would have to meet both criteria in regard to assets and turnover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister instanced a public house in 1974 selling for £100,000.  My impression is that even in 1974 when we were so many points further back on the inflation trail £100,000 was by no means the top price being paid for some public houses.  Perhaps there is not actually at the moment a public house at this point in time, as the Minister for Fisheries would say, of which it can be asserted that its gross assets, or a company owning one public house whose gross assets exceed £1.25 million and its gross turnover exceeds £2.5 million.  I believe there is not such a public house in the country but there are many public houses in the country whose assets and turnover&mdash;again borrowing a phrase from the Fianna Fáil benches, one of Deputy Colley's&mdash;would be in that order of magnitude.  I think that would be fair to say.  Even if we have inflation even at the rate which the Coalition last year predicted and for which the Fianna Fáil Government are now trying to seek credit, even at that somewhat improved rate in common with the rest of the world, I can well imagine that some of these barnlike public houses on the Dublin or Limerick outskirts will be within these <Col N="692" /> thresholds.  Most certainly, if they are applied alternatively, one or other of these thresholds will be overstepped if that is not already the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced a quarter hour ago for the purpose of showing the absurdity of the proposition the idea that the acquisition by Guinness of a public house would be subject to the Act.  Even his Bill will produce the same absurdity; if not now, obviously within a measurably short time.  Without using strong language against the Bill, which is in substance the same as the National Coalition Bill, I think we will make ourselves seem very foolish if we apply mergers and monopolies control legislation to acquisitions of this kind.  Supermarkets which are supposed to be the targets of this legislation, or at least at the moment appear to be the most likely targets, undoubtedly have crossed those thresholds and while I support the idea of not allowing concentrations of retailing and distributing capital in such a way as to be harmful to the public interest and the consumer&mdash;I completely support it as does everybody in my party and everybody in the Labour Party&mdash; the Minister should ask himself whether these thresholds in the measure, in the light of what I have been saying are still not a bit too low.</P>
    <P>I shall end what I want to say about these amendments by saying that if he is aiming at inhibiting the preemption or absorption by supermarket chains of more and more of the retailing capacity and distributing capacity of the country and the cornering of more and more of that market by them to the consequent detriment of the consumer who will then have nowhere else to go if their prices go up, we should have a special Bill on that particular matter.  I cannot see why there should be this cumbersome machinery which will draw in all kinds of operations, harmless operations which I know the Minister will also regard as harmless and which I am sure his Department will nod through as soon as they arrive on the table. But if what he is aiming at now is to inhibit the encroachment of a small number of interests in a particular retailing and distributing field, we <Col N="693" /> should have a Bill which says that or provision inside this Bill which exempts other types of operation of which the simple instance put in my mind by the Minister himself is the public house whose value and turnover will very shortly exceed the limits which these sections envisage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the proposed disjunctive amendment in No. 15 because an enormous number of transactions would be excluded by it.  I do not want to get into a political argument with Deputy Kelly in connection with this but he seems to be very irate about the low thresholds here now.  They are two-and-a-half times higher than his own Minister proposed only four years ago.  God knows inflation was bad enough in the meantime but it was not two-and-a-half times&mdash;whatever that is in percentage terms&mdash;and if all this is so wrong today it must have been at least twice as wrong, if you take inflation out of it, four years ago.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about the feelings of business interests.  I accept that they have made the comment that he has made.  But there is also the public interest. I must think about it and I think my predecessor was thinking of the public interest also.  My job and that of the House, I suggest, is to try to balance the two interests as fairly as possible.  That is what will be done. I worry that some people might feel, as a result of what Deputy Kelly and perhaps others say, that every proposed merger will run into awful difficulties in Kildare Street; that the proposers will be arguing for days and hours with civil servants for weeks on end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I envisage, as I said before, that the vast majority, well over 90 per cent of these proposals, will literally go through in a matter of days and certainly in not more than a week or so. Indeed, we will be encouraging the great majority of them.  It is not just a question of allowing them in a grudging way, we will encourage them because they are in the interests of  <Col N="694" /> here.  There are a small number who potentially would not be.  We want to have powers that would enable the Minister of the day, in the public interest, to stop one or more of the very small minority of proposals that would not be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in order to ensure that one has adequate powers one has to cast one's net fairly widely.  It would be preferable if one could be sure of stopping the undesirable ones without casting one's net so widely but one cannot do that.  It causes a certain amount of administrative work in order to be sure but as far as the individual companies are concerned there will be very little in it because they will get approval within a short time.  I would envisage one week or two in most cases.  As a token of my good intent in this respect in the course of later amendments I have reduced the potential maximum period.  I cannot reduce it below what I intend reducing it but I have reduced it substantially. It should be remembered that it was nine months under the 1974 Bill and that is now being reduced to three months maximum.  A few cases will take the full three months and for that reason I cannot reduce below that period.  As far as the ordinary ones are concerned they should be through within a matter of a week or two, and in most cases within a matter of days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said, that it is our job to try to balance the public good and what the business community see as being in the interests of their members.  On reflection, the thresholds in the 1974 Bill were much too low and these ones are also too low.  If one considers the number of businesses that have assets or turnover of that amount one will find that we are talking of only about eight or ten hotels in Dublin city.  I would imagine that the cost of the construction of a bedroom in a hotel at the moment is about £20,000 and, therefore, any hotel with up to 60 bedrooms will be subject to this Bill. We must try to devise legislation that seeks to eradicate possible abuses and at the same time not to bring within <Col N="695" /> its scope a lot of people who for many reasons want to keep their business private and to conduct their affairs without any interference from the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, and I accept this, that probably 90 per cent of these proposed mergers will be &ldquo;nodded through&rdquo;&mdash;as Deputy Kelly said&mdash;and will certainly go through in a matter of weeks.  Members of business organisations have made the point to me that it is possible that within that couple of weeks where there is a question of shares involved in a public company and shares could change radically in value.  That is something that must be remembered by big companies. Where a merger is desirable, and in 90 per cent of cases small mergers will be desirable because they should bring about more efficiency in many areas, it will not take place if the value of shares changes greatly in a short period of time.  The more people we exclude, without doing damage to the public interest, from the scope of this legislation the better. Fewer businesses will come within the scope of the Bill on the assets end of it than on turnover.  A turnover of £250,000 is not enormous nowadays.  It is reasonably big as far as Ireland is concerned but on a European scale it is very small.  There are many firms in the private sector here&mdash;when we talk about industry in Ireland we tend to think of the public quoted companies; the list that appears annually of the top 100 companies&mdash;who would have a turnover more than that figure they will come within the scope of the Bill.  I do not think it was the Minister's intention to bring such companies within the scope of the Bill but because of the thresholds now proposed they will be subject to an application to the Department if they want permission to merge.</P>

I do not recall how much he proposed to increase those thresholds by but the Minister's predecessor had responded to the arguments raised by the then Opposition and, I presume, by outside interests.  I accept that the Minister has to strike a balance between the public interest and the interests of business organisations.  The Minister feels that his thresholds at present are the right level, except in the case of his own amendment, No. 17.</P>

I should like to draw attention to the fact that in subsection (2) the figure of £750,000 is three times what it was in the 1974 Bill.  I now propose to double that again which will make it six times what it was in the 1974 Bill.  That figure applies only to the monopolies aspect.  That figure, and the other two, can be increased by me by order at any time under a later sub-section. I would envisage making those orders pretty regularly.  I think it will <Col N="697" /> be necessary to make them pretty regularly. It will depend to a great extent on the rate of inflation.  Happily it is now one-third of what it was a couple of years ago.  The need will be less, perhaps, than it might have been in the past, but nonetheless, it will at least keep up with inflation.</P>

      <P>I want to say something about subsection (5).  I considered putting down an amendment but in the end I thought I would not until I heard what the Minister had to say about it, and I will put down an amendment on Report Stage if it seems necessary.</P>
      <P>This subsection has the effect of relieving the Minister from all threshold control of the kind which the foregoing subsections of the same section envisage in a particular case.  Where he is of opinion that the exigencies of the common good so warrant, he can declare by order that, notwithstanding subsection (1), the Act shall apply to a proposed merger or takeover of a particular class specified in the order and, upon the making of such an order, this Act shall apply to a proposed merger or takeover of that class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, if I understand, sub-section (5) enables the Minister in particular cases, or a particular class of cases, to bring them, by his own certain knowledge, special grace and mere motion, under the provisions of the Act, notwithstanding the fact that neither of the concerns reaches any of the thresholds subsection (1) lays down. I notice that the expression &ldquo;the exigencies of the common good&rdquo;&mdash;and <Col N="698" /> it was in the Minister's predecessor's Bill as well&mdash;is cogged straight from Article 43 of the Constitution, which declares that the Oireachtas can make inroads on ordinary property rights in response to the exigencies of the common good.  Of course there must be a right of cutting down property rights in any country like this if the common good so requires.</P>
    <P>I do not like this kind of legislation. I feel in the departmental mind, in the Minister's mind, and in his predecessor's mind, there was a certain kind of transaction.  This is a bad way of doing business.  I am afraid it is one which is characteristic of a great deal of the way business is done in this country: to achieve an objective which you feel it would be disagreeable or embarrassing to speak about in so many words and to do it by a route you hope will avoid notice.  I want to make it clear I am not accusing the Minister, or his Department, or his predecessor, of that overt mental operation, but that is the effect of this proposal.</P>
    <P>If the Government were anxious to inhibit the merger of newspapers, or the acquisition by a newspaper magnate of provincial newspapers or national newspapers, and so on, nobody will be more strongly behind them than I and, I believe, the rest of the party to which I belong.  I am completely in favour of having as many voices speak within the four corners of the law, as often as they can, and as much as they can, and of letting people read as many views as they can.  I am completely against the progressive acquisition of newspapers, whether provincial or national, or the unification under one set of hands, or by one interest, of modes of communication.  I absolutely accept&mdash;and, even if the Minister were not inclined to say it, I would say it&mdash;that the distribution of opinions and news is an operation which is ostensibly just the provision of another service, a capitalist operation, but which has got a dimension which is over and above that&mdash;a very important dimension about which I do not need to read the House a lecture.</P>
    <P>If that is what the Bill is aiming at, if that is what is in the departmental <Col N="699" /> mind at the moment, we should say it. I should like to hear the Minister on the subject of why we cannot be told in so many words in the middle of this Bill, where it is very appropriate, that the thresholds do not apply to a certain type of acquisition, or merger, or take-over, notwithstanding the fact that the monetary element of the enterprises involved may not meet the threshold. I refer to the acquisition or takeover of newspaper enterprises or, if the Minister wishes to look forward to the day when there will be more than one broadcasting station on the air, when there will be independent radio or television, the acquisition of one such station or another.  Any such acquisitions, therefore, would be within ministerial control, within the control of this Bill, notwithstanding the fact that the financial threshold were not being met.</P>
    <P>That is the right way to do it.  If it turns out subsequently to be the case that some other form of commercial activity arises which has a public interest dimension&mdash;I cannot now think offhand what it might be; perhaps there will be one&mdash;over and above its economic or business dimension which is of clear public interest, where the exigencies of the common good clearly require that it should be under control, where serious public interests are being done a disservice by permitting amalgamations and by permitting the concentrations of whatever function is involved in one set of hands, let us have another Bill. The Dáil sits every week except during the recess.  I do not believe it can be the case that any serious situation would arise which could not be remedied rapidly.  I should far prefer to see it done that way if, in fact, that is what is in the departmental mind, rather than to give the Minister what is on the face of it a blanket discretion to ignore the thresholds altogether on a quite arbitrary reading of his own of what the exigencies of the common good require.</P>
    <P>I am not at all opposed to the thresholds being waived or disregarded in certain special cases, but those special cases should be enumerated.  It should <Col N="700" /> not be left open to the Minister from time to time, perhaps in a set of circumstances which no one in this House envisages or possibly could envisage, to bring within the control of this Bill operations which on the financial criteria are completely outside it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's view on the submission which undoubtedly he will have received and which we in the Opposition parties have also received from the Incorporated Law Society.  In relation to subsection (5) they used a style of language which requires a response from the Minister.  They said:</P>
      <P>We consider that the extensive power given to the Minister under this paragraph to ignore at his will the thresholds, is unreasonable and arbitrary.  It will create continuous uncertainty in our industrial and commercial life.  It has no precedent in the Restrictive Trade Practices Legislation.  The section will have very serious consequences in practice and in the Society's view is unwarranted. With a paragraph of this nature incorporated in the Bill there would appear to be no reason for having the thresholds at all.  We strongly oppose this paragraph which encroaches on the rights and liberties of the citizens of our State.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on that.  Our party had the Bill examined.  We consulted with the previous Minister.  We favour the sub-section. Situations could develop in which the ramifications were such, and the complexities of the operations were such, that the Minister should have power to make an order for the common good.  I accept that but, having received the submission from the Incorporated Law Society in language of that nature, I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on the subject.</P>

      <P>This subsection is precisely as it was in the 1974 Bill and I have checked on that.  There are changes made in other sections but this one has not been changed at all.  Apart from other earlier changes, there is a significant change in the following subsection, the one about the order which the <Col N="701" /> Minister would make in order to bring subsection 4 into effect.  Whereas before the Minister would make an order bringing subsection 4 into effect and it would remain in effect unless a resolution annulling it were passed by either House of the Oireachtas within 21 days, the position now is that when an order is made it will lapse unless it is confirmed by an affirmative resolution of both Houses. The result is that whereas before the Oireachtas had only slight, if any, control over the situation and only a limited power to discuss it, they now have an absolute right to discuss it in full.  Any improper usage by the Minister of the powers in the section will be the subject of full debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>For that reason, the Incorporated Law Society should not feel that the powers would be abused or that they are too wide.  Obviously they would be used only in quite exceptional circumstances. The Minister would have to go into both Houses with a confirmatory motion in support of his order and there would be a heavy onus on him to satisfy both Houses that there were exceptional circumstances in which the public interest demanded that he should intervene.</P>
      <P>I do not deny that one of these circumstances would relate to the control of newspapers.  There have been some developments in recent times in relation to the acquisition of newspapers about which many people are apprehensive.  I am not entirely happy about certain things that have happened in relation to the control and acquisition of newspapers and I could envisage a situation in which I would use these powers, and ask the Oireachtas to confirm them, in relation to newspapers if certain events were to happen in the future.  I might well be justified in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly suggested that I and my predecessor should have spelled out these classes of cases in which the Minister would intervene in the public interest.  It would be wrong to limit legislation to specific classes.  The question of the control of newspapers may be topical today but in years to <Col N="702" /> come there may be other matters of equal importance.  At the moment one could think, for example, of oil companies here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>But these would be over the thresholds.  The Minister said that earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps small distribution ones.  Another instance where it might be necessary to intervene if the transaction were under the threshold would be where a large company were involved in a mopping-up operation and had decided to buy up a lot of small companies, all of whom were below the threshold.  They might decide not to do this as a &ldquo;once off&rdquo; operation but to buy up every small company in that business and we would find ourselves faced with a situation in which, because all the companies were small, the Act would not apply to any act, acquisition or takeover.  The situation might become dangerous and there could be the possibility of a monopoly being created and there would not be any competition in a particular area as a result of this acquisition by one company of a large number of small companies.</P>
      <P>I have given three instances.  My predecessor took the view, as I do, that it would not be right to spell out here in legislation the sort of cases where one would intervene.  Things we know nothing about or which would not cause concern today might be the cause of public anxiety in two or three years' time.  It would be wrong to tie down the use of the subsection in a way which would not allow one to deal with major problems in years to come.</P>
      <P>There is a major safeguard in this Bill which was not in the previous Bill, namely, that an affirmative or positive motion must be passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  A motion did not have to be passed under the 1974 Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the affirmative resolution machinery is a safeguard and I accept that the Minister has no sinister intentions in his mind, no more than his predecessor had.  My colleagues and I have to deal with this <Col N="703" /> Bill as if it were the first time it arrived in the House.  No one on this side of the House would be doing his job if he accepted everything in the Bill merely because is resembled or was identical to the Bill of the Minister's predecessor, whom we supported. We have to treat it as if we were seeing it for the first time.</P>
      <P>In regard to the matter of newspapers, the Minister has not produced any other immediate instances.  I do not blame him for that.  I cannot see why we cannot say that newspapers are within this Act, or will be when it becomes an Act.  For all I know there may be negotiations going on at this minute, which may be reaching a stage of completion, for the acquisition of a newspaper by another group and the reduction, therefore, by one of the number of independent voices in the country.  I cannot see why we should not give notice in the Bill that this kind of operation, irrespective of the financial thresholds, will be within the Act, in advance of the Minister and his Department getting around to making an order.</P>

      <P>No.  The Minister has said that he agrees that newspapers are the most conspicuous instance of the kind of merger operation of which he would take a poor view and which he might be inclined to bring within the Act.  That requires the making of an order.  It is not any answer to say that Senator Keating did not do it.  I cannot see why this cannot be stipulated in the Bill and the reduction in the number of independent newspapers subjected to ministerial control, so that everybody will know about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought of putting down an amendment but I refrained from doing so because I wanted to hear the Minister.  He mentioned oil companies, which he had previously instanced as companies which would be caught in any case because of their size.  When I mentioned that to him he referred to small distributing companies. It seems at first blush to be quite a marginal hypothesis and I will not bother with it.  He gave a very curious instance of something which he might wish by order to bring under the Act, namely, the acquisition by a large company of a series of small companies, all of them falling below the threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newspaper matter is one thing, but an oil company is another matter. These are instances that are defined by reference to their economic function. We can understand the sense of trying to prevent newspaper amalgamations and so on, but the Minister's last instance was not defined by reference to the functional status of these companies. I do not want to raise a scare but what the Minister has said must raise the idea in some people's minds that, notwithstanding the words of the IDA, of the Minister and of his Department to the effect that they would like to encourage beneficial mergers, that even in that process there is a limit beyond which one cannot go without risking the making of a ministerial order.  In other words, even a company that is not operating in an area that is sensitive for some reason&mdash;for instance, newspapers&mdash;if it goes about acquiring small interests it may find itself brought in under this measure notwithstanding the fact that the assets or turnover of the servient companies do not pass the thresholds.  This is not a satisfactory way of dealing with this matter.  I should prefer the Minister to express his fears in a concrete way by introducing amendments that would <Col N="705" /> have the effect of waiving the threshold requirement in connection with newspapers and also in connection with multiple acquisitions of firms that are below the thresholds.</P>
    <P>No doubt there are other Members in the House who know more about this from personal experience than I do. The subsection states that the order will have the effect of applying the measure to a proposed merger or take-over. We have defined the word &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; by agreement in the sense that we both had amendments tabled to the same effect.  A merger is now proposed under the Bill as it stands when an offer capable of acceptance has been made.  What is the situation if a merger takes place quietly?  Suppose the Minister finds himself with a <i>fait accompli</i> in regard to the acquisition of a newspaper?  Where is his order then?  The merger is no longer proposed; it is concluded.  Whatever his powers may be under other legislation, so far as this Bill goes the Minister does not seem to me to have any power to break up that merger once it has taken place.  I point out such a case not in a contentious way but to spell out that it is far better to bring such cases under the scope of the Bill now so that they will know where they stand.  Otherwise they can defeat the Minister's intention so far as it bears on newspapers by carrying out the merger quietly behind closed doors so that the first the Minister hears of it is when he reads it in his morning newspaper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to elaborate on this matter before we adjourn at 1.30 p.m.  In the other point made by the CII in their submission they said it was not clear whether the Minister without inhibition can decide to overrule the commission's views and make an order independently.  They also stated it was not clear what kind of power is being vested in the Minister without prejudice to the validity of anything done previously.  They went on to say there was no provision in the Bill for appeal to the courts except on a point of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the section but I am worried about the requirement which <Col N="706" /> I think should be developed on the Minister to state his opinion.  The Minister may make an order and it may be a very bland order.  There are many industries and services engaged in an area in which an order could be made quite legitimately.  It is not just confined to newspapers; in this connection we could talk about the licensed trade, the theatre and the cinema and about certain take-overs in the wholesale distribution companies. There is a wide range of services and industries in practice that could come within the ambit of the orders being made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Such is the suspicious nature of industry towards that form of power that there does not seem to be any obligation on the Minister to state his opinion.  It just makes provision for a situation that where he is of the opinion he may make the order.  Presumably in a public statement subsequently he would have to give his reasons.  Personally I should like to see some obligation developing on the Minister to indicate clearly why the order was being made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have to justify it to both Houses because it would have to be passed by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister inserted that section with tongue in cheek.  The Government have a majority of 20 and the Minister will not be caused any undue worry about the order.  While the order must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas with a confirming resolution, in practice the Minister could make a three line statement and leave it at that.  Issues of that nature have such profound implications that very often the advice given to the Minister is that the less said the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the submission of the CII in relation to this matter, I should like the Minister to elaborate on it.  I do not share their view but it should be dealt with in the House.  They stated that these provisions would place businesses in a hopelessly arbitrary position, subject to quite indeterminate criteria and would give the Minister wide-ranging and unpredictable powers. <Col N="707" /> Presumably the Minister will be exercising these powers in the years ahead &mdash;he may not be elected Taoiseach but at least presumably he will remain Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy for the next few years.  It is as well that these objections be teased out although personally I do not share them.  In fact, if this section were not included I would not have had a great deal of time for the measure overall. Perhaps the Minister will elaborate somewhat further with regard to the CII objections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot use his powers under this section if he does not know about a merger. As Deputy Kelly has pointed out, some companies could surreptitiously get the whole business through before the Minister became aware of it and there is nothing that can be done about that. The only way anything could be done is to take away the thresholds and make every merger subject to control but that would be unreasonable and unwarranted.</P>
      <P>Subsections (5) and (6) of section 2 within these limitations try to give some power to the Minister in the public interest to exercise control over sensitive areas, and it is reasonable that the Minister should have that power.  It should not be assumed by the CII or anyone else that any Minister would arbitrarily exercise those powers.  He would not last very long if he exercised them improperly.  Whatever about winning divisions, having to come in to this House and justify what one has done is a significant control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on what a person is doing.  The Bill would be much weakened if it did not contain a provision of this kind.  What I have not considered yet&mdash;because I think it is premature&mdash;is what orders I might make under the section if and when it is passed.  I believe the first candidates for making an order under this section would be the newspaper industry. I do not believe they would be the only ones.  There might be others and there might not.  It depends on developments <Col N="708" /> in the commercial and industrial life and the needs of the public as they develop over the next few years.  I understand it was contemplated having a section devoted to newspapers only but it was considered on reflection over a long period that newspapers are not the only sensitive area where control of this kind at fairly short notice might be needed in the public interest.  I believe the right decision was taken not to confine a section of this kind simply to newspapers but to allow other potential areas to be covered also.</P>
      <P>There is the problem that until I make the order there are certain transactions which may well escape.  Mergers will take place and they will be completed or have gone to the stage that one cannot do anything about them before the Minister gets to hear about them.  Even if he disapproves of them he would be impotent at that stage to do anything about them.  That is something we have to live with.  The alternative is to cover every merger of every kind.  I believe that would be unreasonable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 6, after line 52, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Nothing in this Act shall prevent any enterprise or enterprises from seeking, or the Minister from giving, an indication of the Minister's view of a suggested merger or take-over in advance of its being proposed (within the meaning of this Act); and a favourable expression of his view by the Minister in such advance consultation shall be a factor which shall bind the Minister, if a proposed merger or take-over in the terms suggested is thereafter notified to him under this section, not to make an order such as is envisaged by section 10 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to make formal what I understand to be the Minister's intention.  I have the impression, from a couple of things he said, that his intention is to permit the Department to interview confidentially or correspond confidentially with people who are contemplating a merger and to give them an informal green light which would not relieve them from the obligation of notifying the merger but which would for practical purposes ensure that they would be given a go-ahead formally within a minimum time thereafter.  If that is the official intention it is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> The amendment is an attempt to put this operation on a formal basis, rather than an informal basis.  I tried to draft it in such a way as to suggest that there might be an informal consultation between the interests involved and the Minister in advance of the moment when a proposer merger, within the meaning of the Act, comes about, in other words when the parties are still talking about terms and things like that, that is before a formal proposed merger such as would oblige notification arises.  The object is to try to put the Minister in a situation that if he or his Department have given the green light to his suggestions in advance of the moment when the proposed merger in the strict sense of the Act arises there is no way of going back on that, in other words, leaving the parties in a situation of having proposed something in the expectation that it would be ratified officially and they now find that a different attitude is being taken.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility for fire safety in public buildings rests with the authorities or persons owning or operating them.  The enforcement of conditions that may be attached by the courts to premises which are subject to licensing by them, such as dance halls and premises used for public singing, music or other entertainment, would be a matter for the Garda.</P>
      <P>So far as my Department and local authorities are concerned the local authorities have wide powers of inspection and control in respect of potentially dangerous buildings under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  Returns indicate that some 7,600 fire safety inspections were carried out in 1976.</P>
      <P>The local authorities have been urged on numerous occasions to intensify their fire prevention work and this, as well as all other aspects of the local fire service, is now being reviewed locally as part of the general examination of the state of the service which local authorities have been asked to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see fire prevention work stepped up considerably and I <Col N="712" /> will be considering in the light of the reviews whether there are any steps open to me to assist local authorities in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the applicant's income, when he applied, was down to £1,900 per annum and that he should have been entitled to a grant under the old scheme?  I am asking the Minister to have this matter reviewed in his Department to ensure that this man is granted the old grant of £325.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the person in question is not entitled to the grant under the legislation which applied at the time of his application. An application was received on 7 March 1977 in this case for a new house grant under the scheme then in <Col N="715" /> operation introduced by the former Government on 1 January 1976 which confined such grants to persons eligible, on an income or valuation basis, for supplementary grants from local authorities.  In May 1977 the local authority concerned, Roscommon County Council, certified the applicant's income at £2,833 which exceeded the maximum annual income of £2,350 allowable; that was £1,950 plus £400 for each dependant.  Last November a £1,000 new house grant application was received for the same house.  This was rejected in January 1978 because work had commenced before 27 May 1977.  In fact work started in February 1977, and this is not at issue.  The applicant may have been misled by some press reports but the position is that work started in February 1977 and he did not qualify under the former scheme on the grounds of eligibility for income purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7 together.  In accordance with a pre-election commitment, I eliminated the 1977 application period for new licences for small public service vehicles used for public hire in the taxi-meter areas of Dublin and Cork in order to allow for a review of licensing procedures before the next application period in September 1978. As regards the issue of licences in Limerick, which is not a taximeter area, I have received representations from a number of sources expressing concern as to the effect of a number of licences issued in 1977.  However, I have no power under the Road Traffic Acts to put a limit on the number of licences which may be granted by the Garda Commissioner, nor have I power to revoke licences already issued.  Pending the outcome of the review I have referred to, it would be inappropriate to comment further on any of the aspects of the subject referred to in the Deputies' questions.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together. Educational release for apprentices was provided for in the AnCO proposals for a new apprenticeship scheme published in October 1975.  These proposals had as their objective the provision of more effective training for apprentices both by way of formal instruction and on-the-job experience. After widespread discussion and consultation with the relevant interests, these proposals were adopted and the new apprenticeship scheme came into operation on 1 October 1976.</P>
      <P>One of the provisions of that scheme was that apprentices would be released to the vocational education sector for formal instruction for at least one day per week during the academic year of 36 weeks or, alternatively, be provided with such formal instruction on block release for an equivalent period during the first three years of their apprenticeship. The question of the appropriate educational release for apprentices is now being reviewed by officers of the Department of Education, my Department and of AnCO.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if there has been a change of policy by AnCO, in relation to the use of regional technical colleges for <Col N="720" /> training purposes; if so, why the change was made; if sections of some colleges, specially built for training purposes, are unused at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change of policy by AnCO in relation to the use of regional technical colleges for training purposes.  It continues to be AnCO's policy in consultation with the Department of Education to use whatever appropriate facilities are available in the educational sector.  Indeed at present discussions are taking place between AnCO and my Department and the Department of Education in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that statements have been made by various interested groups in the educational sector to the effect that there are spare facilities in some regional technical colleges but the Department of Education have not made any statement to this effect.  I would also like to give the Deputy an idea about some of the uses presently being made of facilities in the vocational schools and colleges: for example, the provision of courses of technical education for about 10,000 apprentices each year either on day release or block release courses; fulltime off-the-job training for about 72 apprentices in the following colleges&mdash;the College of Technology, Bolton Street, Moyross Technical College, Limerick, Letterkenny Regional Technical College and Cork Regional Technical College, all providing special courses for apprentices on a block release basis for apprentices who become unemployed or redundant, together with the provision of special courses aimed at career orientation for young persons who have left school and are seeking their first job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations are currently taking place between the management of AnCO and the Workers' Union of Ireland on a productivity agreement, an element of which would be the ratio between the number of instructors and apprentices at AnCO training centres.  Pending the conclusion of these negotiations, it would not be appropriate for me to elaborate on the proposed agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for the Minister to give a blank figure in a situation like this on the lines of the primary school 30 children per teacher?  Is it possible to say what is the optimum figure in the AnCO situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It varies between skills.  A balance has to be struck between an economic ratio and a practical ratio.  To give an example, in some skills it may be one instructor to 12 trainees and in other cases it may vary.  In motor mechanics and special types of welding the ratio is lower&mdash;one to eight or one to six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not be impeded in any way by lack of finance in achieving the optimum in his negotiations with the unions who are concerned with productivity agreements but ultimately, presumably, the Minister hopes for what he considers to be the optimum ratio in each trade. Will he be inhibited in any way by lack of finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect not.  Pending the conclusion of these <Col N="722" /> negotiations I would not like to make any statement on it, but my desire would be that it should be economically acceptable and practically beneficial to the apprentices and the trainees concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that two young men (details supplied) from the Connemara Gaeltacht, County Galway, whose home and school language is exclusively Irish, felt themselves disadvantaged in their interviews for AnCO training schemes, because their suitability interview was not conducted in the Irish language; and the steps he intends to take to end this clear discrimination against young people from the Connemara Gaeltacht seeking training in a new skill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed that the two young men in question were given an aptitude test but failed to reach the qualifying mark and therefore did not undergo an interview.</P>
      <P>The tests which are now applied to assess the suitability of applicants for participation in AnCO training courses were devised outside this country and are used internationally.  There is no Irish version of these tests at present available but I have given instructions that a substitute test in the Irish language should be devised.  Discussions on this are proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that statement. It seems most unfair that young people whose families persist in using Irish and will not use English should be discriminated against in this way. What is the position about young people of this kind?  Will they have to wait until new tests in Irish are ready?  Can it be assumed that they failed the aptitude test because of difficulties with the language?  From personal knowledge of these boys I can assure the Minister that this is more than likely true.  Can they have another go at the aptitude test as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the reasons for their failure in the aptitude test.  I do not think it appropriate that AnCO should inform me <Col N="723" /> why any student failed such a test.  If the Deputy has a particular belief and if that is the position, there is one possible option open, that is, the Gweedore centre in the Gaeltacht area. I will certainly review the position of what advantage it would be to those young people to have a second chance at an aptitude test in Galway or the Gaeltacht training centre in Gweedore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there is operating in the Connemara Gaeltacht area a number of mobile training centres.  I understand these courses can be given in Irish or English, depending on what the majority in a class opt for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was: in the AnCO course in Galway will there be lectures in Irish for people whose language is exclusively Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the difficulties there may be for an organisation like AnCO to have two separate courses, one in Irish and one in English.  From an overall efficiency point of view the more desirable thing would be to have such a course in one or the other language.  In the mobile centres used in the Connemara area this facility is available on a majority basis of the class numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware of the criticism made by the chairman of the Construction Industry Federation in relation to the AnCO apprenticeship scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the recent Press statement made by the president of the Construction Industry Federation in relation to the training of apprentices in that industry involving criticism of AnCO in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also seen the statement issued by the director general of AnCO in <Col N="724" /> response to that criticism and I am fully satisfied from inquiries I have made that the position is as stated by the director general.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also have read the Press report of a recent statement on this matter by the chairman of the apprentice committee of the College of Technology, Kevin Street, Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the contents of the statement of the president of the Construction Industry Federation were very serious. The president implied that there were vacancies for up to 1,400 apprentices in the building industry but for the neglect of AnCO.  Would the Minister care to comment on that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have also seen the statement by the director general. In 1977 alone AnCO spent £1.2 million on training nearly 400 apprentices for the construction industry.  In those circumstances, and with that contribution to training, it seems an unfair criticism.  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to a statement by the chairman of the Committee of the College of Technology, Kevin Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to the statement by the director general of AnCO, he does not say that what the president of the Construction Industry Federation said was untrue.  He does not deny that there are up to 1,400 vacancies for apprentices in the construction industry.  I want to know from this Minister, who is responsible for creating jobs, what he has done to rectify that situation, whoever is to blame?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is saying that any situation has to be rectified or that anybody is to blame.  I am pointing out the facts of the situation. Other industries recruit and train their own apprentices to meet their future needs at their own expense with the assistance of AnCO.  In this case a very substantial sum of money was spent in 1977 for training 400 apprentices for the building and construction industry and this will continue.  I believe AnCO are providing a very useful service to the building industry.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office is the official agency responsible for the compilation and publication of statistics including dispute statistics.  As the Deputy is aware from the Taoiseach's reply to a parliamentary question on 2 May, statistics are not available in that office concerning industrial disputes which occurred in the first months of 1978.</P>
      <P>My Department estimates, however, that approximately 194,000 man-days were lost during the period 1 January30 April 1978.  Of this figure an estimated 141,000 man-days were attributable to the Aer Lingus and telecommunications disputes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of workers made redundant as a result of the closure of the Ferenka factory was 1,367.  The National Manpower Service offered their services to all the redundant workers concerned and 250 of them registered with the service in the Limerick area.  Of these 88 have been placed in employment.  The total redundancy figure included 103 craftsmen and all of these have since found alternative employment.  There were 49 apprentices and all but a few of these have been placed in jobs or taken into AnCO training centres to continue their training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I must correct the Deputy.  I am sure the Deputy can appreciate that I do not have information on all of them but the National Manpower Service offered their services to all the redundant workers and 250 of them registered and of those 250, 88 people were placed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

They have 88 people who as far as they are aware have been re-employed.  Is this not a scandalous failure on the part of the Government not to seek more energetically some firm to take over this Ferenka disaster and do something about it?

Would the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy make a joint statement appealing to the employers to give work to these people?

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Industrial Relations Acts the function of determining minimum rates of pay and other conditions of employment for agricultural workers is assigned to the Labour Court, which deals with the matter through employment regulation orders made on the proposals of the Joint Labour Committee <Col N="735" /> for Agricultural Workers.  The current employment regulation order was made on 23 January 1978.  The order provides for normal working hours of 42½ per week but does not lay down the number of days in the normal working week.</P>
    <P>The safety, health and welfare legislation for which my Department are responsible does not extend to agricultural workers.  The employment incentive scheme has applied to the agricultural sector since it was introduced in February 1977.  In fact, up to 28 April 1978 applications to participate in the scheme have been received from 388 employers in agriculture in respect of about 460 employees.  To date, 245 employers have received payments under the scheme in respect of about 290 workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Mitchell</b> asked the Minister for Labour when he proposes to introduce the necessary legislation to outlaw discrimination against women in respect of pension benefits, particularly under the headings of eligibility, retirement age and scale of pension benefit which in all cases show a clear bias against the right of women to have equality of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, which provides for equal remuneration for light work and which defines remuneration as including any consideration of cash or in kind which an employee receives, directly or indirectly, in respect of his employment from his employer.</P>
      <P>The Act gives the Labour Court a central role in regard to disputes under the Act.  In a recent case, the Labour Court determined&mdash;in accordance with its function under section 8 (1) of the Act&mdash;that pension benefits come within the definition of remuneration in the Act.</P>
      <P>Under section 8 (3) of the Act there is a right of appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  No such appeal has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> In the circumstances the need for new legislation does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of research work carried out by the Irish Pensions Trust on behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions early this year which indicated that under the headings outlined in the question there was and is a clear bias against equality of treatment for women in regard to their pensions?  Would he be good enough to consider this and see how he could ameliorate or get rid completely of any such bias as exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the practical difficulties that arise in implementation of the Act.  It appears, from what I have said in the reply, that there is not a need for legislation.  The legislation does cover the pension, but I am aware that there are practical difficulties of implementation that basically are a matter for solution between the employer and the employee.  I am talking of, for example, the different retirement age for a man and a woman. There are practical problems but I am not convinced, and I do not believe that legislation is the answer in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the Minister's superior knowledge in regard to the necessity for legislation although it is obviously a fact that anomalies, if one can call them that, exist.  Would the Minister be good enough to investigate this problem and see if whatever influence he can bring to bear might be used with regard to the criteria of eligibility for retirement, scale of pension benefits and death benefits, for example, which show a clear bias against women in regard to their pension rights.  I should be grateful if the Minister were willing to have a look at that.</P>

Has the Minister any powers to protect youngsters in these dreadful situations, selling newspapers, particularly in winter time?  Is that subject to any control by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly cafés and pubs and I believe also the other activity referred to.  A number of complaints of breaches have been received and have been investigated. In addition, the factory inspectorate on their normal inspection of work places investigate or inspect for any breaches under this Act.  A number have been detected and on the assurance by the employers of non-repetition or compliance with the Act prosecutions have not been initiated.  If the Deputy or any Member of the House wishes to bring any complaint of that nature to my attention I can and will have it examined by my inspectorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The decision to establish a Commission on Industrial Relations was communicated by letter to the chairman of the employers' side of the Employer-Labour Conference and to the president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the 18 January 1978.</P>
      <P>The announcement regarding the chairman was made in the manner which appeared to me to be the most appropriate to the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to admit that he mentioned a commission and review body as early as October last year, seven months ago?  That being so, what has held up the setting up of this commission? When will it have its first meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the question is factual.  This was the first official communication with both sides. I would hope to have the first meeting of the commission before the end of this month.  Arrangements are at present in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked the Minister when the decision was made to appoint a review body or commission.  On 9 November the Minister <Col N="739" /> referred to the review body.  What has held up the setting up of the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A commission of this nature is very important and it is also important that both sides of industry be consulted.  They were consulted. Nominations were requested from them.  Nominations have now been received.  Is the Deputy saying that he does not want the commission to operate?  The commission has been named and, hopefully, will be meeting towards the end of this month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall answer the Minister's question with another question: is he aware that since he came into office industrial relations have been in a shambles and that therefore there is an urgency about the setting up of this commission.  If the delay in setting it up is any indication of the speed with which it will report, God help us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to a recent article in the <i>Financial Times</i> on strikes in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="740" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article referred to in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 25 April 1978 regarding industrial disputes here.</P>
      <P>I believe that it presented a misleading picture of the effects of certain strikes and of their impact on the IDA's industrial development programme. It exaggerated the impact of the disputes and was in a number of respects contradictory and inaccurate. The article put a disproportionate emphasis on industrial relations as a factor in the attraction of overseas investment and ignored all the other factors which continue to make this country an attractive location for overseas investment.</P>
      <P>I have already made known to the Press my views on the article in question and I understand that the IDA have written to the newspaper refuting in detail the allegations in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister commenced replying to that question I understood the Chair to accept a supplementary from Deputy Mitchell because of the fact that two questions were involved.  As Deputy Mitchell was about to put a supplementary question to the Minister on the second question the Minister read his reply to Question No. 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I had already permitted four supplementaries.  The Deputy was on his feet asking questions repeatedly and he spoke for a lengthy period without putting a question. I cannot condone the device of using a preamble to a question to make a speech.  It is something that must be ruled out at Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but I understood that the Chair had accepted Deputy Mitchell's point of view, that he was entitled to ask a supplementary based on the second question dealt with in the Minister's reply.  It is possible that the Minister did not hear the Chair agreeing with Deputy Mitchell that he was entitled to ask a supplementary.</P>

      <P>In connection with Question No. 25, I should like to ask the Minister, in respect of the announcement of the appointment of the new chairman of the Industrial Relations Commission, if it was due to embarrassment that the Minister did not come before the House because this was his second choice?

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the strikes in which he has personally intervened in since taking up office; the stage in each strike that the intervention was made; and the success with which the intervention met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have intervened directly in one case, the Ferenka dispute. I have also been involved with my colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning the telecommunication dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Ferenka I intervened <Col N="742" /> when it became clear to me that an impasse had been reached.  I made proposals which were not acceptable to all the parties involved.  In the case of the dispute in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, following protracted negotiations involving the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and myself, settlement proposals which were acceptable to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were brought forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. These were accepted by the members of IPOEU in a secret ballot.  Normal working resumed on Monday 8 May.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have repeatedly pointed out that I do not intend to intervene in dispute situations where the institutions established by the Oireachtas are being utilised or can be utilised to produce solutions.  I am satisfied that ill-considered Ministerial intervention represents a threat to those institutions.  I propose to invite the Commission on Industrial Relations to comment on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Acts dealing with industrial relations allow for direct intervention by him, and by the Labour Court, in cases of intractable disputes?  Would the Minister admit that he has had his fair share of intractable disputes since he took office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that this is a particularly difficult question when we have such a high level of healthy people unemployed, but would the Minister consider the desirability of introducing legislation in order to try to establish that a minimum number of disabled people would be employed in the public and private sector?  I am sure he has good wishes and goodwill on this issue, but he must know the only way practically any country has done this is by insisting on a minimum number of jobs being made available for handicapped people.</P>

Now we have a positive target figure there.  I would hope that move would be an encouragement to the private sector.  It is fair to say that many private firms share our concern for handicapped people and give them an opportunity of obtaining employment. I believe encouragement rather than legislation at present is the way to build up a confident feeling that these people should be employed in private industry on a percentage basis, as a percentage of the work force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 2: In page 3, between lines 45 and 46, the following inserted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(8) Where a dispute arises in regard to the apportionment of the rent under subsection (7) (c) (ii), the matter shall be determined under section 17 of the Act of 1967 (which <Col N="758" /> refers to the determination of certain matters by arbitration).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason I am here is that the Minister for Justice was dealing with other legislation in this House and he asked me to pilot this legislation through the Seanad, which I did.  We will have to leave it to the historians to decide whether it was successful or otherwise.  It passed through all Stages in the Seanad.  Basically this amendment is in conformity with an amendment proposed by the Opposition in the Seanad.  It gives effect to a lacuna or a void in section 2.  Effectively it is an additional subsection.  It was brought forward for discussion in the Seanad by Senator Cooney and Senator Molony.  This amendment is now before the Dáil to give effect to their wish.</P>
    <P>If there are any details Deputy O'Keeffe would like to raise, within my competence I would be glad to deal with them.  This amendment gives effect to an Opposition amendment in the Seanad&mdash;more or less; I do not want to mislead Deputy O'Keeffe or the House, it is not in direct or exact conformity with what was desired&mdash; which was withdrawn on the undertaking that an amendment would be introduced in this House.</P>

      <P>Section 2: In page 3, between lines 45 and 46, the following inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) In subsection (7), references to a sublease or sublessee include, where appropriate, references to an assignment and to an assignee, his personal representatives and successors in title.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> This amendment relates to subsection (7) of section 2.  I understand it was inserted by an official amendment on Committee Stage in this House. Deputy O'Keeffe may have been the proposer of the amendment and he would have a greater knowledge than I of the history of the amendment proposed on Committee Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The amendment was designed to cater for a situation the possibility of which was raised in the course of considering observations furnished by the Incorporated Law Society.  Subsection (7) provides that where a lease made after the Bill becomes law is rendered void under subsection (3) because of the building of houses on part of the land, a sublease of the remainder of the land on which no houses have been built will not be rendered void, and the sublessee will become the direct lessee of the lessor who gave the terminated lease.  In logic, even if not in law, that seems a reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>I understand this conforms with an Opposition amendment in the Seanad and is almost on all fours with it.  We say it is more or less perfecting the proper amendment put forward by Senator Cooney and Senator Molony. I am not certain whether I have my facts exactly right in relation to the proposers of the amendment.  I am told I have.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe accepted the first amendment under the same circumstances, he might accept this amendment.  It is proper to mention in defence of the Seanad that, if the Seanad were not there, there are occasions when, by virtue of pressure of business in the Dáil, amendments of this nature might escape the legislative net.  In that way we can be grateful for the presence and existence of the Seanad.  We are grateful to the two Opposition Senators who proposed the amendment we feel we have perfected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the latitude. This is a rather important practical point which worries a number of house purchasers.  These are people who have in recent times entered into contracts to purchase on the basis of long leases.  Examples given to me include 999-year leases at 1p a year. These people are building houses on bridging finance on the basis of furnishing title to mortgage institutions as soon as the houses are completed.  I accept that there is a provision in the present Bill for a developer to buy out the freehold under section 2 (5) where planning permission has been granted. However, in the circumstances to which I am referring, there would not be a contractual obligation whereby the house purchaser could force him to do so.  I am concerned on behalf of these people because there appears to be a <i>lacuna</i> which could bring great hardship on them.  They could fall between two stools: on the one hand, unable to enforce their rights under the existing contract and, on the other hand, unable to gain the benefit of <Col N="761" /> the new Bill.  Does the Minister appreciate this point and can anything be done to ensure that hardship to existing house purchasers will not arise in these circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point.  If, as the Deputy suggests, that is the situation, it could be a very serious matter.  With the passage of this Bill it will be enacted into law when it is signed by the President and this should be given maximum publicity.  Such publicity should encourage people, who are in the process of contracting as the Deputy has described, to formalise their contracts before the Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to prohibit the creation of future ground rents on ordinary dwelling-houses.  I understand that is what the Deputy is speaking about.  The Bill proposes to do this by making void any future attempted lease of such a dwelling that would create a ground rent, apart from renewals of existing ground leases.  The amendment seeks to validate such leases, provided a contract for the lease has been entered into before the Bill became law.  It was argued that when the Bill becomes law some unknown number of persons will have contracted to take ground leases but will not actually have taken them.  If I can be of any further assistance to the Deputy and his colleagues they might be accommodated in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 37 and 38 to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister for the Environment, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, shall, within three months of the commencement of each calendar year to which this Act has application, prepare and have presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas, a report setting out the following in respect of each of the three previous calendar years&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in respect of each rating authority the number of persons, the valuation of whose tenements of agricultural land in respect of which they are rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified on the first day of the year in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, who were not liable to pay income tax because of insufficient income but who were liable to pay rates, as provided in this Act, in the relevant year;</P>
      <P>(b)  in respect of each rating authority the number of persons, the valuation of whose tenements of agricultural land exceeds £1 per acre on average and whose total valuation exceeds the amount standing specified on the first day of the year in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  in respect of each rating authority the extent to which the percentage increase in the county rate in the year exceeds the percentage increase in agricultural incomes in the State in the year in question or the latest year for which figures are available as <Col N="763" /> determined by the Central Statistics Office.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I bow to the Chair's ruling in regard to amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  I understand they have been ruled out of order on the basis that they could impose a charge on the Revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The meaning of that is that it is not outside the bounds of possibility that the income tax on farmers will be enforced at a lower threshold than that which appears in the Finance Bill of this year.  If that were not so these amendments could not in any way impose any charge on the Revenue.  The slogan is: farmers beware.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Bill as it stands is to depart from its predecessors over many years, because in so far as the relief of rates by way of agricultural grant is concerned all previous agricultural relief Bills within living political memory have had the effect of granting further relief to rated occupiers of agricultural land, in so far as rate relief by way of poundage, properly so called, was concerned.  Some Bills had the effect of giving 100 per cent relief in valuations up to £20.  Other Bills confirm relief given by their predecessors. Of course, I make the Minister a present of the fact that the 1976 Bill removed token relief of £17 in respect of an agricultural labourer, which then represented only a fraction of a week's wages for such a labourer.  With the exception of that one solitary removal, all Bills within living political memory either confirmed existing relief or increased relief. This Bill departs from that precedent in that it removes relief altogether. As from 1 January of this year it removes all relief in respect of holdings with a valuation of £75 and upwards and in respect of holdings with a valuation of £60 and upwards it removes all relief as from 1 January 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister and his colleagues <Col N="764" /> were speaking to the agricultural community and the farming organisations they excused this proposal and explained it by saying that farmers could take credit for the increase in rates that this measure will bring about against the income tax they will be called on to pay.  I have been making the case&mdash;and I want to repeat it here &mdash;that from 1 January of this year this Bill will extract from farmers amounts ranging from £360 per annum up to a few thousand pounds depending on the valuation.  The farmer with a valuation of £75 will be hit for about £360 and it will be more next year because the threshold comes down.</P>
    <P>I have been making the case that many of these farmers will not be liable for income tax as from 1 January 1978 or from 1 January 1979.  They may submit accounts showing that their income does not reach the level at which income tax is payable or they may be farmers who rely on the notional system in respect of which the Government have increased the figure from £65 to £90 per £1 PLV on a much lower threshold.  The farmers who rely on the notional system may have big families that entitle them to large allowances.  In addition, they may be paying substantial bank interest, heavy charges to contractors or agricultural wages.  In one way or another they may be exempt from income tax but yet they will be called on to pay these heavy increases in rates without reference to their income or their ability to pay.  I have tried to tie down the Minister to conceding to me in argument in this House that that is the case but, of course, he sidestepped the question.  He refused to answer the arguments made.</P>
    <P>The objective of this amendment is to bring the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners out into the open as from 1 April 1979 and to make it obligatory on them to state how many farmers who are not liable for income tax will have their rates increased as a result of this measure. That is the effect of paragraph (a) of the amendment.  The section discriminates against one section of the community.  It discriminates against the section of the ratepayers who are <Col N="765" /> less well off than their co-ratepayers who have equal valuations.  As from 1 January 1978 the ratepayer with a valuation of £75 and who is liable to pay £1,000 in income tax may not be affected by this measure because he will be able to credit that amount against his income tax.  Of course he will have paid his income tax 18 months in advance but beyond that he will not be affected.  However, in the case of the man with a £75 valuation who is not liable for income tax because he is less well off, he will be blistered to the extent of between £300 and £400.  Clearly this discriminates against him.  We said before that the rating system did not have regard to the capacity of people to pay but valuations were treated equally.  What the Minister is proposing is unfair and unjust.  It should be obligatory on him to state how many people will be affected.</P>
    <P>The clear intention of paragraph (b) is to oblige the Minister to present another list, namely, a list of people who are heavily rated.  We know that in the present rating system the valuations on land were carried out under the Griffith valuation.  Let me at once exonerate completely the name of a great Irishman, Arthur Griffith.  This matter has nothing to do with him and he is so well and honourably known that I should disassociate his great name from that measure.  The valuation was done by another person of the same name.  It started in 1850 or 1852 and it ended in 1865.  I understand it started in the south of Ireland shortly after the Famine and the people who valued the land worked their way up north through the midlands and arrived in the north when things had become much better.  The test then was the capacity of the land to grow flax or wheat.  The part of the country that was valued in 1865 long after the Famine was valued at a much higher rate than the land which was valued three or four years after the famine when Griffith started.  The effect of that is that some land is valued at a few pence per acre and other land is valued at well over 100 pence an acre.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is <Col N="766" /> to expose the inequity of this system. We ask the Minister to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas the number of people the valuation of whose tenements of agricultural land exceeds £1 per acre and whose total valuation exceeds the amount specified on the first day of the year in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974.  The Minister is invited to lay before the House in respect of each rating authority the extent to which the percentage increase in the county rate in the year exceeds the percentage increase in agricultural incomes in the State. This is because the rates in the £ will vary from rating authority to rating authority.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) would make it obligatory on the Minister to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas particulars of the persons where the percentage increase in the county rate exceeds the increase in agricultural incomes. The effect of paragraph (b) and paragraph (c) is to highlight the injustice of the rating system as a means of collecting revenue.  The effect of paragraph (a) is to point out the number of people who will have large sums of money extracted from them under the Bill irrespective of their capacity to pay and notwithstanding that they are in poor circumstances compared with their better off neighbours. We want to make it obligatory on the Minister to give a list of the people who are being discriminated against in this way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton put this amendment down for Committee Stage but he gave very short notice of it and the Chair did not accept it.  He discussed the matter on the Committee Stage.  I am sure the Minister has had an opportunity of considering it since and been advised on it.  It is a reasonable amendment. I strongly urge him to accept it.</P>

      <P>This amendment in the names of Deputies Fitzpatrick and Bruton seeks to have it written into the Bill that I should have to submit a report each year to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The report would have a number of sets of detailed figures related in some degree to the agricultural <Col N="767" /> grant and covering the three previous years.  I do not think the amendment is a reasonable one and I must oppose it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular information sought in the amendment some of it would not arise directly from the administration of the agricultural grant.  Some of the information sought involves the responsibility of other Ministers besides the Minister for the Environment.  For those reasons, even if I thought the information was important enough to justify special annual reports to both Houses of the Oireachtas, I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to paragraph (a) of the amendment, it is really looking for information in relation to the number of people with valuations above the income tax thresholds who are not liable to pay income tax because they do not make enough money.  I do not know whether or not the Revenue Commissioners would have this sort of information.  I do not have it.  Paragraph (b) of the amendment looks for information on a county basis of the number of people with valuations over £1 per acre and with total valuations over the income tax threshold.  I have no information about the relationship between the valuation and the area of particular holdings.  It does not arise from the administration of the agricultural grant or the rating system. Certain general information is available from which average valuations per acre can be worked out.  For instance, the average for the country is 41p.  This is a different thing from the valuation per acre of individual holdings in every county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of the amendment seeks information about annual percentage rate increases in each county related to percentage increases in agricultural income.  My Department would not have figures on agricultural incomes.  These would be matters for other Ministers.  The volume of local estimates, which is presented to both Houses, normally gives information about rate levels of all local authorities.  It is open to anybody to <Col N="768" /> relate these figures to any other figures he may be interested in.  With regard to all three cases, paragraph (c) is a matter for a different Minister; the information sought in paragraph (a) is not available to me and I cannot say if it is available to the Revenue Commissioners; and the information sought in paragraph (b) has nothing whatever to do with the administration of the agricultural grants.  While Deputies Fitzpatrick and Bruton gave ample notice of the amendment, I cannot accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for putting down this amendment is basically so that justice can be seen to be done in relation to this matter.  The argument in favour of this increase in the rates consequent on the withdrawal of very important reliefs has been that farmers will be able to claim back the increased rates paid against their income tax.  The purpose of the amendment is to require the Minister to justify this on a continuing basis.  If it transpires that the system is operating unjustly, that farmers because of the provisions of this Bill have to pay much increased rates, which they are either not able to claim back against income tax because a significant number of them are not earning enough to be in the income tax net or, alternatively, that a significant number of them have valuations which are so high, for instance, being over £1 per acre, that the amount of rates they will have to pay will be disproportionate to the amount of rates other farmers are paying because of the anachronistic valuation system we have here which goes back to the nineteenth century.  Or, thirdly, that in a particular year the increased rates are unjust because in that year the increase in agricultural income has not taken place which would enable the ratepayers to meet the cost.  This amendment seeks to have, on a continuing basis each year, this information laid before the House so that it will be possible for a review to take place as to whether this Bill is operating justly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have said we believe it is an unjust Bill anyway.  But even within the Minister's own criteria the disclosure of this information will make <Col N="769" /> known whether or not the Bill is operating justly.  Amendment No. 3, paragraph (a) requires that the number in relation to those who are not liable to pay income tax but who are paying the increased rates be disclosed.  The Minister has said that he does not have that information in his Department. However, it is being shown, in section 45 of the current Finance Bill, which is being considered by the House at present, that in relation to this matter of rates an arrangement can be made for the exchange of information between the Department of the Environment and the Revenue Commissioners as to the farmers who should be liable for increased rates, and that the Revenue Commissioners will exchange information with the Department of the Environment on this matter.  If the Minister for the Environment can get information from the Revenue Commissioners under that provision why then can he not do it as suggested in amendment 3, paragraph (a)?  If the Revenue Commissioners can give the other information why can they not give the Minister information on a continuing basis as to the number of farmers they have on their books as having valuations in excess of £60 who, in a particular year, were not liable to income tax?  Why can that information not be given?  We are not asking for the disclosure of the names of particular farmers.  We are merely asking for the number of farmers involved.</P>
    <P>If a farmer is liable to pay income tax because of his valuation but does not pay it because he does not have an income, <i>ipso facto</i> that farmer has had to pay much increased rates simply because he has that valuation, the provisions of this Bill applying to him regardless of whether or not he has that income.  Therefore, that information must be available to the Revenue Commissioners.  They must have a record of every farmer who has a valuation in excess of the specified figure; they must have information as to how many of those are paying income tax.  There is no question but that they have that information.  Otherwise they could not be operating the tax system.  If they have that information there is no reason that they cannot <Col N="770" /> give it in an abstract form, not laying out the names or details of any individual, to the Minister for the Environment so that he can comply with the requirements of this amendment and let us know the number of persons whose valuations exceeded the specified figure but who were not liable to pay income tax.  I cannot see how the Minister can claim that that information cannot be obtained.  To say that he does not have it in his own Department is to suggest that his Department functions as some sort of an island in the public service and that nobody can get information into it or out of it, which, of course, is not the case.  If the Minister and his Department are functioning as part of an overall Government and if they want information from other Departments in order to comply with the responsibilities which have been imposed on them by statute in this House they can get it.  The fact that, in requesting it, they are able to cite a requirement of statute&mdash;such as they would if this amendment were accepted&mdash;will ensure that the Revenue Commissioners must give the information being required in this amendment to the Minister for the Environment so that he can comply with its requirements.</P>
    <P>Amendment 3, paragraph (b) requires information as to the number of valuations in each county which exceed £1 per acre.  It is well accepted that the usual valuation of land is somewhere between 60p per acre and £1.  If a farmer has a valuation in excess of £1 per acre under the Griffith Law Valuation he has very highly valued land as his rates are based, not on the number of acres he has or on his income but simply and solely on his rateable valuation if he has a valuation in excess of £1.  I have heard cases of farmers with quite bad land, insufficiently drained or something like that or which was situated in a part of the country where for some reason because he wanted influence in parliament at the time the landlord, who was in a position to influence Mr. Griffith when he was carrying out his valuation in the last century, was able to have his particular area valued at a much higher level.  I have heard of <Col N="771" /> examples, for instance, in County Tipperary where one landlord wanted his land valued highly and he was able to get it valued at nearly £2 per acre.  This is land, I think, in the vicinity of Tipperary town.  I have heard of other parts of the country where other landlords, for other political reasons long since irrelevant in modern times&mdash;and there is no need for us to go into them at this stage&mdash;wanted to have their land valued at a low rate.  Therefore, they were able to influence Mr. Griffith when he was carrying out his valuation, and they got a low valuation, maybe 70p or 80p per acre, put on their land.  But the farmers who live on that land today have inherited those valuations and the rates they are paying on them.  Indeed the much increased rates which will be levied as a result of this Bill, double or treble the amount in some cases, will be based on those valuations drawn up in the nineteenth century on the basis of long and anachronistic political considerations of those times.  To my mind that is most unjust.</P>
    <P>The purpose of paragraph (b) of this amendment is that the Minister should be required to place that information before the House, to let us have once and for all information in respect of each county which identifies exactly how many landholders in each county have valuations in excess of £1 per acre.  That would be some indication, a rough one&mdash;and indeed not sufficient because it is not related to the actual potential of the land but a rough indication&mdash;of the number of farmers in each county who have valuations which are very high and who, consequently, are paying very high rates.  If we have that sort of information lodged in the House every year I believe it will bring home eventually the need to have this valuation system revised particularly because these excessively increased rates are being based on that valuation system but also in view of the fact that eligibility for many other benefits&mdash;eligibility indeed to pay income tax or not to pay income tax&mdash;is based on these valuations drawn up on the basis of anachronistic political considerations in the last century, considerations <Col N="772" /> based also on forms of agriculture which have long since gone.</P>
    <P>If I may revert to what I was saying about landlords and give another explanation as to why, in some cases, land is valued very highly, we all know that in certain parts of the country in the last century the production of linen was very common.  Anybody going through the country and seeing the circles of trees in the middle of fields which are known as bleaches will know that those trees were planted originally so that the linen could be dried.  One can see these bleaches all over the country.  They are evidence of the fact that at the time Griffith land valuation was drawn up flax cultivation and linen production were very common and very profitable.  Only certain types of land are suitable for flax production and land so suitable is not suitable for other forms of agricultural production.  Because flax was a profitable crop at the time of the Griffith evaluation the land on which it grew was valued much more highly and the result of that is that that land, no longer producing flax, still carries a very high valuation and the disappearance of that particular type of cultivation has left areas very unjustly too highly valued.</P>
    <P>That is another illustration of how unfair the retention of the Griffith valuation system is and another reason for the adoption of that part of my amendment in paragraph 2 (b) which requires the Minister to give details of the use in respect of each county of the number of holdings where the valuation per acre exceeds £1.  That information will have to be obtained by the county councils.  I agree with the Minister that it probably is not readily available at the moment but, if it is once done, the number of times it will have to be changed will be very few because, unless the valuations are changed or holdings are amalgamated, the information will not have to be revised.  Now we all know that rate collectors have not as much work to do since domestic rates were abolished and there you have people readily available, and none better qualified, to obtain the sort of information required here, information which will <Col N="773" /> clearly illustrate the injustices that exist.  The Minister cannot say that it is not possible for him administratively to get this information.  He can get it done quite easily by asking the rate collectors to do the work.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) is concerned about the extent to which the percentage increase in the county rate in the year exceeds the percentage increase in agricultural incomes or the latest year for which figures are available as determined by the Central Statistics Office. A basic principle governing taxation is that it should be based on ability to pay.  One does not deny that in recent years there have been reasonably good increases in agricultural incomes because of a succession of price increases plus the devaluation of the green £, but that need not necessarily continue to be the case, particularly as other member states of the EEC are anxious that price increases should be moderated.  Indeed, we have our own Minister for Agriculture looking for less in terms of devaluation of the green £ than he would be entitled to get.  Our own Minister for Agriculture is in Brussels looking for less for the Irish farmer.  If that is the approach of the most agricultural Minister in the most agricultural country in the EEC we can see the type of pressure that exists to curb income increases to farmers and we can see that it will not always be the case that farmers will have substantial increases in their incomes.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, regardless of their incomes, the rates they pay will go up as a result of factors entirely extraneous to agriculture, factors relating to the needs of local authorities, to public finance, to the fact that the Government are not prepared to put up the money and want more money levied on non-domestic ratepayers.  The pressure of consumer interest and large industrial countries to keep food prices down will depress farmers' incomes. Pressure to increase local authority expenditure will force up rates.  In the years ahead, therefore, farmers will be paid increased rates while not getting any equivalent increase in incomes &mdash;perhaps half or one-quarter as much of an increase percentage wise as they <Col N="774" /> will have to pay percentage wise in rate increases.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) provides that the Minister shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>in respect of each rating authority the extent to which the percentage increase in the county rate in the year exceeds the percentage increase in agricultural incomes in the State in the year in question or the latest year for which figures are available as determined by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>Suppose in a particular year rates in Mayo increase by 60 per cent and agricultural incomes increase by only 5 per cent a statement of that blatant injustice, and no one can deny it would be nothing other than a blatant injustice, must be laid before this House by the Minister so that the effect of this Bill can be clearly seen by being brought to the attention of the House on a regular basis and the position reviewed on a regular basis.  This sort of hidden increase in taxation can take place without its being clearly and consciously adverted to by those responsible, namely, Members of this House.</P>
    <P>We all know the way in which tax free allowances are eroded but that is never drawn to the attention of the House.  Buoyancy in revenue is in fact a real increase in taxation and affects the income of all income tax payers. So far as this Bill is concerned I want to ensure that, if farmers have to pay a 60, 70 or 80 per cent increase in rates without obtaining any increase in incomes, that fact will be clearly drawn to the attention of the House. That is an eminently reasonable request and one the Minister should not reject.  The Minister claimed it would be difficult to get this information. I think he claimed this in respect of item (c) also.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>I do not believe that is true.  Firstly, the county rate in respect of each county is easily determinable. All counties must strike their rate at the same time each year.  We know what their rate was last year&mdash;that is a matter of public record&mdash;and the decision <Col N="775" /> as to the rate for this year, is also a matter of public record.  The rates are struck on the same basis across the board.  Therefore, in respect of any county it is perfectly easy to calculate the percentage rate increase. If the rate last year was £10 in the £ and this year it is £15 in the £, there is no problem in working out the percentage increase.  You do not have to be a mathematician.  A child in third class in the national school could tell you that the percentage increase in rates was 50 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the other part.  Will the Minister agree with me when I say that it is not too hard to find the percentage increase in rates? The second part of the amendment reads: &ldquo;the percentage increase in agricultural incomes in the State in the year in question or the latest year for which figures are available as determined by the Central Statistics Office.&rdquo;  We all know the CSO do exercises of this sort.  If the Minister is not satisfied with my inclusion of the CSO he can put in An Foras Talúntais, because they too do surveys on the increases in agricultural incomes on a regular basis.  As I said, I am not insisting that we have the CSO. If the Minister is not happy with them, he can include the Agricultural Institute.</P>
      <P>If the statute requires &ldquo;the percentage increase in agricultural incomes in the State in the years in question or the latest year for which figures are available as determined by the Central Statistic Office&rdquo;, there is no doubt but that that office, which ultimately has its mandate from this House, will produce those figures. There is no problem getting this information from the Central Statistics Office or the Agricultural Institute. Does the Minister contend there is a problem?</P>

      <P>The Minister has admitted that the information in paragraph (c) is and can be available.  Why, then, does he object to his being required to lay this information annually before this House so that it can be seen clearly in any year that farmers in a particular county, as a result of the provisions of this Bill, have to pay an increase in rates which is way ahead of the increase in income they obtained that year?  If that were seen to be the case and if a statement to that effect were laid before this House, I believe it would draw to the public mind clearly the injustice of the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister would have to take account of this and make sure, either by subsidisation of local authorities or by some other means, that the farming community were not asked to pay an increase in rates in any one year which was out of line with the increase in income they were getting in the same year.  That is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister is prepared to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a general remark about the purpose of this amendment and amendments of this sort.  In respect of legislation enacted it is a good principle that the Minister should be required to report on a regular basis on the implementation and effects of that legislation.  Too often legislation is passed in this House and <Col N="777" /> its provisions forgotten and not discussed again.  If the provision I am advocating is adopted in this case there would be a procedure for the regular, continuous and annual review of the way this Bill is operating so that the justice, or otherwise, of this legislation will be brought clearly into the light of day.  In view of these arguments, I hope the Minister accepts this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not have very much more to say on this amendment. Deputy Bruton put the case extremely clearly.  When speaking originally I stated that it is quite clear that the Bill as presented to this House discriminates against a section of the farming community.  I want the Minister to come clean with the farming community and spell out early next year the number of people, county by county, who are discriminated against. The only real excuse given by the Minister for failing to comply with paragraph (a) of the new section is that the information is not available to him.</P>
      <P>I pointed out on the last occasion that the Minister proposes to consult the Revenue Commissioners about other points in this Bill and to avail of and invoke the extraordinary powers of inquisition and of prying into the private affairs of the taxpayer which the Revenue Commissioners have.  He proposes to use those powers in implementing this Bill.  I find it difficult to see why he is not prepared to go ahead and avail of the same information to lay before both Houses the number of people who are being discriminated against.  The only reason I can see for it&mdash;and I propose to elaborate on this on the other amendments &mdash;is that he is thoroughly ashamed of himself and of his performance here. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle pointed out a few minutes ago, on this Stage it would be out of order for the Minister or any other Deputy, other than the proposer of the amendment, to speak twice.  I want to repeat that it is very difficult, and has been found impossible, to get Members of the Fianna Fáil Party to speak even once on this Bill.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It does, because the only explanation I can get for the Minister's failure to accept the amendment is that he wants to hush the whole thing up.  We had a very long Second Stage and Committee Stage debate on this Bill.  We could only persuade two members of the Fianna Fáil Party to contribute about ten minutes between them to this debate.  That is in keeping with the Minister's attitude to this amendment because he is not prepared to give information and he is not prepared to tell the people how many ratepayers he is discriminating against. That is regrettable and shameful.  The information which this amendment seeks to put before the House is relevant information which would enable the taxpayers in general to see whether the tax laws are being equitably enforced. There is and has been an attempt to build up a conflict between the agricultural community and the urban community.  It is only right in that sort of a climate that things that are being done to the agricultural community should be open for everyone to see.</P>
      <P>The Minister has decided to get this Bill out of the House and on to the Statute Book as quickly and as quietly as he can.  That has been the attitude of the Minister and his party since they first saw the light in this House. If it was debated here, the Government said, it would not be the Government's fault.  Sometimes a Government do not put in speakers on Bills because they have a lot of work to get through and they do not want to take up the time of the House.  That is not the position with this Government because they are now nearly 12 months in office and they have brought nothing before the House except Bills like this.</P>

I made the case I wished to make in introducing this amendment and I consider that Deputy Bruton has covered the ground in an excellent way in regard to the three paragraphs of the amendment.  The Minister has refused point blank to yield an inch.  Deputy Bruton's amendment seeks to highlight and isolate discrimination. The Minister does not <Col N="780" /> deny that there is discrimination and the only change that the Minister has made in this Bill since it came into the House was to perpetuate and consolidate discrimination in another way by an amendment which he introduced. The Minister consolidated an absurdity and it is no wonder then that he resists this amendment because this amendment would highlight another absurdity and further discrimination, while the Minister apparently is prepared to enforce discriminations and absurdities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 39, before &ldquo;Relief&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Withdrawal of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to change the title of the Bill from the present title which reads: &ldquo;Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill&rdquo; to &ldquo;Rates on Agricultural Land (Withdrawal of Relief) Bill&rdquo; and to change the collective title of the Acts from 1939 to 1976 and this Bill from the proposed title, the &ldquo;Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts, 1939 to 1978&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Rates on Agricultural Land Acts 1939 to 1978&rdquo;.  I have been a Member of this House since 1965 and I am aware that it is rather unusual and rare to challenge the title of a Bill and seek to amend it.  I am seriously asking the House to change the Title in accordance with my amendments.  I regard the Bill as a double-cross on the farming community, as a cynical going back on solemn promises made to the farming community by the Fianna Fáil Party before the last election.  This Bill is not a rates relief Bill and the Minister knows that.  The procedure in the past has been to re-enact those Acts giving relief and extending or enlarging on that relief.  This Bill does not do that.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to extract from the pockets of the agricultural rated occupiers £7 million this year and £9.2 million next year.  Anybody who would call that part of the Bill agricultural land relief is calling it something which is erroneous, dishonest and fraudulent.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto dealt at length with farming taxation, income tax and rates but it did not give even the slightest hint that they proposed to increase rates on agricultural land.  In that manifesto, under the title of &ldquo;Local Government&rdquo;, the question of rates in general is dealt with with particular reference to private houses.  Nobody could detect from that section that Fianna Fáil had any intention of increasing rates on agricultural land when they got into power.  I remember it being stated during the election campaign that Fianna Fáil in office would pass on the rates relief on private houses to other ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That was stated by members of the then Opposition during that campaign.  Representatives of the then Government parties, Fine Gael and Labour, stated during that campaign that Fianna Fáil in office would pass on the rates which they propose to abolish on private houses to other ratepayers.  I clearly remember a person of no less a calibre than the Taoiseach indignantly denying that Fianna Fáil would do any such thing.  He gave an assurance, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, that while rates would be abolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is misleading in the extreme.  I will get away from that subject in a moment.  I remember the charge being made by Fine Gael and Labour people that Fianna Fáil would pass the rates they intended abolishing on private houses onto other sections of the community.  I can recall an assurance being given on behalf of Fianna Fáil that no such thing would happen.  Assurances were given that following the abolition of rates on private houses those rates would not be passed on to other sections of the community but that will happen under this Bill.  Does this Bill not provide that £7 million of the rates which will not be collected on private houses this year will be paid by the agricultural community?  Are we not going to increase that figure to £9.2 million next year?  It was a political double-cross, a cynical reneging by Fianna Fáil on their solemn pre-election promises.  That is why I am seriously challenging this Title.  I propose to put this issue to a vote.</P>
      <P>The Minister may seek to defend the existing title by saying that the Bill does provide relief on agricultural rates because he is providing £38 million.  That is like the Fianna Fáil manifesto, it is only half the truth. The people who will get that relief will say: &ldquo;Thank you for nothing, we had it before, we have had it for the past 50 years.&rdquo;  It must be remembered that relief is being taken away on all ratepayers whose valuation exceeds £75 this year and £60 next year. Does the Minister deny that?  I defy the Minister to deny that this Bill goes only a bit of the way its predecessor went.  To call it the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill is dishonest in the extreme and is only half true at very best.  The collective title goes on to connect all its predecessors with this Bill and to pretend there is no difference whatever.  Of course that is not the case and the Minister knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not feel so strongly about this Bill if I did not relate it to the performance of the Government in Opposition on taxation in general, and if I did not relate it to their manifesto. <Col N="784" /> A couple of times in the manifesto it is said that income tax will fall due at the end of each financial year.  In this case, income tax will fall due, where it is payable by these people, 18 months before the end of the financial year in question.  The Minister has no apology to make, and no explanation to give.  All he can say is: &ldquo;That will happen once only.  It will iron itself out in due time.&rdquo;  A nice explanation to give for not fulfilling a solemn undertaking in this historic document that tax payments will fall due at the end of each financial year.  This measure proposes to extract them 18 months in advance.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder the <i>Evening Press</i> of today's date carries a huge headline: &ldquo;Govt.  Tightens The Purse String.&rdquo; Those are the words of the Taoiseach yesterday.  Has there been a complete and utter change?  Have they run out of money?  Can they not borrow what they thought they could borrow?  Is this a cynical going back on all the promises made, now that they have 84 seats and can sit there for the next four years?  They do not give a damn. They are shameless.  You could not extract a blush from them.  You could not get a word out of Deputies sitting behind the Minister.  They will troop in here with a majority of 20&mdash;although they did not have that majority on the last occasion&mdash;to vote these provisions through regardless of the promises they made, regardless of the undertakings and assurances they gave. They will talk about one thing and enact another.</P>
    <P>There are decent Fianna Fáil Deputies in the House.  Some of them are so decent and so down to earth that they cannot sit in the House.  They take their place in the Lobbies because they are thoroughly ashamed of the performance of the Fianna Fáil Government and the performance of the Minister.  If this Bill goes on the Statute Book with the short title proposed in section 2 (1) which reads: &ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1978,&rdquo; nobody will be able to identify it in the index of statutes.  Students and others in search of this Bill in the <Col N="785" /> immediate future or in the years to come, knowing what is in it and knowing the history of these Bills, will not be able to identify it as a relief of rates on agricultural land Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say: &ldquo;Of course it contains reliefs.  Of course it gives relief to the extent of £28 million or £38 million&rdquo; or whatever it is.  That is half the truth.  The Minister should be thoroughly ashamed to hide under that umbrella, to get out of the House under that smokescreen.  He should have the decency to say that the whole ball game has changed and there is not money to spare as one of the players said long ago.  He should say: &ldquo;Did you not hear the Taoiseach speaking yesterday?  We have tightened the purse strings.  We have to get money everywhere&rdquo;. There is a picture of the Taoiseach smoking his pipe like a contented man beside that headline. Well he may smoke his pipe with the majority he has in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): If we are to take the Bill at its true value, it might be about smoking or anything else.  It is misleading. We might be able to discuss any topic under the Bill.</P>
      <P>We should be honest with each other.  We should be honest with the House and with the people.  We should call this Bill what it is, a withdrawal of relief Bill.  If the Minister does not like that title, he can call it a discontinuance of relief of rates on agricultural land in respect of valuations of £75 and over as from 1 January 1978 and in respect of valuations of £60 and over as from 1 January 1979, and a continuation of relief in respect of lower valuations.  I will accept that, if it will make him happy.  In no circumstances am I prepared to accept an omnibus title which creates the impression that the position is as it was.  It is not.  The position is the same as it was on holdings with valuations up to £60 but it is utterly different on holdings with valuations of £60 or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind what the Minister calls this Bill so long as he does not create the impression that it is a repetition <Col N="786" /> of the law on agricultural rating as it stood up to the end of last year. That is what this Bill leads people to believe, but it is no such thing.  It is a withdrawal of relief on holdings of £60 and over.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with the amendment because I am putting it forward as a serious amendment. I propose to have it voted on to put the record straight on the Bill and its amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to change the name of this Bill from Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill to Rates on Agricultural Land (Withdrawal of Relief) Bill.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick really believes in what he has been saying in regard to the name of this Bill, surely he was very inconsistent in 1976 when a similar Bill was brought in with the same title which withdrew the employment allowance from farmers with over £20 valuation. Why did he not vote against that Bill? He was a member of the Government which brought it in.  There is a definite inconsistency in the Deputy's approach.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives rates relief to the farming community of £38.5 million and if the Bill had not been brought in we would not be able to apply the relief.  The Bill is properly named.  It is a Bill giving relief.  I am not in any way disposed to accept an amendment which will misname the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Fitzpatrick's references to the undertakings in the manifesto, I do not recall any mention in the famous 14-point plan of 1973 about the taxation of farmers.  There was none to my knowledge.  I emphasise again that under domestic derating, which comes to £80.75 million, the farming community will benefit to the tune of £9.5 million because of the derating of residences and farm buildings which were still rated.  The total relief this year between domestic derating and this Bill amounts to £120 million. This Bill gives relief of £38.5 million and to this must be added £9.5 million because of domestic derating of the farming community.  People who do not benefit under the supplementary or primary allowance under this Bill can set off extra rates against their income <Col N="787" /> tax.  This is a relief Bill to give £38.5 million relief to the farming community. I am not disposed to misname the Bill under the amendments proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has made the case with considerable eloquence that this Bill is the expression of a double-cross perpetrated on the farming community during the recent election by the party opposite.  They told the farmers all about the changes to be made in income tax and about the improvements they would make in various matters relating to agriculture &mdash;for instance, the farm modernisation scheme.  They told them about the removal of domestic rates on their houses and the houses of others, but they did not tell the farmers before the election about the content of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is an integral part of the means whereby the package put to the people and accepted by them at the last election is to be financed.  Yet the party opposite did not have the courage or honesty to tell the people that in voting for them they were voting for this Bill.  They did not tell the farmers that if they had a valuation in excess of £60 there would be an increase in their rates of a minimum of £360 and it could be up to £500 or £600 or even £1,000.  When they were soliciting the votes of the farmers they did not tell them that they would be voting to have their rates increased.  The farmers were told many things, some true and some untrue.  This was deliberately concealed. I can say without fear of contradiction that the Minister and his party knew that they would introduce a Bill of this sort.  They knew at the time of the election that this would have to be done if the exaggerated promises made then were to be fulfilled, but they deliberately concealed their intention from the farmers and failed to tell them the full story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very many farmers do not realise the reality yet because they have not received their rates demands.  They will receive them during the next few weeks. In my own county they will probably be received next week.  Then they will <Col N="788" /> realise the truth of Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment and that this is the most misnamed Bill which has come before this House for many years.  It is disingenuously described as a relief Bill.  It is nothing of the sort.  It is the black side of the manifesto about which the people were not told when they were so seduously courted for their votes at the election.  Why was it concealed? I contend that it was deliberately concealed because I do not think that Fianna Fáil could have made the promises they made without being fully conscious that they would have to introduce a Bill of this sort.  They deliberately concealed those aspects of their taxation and rating proposals which would not be viewed favourably.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil realised clearly the double-cross.  At the most recent Division in this House on this Bill less than half-an-hour ago, Fianna Fáil had the smallest majority they have had since this Dáil assembled. That is clear evidence that many of the Deputies who know that this matter is being discussed realise that they are being asked to vote for something which is clearly detrimental to the interests of their constituents among the farming community.  They have chosen for one excuse or another to absent themselves from this House. That is the reason for this small majority of 15.  The Government should have a majority of at least 20.  Usually the Government have more Members in the House as a proportion of their total strength than have the Opposition because of having to maintain a quorum and so on.  Yet they have a majority of only 15 on this Bill.  That is a clear indication that the conscience of the party opposite in relation to this Bill is not clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to describe the relief granted by this Bill.  This Bill merely continues reliefs which have been there since 1946 and earlier.  It is usual in relation to statutes that if a scheme is introduced which will cost money a Bill is introduced enabling the money to be spent and provision is made in the Estimates every year. The Estimates are incorporated in the Appropriation Bill which becomes an Act at the end of the year.  There is no <Col N="789" /> need for a separate statute to be introduced every year to allow the money to be spent in that particular year.  Let us take, for example, expenditure in relation to the subsidisation of national schools.  There is no need to bring in an Education Act every year to enable capitation grants to be paid to national schools.</P>
    <P>Agricultural reliefs are in exactly the same category.  They are a continuing scheme which has been in operation since 1946.  For some reason it has become the custom that these reliefs, instead of being allowed to continue, are renewed every year or two by a new Bill.  In the past this has been purely a formality.  On many occasions such Bills were put through this House without any discussion at all.  Nobody ever pretended, just because a Bill was being reintroduced to continue something which had been there since 1946, that there was in any sense a new relief or any particular benefit being conferred on the farming community. It was a continuation of something that had been there for many years.  It was the same as any other scheme of Government expenditure which did not require, as this for some quirk of legislative history requires, to be renewed by statute every year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister has come back with a Bill that simply reviews what was given in the past, but on a much reduced scale in relation to agricultural relief, is nothing new.  It does not allow him to pretend to be giving something away, to pretend that he is being generous. He is merely giving some farmers something that they have had since 1946, but he is taking away from many other farmers an allowance that they have had since then.  The only unusual characteristic of this Bill is that it is taking away from a substantial number of farmers an allowance they have had since 1946.  That is the political and legislative reality of this Bill and that is what it should be called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to make the argument that the 1976 Bill contained a provision regarding the withdrawal <Col N="790" /> of relief that had been granted up to then and said that, if that Bill was called an Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, this one should also be called that.  Let us compare what happened in 1976 with what happened in this Bill.  In 1976 the employment allowance was withdrawn, but as most farmers do not employ anyone that withdrawal did not affect the majority of farmers.  In the main our farmers rely on their own labour and that of their children but not on paid labour. However, for the farmers who had paid labour it was a relief of £17&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seeks to compare the withdrawal of £17 with what is proposed in this Bill, namely, a withdrawal of relief to the extent of £360 minimum ranging up to £1,000. He is not comparing like with like and he should not try to press that argument too far.  It may give him and his non-existent supporters here some small comfort in this debate, but it will not carry him far when he has to justify this Bill to the farmers in Clare and throughout the country.  When they get their rate demands in the next few months they will ask the Minister what has happened.  They will wonder why he did not mention that fact when he was canvassing in Ennis before the general election.  The Minister's colleague, Deputy Daly, may not agree with what the Minister is proposing, but the ratepayers of the county will wonder also why he did not mention what the Government had in mind. The Minister may tell the farmers that the National Coalition Government withdrew the employment allowance, but that was only £17 in comparison with the amounts now proposed to be taken from them, namely, from £360 to £1,000.  I do not think the ratepayers in County Clare or in any other county <Col N="791" /> will be very enamoured of the Minister's argument.  He should have another think before he comes up with the next manifesto he has to produce to enable him to get the farming supporters of his party to accept this legislation.</P>
      <P>One aspect that needs to be mentioned is that this opens the door to the withdrawal of relief of rates simply by changing a figure in the Finance Bill.  Although relief will be withdrawn from farmers who have a valuation in excess of £60 as a result of this measure, it will merely require a change in the figure in the Finance Bill for next year or any other year for a greater amount to be withdrawn. Relief can also be withdrawn without this Bill or a similar one ever having to be discussed again, and this may affect farmers with a valuation of, say, £30 or £20.  In fact, it will be possible for the Minister to withdraw all agricultural relief without having it discussed in this House so long as he can persuade the Minister for Finance to change the specified figure in section 15 (3) of the Finance Bill, 1974. If the Minister for Finance in next year's Finance Bill were to introduce an amendment stating that the specified figure shall not be £75 but that it shall be £1, simply by doing that all agricultural relief would be abolished at a stroke and the Minister for the Environment would not be required to justify it.  Although it will be withdrawing something for which he is responsible and to which this Bill relates, by the powers conferred by this Bill that can be done by the Minister for Finance without the Minister for the Environment having to justify it.  This Bill is conferring such powers on another Minister.  This is not a relief Bill.  It is allowing the permanent and total withdrawal of all agricultural relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no way of knowing what increase in rates farmers will have to pay in the future.  This year there is a ceiling of 11 per cent on all rates. This includes any rates paid on domestic dwellings by the Minister and rates paid by people on rated property that is not exempted.  Next year the Minister could freeze domestic rates at 11 <Col N="792" /> per cent, but he could allow local authorities to increase rates on farms by 40 per cent or 50 per cent.  There is nothing to prevent him from doing that.  He can tell any county council if they are short of money to increase the rates on agricultural land by 40 or 50 per cent.  Although the farmers' rates are being doubled this year and although this Bill confers power on the Minister to abolish agricultural relief entirely, the realities of the rating system do not allow the Minister to authorise an increase in domestic rates thereby starving local authorities of finance.  At the same time he can allow a limited increase in the rates in any particular year by local authorities on non-domestic property, land, buildings and commercial property.  It could easily occur under the evolution of the local government system that the entire burden of local government will be paid by agricultural ratepayers and commercial ratepayers. That does not happen at the moment because there is an 11 per cent ceiling across the board but it could happen at some future stage.  This Bill, which is so erroneously described as a relief, is facilitating such a development.  How could the Minister honestly describe a Bill of this sort, which has such grave implications for our major industry, as a relief Bill?  It is no such thing and it should not be so described.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am not surprised that the Minister is apparently determined to brazen this debate out.  He has failed to justify his proposals and failed to reply to arguments.  This has been a very difficult debate to conduct because we had no response from the Government and the Minister.  It was apparent from the first few minutes of this debate that this party and the Labour Party were absolutely opposed to the proposals contained in the Bill, that we were opposed to the title of the Bill and that we would debate against it.  The reaction from the Minister and his party was silence and refusal to argue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been treated to an exhibition of arrogance by the Minister and his party, not the arrogance of words <Col N="793" /> but arrogance in absence from the House and silence.  The worst arrogance is relying on a massive majority to steamroll the Bill through the House.  This amendment proposes to change the name of this Bill and to call it what it is, a measure to withdraw relief in respect of rates on agricultural holdings.  We get no reply from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said the Minister referred to the provisions in the 1976 Bill which abolished relief which ceased to be meaningful, £17 in respect of each labourer employed.  This represented at least a month's wages and perhaps six weeks' wages when it was introduced but when it was abolished it represented three days' wages.  That is the only defence the Minister has.  In his reply to the amendment he referred to the Coalition's 14-point programme in 1973 and said that we did not promise taxation. We did.  We were honest with the people.  We solemnly undertook to abolish a form of taxation which terrified the people.  We explained that death duties would be replaced by another form of taxation.  That is the difference between Fianna Fáil and the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>The National Coalition abolished death duties.  When I went on television as the Fine Gael spokesman I made it absolutely clear that the then iniquitous and terrifying taxation in the form of death duties would be replaced by other capital taxation. When the Minister says otherwise he is putting up dishonest arguments to justify a despicable performance in the form of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is hard to reply to arguments which have not been made.  It is hard to reply to an intervention by the Minister when he does not justify the measure he is pushing through and when he relies entirely on his 84 people or whatever number of them <Col N="794" /> are here to vote this through.  Things have changed utterly since the manifesto and the election campaign.  I want to give a short quotation from today's <i>Evening Press</i> of Wednesday, 10 May 1978 by John Wallace.  The heading is &ldquo;Government Tightens the Purse Strings&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    <P>Government purse strings are being tightened because the economy cannot sustain the present level of borrowing, the Taoiseach said today.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lynch revealed that what he called &ldquo;a thorough-going reassessment of public expenditure priorities&rdquo; was under way.  Spending was being critically reviewed, he said.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with public expenditure here.  This is a saving of £7 million this year, a cut-back in that £7 million public expenditure in the teeth of the promises made in the manifesto and the election campaign.  This cut-back in public expenditure is evident throughout every parish in the country, in the homes of the old age pensioners and in the homes of all social welfare classes.  The Minister should be honest enough to say that this is a first public instalment of what the Taoiseach has for us.</P>
    <P>We have made the arguments but the Minister has not replied to them. We can only repeat what we said before.  It becomes very frustrating to come in here and be expected to reply when you have nothing to reply to. I must put it on record that it is evident that Fianna Fáil Ministers are nice fellows in the House but it does not need aggressive contributions to constitute arrogance.  There is the terrible arrogance of failing to argue and relying on the strength of their colleagues' feet in the lobbies.  That is what the Government is doing.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In so far as this Bill contains relief I have no objection to it and neither have those Members on <Col N="797" /> this side of the House.  In so far as those sections which do not contain relief are concerned, I am totally and absolutely opposed to the Bill.  The fact is the Bill contains relief only on agricultural holdings up to £60 valuation. I am wholeheartedly in favour of that but section 1 (2) of the Bill specifically deprives rated occupiers of holdings with a valuation in excess of £60 of relief.  That is written into the Bill in black and white.  Subsection 2 provides:</P>
      <P>A rating authority . . . shall not apply the Act aforesaid to a person, as respects a local financial year, if the valuation of all the tenements of agricultural land in respect of which he is rated equals or exceeds the amount standing specified, on the first day of that year, in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>
      <P>There you have a specific direction to the rating authority to get at the farmer with the £75 valuation this year and at the farmer with the £60 valuation next year.  This is a doublecross. This is a going back.  This is a cynical betrayal of the farming community. This is a total disregard of the promises made by the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to the people who supported them.</P>
      <P>I have made the case as strongly as I could, with the able assistance of Deputy Bruton and practically the entire Fine Gael Party, and we have failed to prevail on the Minister to amend the Bill.  As it stands now it is an instrument designed to kill relief. What other interpretation could section 1 (2) bear?  Why has the Minister put that section into the Bill?  He has put it in to take away the relief which these categories of rating valuations enjoyed for 50 years.  That is the object of subsection (2).  Subsection (2) is the section which the Minister, with the assistance of agricultural Deputies from Cavan, Monaghan, Meath, Louth, Cork and the midlands and every agricultural Deputy in the Minister's party, put on the Statute Book of this House. It is no wonder they are ashamed of themselves and have nothing to say. That is the subsection to which I have objected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> We have done everything in our power within the rules of order of this House to try to persuade the Minister by force of argument that he should have deleted section 1 (2) but we have not succeeded.  We do not propose voting against the entire Bill because it contains relief up to the £60 valuation but subsection (2) takes away relief from other categories and that is what I am against.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton pointed out, when the first Finance Bill was introduced by the National Coalition, the Minister for Finance, sitting on this side of the House beside the then Deputy Lynch, asked: &ldquo;Are you not going to tax the farmers?&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment have the machinery in subsection (2) to reduce the threshold to nil and take away the agricultural relief utterly and entirely.</P>
    <P>If there was an argument wanted in favour of what I am saying and if it was necessary to prove it beyond doubt, I would point out to the House that Deputy Bruton and myself offered amendments today to substitute £75 for 1978 and £60 for 1979.  In other words, to tie the threshold to the existing figures in this year's Finance Act. But these amendments were quite properly ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle in the following terms: &ldquo;I regret that amendments Nos. 1 and 2 tabled by you and Deputy Bruton must be adjudged out of order because they involve potential charges upon the revenue.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The effect of that is to enable the Minister to reduce the threshold from £50 to £40, to £30, to £25 and to £1.  I am using as an argument in favour of that the letter I got from the Ceann Comhairle telling me that my effort to change that would impose a charge on the Revenue.  The only way a further charge on the Revenue could arise would be by the reduction in the poor law valuations of £75 and £60 down the ladder.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance who believe in taxing farmers and always did will do that.  I am against that.  I am utterly and absolutely against the proposal in the section to abolish the relief of rates on agricultural land, because I believe that not alone should we not be increasing rates but we should be getting away from the system utterly and entirely. The arguments which have been made during the debate have proved conclusively that the system is wrong, unfair, unjust, inequitable and discriminates between one rated occupier and another and the thing to do is to get away from it.  I object to this Bill because its provisions are not moving away from this inequitable system of taxation but rather are they writing it in firmly, consolidating and using it as a measure for collecting taxes to substitute rates on private houses and to substitute a wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if we will have any further contribution from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I cannot speak on this Bill again but I want to go on record as saying that from the first moment I saw this Bill I detested it and determined to oppose it because I regarded it as a shabby, double-cross of the agricultural community by this Government. At a time when they were leading the people to believe they were going to move away from rates, they have moved back again.  I want to warn the people that a Government capable of using the biggest majority any government ever enjoyed in this State for <Col N="800" /> that purpose is capable of using that majority for anything unless their own backbenchers get so thoroughly ashamed of them and disgusted with them that they would rather walk out of public life than continue to be associated with this kind of performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of my right to contribute on the Fifth Stage to draw attention to one aspect of it which I think is most unusual in terms of the content of a statute.  If a Bill is introduced by a particular Minister it confers powers on him as Minister which he will exercise.  The House is assured that, if any substantial change occurs in the powers or their effect being conferred by that Bill, the Minister who introduced it will be answerable to the House for that change. This Bill is most unusual in that it marks a departure from that principle, and a departure in my view from what is proper ministerial responsibility to parliament in relation to legislation.</P>
      <P>Under section 1 (2) of this Bill it is possible for the Minister for Finance, who has not spoken on this Bill, to set at nought the entire relief granted under this Bill, because the continued existence of any of the reliefs contained here is contingent on an amount specified in a Finance Bill.  If the Minister for Finance were to substitute the figure &ldquo;0&rdquo; for the figure &ldquo;75&rdquo; in section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, he could entirely abolish all the rates relief contained in this Bill and in all agricultural rates relief legislation since 1939&mdash;all the £38 million worth of relief which the Minister for the Environment has claimed is being granted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, who is responsible for this Bill, is giving this power to the Minister for Finance.  That is a most unusual and undesirable precedent to set in the drafting of legislation.  If the effect of a Bill is to be radically altered it is a sound and indispensable principle of constitutional Government that the Minister responsible for the Bill should be the Minister entitled to alter it and that Minister should have to justify setting at nought the Bill and the purpose <Col N="801" /> for which it was introduced.  Yet in this Bill the Minister for Finance can abolish every relief granted in this Bill by changing a figure in one line of section 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974. The Minister for Finance can introduce a Finance Bill containing as many as 200 sections and he can substitute the figure &ldquo;0&rdquo; in a certain line of the Finance Act of 1974.  Simply by an amendment buried in a Finance Bill the entire agricultural rates relief legislation can be abolished.</P>
    <P>In assessing this Bill the farming community should pay even more attention to the potential it has than to the changes which are immediately taking effect in the rates they are now having to pay as a result of this Bill. The fact that farmers with over £60 valuations will have to pay perhaps twice as much rates next year as this year and that the farmers with over £75 valuations are having to pay twice as much this year is important, but of potentially far greater importance is the blank cheque which the Minister for the Environment through this Bill is handing to the Minister for Finance to enable him to abolish rates relief without consulting the Minister for the Environment.  We all know that a Bill must go before the Government before being introduced.  However, once it is introduced, if a Minister wishes to introduce an amendment, he can do so without consulting the Cabinet.  The Minister for Finance can amend the current Finance Bill which contains the figure &ldquo;60&rdquo; and substitute the figure &ldquo;0&rdquo; in 15 (3) of the Finance Act, 1974, and by that amendment agricultural land rates relief legislation can be abolished.  That is the enormity of the power being conferred by this Bill and the extent to which the Minister for the Environment is signing away his powers to grant agricultural relief.</P>
    <P>I protest against this Bill.  For the responsible Minister to give to another Minister the right to negate legislation is objectionable, and it would be objectionable in any Bill even if it were a Bill dealing with a minor aspect of government.  If any Bill contained a provision that the Minister responsible for the Bill could allow another Minister <Col N="802" /> to take responsibility and do away with the contents of the Bill without his having to go back to the House, it would be objectionable.  But it is all the more objectionable when it deals with a system of taxation which is basically unjust and which will be seen to bear very heavily on the agricultural community regardless of whether they make an income or not. The fact that reliefs in that context can be done away with simply by a minor change in a Finance Bill makes this constitutional impropriety all the more improper, and the Minister cannot justify it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point to the deafening silence from the Government benches with regard to this Bill, which has been debated here for weeks. Rarely if ever have I heard such a deafening silence.

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>During the last general election campaign I pointed out at many meetings that many of the promises being made by Fianna Fáil would be paid for in the manner that this Bill sets out.  I knew that much of the moneys would be recouped from the farming communities in this manner.  The appropriate person to have brought in this Bill was the Minister for Finance.  If he were not available and could not spare time to come here, the next person whose responsibility it was to put this Bill before the House was the Minister for Agriculture, because this Bill and the £7 million we are discussing relate to the farming community.  It is only from them that the money is being taken and only they are being affected.  For that reason there was an obligation on either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture to come here with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have the withdrawal of the £7 million from the farming community plus the fact that in the budget <Col N="803" /> the multiplier was increased and valuations reduced in the context of income tax.  Also, we now have the Finance Bill, 1978, being discussed in the House which in regard to the capital acquisitions tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going into the Finance Bill and we cannot discuss capital taxes on this Bill.  The Deputy must keep to what is in the Bill, nothing else.  I am sorry, but that is the rule of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Every available method of collecting finance from the farming community that one could imagine is being brought before the House.  In regard to the capital acquisition tax the ceiling, if you study the Finance Bill, has remained exactly the same in regard to devolving property from father to son, mother to son or daughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing capital taxation and we cannot do so on this Bill.  The Deputy will have every opportunity to do so on a future Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put this on record because of the importance of the fact that all these methods are being used to try to gather every possible penny from the farming community. They have been seriously and sorely let down in this Bill and the other items I have mentioned.  This is wrong and it is a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, rates are being taken off all private residences.  When it is wrong to have rates on private dwellings it is wrong that they should be left on agricultural lands, not only that, but callously and cruelly increased in a way that will cause great hardship. The people this Bill hits hardest are people who do not qualify for Health Acts relief, the farmers with children not qualifying for higher education grants.  Even if a farmer happens to be ill in hospital for years this Bill will hit him hard.  The Bill utterly and completely discriminates against the farming community.  It is a Bill against which a farmer cannot appeal and for this reason it is one of the worst pieces of legislation to come before the Dáil <Col N="804" /> and to be bulldozed through by the Government in silence.  That is what is happening today and it is wrong.  The people who are being hit by it will long remember the Government for pushing it down their necks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It may seem rather strange that I, since we do not have many dairy farmers or beef farmers in Dún Laoghaire, should intervene in this debate.  But it is appropriate that the House should consider the Bill in its Final Stage in the context of the overall package of the Government on three aspects in terms of the expenditure planned by the Government, in relation to local government and the Government package in relation to the rating situation generally.  Also, there is to be circulated in the near future the Rates Regulations Bill.  It would come as no surprise if we should see in relation to that Bill the true unfolding of the future strategy of the Government in regard to the role of rates in financing the Government's expenditure programme.</P>
      <P>The most important feature of this Bill is the duplicity involved.  The last election was in many ways a money election.  People were promised aspects of relief which we knew were unattainable, for which we knew somebody would have to pay in the long run.  Slowly but surely the birds are coming home&mdash;more appropriately perhaps, the cows are beginning to come home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A few of them will be sold off to pay rates bills in the next few months.  We in the Labour Party had forewarned the farming community that the creation of expectations of largesse implicit in the Fianna Fáil Party programme could not be justified, or was not attainable and that ultimately they would have to pay through the nose for the Government's expenditure programme.  When the Government have been a year in office all one can say to the Minister <Col N="805" /> is that the party of reality is now facing reality.  The Minister, as Minister for the Environment, is like his predecessor in a Department where one faces reality every morning.  The reality is that this is something his party did not put before the electorate in the last election and something which I have no doubt will be remembered by the electorate in the years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a most extraordinary Bill to come before the House so shortly after an election in the light of the promises of the Minister and his colleagues during that campaign.  The Bill is also extraordinary in its title.  It is extraordinary to have a Bill brought in to increase rates when the election campaign fought by the Minister and his colleagues was to abolish and to reduce rates.  The point was made by many Deputies on the introduction of this Bill that in the election campaign not only did the Fianna Fáil candidates campaign on the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings, but the impression was widely given that a reduction for all those who would still be rated would be given.  This Bill is far from giving a reduction in rates.  Probably because of its title it has given a wrong impression and has not got the publicity it deserves.  Not only has the silence on the other side of the House been deafening, as a former speaker said, but the silence of the media has also been deafening.  I wonder if the farming organisations, and their representatives in the media, have read the contents of the Bill as carefully as Members have.  The Minister's colleagues on the Government side read it so carefully that they decided to stay out of the House during the debate.</P>

    <P>It is unfortunate that the Government decided to make up the money lost by the abolition of domestic rates by increasing rates paid by a section of the community involved in producing food.  I have no doubt that this Bill will increase the cost of producing food and when that happens that increase will be passed on to the consumer.  The Minister may say that only the ranchers and owners of big farms will have to bear this or that the mood of <Col N="806" /> the country is that such people should be taxed.  That may be so this year for the majority who will have to pay the rates but the fact is that the valuation limit will be reduced from £75 to £60 next year and that will mean that a sizeable portion of our food-producing community will be caught.</P>
    <P>There is no credit due to the Government for making this decision when people are finding it increasingly difficult to keep food on the table.  The protest made by the Opposition parties in relation to this Bill has not got the publicity it deserves.  It is unfortunate also that Members on the Government side did not contribute to the debate. If Members on that side had contributed we might have been successful in our efforts to change some sections of the Bill.  The Minister might have accepted the arguments put forward by the Opposition and the Bill might have been given an easier passage through the House.  I hope that when the Bill is passed we will not have a continuation of this system of taxation.  I hope we will not have a further reduction in the valuation limit because that would be disastrous. I hope the Minister does not reduce the eligibility limit to £50 or £40.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party secured a majority in the last general election on a number of promises and it is to be deplored that at this early stage in the life of this Government they are going back on some of the promises they made.  They gave the impression that they would do certain things without the slightest inclination that they would tax farmers in this fashion.  The mood of the country may have been to tax farmers, and to bring a certain number of farmers into the tax bracket is palatable but to insist on this important food-producing section of the community paying rates whether they make a profit or not is wrong.  If it was income tax they would not have to pay it if they did not make a profit.  It is terrible that they must pay such a tax if they do not make a profit.  It must be frightening for the farming community. I am sure representations were made to the Minister in relation to this matter but he has chosen to <Col N="807" /> ignore them and get the Bill through the House at all costs.  I want to add my word of protest at the decision to introduce this means of taxation on farmers.  We all know that farmers are prone to a bad year at least once every five or six years but those formers must pay that tax in the year they do not make a profit.  I am sure all Members agree with taxing farmers because every section of the community should pay its fair share of tax but it is deplorable that any section of the community be taxed in this fashion.  I hope this is the final stage in this taxaton and I long for the day when there will be a change of Government or Minister so that the relief that is so necessary for the food-producing section of our community is given.</P>

      <P>This Bill enables us to make £38.5 million available for the relief of rates on agricultural holdings this year.  The benefits are: 100 per cent derating for those under £20 valuation; 100 per cent for those up to £33 valuation on the first £20; from £33 to £75, 80 per cent on the first £20 and 30 per cent on all rates on agricultural land between £20 and £75.  That comes to a total of £38.5 million and it excludes those over £75 valuation who constitute 3 per cent of the total rated occupied holdings.  Even though they are excluded from the relief this year they can set this off against the income tax which they will be liable to pay. The Bill directly links the limit to the income tax threshold for full-time farmers.  Contrary to what Deputy Bruton said, the threshold cannot be changed without amending legislation which would have to be in the form of the Finance Bill.  The Dáil will have an opportunity of debating that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is of importance to people involved in industry. One must stress the casual approach to safety we see throughout industry on the part of employers and employees. This must be checked in some way or other.  A number of people are being injured permanently, suffer physical deformities for the remainder of their lives, and suffer different kinds of serious injury because safety standards and regulations are not observed.  If people are not aware of this, serious accidents will continue to occur.</P>
      <P>In many industries there are safeguards on machines to prevent accidents. Through pressure of work, or because people are anxious to get the work finished, on numerous occasions the safeguards are taken off by employers, employees and different people involved.  In many cases because of this injuries occur.  People lose their fingers, or their hand, or some part of their bodies, and they are physically deformed for the remainder of their lives. It is horrifying that this should occur.</P>
      <P>The Department of Labour, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, the trade unions, and so on, adopt an all too casual approach in allowing accidents to occur.  Occurring they are day in and day out.  The attention of Members of both Houses is drawn to this tragic fact all too often. The Department of Labour should have power to enable departmental inspectors to check whether minimum standard fittings and safeguards are on machinery.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Civil Legal Aid: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Mrs. Desmond on Tuesday, 9 May 1978:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls for the immediate implementation of the comprehensive scheme for civil legal aid and advice recommended by the Pringle Committee; and calls on the Minister for Justice as a matter of urgency to take the necessary steps to ensure (a) that the remedies and procedures of the courts are simplified and made more accessible, and (b) that a broad review of provision of legal services and access to legal education in Ireland is undertaken without delay.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;expresses its confidence in the Minister for Justice in relation to the exercise by him of his functions in regard to legal education, legal services, including legal aid in civil cases, and the accessibility of justice in the Courts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Justice.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time available to me I want to cover a few points related to this motion.  The first part relates to civil legal aid.  I covered a lot of that ground yesterday.  Basically I condemn the Minister and the Government for their failure to implement the provisions of the report.  It is clear from the report that a comprehensive scheme is recommended.  It is clear that a phasing-in scheme, or an interim scheme along the lines suggested in the Minister's statement, is not recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I condemn the Government for their delay in introducing this very desirable reform.  The Minister told us there has been a delay because he has been examining the report.  I observe from the front page of the report that the date it was presented to the Minister was 14 December 1977&mdash;five months ago.  How much more time does the <Col N="810" /> Minister want to examine the report? Not alone is the report totally detailed, but it includes a draft Bill, so the legislation was ready to roll immediately the Minister and the Government came to a decision.</P>
    <P>This is the problem.  They are unable to come to a decision in relation to this matter.  Why?  The Minister produced another excuse for delay.  He referred to the fact that the UK system was in operation for 27 years and that there had been further developments over the years.  Is this a reason for waiting another 27 years in case there may be still further developments in the UK system?</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to complexities. Of course it is a complex matter, but the committee spent their time in teasing out these complexities, introducing solid recommendations and a solid Bill.  On that basis I demand in the interests of the people who need this service that this report be implemented immediately.  The approach of the Minister and his Government is typical of their whole approach to law reform.  It is clear that they have no interest whatever in law reform.  I say quite deliberately that we have not had one measure from this Government since they came to power almost a year ago.  I mean, of course, one fresh measure, in case the Minister trips me up on the basis of the ground rents measure which was there before this Government came into office.</P>

      <P>The Minister is wasting my time.  Basically this report needs to be recommended and that covers the situation in relation to legal aid.</P>
      <P>Simplified access to courts is another major measure.  There are many other measures.  As I said yesterday, the Minister should take away the 100 per cent increase in the cost of issuing High Court proceedings.  I suggest an immediate increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court and the Circuit Court.  I suggest, in addition, that there should be more judges appointed to the Circuit Court and the District Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have better court accommodation and the courts should be more adequately staffed. People there work under very severe pressure.  I suggest the introduction of a small claims procedure.  Certain cases involving small claims, children, family law and so on should be heard in the evening after normal working hours.  These things could be considered and there would be very little expense involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to legal services, there is need for reform.  As a solicitor I have no fear in saying that there is need for real reform in that area.  Apprentices being taken on are charged fees.  This should be abolished.  There are no funds or scholarships available for people who want to become solicitors or barristers.  I believe that the limitations on people becoming solicitors should be abolished.  If there is difficulty about the provision of facilities, funds should be made available to the <Col N="812" /> Law Society to extend facilities.  There should be a change in emphasis in the training of law students so that they would be more aware of modern complexities in the field of social welfare and other fields.  There is also considerable room for reform in the barristers' field.  This Government have no interest in reform.  What is needed is an outlook, a vision, which will transform and reform the system.  The most important point is that what is needed to get matters under way is the immediate implementation of the recommendations of the Pringle Report, that is, the introduction of a comprehensive legal aid scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The experience of most people is that when someone is shouting it is in order to cover up a lack of knowledge of the topic about which he has been shouting.  Such people resort to compensating for this by shouting.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to see that Deputy Barry Desmond is leaving the House because he was one of the people who gave evidence to the Pringle Committee. The report of that committee is a most interesting document.  It is well worth reading and I hope that people other than lawyers will read it.  It is extremely easy for non-legal people like myself to read.  It appears that there is among certain members of the legal profession a kind of arrogance and a belief that they are the only people who know the truth of the law.</P>
      <P>I wish to make some comments in relation to the Pringle Report.  The committee first met on 10 May 1974. They held 89 meetings during three-and-a-half years of arduous deliberations and they met interested bodies from all over the world, from the UK, from countries in Europe, from different provinces in Canada and different states within the USA.  A very thorough job was carried out and they produced the best possible report.</P>
      <P>The motion states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls for the immediate implementation of the comprehensive scheme for civil legal aid and advice recommended by the Pringle Committee; and calls on the <Col N="813" /> Minister for Justice as a matter of urgency to take the necessary steps to ensure (a) that the remedies and procedures of the courts are simplified and made more accessible, and (b) that a broad review of provision of legal services and access to legal education in Ireland is undertaken without delay.</P>
    <P>Even the Pringle Committee did not call for the immediate implementation of their recommendations.  They refer to interim measures.  As the Minister said last night, this is highly complex.</P>
    <P>The Minister was accused by Deputy O'Keeffe of having rejected the Pringle Report.  This is absolutely untrue. Deputy O'Keeffe said: &ldquo;The Minister's statement can only be construed as a total rejection of the Pringle Report.&rdquo;  The Minister said: &ldquo;I am examining the recently published report of the Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice and I hope to submit proposals to the Government on the matter in the near future.&rdquo;  I do not know how anyone can say that is a rejection of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe suggested that the task of implementing the Pringle recommendations was simple in view of the fact that they have already a draft Bill contained in the report to the Minister.  The draft Bill referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe is not actually a draft Bill.  It is headings for a draft Bill.  The difference, if I may explain to the learned solicitor, is that it is the general scheme of the Bill&mdash;something quite different.  Any person involved in the reform of law, particularly a spokesman on law reform in Dáil Éireann, knows that the general scheme of a Bill is a document drawn up at a particularly early stage in the preparation of legislation and is not comparable to a draft Bill.  The latter has been through the processes <Col N="814" /> of being drafted by the parliamentary draftsmen and this has not.  There are the consultations which go on with the parliamentary draftsmen, as the former Tánaiste would know.</P>

      <P>That may well be.  He would agree that in no way could this be interpreted as a draft Bill.  He nods his agreement on that.  That is for Deputy O'Keeffe's information.  The Deputy in a parliamentary question a week ago referred to the Law Reform Commission and asked the Minister to introduce a Bill to give effect to the recommendations in the commission's first report.  I have here that report and it states as follows:</P>
      <P>It is circulated for comment and criticism and does not represent the final views of the Commission.</P>
      <P>In other words, they are not yet ready for the reforms in this document to be drafted in the form of a Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has rightly pointed out, it is ultimately the responsibility of the Government to legislate.  The previous Government set up the committee and they have reported to the present Minister.  It is up to him and his advisers to study carefully this very complex matter.  It could be very costly for the taxpayer.  Huge amounts of money could be wasted if the wrong kind of law reform or if piecemeal legislation not in the best interests of people were introduced.</P>
      <P>There is a general vagueness in the report with regard to an interim scheme.  On page 15 of the report it is stated:</P>
      <P>16.  General</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee recommends that if there is to be an interim Scheme <Col N="815" /> it should be modelled on the comprehensive Scheme but on a more limited scale.  The Board should be established, Community Law Centres and Legal Advice Centres should be set up at the earliest possible date and the same criteria for granting legal aid and advice should apply.</P>
    <P>17.  How an interim Scheme might differ from the comprehensive Scheme</P>
    <P>(a)  Legal aid might be confined to certain categories of cases which should certainly include:</P>
    <P>(i)  family law cases,</P>
    <P>(ii)  landlord and tenant cases,</P>
    <P>(iii)  consumer protection cases.</P>
    <P>These priorities should be kept under review.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Scheme might be confined to persons in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Scheme need not extend to tribunal proceedings.</P>
    <P>(d)  The legal advice system which is proposed in paragraph 4.4.3. of the Report might be deferred pending the introduction of a comprehensive Scheme, but some alternative legal advice scheme should be introduced.</P>
    <P>On page 17 they state in a letter to the Minister:</P>
    <P>1.  We were appointed a Committee by your predecessor on 10th May, 1974 with the following terms of reference...</P>
    <P>. . . To consider whether, pending the introduction of a fully comprehensive scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is where I differ with Deputy Desmond when she calls for a fully comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would be desirable and possible to develop as a matter of urgency a system of legal advice centres and legal aid in certain categories of cases which the Committee considered merited immediate consideration.</P>
    <P>They went on to mention 89 meetings.</P>

      <P>This is a large publication; it has 290 pages and one could pick all kinds of items out of it.  A wide range of submissions have been received by the committee.  There was a minority report by one of the members, from the Department of Finance, Mr. C.K. McGrath.  He was worried about the speed with which certain items might be implemented which might not prove possible.</P>
      <P>In the section dealing with terminology they made the following observations:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Legal Aid Board&rdquo; means the body recommended in Part V of the Report to have responsibility at national level for the administration of the Civil Legal Aid and Advice Scheme.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;law centre&rdquo;, &ldquo;community law centre&rdquo; or &ldquo;legal advice centre&rdquo; means a public office established or recognised under the terms of the Scheme for the purpose of providing legal aid or advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make the following suggestion to the Minister.  Throughout the country community information offices have been set up under the auspices of the National Social Services Council.  Some of these centres would be ideally suited for such work to be carried out in them and I think Deputy O'Keeffe agrees with me on this.  These information offices are doing tremendous work.  One of them in my constituency has a member of the staff of the Department of Social Welfare working in it and people no longer have to go into town to the Department for information.  The Minister might consider using the <Col N="817" /> community information offices rather than setting up special legal advice centres.</P>
    <P>For many young lawyers when they qualify there is the problem of getting briefs.  It takes time to work up a practice. In drafting legislation to cover a wide range one of the imponderables is the cost.  The committee stated that they estimate that the overall cost of the comprehensive scheme would be in the order of £2 million per annum and £1 million per annum for the interim scheme.  These matters must be borne in mind because ultimately the taxpayer will have to pay.  We must be careful to differentiate between advice and information.  Many people require information while others need advice. These factors must be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if all the groups who made submissions were brought together they would not come to unanimous agreement as to what ultimately should take place.  The Minister for Justice will have to exercise the judgment of Solomon to come up eventually with what is in the best interests of all.  We know that there is great need in family law cases.  We have always favoured the setting up of family courts.  Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the Fianna Fáil manifesto. We stated in that document that there was a need to update law reform. There is nothing dividing us on this issue.  It is a question of priorities and how quickly certain things should be done.</P>
    <P>On page 22 the committee reported as follows:</P>
    <P>1.2.  Terms of reference</P>
    <P>1.2.1.  We were not required, under our terms of reference, to consider whether a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice in civil matters was necessary.  The then Minister for Justice, when he addressed us immediately before our first meeting, said that the need for such a scheme was already well recognised.  The evidence we have received indicates that this is so.  Our approach, therefore, was to establish in relation to a legal aid and advice scheme&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the type of service to be provided;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> (b)  for whom and subject to what conditions it should be provided;</P>
    <P>(c)  how it should be provided;</P>
    <P>(d)  how it should be administered, and</P>
    <P>(e)  its cost and how that cost should be met.</P>
    <P>They say in the last paragraph of that section:</P>
    <P>The most difficult of these issues was the definition of the word &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; as it involves discussion on the philosophy behind the legal aid and advice scheme.</P>
    <P>There again are the difficulties we have been running into.  Who ultimately has the decision to make?  It is the Minister for Justice on the best advice available to him who has to make these decisions. In paragraph 1.3.1. on page 23 they say:</P>
    <P>First of all, our terms of references are for us &ldquo;to advise on the introduction&rdquo; of a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice.  We interpret this as making it incumbent on us to outline a comprehensive scheme but leaving us free to recommend the phasing of its introduction.</P>
    <P>Again they emphasise the phasing of its introduction.  They do not call for the whole lot to be implemented.  That would go counter to the paragraph which Deputy O'Keeffe earlier referred to.  This will take time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interpreting this in the way I think a lot of people will. I am quite sure that when Deputy Horgan is speaking he will interpret it quite differently from the way in which Deputy O'Keeffe interpreted some of the sections.  In paragraph 1.3.4. on page 24 they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Hidden&rdquo; need is not an easy term to define precisely.  We take it <Col N="819" /> to refer to the situation where a person, though having a legal problem, does not for one reason or another avail himself of legal assistance. Some of the contributory factors appear to be poverty, ignorance of the fact that there is a legal remedy or reluctance to approach a solicitor.  The concept of hidden need is now a widely accepted one in the legal aid and advice context.  In England and the United States, law centres have proved most effective in uncovering and meeting hidden need.  The experience of Free Legal Advice Centres, here, strongly suggests that there is need in this country also which is hidden.</P>
    <P>They go on in paragraph 1.3.5. to say:</P>
    <P>The point at issue here is whether a comprehensive legal aid and advice scheme should concern itself with the process whereby hidden need becomes known for articulated need.  Should the scheme be concerned, for example, with dissemination of information on aspects of the law which are likely to concern those in need and with research aimed at establishing the precise nature and extent of hidden need? Our view is that it should.  Equality of access to the law is hindered not only by lack of money but also by lack of information.  Financial support for litigation, on its own, certainly does not guarantee equality.</P>
    <P>It is an excellent recommendation that people be educated to their legal rights.  Our population should not be educated to go berserk, as they have in one country, where a legal action is taken every time a person crosses the street the wrong way.  People are subjected to legal action for such trivial matters every day of the week in that country.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about another matter in relation to family law.  I want to refer to the case where two lawyers represent respectively the husband and wife who are on the verge of breaking up.  The wife's lawyer may advise that <Col N="820" /> he can have an order issued by the court to throw her husband out of the house and not let him into the house for three months because he struck her.  That marriage might possibly have been saved if, instead of the two lawyers competing with each other and one telling the wife she is entitled to this, that and the other, a judge in a family court setting got everybody together to see if a reconciliation could be effected.  This is happening in certain cases.  Once the man has been put out of the house for three months there is no way that marriage will ever come together again.  Sometimes people are encouraged by young inexperienced social workers to proceed on those lines.  It is a very ticklish matter when we are dealing with the everyday lives of people.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to page 24, paragraph 1.3.6 which states:</P>
    <P>We do, on the other hand, recognise that &ldquo;need&rdquo; like &ldquo;demand&rdquo; could be virtually endless.  The education of the public as to their legal rights and remedies is clearly within the ambit of the type of scheme we are here discussing, but we do not suggest that it would be reasonable, under a comprehensive scheme, to divert resources to the pursuit of hidden need to such an extent that known needs could no longer be adequately catered for.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 1.3.8 on page 25 they say:</P>
    <P>One feature of the &ldquo;activist&rdquo; approach is that the pursuit of legal remedies would be encouraged. However, undue encouragement to pursue legal remedies is not always in the interests of those who have legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>That underlines the case I have just made about the possibility of a marriage breakdown that might not necessarily have taken place.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>Sometimes a person with a problem which is partly legal and partly social would be better advised not to take legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Those are the things which will give the Minister a lot to think about.  The <Col N="821" /> Pringle Committee took three-and-ahalf years to report.  This was very quick to bring out a report like this but we want the Minister to legislate very quickly without taking into consideration all the pros and cons of the matter. What the Minister legislates for will directly affect the lives of future generations of our people.  This legislation comes into everybody's home and it is very important that those things are borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I am reading those paragraphs to show the complexity of the problems which face the Minister in making his decision and also the drafters of the legislation.</P>
    <P>They say on page 26 in paragraph 1.3.10:</P>
    <P>The fact that views differ as to the objectives of a comprehensive legal aid and advice scheme emphasises the need for flexibility and pragmatism in developing it.  There is no such thing as a readymade blueprint for the ideal service.  Consequently, the basic structure and the legislation bringing it into being have to be such that they will allow for the speedy implementation of any changes which experience may show to be necessary.</P>
    <P>In the light of experience various changes can be brought about.  We have to proceed here with a certain amount of caution.  A lawyer once said to me many years ago &ldquo;Every time you legislate you erode the freedom of some person.  You can bring legislation up to date, you can get rid of old legislation and you can modernise legislation; but when you introduce new legislation you are eroding freedom to a certain extent.&rdquo;  It is very important that we encourage society to be responsible and not lean on the law all the time for small things.  I am not including in that the basics on which we are unanimously agreed in the House&mdash;the needs which we feel exists.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1.4.4 on page 27 puzzled me.  It states:</P>
    <P>With regard to the person who seeks advice on a matter which is entirely within the criminal field, the Minister agreed that it would be undesirable if any person in need of <Col N="822" /> such advice were turned away from a legal advice centre just because his or her problem was primarily or entirely in the criminal field.  The Minister stated that legal advice centres would be of little use if they were not staffed by persons with both common sense and a fair modicum of sympathy for people in need and that it would be unthinkable that, just because his or her problem was in the criminal area, they would not give to an enquirer in need of help, and perhaps at a loss as to where he should turn, enough advice to guide him.</P>
    <P>We know that free legal advice is available in criminal cases where the person has not got the ability to pay. However, that paragraph puzzled me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The next paragraph makes it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have selected certain paragraphs.  I have not made a detailed study yet.  It appeared to me from the Deputy's speech yesterday that he had not made the study he might have.</P>
      <P>I should like to come to another paragraph which impressed me very much, that is Recommendation (2) on page 29 where it is said:</P>
      <P>There should be a considerable degree of flexibility in the overall approach to the development of the legal aid and advice service and this should be provided for in the legal aid legislation.</P>
      <P>That is very important.  The Committee say, just above that on page 29, in paragraph 1.5.4:</P>
      <P>Any such recommendations should be brought to the attention of such bodies or persons as the Legal Aid Board may think fit.</P>
      <P>They followed that, in paragraph 1.5.5. with:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This aspect of the legal aid and advice service could be developed as the service itself grows but we cannot, at this stage, go beyond a general recommendation that the Legal Aid Board should, from the beginning, make provision for the analysis of the results of its work, <Col N="823" /> with a view to making appropriate recommendations to such bodies or persons as the Board may think fit.</P>
    <P>Again, the Pringle Committee is recommending caution.  I do not think anyone would disagree with me when I say that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has about three minutes left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Law reform is an on-going process.  It is on-going in the light of experience to a large extent. The provision of money will not overnight change our society and it is very important that that be realised.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to those people and all the various bodies who gave of their time to make submissions to the Pringle Committee and while doing so not only to compliment FLAC for the work they have been doing but to commend them also for the idealistic way in which they have performed their work.  I should like to pay tribute also to many individual solicitors whom I know personally who have taken on cases free of charge, solicitors who are not Members of this House who have taken on such cases, and there are many of them.  A large debt of gratitude is owed to them, and many of them are on in years.</P>
      <P>I do not think it will take all that length of time before this essential legislation is introduced.  Naturally it must go before the Government, be discussed and very carefully thought out.  There are many recommendations and a lot of food for thought.  We have waited three-and-a-half-years for this report.  Even if we have to wait another year it will not be that long in my view.  I do not know how long it will be before the Minister introduces this legislation but I know he will not do so until he is absolutely satisfied that it is right for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also fair to say, having complimented the legal profession, that some of them have a vested interest also in State moneys going to pay them large amounts.  Very shortly I will be putting a question to the Minister to ask the kind of fees paid over the last year <Col N="824" /> or so to certain solicitors.  I can think of one man who, in the past year, is reputed to have earned over £50,000, which is not bad money.  The legal profession also have a vested interest in free legal aid and, while we appreciate their contribution, that must be said of them in many instances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to believe that the law in general is not as neutral as it is widely supposed to be and as it is widely touted to be especially by lawyers.  The philosopher and author, Anatole France, once put it very neatly when he pointed out with a typically Gallic sense of irony that the law is alike to rich and poor where it forbids both rich and poor alike to sleep under arches.  That is a classic example of the way in which an apparently neutral piece of law in fact operates in a discriminatory way because, of course, we all know which of the rich and which of the poor are more likely to end up sleeping under arches along the Seine at night.  This motion is about something along these lines.  It does not perhaps go into this fundamental question of the neutrality or otherwise of the whole corpus of law but it deals very satisfactorily with the related question of the administration of and access to legal advice and legal remedies under our existing situation.  It does so specifically by mentioning this Pringle Report which has been mentioned and I believe praised on both sides of the House and goes on indeed&mdash;and this point should not be lost sight of&mdash;to widen the scope of the debate from that encompassed purely by the Pringle Committee's Report, which is the report of a Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice, to urge that a broad review of the provision of legal services and access to legal education in Ireland is undertaken without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several speakers have referred already to delay.  Naturally there will be different views on each side of the House as to what constitutes an acceptable delay.  I will refer to one point only in this, to one deadline which hangs over the Minister and it is not the deadline of a vote in this House.  This report has been on the <Col N="825" /> Minister's desk since December last, some five months ago.  There is at present going through the European judicial system, which to some extent overrides our own, the case of a woman from the same constituency I believe as the Taoiseach who is complaining, with what seems to me to be a great deal of justification, about the lack of access that she had in her case to legal remedies for the situation in which she found herself.  It is very probable that this case will end up before too long in the Court of Human Rights.  If that happens the Government will be in the extremely embarrassing situation of being proceeded against in the Court of Human Rights on the basis of Mrs. Airey's complaint while, at the same time, having the remedy to that complaint gathering dust on one of the very many shelves in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>That is a deadline the Minister cannot ignore.  More than that, the longer he leaves this report and the closer that any implementation of it, however partial, is to a judgment, a decision or a hearing in this particular case, the more he will find himself accused not of doing this thing because of its own internal validity but because he was being pressured into it by Europe.  I am sure the Minister would prefer to do something because it needed to be done than simply to be seen to be pushed, pulled or dragged unwillingly into it by the legal bureaucrats in Brussels and in the European judicial system.  I am not confident or hopeful that the Minister or the Government will act with any expedition on this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Deputy, the Minister said last evening he would be submitting proposals fairly soon to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Deputy, I would suggest that Ministers, and not only Ministers of Fianna Fáil administrations, have been known to make commitments like that and the phrase very soon has been discovered to have an elasticity that the framers of the Oxford Dictionary rarely imagined it to have.  I do not <Col N="826" /> doubt the Minister's intention and, indeed, his goodwill.  But it is one thing to submit proposals to a Government and another thing to force decisions out of perhaps an unwilling Cabinet and another thing again to get decisions into the form of a Bill, on to the floor of this House, voted on, passed and implemented.  If we had any doubt about the degree of delay we may expect to afflict a consideration of this report I think we should look with a keen sense of alarm at the speech made this afternoon by the Taoiseach establishing priorities for Government spending.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made it very clear that as far as he was concerned the priority would be jobs and he hinted very categorically, letting the cat out of the bag with a yowl such as has never been in the last 12 months, that anything which was not in the area of direct job creation was unlikely to feature very high up on the Government list of priorities.  To us, on this side, that kind of warning&mdash;and it was a warning&mdash;spells death, and a horrible and very quick death, for social spending.  What we are looking for here is social spending, tiny in comparison with total Government spending in the industrial and job creation area, but social spending nonetheless; and we are now served unambiguous notice that social spending under this Government, only a year in office, is already at risk.  There are relatively few jobs in legal aid. Perhaps if the legal system were better organised there might be more.  As against that, the rights, the aspirations, the fears of countless numbers of people are involved and one cannot put a price on those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than go through the recommendations of the report, particularly the positive recommendations which have been urged on the Minister at some length, I want to warn the Minister against one particular section of the report because it is a section which gives him the excuse for doing nothing. It is not, properly speaking, a section of the report.  It is a minority report written and signed by Mr. C.K. McGrath.  It constitutes a classic argument for doing nothing.  On page 188 <Col N="827" /> this minority report comments on the conclusions and recommendations of the majority report.  It says:</P>
    <P>(1)  the community has indicated neither a need nor a desire to provide public funds to finance private actions in civil legal matters;</P>
    <P>(2)  most likely, the beneficiaries of public expenditure on civil legal aid and advice would not be the poor and the deprived but the legal profession and persons reasonably able to pay for essential legal services from their own resources;</P>
    <P>(3)  a State-financed scheme would be bound to generate a considerable volume of non-essential legal actions which would rarely, if ever, serve any useful social purpose;</P>
    <P>(4)  once introduced, a civil legal aid scheme could not be contained without creating widespread dissatisfaction and could only lead eventually to costly State involvement in the private legal sector.</P>
    <P>These words can be translated into one simple phrase and, with all due respect to the person concerned&mdash;I respect his opinions&mdash;that phrase is: &ldquo;Nobody should ever do anything for the first time&rdquo;.  More than that, there is at the core of these reservations, which will be the core of opposition to the report and the core of attempts to water it down and delay it, a fundamental contradiction which, I believe, the author of this minority report has not adequately faced up to.  It is particularly well expressed in No. (4): &ldquo;once introduced, a civil legal aid scheme could not be contained without creating widespread dissatisfaction and could only lead eventually to costly State involvement in the private legal sector&rdquo;.  That is completely contrary to No. (1): &ldquo;the community has indicated neither a need nor a desire to provide public funds to finance private actions in civil legal matters&rdquo;.  Either of those statements can be true, but both cannot be.  If it is true that the introduction of a free civil legal aid scheme will be widely availed of and will be expensive, then it is not true <Col N="828" /> that the community do not feel or perceive the need for such a scheme.  It is far more likely to be true that, once such a scheme is introduced, the community will avail of it because people will become aware, perhaps for the first time, of many of their actual and legal rights.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to this whole argument is the question of perception.  People do not perceive some rights are legal and, even if they perceived them, they have no idea how to go about claiming them.  For most people who never go to law and never think of any reason for going to law the legal profession and the lush pastures that profession inhabits are less familiar to them than the territory depicted for them in &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo;.  It is a country of foreigners whose language and customs they do not understand, and are not encouraged to understand. There are many reasons for this.  One of the main reasons is the growth over the years of the legal profession itself and the way in which it has developed. It is, I think, true to say that the legal profession has focussed on two main areas.  It has focussed on areas involving substantial amounts of money and on areas involving civil rights.  It has always been quicker to follow money than it has been to establish rights for the very simple reason that, until comparatively recently, there was absolutely no access at all to the legal profession unless one had the money to pay.</P>
    <P>I remember a conversation with a distinguised jurist, Mr. Seán McBride, in which he pointed out how much could be learned from an analysis of the type of cases most commonly in the court over the past 50 or 60 years. Up to the end of the last century by far the most common cause of action was an action for breach of the electoral laws.  Half a century later the most common case was a running down action.  There are social reasons for these trends and developments and, because the legal profession has been one entirely in the private sector, the question of using that system to establish people's rights and giving people access to that system has often taken a very poor second place indeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> I further believe that the trend in the provision of legal services to which I have already referred has been reinforced and has perpetuated itself in the system of legal education which is referred to specifically in this motion. I should like to discuss legal education under two headings: access to it and the content of it.</P>
    <P>I found it extraordinary some years ago, when I attended a meeting of the Young Solicitors' Society, to hear the then president of that society standing up and averring that there were no barriers to entry to the legal profession. To their credit there were some young solicitors who disagreed vociferously with that.  It cannot be entirely an accident that when we see in the papers the names and addresses of those who were called to the Bar and those who were given solicitors' parchments, they almost invariably reflect the better off areas of the larger conurbations. It is statistically and socially impossible that that should be an accident. Of course it is not an accident, because of the way the education system in general works and within the education system in general the legal education system in particular.  It is not impossible to see in the barriers that are erected, even to many middle class children who may want access to the legal profession, the desire in the legal profession, which is common to all professions, to protect first and foremost their own level of income and on occasion to disguise that understandable self-interest behind the allegation that what they are really protecting are professional standards.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the content of legal education in no way reflects the real needs of the majority of the population.  I can speak of this with some personal experience because I was a law student once.  I was a fellow member of the law society in University College Cork with Deputy O'Keeffe, and a solicitor's apprentice for many years&mdash;unsuccessfully in the end because I went to journalism instead&mdash;in solicitors' offices in Cork and Dublin.  When I think back on the law I studied then&mdash;and it is not that different from the law being studied by many of our solicitors' apprentices now&mdash;and compare the <Col N="830" /> training I was getting then to the work I am doing now as a public representative, it seems that the separation in time is also a separation almost of philosophy, in culture and in every other way that matters.</P>
    <P>I could give the House a simple example.  Every public representative will know that there are very large numbers of cases of legal or para-legal nature which we deal with in our advice clinics in relation, above all, to social welfare law and to the law of employer and employee.  How much of this social welfare law, of trade union law, of employment rights law, of women's rights law, finds a place, much less an honoured place, in the curricula of our legal educational institutions today?  If it does not, and I suspect it does not, it is because there is largely no money in it and because solicitors and barristers have to earn their bread like everybody else.</P>
    <P>This is why we need a free legal aid scheme.  It is better that solicitors and barristers should be earning their bread doing and pursuing work to establish the basic human and legal rights of the vast majority of the population than that they should be earning disproportionately large sums on behalf of a tiny section of our population.</P>
    <P>Another sidelight on access to free legal aid can be seen if we examine the structure of the various Departments I am talking about and compare them with the real needs of the people.  Many of the legal problems with which we find ourselves dealing cannot be dealt with by the public servants in the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health or the Department of Labour for the very good and simple reason that these public servants by and large shut up shop at 5 or 5.30 in the evening.</P>
    <P>One thing you will note about public advice centres, both those operated by the Department of Social Welfare, which are good but few in number, and those operated by public representatives is that they take place at the times of the day and night when, and at the only time, ordinary working people are free to attend them.  That is why we have no nights and no weekends. I do not object to doing that because <Col N="831" /> I think it is a fundamental part of our role as public representatives, but it is an example of the failure of a system which exists to meet the needs it purports to meet.</P>
    <P>It stands to reason that there is no future in establishing a civil legal aid system if we are simply going to pump more State money into a system which is already discriminatory and characterised by inequalities of access, by irrelevancies of curricula and all sorts of other anomalies.  At the same time, we must reform the profession itself, access to it, and education to it.  As our motion says, we urge that &ldquo;a broad review of provision of legal services and access to legal education in Ireland is undertaken without delay.&rdquo; When we look at the Minister's amendment we find that we are asked to express our confidence in him &ldquo;in relation to the exercise by him of his functions in regard to legal education, legal services....&rdquo;  The Minister for Justice has precious little to do with legal education.  I know the Minister for Education has no function with regard to legal education, because I put down a question to him and it was disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle. We are asked to express our confidence in the Minister's ability to do something about something over which he has no control.</P>
    <P>This is why our motion calls for an urgent inquiry into these matters. The Minister could have accepted at least this part of our motion because it does not depend on the implementation of anything in the Pringle Report. It stands by itself as a valid expression of a need for our legal system and our legal education.  If we had shown any willingness to intervene at long last and investigate the adequacy of our legal education, the out of date division between barristers and solicitors which has been attacked, and all sorts of other anomalies, I would have been satisfied.  I would like to see the Minister take on the legal profession, if necessary.  I would also like to see more evidence of this Government, or any Government, being more willing to take on the professions.</P>
    <P>George Bernard Shaw, a great Irishman <Col N="832" /> and socialist, once described all professions as a conspiracy against the laity.  Thank goodness, that is not always true.  But what is true of our motion is that we see a need in the professional and service area, at least as much as we have always traditionally done in the industrial and democratic area, to allow the consumers of these services to begin to indicate what their real needs are.  As long as we allow the provision of these services to be dictated only by the people who produce them then it is as clear as anything can be that the gap between the provision and the need will continue to be wide and to grow to the point where ordinary innocent people in our society will suffer needlessly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Mrs. Desmond on placing this motion before the House.  The Pringle Committee was appointed on 10 June 1974 by the then Minister for Justice, now Senator Cooney, and reported on 14 December of last year.  His Honour Mr. Justice Finlay, the President of the High Court, on page 36 of this report said:</P>
      <P>With the increasing complexity of law and litigation the inequality arising from the absence of representation to one party in an action where his opponent has legal advice and representation has now reached alarming proportions.  This is particularly true where the reason for the absence of legal representation is poverty, since persons in low income groups are, in general, persons with an inadequate capacity to communicate.... Whilst therefore, legal aid in civil cases has long probably been a desirable social objective it has now, in my opinion, become a necessity, if the courts are to function justly and with the public appearance of, and reputation for, justice....</P>
      <P>That sums up the situation exactly. Part two of the report at page 150 paragraph 10 says:</P>
      <P>Under a comprehensive Legal Aid Scheme, legal aid should be available to eligible persons in respect of all types of civil proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> These two points emphasise the necessity for a comprehensive free civil legal aid system.  This is a matter of great public concern.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is probably aware, legal services have been used on occasions by people with no means. Solicitors and barristers have on occasions brought cases without payment or hope of compensation because they felt that the cases were just.  These cases were brought to court because of the generosity and kindness of the barristers and solicitors involved but not as of right.  People should not be put in a situation where they have to depend on kindness, they should have the right.  People from different walks of life who have not had the benefit of a full education are not in a position to speak for themselves in court. They appear in court and they cannot speak for themselves.  They are unable at times to comprehend whether or not they have a case.  When they go to a solicitor's office they feel that all the proceedings are above them and they are far removed from the solicitor's approach.  They also feel that to bring cases is far too costly and they are generally reluctant to go to court. Because of all this it is a sad fact of life that many poor people are deprived of their basic human rights and their constitutional rights in relation to justice.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on all of us as legislators if we do not make every effort to remedy that situation.  There are situations where tenants suffer seriously because landlords being aware of their rights and knowing that the tenant is not aware of his rights, manipulate and generally extort benefits from these people.  There are cases where large companies because of their strength and capacity are able to enforce their rights and extend the law to its fullest and at times go beyond it to deprive people of their rights.  In consumer affairs there are situations where people are deprived of their rights.  A report was published recently dealing with the Department of Social Welfare stating that people were not aware of their rights as regards social welfare and that some of the people discharging duties in the Department of Social Welfare were not <Col N="834" /> aware of the rights of the people they were dealing with.  There are countless examples where successful cases could be brought against the Department of Social Welfare.  I am giving these instances to emphasise the importance of these rights.  There are many areas, family law being very important, where it is essential that legal advice be given to the people.  Legal advice can be given by written and oral submissions from solicitors and barristers and in legal aid, the full case is brought to court and a person is represented by a solicitor and barrister.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the English system of civil legal aid was having a lot of difficulties.  There are difficulties but they have at least tackled the problem and have benefited a lot of deserving people.  No matter when the scheme is brought in here there will be difficulties but no matter what the difficulties are in implementing it and in administering it we should not be deterred from making an effort to introduce legislation which we can improve as we go along.</P>
    <P>In relation to legal costs it is essential that our existing court framework is investigated.  The way in which our courts operate is largely responsible for the costings, and the Minister referred to this in his amendment.  In the district courts in some of our bigger towns such as Limerick, Cork, Athlone Portlaoise and so on, there are situations where there are very long lists, and it is quite common for the courts to have to adjourn at five o'clock in the evening and people who have been summoned to appear at 11 o'clock that morning are obliged to return the following fortnight or month to have their cases heard.  That puts a nervous strain on people, most of whom are nervous of appearing in court, and it also imposes a financial strain.</P>
    <P>Similarily, I regard as highly unsatisfactory our present arrangements in regard to the circuit courts and the sessions that are held around the country.  It would be enlightening to visit any country town when a session is being held and see the situation on a Monday or Tuesday morning.  The place is packed with jurors, up to 50 or 60 of them from different parts of <Col N="835" /> the county for the hearing of criminal cases.  You have witnesses and litigants for civil cases.  You have solicitors, counsel, doctors, engineers and so on awaiting the hearing of their cases. The situation is such that at times&mdash; and I can prove this; I can show a list of these cases&mdash;often 50-100 cases are all timed for 11 a.m. on a Monday or Tuesday morning.  That is not good enough because it calls into question the whole legal system and brings it into disrepute.  This is wrong and those administering the system should be questioned.  A review is absolutely essential; if it is not carried out the whole system will be clogged up and brought to a halt.  The manner in which the lists are produced at present is a scandal.  There must be a review.</P>
    <P>What I say might not be popular but somebody must say it; somebody must see that it stops and that the procedure is rectified.  In the case of the High Court a number of cases are set down in the list for hearing and people troop up from all over the country, the west, the south and the midlands.  Next thing, the case before theirs is not settled and goes forward for hearing and all those people travel back home again at great expense and these may be people who are suffering as a result of accidents, people who have been injured and so on.  They return home and the worry and strain is still with them.  In a few months' time they must come back up again to have their cases heard.  That is not good enough.  It causes expense, trouble and difficulty for litigants.  That position must be rectified and the sooner the better.  The work should begin tomorrow.  This is essential.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I have not an opportunity of going on much longer because this is a very important subject.  As I said at Question Time the other day, we have ten High Court judges but only eight available courtrooms so that in Ireland in 1978 there is a situation in which a judge who wants to hear cases and who is available has no courtroom in which to hear them.  When a man is paid £14,221 <Col N="836" /> and has no place in which to do his work it calls for investigation.  It is a serious situation.  It creates expense and difficulty and is unsatisfactory.  It is wrong.  More judges must be provided and there must be an adequate number of courtrooms.  A complete review of our whole legal system and its administration is essential and in addition there must be a comprehensive legal aid system introduced immediately. Unless that is done we are depriving people of their natural and constitutional rights and continuing a situation where might is right and where wealth is all-powerful and where a poor man has little chance against a strong man.</P>

      <P>In tabling this motion and initiating the very useful debate we have had I had hoped to gain an assurance that the commitment to social justice which the present Government have was adequate to provide a sufficient response to calls repeatedly made in the recent past for change and improvement in the legal system and provision of legal services generally.  I have reason, as would anybody listening to this debate and particularly to the Minister, to believe that this may not be so.  Our fears were first awakened, as I said in my opening remarks, by the reference in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to &ldquo;a first step&rdquo; in the provision of legal aid, a first step which indicated that legal aid would be confined to particular cases. The debate has proceeded since and one may say has culminated in the publication of the Pringle Report.  It was disconcerting to find in a Seanad debate some two months after the publication of this report the Minister stating that he would be dealing with the question of legal aid for particular types of people, including family law, as an interim measure.  It should not be necessary to repeat that all aspects of family are of vital importance and we cannot conceive of family law as enacted by the previous Government being effective without free legal aid. That case was cogently made by all speakers on each side of the House on that occasion.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made forcefully also in this debate and in the Pringle <Col N="837" /> Report which has been referred to so often and so effectively in this debate. The Minister dealt in the Seanad debate, as he did last evening, with the complexity of introducing a comprehensive scheme or, indeed, any scheme.  The complexities which he listed such as the assessment of applications, the award of costs and damages, the question of means tests&mdash;all these are just as relevant to a comprehensive scheme as to an interim scheme and <i>vice versa.</i>  It is no argument for postponing the implementation of a comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>All these things are considered in the report itself and what remains to be done is to take a simple political decision to implement a comprehensive scheme or an interim scheme.  The Minister has given us neither.  He has said that he is considering the report and has indicated that he will be coming up with something far short of a full measure.  In supporting his case he quoted very selectively from the report, as also did Deputy Briscoe in his contribution.  It appears from the quotations given by both of them and from their obsession with quotations to back up the case for an interim scheme, that this, in fact, is what is already decided on but we have not been told when even this interim scheme will be introduced.  There is no commitment to a deadline or even an approximate deadline.  The only reference in this regard made by the Minister was that the report published in England preceded the implementation of a scheme by three years.  I hope this does not indicate that he envisages three years elapsing between the publication of this report and the implementation of a free legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>He spoke of a detailed consideration of the report and definitely that is merited.  He has now had the report for five months and he had the human resources necessary to come to a decision within that period.  I have studied the report very carefully and the recommendations are very clearly in favour of a full, comprehensive scheme of free legal aid.  The references made to an interim scheme appear only to have been made because they were asked in their terms of reference to <Col N="838" /> consider also an interim scheme.  In their terms of reference as stated in the report at paragraph 1.2. they say:</P>
    <P>We were not required, under our terms of reference, to consider whether a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice in civil matters was necessary.  The then Minister for Justice, when he addressed us immediately before our first meeting, said that the need for such a scheme was already well recognised.  The evidence we have received indicates that this is so.  Our approach, therefore, was to establish in relation to a legal aid and advice scheme....</P>
    <P>They had found that a full comprehensive aid scheme was necessary. In summarising the recommendations in Part 2 of the report on the services which should be provided the committee stated:</P>
    <P>Legal advice and legal assistance in civil matters should be available in relation to all types of legal problems...</P>
    <P>Throughout the report there is the recommendation that all types of legal problems should be covered.  One would have to quote very selectively indeed to prove otherwise, as the Minister and Deputy Briscoe tried to do.  The committee also recommended that:</P>
    <P>Under a comprehensive legal aid scheme legal aid should be available to eligible persons in respect of all types of legal proceedings.  We do not consider that the phasing in of a legal aid scheme by reference to categories of cases is desirable but it would be possible to do so.</P>
    <P>If there has to be phasing by reference to categories of cases, then the order of priority should be...</P>
    <P>The report went on to list the priorities. The report states the view of the committee if there had to be phasing, but the committee were not in favour of it.  They recommended that if there had to be phasing it should be carried out to a definite timetable with a view to the development of a comprehensive scheme at the earliest possible date.  Why does the Minister not tell the House where he intends to start? He should commit himself to a deadline <Col N="839" /> by which he hopes to implement a full comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>The report went on to recommend that the Legal Aid Board should be established, that the same criteria for assessment of cases should apply, that a system of law centres and legal advice centre should be developed at the earliest possible date.  They regarded those as indispensable and urgent.  All the structures for the implementation of a full comprehensive scheme is recommended strongly by the committee. In so far as they talked of an interim scheme they say that such a scheme might be confined to a smaller section of the population, but they were not in favour of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe spoke in the context of pending the introduction of the scheme but in my view in doing so he was quoting the report out of context.  The paragraph he was referring to states:</P>
    <P>If it is considered necessary to introduce an interim scheme of legal aid and advice, pending the introduction of a fully comprehensive Scheme, then the interim Scheme should be on the general lines proposed on this Part of the Report.  In particular it should provide for the establishment of Legal Advice Centres and Community Law Centres as a matter of urgency....</P>
    <P>In that respect the committee were dealing with it only as a contingency and certainly were not recommending it.</P>
    <P>The report emphasised clearly the need to publish any scheme of legal aid that might be introduced.  I agree with that recommendation because, as the committee maintained, experience in other countries had shown that, where legal advice and legal aid schemes were in operation, they had been in existence for many years before a high proportion of people living in poor circumstances&mdash;those for whom the schemes was introduced&mdash; became aware of their existence.  It is important that the fullest publicity is given to such a scheme when it is introduced.  Deputy Horgan referred to the lack of response from some areas <Col N="840" /> to submissions in the report but I suggested that it is because of the irrelevance of the law for so many sections of our people.  They do not see this as pertaining to them at all. That is the case.  We want an education process as far as the law is concerned and we want equal access to the law for all sections of the community.  It is to hasten that that we have tabled this motion.</P>
    <P>In the past the poor have been deterred from seeking the services of solicitors through lack of knowledge. Many sections of the community have what amounts to a superstition of the law.  We have all heard people say that they would like to keep as far away from the law as possible.  The law should serve people in a better way. For that reason the scheme must be reviewed and the law must be more accessible to our people.  We must develop a broader view generally of legal services.  The first barrier to remove is the financial one, and that can be removed by the implementation of a full comprehensive scheme of legal aid.  It will not be removed totally by a partial scheme.  It appears to be the Minister's intention to introduce a partial scheme.  For instance, a partial scheme that will apply only to family law will be dealing with the tip of the iceberg and the plethora of problems of a legal nature which could lead to their manifestation in family law cases would not be dealt with.  There is no way we could have a situation obtaining where some cases in which people may seek a legal remedy would be dealt with under the free legal aid scheme and others left to be dealt with by the voluntary system of paying as at present.  Such a situation would be ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I know the removal of the financial barrier would not remove all the barriers, but each barrier must be dealt with separately.  A start will have to be made in the financial area. There should be a broad review of the legal services which, I suggest, should take the form of a commission. A Royal Review Commission is at present operating in England and a separate commission operating in Scotland, but no move has been made here <Col N="841" /> to undertake any review of the whole question of the revision of our legal services.  We have a structure which is compartmentalised into barristers and solicitors and this exists more for the legal profession than for the public.  It is heartening to find members of the legal profession admitting that and leading the call for a change in the structure of their own profession.  It would serve their profession good to have that general view.  There are long delays in providing services and it is not, in the main, necessarily a good <Col N="842" /> service for the public.  There are constant complaints and sometimes mistrust. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision.  We cannot accept his amendment in view of his contribution.  We ask the House to accept this motion because of the great need there is for a review of the legal services here and making the law relevant for the least well off sections of our community.</P>

It is understood that the same position obtains during the current school term.  The service may be restored only from a date from which the relevant conditions are fulfilled. For this purpose a minimum of ten eligible children availing themselves of the service on a regular basis will be required.</P>
