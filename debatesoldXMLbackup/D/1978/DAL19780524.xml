      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate on this Bill I was dealing with the concessions given in the budget to the private sector in an effort to create more employment.  Those concessions were very good.  We could all say a lot about how to create employment but it is my view that those matters should be dealt with during the debate on the various Estimates.  However, in dealing with this Bill we can refer to what the budget proposes doing in order to create the right atmosphere to employ people.  The budget was introduced to create the climate for more employment. As far as the public sector is concerned a reasonable effort was made by the Government to do for that sector what it is proposed to do for the private sector.  I was disappointed that the private sector did not respond to the incentives given in the budget.  It is only right that somebody should sound a note of warning about the seriousness of the situation if the private sector does not respond to the generous incentives given in the Bill to create <Col N="1616" /> employment.  Small industries and others were given tax incentives.  The private sector was given every encouragement in the budget to create more employment; in fact, many people believe that sector was given too much.</P>
      <P>I am a firm believer in the State playing a major role in the creation of employment and I was astonished to hear people complaining about the fact that the tax was taken off our co-operatives.  The co-operative movement is in competition with the private sector and if the latter sector was given a tax concession there is no reason why it should not have been given to the co-operatives.  I am anxious to show the inconsistency of the Opposition who maintain that we are not doing enough for the private sector but tell us we are wrong when we remove the tax on co-operatives.  It should be remembered that the State cannot continue to give concessions to the private sector if there is no response to the incentives granted in the budget.  It is important that people are taken off the unemployment register.  If we must continue to pay the same amount in unemployment benefit then the State cannot continue to give incentives to industry to create employment. The private sector should sit back and take note of that matter. That sector has been given the goahead to do a job and must realise that the State cannot afford to help them and at the same time pay a huge bill for unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that some business people have taken a serious view of this matter.  I know some cut down their profits in order to create more jobs. I told one business man who had cut his profits in order to create employment that he had made a very patriotic decision but he did not agree.  He felt that the decision was for his benefit because if the unemployment situation got out of hand the person without property or a business would not suffer.  The need for employment for our young people is a burning question at present.  We can all call for the setting up of youth organisations and other bodies but if we leave an educated young people unemployed for a long period we are creating a breeding <Col N="1617" /> ground for violence.  I saw a lot of unemployment in the 1930s but it was an uneducated unemployed the country had to deal with then.  They are not nearly as dangerous as unemployed people who have a couple of honours in the leaving certificate.  There is a grave danger to democracy here if we do not do something about providing employment for our youth.  If that is not done we may reach the situation when there will be no respect for this House.  That is why those with money and a stake here should realise that we all have a job to do, irrespective of who is in power.  We must realise that if those with brains do not put them to good use they will put them to bad use.  There is little use in comparing the unemployment situation which exists now with that which existed in the 1930s.</P>
    <P>In relation to the creation of employment I should like to state that I was disappointed at the attitude of the commercial banks who issued a statement recently to the effect that they intended taking on former employees for temporary employment.  They want a closed shop situation.  Those banks have made a lot of profit in recent years and they should be giving example to the private sector.  We are asking everybody in the private sector to help in the creation of jobs and the banks should be giving a lead. Many people who have been asked to help in this drive are questioning this decision of the banks.  They are not giving good example in not employing young people.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some misunderstanding in relation to the employment incentive and who is qualified to collect it.  I attended a meeting recently at which two builders were present and they told me that they failed to get the incentive for two or three people they employed because, they maintained, that some of the people who have been a long time on the unemployment register are considered unemployable.  Apparently young people have to be two months on the unemployment register.  I explained to these two builders that this was necessary because if a job were to come up in my area and I was not unemployed <Col N="1618" /> I could go immediately and register and get the job and this would not reduce the unemployment level.  These men said that enough information was not available in the local labour exchanges or from the Manpower service in relation to the qualifications. Last year a number of business people told me that if an incentive was given across the board they would employ extra young people.  Because the stamp is so costly they wanted an incentive to employ young people.  The incentive is there now but there seems to be some misunderstanding.  I was astonished when people told me how hard it is to get this incentive.  I would be glad if the Minister would refer to this when replying.</P>
    <P>The budget and employment is what this Finance Bill is all about.  A survey was done recently in Ballinasloe and it transpired that 48 per cent of the people in the town were under the age of 25.  We must look at this very seriously with a view to dealing with them.  I congratulate the Minister on the increases given in the personal allowances.  All employees are better off now than they were.  There are complaints from married women but taking it all in all the increases were very good.  The single person's allowances have gone up from about £700 to over £900.  I had a case recently where an old age pensioner was a caretaker in a dispensary and between the old age pension and the wages she had to pay £75 income tax.  That person does not have to pay income tax now because of the increase.  I congratulate the Minister on the increases because while I am critical in some respects I give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that there was no increase in children's allowances in the Finance Bill and that although in every Finance Bill there are increases in the old age pensions there is no increase in the eligibility limit for an old age pension.  In 1978 if a single person has over £6 per week he is disqualified for the full old age pension and if a person has over £15 he gets no pension and the limit for a man and his wife is £12 to get the full pension. That is all wrong.  The old age pensions have been increased yearly in the Finance Bills but the eligibility limit <Col N="1619" /> has not been increased in line with inflation.  In relation to the prescribed relative's allowance it would save a lot of money if this allowance was given irrespective of the number of adults in the house rather than have these people kept in hospital.  A number of old people who would like to be kept at home cannot be kept because their relative gets nothing for minding them if another adult lives in the house.  A while ago a young girl came to me saying that her husband had been getting an allowance for minding his father but had lost it. I explained the situation to her and told her that it would have to be a choice between her and the allowance, because when he had married and brought a second adult into the house he automatically lost the allowance for the father.  This is all wrong.  The money should be paid irrespective of who is in the house.  It would cost a lot more money to keep these people in State institutions.</P>
    <P>In relation to farmer taxation, as a member of the farming community I always believed that farmers should pay tax provided they earned enough. Up to recently that was not the case. There is a lot of talk about the increases the farmers are now getting. These increases are in line with the national wage agreement.  Basically I do not agree with percentage increases because they make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  However, the increases were given on a percentage basis and the farmers' increases are approximately the same as those given in the national wage agreement.  I congratulate the people who negotiated the national wage agreement which shows a good deal of common sense.</P>
    <P>In relation to the national system as against the accounts system, I suppose the idea is to try to get farmers to keep accounts.  The people who opt for the national system have to make a decision now for three years and they are worried about what the multiplier will be in three years' time.  I would like to have an indication that the increase in the multiplier will not exceed 110 within the three years, so as to give some indication to people <Col N="1620" /> opting for the national system of where they are going.  There are many people in my area who got a terrible going over from brucellosis.  Their incomes have been reduced to nothing for all practical purposes.  Therefore they have not the foggiest idea of what the multiplier will signify in three years.</P>
    <P>I agree that farmers who make profits should contribute to the national tax pool, but according to a recent survey we have been told that 33 per cent of our farmers earn less than £2,000 a year.  Only a small percentage of them make money and I agree that that percentage should pay tax.  My concern, of course, is that everyone in the State is not making sufficient money to be liable for tax, but the sad truth is that only a small percentage of farmers are liable.  At the beginning of the EEC, when the Treaty of Rome was being prepared, there were hopes that there would be a vast levelling off of incomes within the Community, that the poor would be less poor and that the rich would not get richer.  It is sad that this has not happened.  Indeed the rich have got richer and there has been very little change in the status of the poor.</P>
    <P>An important point from the point of view of the west of Ireland in particular is the capital acquisitions tax system.  The Minister has doubled the threshold, and I congratulate him sincerely for doing so, but I would make a special plea to have brothers, nephews and nieces included in the exemption clauses.  In the west of Ireland a great number of farmers are single and they leave their farms ultimately to nieces and nephews.  They are not exempt and although the threshold has been doubled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In these days of inflation and rising costs farms are enormously overvalued.  Sometimes a man who cannot afford a good suit of clothes has his land valued at £40,000 or £50,000 and if such a farm is bequeathed to a young brother, say, or to a nephew or a niece, they would <Col N="1621" /> nearly have to sell it in order to pay what used to be death duties.  I should like to see a broad review of the capital acquisitions tax with a view to including those who are not what could be termed direct family relatives.</P>
      <P>I sincerely congratulate the Minister on having removed co-operatives from the income tax net.  Co-operatives are an important part of the lives of small farmers, particularly in the west of Ireland.  Small farmers are not able to compete on their own against big syndicates and this is where the co-operatives play their part.  In private enterprise, naturally, people who invest their talents, their intelligence and their money in business are entitled to make profits, but co-operatives plough back their profits into the business.  There are very few people who can speak on the history of the co-operative movement with my experience. I helped to organise the movement in the west and I had an awful time encouraging people to participate because there was a tradition of loss in the movement in its early days when co-operatives were not limited liability companies and a lot of people lost all they had.  I and others like me had to convince people to participate, now that co-operatives had become limited liability companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important element in all co-operatives is the democracy of the movement.  For instance, a man who has a £6 share in a co-operative has the same voting rights as the person with numerous shares.  Such a person can even become elected to the governing body.  I was astonished to hear people supposedly with social consciences criticising the exemption of co-operatives from the tax net.  Anyone with a social conscience should help to ensure that nothing will be done to take away from the democratic nature of co-operatives.  I am a firm believer in giving credit where credit is due and a lot of credit is due to the Minister for having removed co-operatives from the tax net.  There are many small co-operatives in the west who could not have borne this tax and the <Col N="1622" /> farmers would consequently have been deprived of a great service which has done so much to improve their standard of living.  It is one of the best movements so far as the smaller farmer is concerned.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy said that a Second Reading debate should not go on for too long and I agree with him.  Details of any Bill, and particularly a Finance Bill, can be argued on Committee Stage.  Some Deputies yesterday said that all details of a Bill should be discussed sufficiently after four days debate and that it is better to proceed to Committee Stage to tease out any problems that may exist.  When I spoke from the Opposition benches I found that on Committee Stage one could make constructive suggestions and generally they were listened to attentively by the Minister concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope my comments were constructive. I should like to issue a final warning to those whom it may concern. It is that the incentives given in the budget could not have been better and they have helped small industrialists and the private sector generally. However, I am not happy with the response so far and I hope it will be better.  I do not think those incentives can continue if the unemployment situation is not improved.  Now is the time for everybody who is interested in his own future, and not even in the welfare of the country, to make his contribution.  If the young people become violent and lose confidence in democracy it is not the Johnny Callanans, who never had a lot, who will suffer&mdash;it is the big business people who will suffer.  I hope they will take a note of that warning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with considerable interest to many of the contributions to the debate, not least to that from Deputy Callanan.  Sometimes I think he is in the wrong political party and if I did not think it would compromise his rise to fame in the ranks of Fianna Fáil I might invite him to cross the floor of the House. However, I take some consolation from the fact that Deputy Callanan could hardly be further physically from the Fianna Fáil front bench and <Col N="1623" /> still be in a position to speak&mdash;he is that far away from it.</P>
      <P>I share some of Deputy Callanan's criticisms of this Bill but I would go further than him in many respects. When one looks at this Bill overall it has a depressing and perhaps even a terrifying aspect.  Its financial implications are alarming and its social implications are deeply disturbing.  I believe it to be a Bill that has been put together in a lazy and crude way and one which is almost guaranteed to be socially regressive.</P>
      <P>It illustrates also very nicely a major problem in politics, that is, the difference between electoral strategy and economic strategy.  Any student of politics who is in any doubt as to the importance of the difference between electoral strategy and economic strategy could do no better than to compare the electoral strategy of the Government with their present economic strategy.  Part of the problem is that it creates major problems for a conscientious Opposition.  Of course, the main problem created for the Opposition is that they are now the Opposition and not the Government, but that is water under the bridge and we will not go into that.  There are subsidiary problems that are just as real.  Is it the duty of an Opposition who have been defeated in a general election on the basis of promises and fiscal policy which they knew to be economically unsound to insist after the election on the full implementation of this fiscal policy regardless of its effects on the economy and on the social structure of the country?  I believe the time has come to say &ldquo;halt&rdquo;.  It is appropriate for me as a member of the Opposition and speaking on this Finance Bill to ask the Government seriously to consider whether they would not admit the possibility that their electoral strategy was economically and socially disastrous and that they would do better to abandon some of the concessions and other items in the Finance Bill for the sake of the economy, society and the country generally rather than to rush headlong into it and to expect our foreign bailsmen to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast to any socially progressive <Col N="1624" /> task, this Finance Bill is plundering the future to pay for the past.  The past it is paying for is the past 12 months and I suspect that the future it is plundering will go far beyond the term of office of the present Government. It is socially far more responsible to tax the present to pay for the future but there is not a lot of evidence that the Government are prepared to do that in the Finance Bill.  Of course taxation is at the heart of politics.  It applies transfers between individuals, different social groupings and institutional groupings.  In this Finance Bill we are transferring money out of the present and the future to pay for the past.</P>
    <P>The first aspect of it to which I should like to pay some detailed attention is the question of taxation of the farming community and of farming co-operatives, to which Deputy Callanan paid such attention.  I take his point that in the early days of the farming co-operatives, and perhaps even now in some cases, the co-operatives were genuine self-help organisations that ran on a shoestring and that were encouraged by the voluntary efforts of people like Deputy Callanan to create genuine self-help structures for the farming community. However, that day is long past for any farming co-operative.  There are now different kinds of farming co-operatives and some of them are very big business indeed.  It is absurd to say that just because a particular big business happens to be an agricultural business that its success should not be taxed modestly.  The tax on farming co-operatives was modest indeed.  I am not aware of any farming co-operative who have gone bust because of the tax put on them by the previous administration. The removal of this tax by the Government was unnecessary.  It is the type of gesture to the farming community that they do not need. They are now very much wealthier than they were when we joined the EEC but that does not by any manner of means say that all farmers are much wealthier.  Deputy Callanan said that almost one-third of them have cash incomes of under £2,000 a year.  That is a dreadful situation for anybody interested in social progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> On 23 May I asked the Minister for Finance the number of farmers paying income tax in each of the last four years and if he would express those figures as a percentage of the total number of farmers in each year. The reply to Question No. 91, which was tabled in the Official Report, gave me the information that in 1978-79 there were approximately 170,000 farmers, there were 26,000 farmers assessed for tax on their farming profits and these amounted to 15.3 per cent of all farmers.  Deputy Callanan will be as aware as I am that the money which has gone into agriculture since we joined the Common Market has been as evenly distributed within the farming community as money which has gone into any other sector, perhaps even less equally distributed than in many other sections in the community.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that this overall prosperity of the farming community can conceal the very real crisis which agriculture in Ireland is facing.  If we look at the structure of the ownership of agriculture in Ireland and the distribution of income in the agricultural sector we can very easily come to the conclusion that in industrial terms Irish agriculture is in the situation of a company which is ripe for a take-over.  That kind of situation does not need concessions to the wealthier 15.3 per cent of Irish farmers and it does not need the window dressing of the removal of the tax on farming co-operatives; it needs a much more subtle and sophisticated analysis. Over 62 per cent of all the farms in the country are under 50 acres.  Many of those are still struggling to keep their heads above water.</P>
    <P>Dr. Jim Frawley, who lectures in the rural sociology department at the economics and rural welfare research centre of An Foras Talúntais has estimated that in 1972 only 15 per cent of farmers had an education beyond the primary level and only about 1 per cent have been to agricultural colleges.  The reference is to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 March 1978.  This imbalance in the agricultural sector must be terrifying for anybody who has the future of our agricultural community <Col N="1626" /> genuinely at heart.  I doubt if the tax concessions to the farmers in this Finance Bill, which are almost double in percentage terms to the tax concessions to PAYE workers, will have any real effect in meeting the substantial structural and economic problems of the farming industry.  The removal of the wealth tax will not add one jot to the need to find a solution to those problems, I suspect that not even the wealth tax produced a great deal from the farming community.</P>
    <P>A married farmer with four children under the wealth tax who had, for example, agricultural land and buildings valued at £120,000, stock valued at £30,000, farm machinery valued at £10,000 and perhaps a loan of £15,000 would have been liable for not more than £10 a week in wealth tax.  How does that compare with a net total of £145,000?  What will he do with the £10 a week he will get from the abolition of wealth tax?  What use will it be to approximately 15 per cent of the farmers with the tiny acreage I have already described?</P>
    <P>When Deputy Lawlor spoke about the removal of the tax on the farming co-operatives he made the argument that this was necessary because there was a need to provide jobs especially in the western areas.  There is a need to provide jobs everywhere, not least in the western areas.  The fact is that over the last few years the employment situation in what used to be called the underdeveloped parts of Ireland has improved at a much faster rate than the employment situation on the the employment situation on the populous east coast.  Perhaps this redress of the balance was necessary.  It is now true to say that as far as unemployment is concerned it is double in the eastern crisis area and the urban areas and not those parts in the midlands and the west where they have managed with some success to build a mixed economy based partly on agriculture and partly on industry.</P>
    <P>The concessions given in this Bill will have to be paid for.  There is a considerable dearth of information about who will pay for them and when. At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, who was defending the <Col N="1627" /> very high level of Government borrowing, which is being used to pay in a short term for this particular package said, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of February 1978:</P>
    <P>They had been criticised for increasing the level of borrowing but, he said, the increase in borrowing represented a cost on the economy of only £20 million a year&mdash;an amount that could be raised through taxation by adding 6p to the price of a packet of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>That was a very clever debating point. We could meet our extra borrowing requirements by adding 6p to the price of a packet of cigarettes.  When we come in here to debate the Finance Bill do we find 6p put on the packet of cigarettes?  We do not.  We do not find even the 3p on the packet of cigarettes, which would have yielded the same amount as the removal of the wealth tax has left us short.  It is one thing to talk about how easy it is to put 6p on the packet of cigarettes but it is another thing to come in to the House with a Finance Bill, which has no such tax proposals at all and which is simply giving concessions today and hoping to pay for them tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the situation is no longer that of the sixties in which the spread of taxation as a fiscal drag caused by inflation enabled Governments, particularly Fianna Fáil Governments, to finance a whole series of reasonably progressive social schemes. The situation now is that we are topping out of a mini-recovery.  This is the most dangerous time to expect to pay for these concessions out of borrowing rather than out of taxation.  One of the key questions about taxation is that the Fianna Fáil Party and economic policy have always banked on the belief that wage and salary earners are ready and willing to accept unequal shares of an improving economy and that the tax system can be adjusted accordingly. But if the economy is not always improving or growing people are much less willing to accept unequal shares on the way down.  It is then that these chickens will be coming home to roost.</P>
    <P>In his introductory speech the <Col N="1628" /> Minister pointed out that the budget was designed to give a stimulus to activity in 1978 and set the economy on a course designed to achieve our medium-term targets.  He argued also that, combined with the income tax concessions provided for in this Bill, the national wage agreement guarantees significant increases in real income. I shall be talking later about whether any really significant increases are taking place and where precisely they are concentrated.  But when the Minister speaks about the budget as something designed to set the economy on course for achieving medium-term targets it is obvious that the main target he had in mind was the job target.  It is ironic to see how rapidly, after that speech had been made or how closely in context with it, public scepticism was expressed about the ability of the economy to meet the medium-term targets which the Minister is so confident we will meet.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out in <i>Business and Finance</i> magazine and reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 5 May 1978 gave evidence of a general opinion that, according to the survey, the inflation rate is likely to rise and not fall, current job targets will not be achieved&mdash;only 9.4 per cent thought they would&mdash;and a growth figure of 5 to 6 per cent for the year was felt to be more realistic than the projected 7 per cent.  This survey covered 32 chief executives whose companies represent a turnover of £2,000 million and employ some 30,000 people.  These are the people who are being asked to deliver in response to the concessions being announced in this Finance Bill.  These are the people who are saying already that they are not sure they will be able to do what is being expected of them.</P>
    <P>On the employment problem I must refer to a speech given by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to a meeting in Clare some time earlier this month and reported in the <i>Clare Champion</i> on 12 May 1978. According to this speech the Minister said that the number out of work was down 7,000 since they took over.  That speech was made on 12 May 1978.  If the Minister believes that the Government met their initial target by reducing <Col N="1629" /> unemployment by 5,000 by the end of last year, he is saying it is down only 2,000 from the end of last year to 12 May 1978.  In fact, as we all know, the claim by the Government was that they had reduced unemployment by 5,700 by the end of the year.  Therefore, subtract 5,700 from 7,000 and one gets a net total of 1,300 reduction in unemployment from the end of last year to 12 May 1978.  We really must have more sense, consistency and honesty about these figures.  The really terrifying thing about this speech is contained in the last paragraph where the Minister said that we had to throw away all the reasonable answers and press ahead with the unreasonable ones that will get us the necessary solutions in the earliest possible time. I have no idea what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development thinks are reasonable or unreasonable solutions but it is becoming rather obvious that this Finance Bill is an essential ingredient in the unreasonable solutions which he feels should be adapted and adopted to solve our problems.</P>
    <P>Barely was the ink on the Finance Bill dry before the Taoiseach gave stern warning that public investment in areas not directly associated with job creation&mdash;no doubt including such areas as health and social welfare, these key areas for social progress&mdash; might have to mark time, if not even do worse than mark time while there was more investment in the jobproducing area.  To have this speech made at the same time that the Finance Bill was introduced in Dáil Éireann is rather like going to a restaurant and having the bill presented with one's soup.  We are now being told what are the goodies but we are being told in advance also what a socially regressive price we are being asked to pay for them.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of very interesting contributions from the other side of the House on this Bill and I should like to refer to them briefly.  There were those of Deputy L. Lawlor, Deputy Callanan and Deputy Woods.  Deputy L. Lawlor, in Volume 306, column 1088, of the Official Report suggested:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> As implemented in the budget and dealt with in the Finance Bill, the income tax allowances must surely be recognised particularly by the Labour Party who are continuously calling for more State involvement. This measure puts money into the pocket of the ordinary worker....</P>
    <P>That is an example of the kind of over-simplification which gets politics a bad name because it does not put the same amount of money by any means into the pockets of all ordinary workers.  In the Fianna Fáil economic and fiscal strategy some workers are more equal than others.  In this Finance Bill they are more equal than others if they happen to have no children.  I do not know whether this aspect of the Finance Bill is a deliberate antinatalist policy on the part of Fianna Fáil to explain the delay in producing legislation in other areas.  I imagine it is merely a part of what I have described already as a lazy and crude approach to fiscal problems needing a much more fundamental and radical reappraisal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods made a very interesting speech which is reported in Volume 306, column 889 of the Official Report where he says:</P>
    <P>I have heard various people say in this House, particularly people who believe in socialism and the more extreme Left view, that we should nationalise everything.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to Deputy Woods he is referring here to people, in the plural, but the only person he goes on to quote is Deputy Dr. Noel Browne. If Deputy Woods has evidence that there are more people in this House who have the simplistic belief that the answer to all our economic problems is to nationalise everything he should have the courage to name them and not try to hang this kind of label around the necks of people whose approach to financial and fiscal problems is considerably more sophisticated and responsible than that of the present Government.  We are now in a pluralist society, one hopes, and we do not have to entertain this cheap and <Col N="1631" /> inaccurate remark which, by implication, damns everybody on this side of the House from myself to Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan because it fails to distinguish between us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods at column 890 said that for the married couple to be given double the single person's allowance constituted an enormous step forward and a very brave one on the part of the Minister for Finance who has to foot the Bill ultimately and make such provision.  The only bill, of course, that the Minister for Finance ever has to foot is a political one.  It is not an economic one and I have no doubt that, when that bill is presented in due course, the Minister will find himself with insufficient resources to meet it.</P>
    <P>More interesting than either of these two points in Deputy Wood's speech was the following:</P>
    <P>I should like to see attention given to the question of children's allowances and the possibility of increasing them.  I appreciate it is not a simple matter.  With the enormous benefits given by way of income tax reliefs this is not something that can be readily done right across the board.  But I would ask the Minister to look very carefully at this problem and to review it to see how children's allowances might be improved in the medium term, particularly in the case of those who depend so much on them.  I need not specify who they are.  They are people whose incomes will not rise to the same extent as other incomes do.  They are people who, because of the number of children they have, are dependent to a great extent on these allowances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods's analysis of the problems which are being caused and will be caused by the failure to increase children's allowances is a fairly soft one, as befits someone speaking from that side of the House, but he has put his finger on one of the major problems in this Finance Bill, one which is so large that I am surprised the Minister did not notice it in advance or did not even make a cosmetic attempt to shield himself from criticism on it.  I <Col N="1632" /> refer to this extraordinarily strong bias against the family.  I shall come back to this later but, in the meantime, I should like to turn now to one or two of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One point which I do not think has been raised yet relates to section 1 which provides that, in the case of life insurance policies taken out after 1 February the fraction of qualifying premium allowable as a reduction for income tax purposes will be one-half whereas in the case of policies taken out with Irish companies after 21 May 1953 but before 2 February 1978 twothirds of the qualifying premium will continue to be allowed as a deduction. My understanding of the <i>rationale</i> behind this provision is that it is necessitated by various forms of harmonisation within the EEC.  It is permissible, however, to look at the particular form of harmonisation that has taken place.</P>
    <P>In the past Irish companies had a somewhat privileged position. Premiums on policies taken out with Irish companies could be allowable against income tax to the amount of two-thirds whereas premiums paid to companies outside Ireland were not so favourably considered.  What we have now is not a generalised levelling up but rather a cutting down to size of Irish companies.  It would be very interesting if the Minister would give us some indication of the cost implications in terms of revenue foregone by levelling up the other companies to the Irish level instead of levelling down the Irish companies to the level formerly enjoyed by the non-Irish companies.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this which I believe the Minister may not have taken into account and which he will certainly have to take into account later because there will undoubtedly be pressure about it.  I refer to the fact that there are many insurance policies which are used as collateral for house purchase and, if the Minister is serious in encouraging house purchase, in encouraging the building industry and providing jobs therein, he should not be making moves which will reduce the attractiveness of that kind of insurance policy.  While on the question of insurance policies it should be pointed <Col N="1633" /> out to the Minister that Irish insurance companies have certainly a moral, if not always a legal, obligation to invest premium income in Ireland.  On balance, they are far more likely to invest in Ireland in Irish industry and jobs than they are to invest outside but, in this Bill, we have this particular section which militates against the likelihood that they will continue to expand their investment in Irish industry at the same rate.</P>
    <P>Section 3 and Part I of the First Schedule remove the cash limits which apply to the amount of premiums for retirement annuities payable by persons in self-employment or wholly nonpensionable employment which qualify for tax relief.  This is an interesting concession, though not necessarily a large one.  In a recent answer to a Parliamentary Question about the number in the self-employed category earning particular sums it was interesting to see that there is a general scale under which the higher up you go in the income bracket the fewer there are who are self-employed.  When you get over the £5,000 per annum level the number of self-employed suddenly shoots up.</P>
    <P>I once had the experience, and I would recommend it to any practising politician, of collecting for my political party outside a church in a particularly well-off area in my constituency. It was a couple of days after the previous National Coalition Government budget had been introduced and in that budget there was a modest increase in the amount of premiums allowable as a set-off against income tax.  One constituent of mine&mdash;he was not a constituent then but I am glad to say he is now&mdash;came up to me and pressed paper money into my collection box with an expression of great delight at this unexpected and generous decision by the National Coalition Government.  I believe the concessions given in that budget by that Government in respect of this kind of relief were adequate and extending them further in the way the Minister is doing now does nothing for employment and everything for self-interest.</P>
    <P>We should have, as has often been <Col N="1634" /> said, a national pension scheme.  The Government are committed to introducing it.  If we had a real commitment of this kind on the part of the Government we would need less of this very large concession to people who are already among the wealthy members of our community.  The concessions given in the last budget introduced by the National Coalition Government were, I believe, adequate and fair and were seen as such by those who hoped to benefit.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which has attracted a certain amount of attention on both sides of the House, relates to the use of cars on official business by people who have cars as part of their employment. This is the section which actually repeals the National Coalition's legislation on benefit in kind for cars.  As the House knows, the Coalition brought in legislation stating that the minimum benefit in kind should be 15 per cent of the cost of the car provided.  I think a cash sum of about £300 was mentioned. This proviso gave rise to a lot of dissension, especially among commercial travellers, and there was a good deal of argument that it should be changed and repealed.  This is what is now being done.</P>
    <P>Even the National Coalition's legislation, which may have been open to criticism, did not put a very heavy premium on the private use of a car by somebody who had a car as part of his employment.  Prior to the introduction of the legislation by the National Coalition, the benefit in kind was negotiated between the employee and the Inspector of Taxes.  This section now restores the old position.  If the Government are honest, they will accept that neither of these systems has proved to be satisfactory in the past to either party.</P>
    <P>The Labour Government in the United Kingdom brought in legislation which puts specific benefit on cars of different sizes.  The amount of the benefit depends on the extent to which the car is genuinely used in business. For example, a commercial traveller would be considered to have obtained a smaller benefit from the same car <Col N="1635" /> than the company accountant who had clearly driven fewer business miles during the year.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility of framing sensitive, discriminatory legislation which will take into account the real problems of the self-employed and the commercial traveller, and ensure that people who are already very well off do not get very substantial increases in effective disposable income by perks of this kind.  I gather the cost of this concession is estimated at approximately £2 million.  Of course, some people will benefit more than others.  It will obviously benefit our friend the commercial traveller, and good luck to him.  I do not envy anybody who has to spend so much time in his car driving around the country, selling the products of our factories, and helping to create employment.</P>
    <P>It may not benefit him one half as much or one quarter as much as it will benefit his company accountant, his company secretary, his company director, who is or ought to be on a far higher marginal rate of tax.</P>
    <P>Nor will the section benefit at all the kind of people about whom Deputy Callanan waxed eloquent, the people in west Galway or east Galway who have to sit into a car and drive 20, 30 or 40 miles to work each day.  They have benefited from the removal of car tax.  That much is true, but they certainly will not benefit from this.  Who will argue which is the more important: that a company director should have the free use of a very large and expensive car as part of a hidden subsidy to his salary, and be now given some kind of benefit from it by this Government, or that two, three or four people who have to club together to buy some kind of an old banger in east Galway to travel 30 or 40 miles to work should not get any benefit at all from this section?  It is the old problem: to him who hath shall be given, and from him who hath little even that little which he hath shall be taken away.  The cost of this small section dealing with benefits in kind adds up to about £2 million, and its social implications are derisory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> I should like to turn now to that general section of the report relating to the benefits and concessions which are being extended to companies in an attempt to get them to improve and increase their employment quota for the years ahead.  In this respect we are talking mainly about company taxation, about relief for manufacturing companies.  The Finance Bill gives legislative effect to the changes outlined in the budget speech and also extends the relief to companies which commenced to trade after 31 December 1976.  For 1977 the original targets of a 3 per cent increase in employee social welfare contributions and a 5 per cent volume, increase in output over 1976 applied, but companies would qualify for the output test if the 1977 sales were 19 per cent more in cash terms than the 1976 sales.  For 1978, a company will qualify for the 25 per cent tax rate if its employee social welfare contributions are 6 per cent more than in 1976 or, if it so elects, 3 per cent more than in 1977. There is no output test.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to concentrate on the provisions for 1978.  A company will qualify for the preferential rate if its employee social welfare contributions are 6 per cent more than in 1976 or 3 per cent more than in 1977.  This is small enough in all conscience.  It accepts that a company will not only have to maintain but probably improve its profit margins, its ratio of profit to employee, and it will allow a company to make more profits of this kind and at the same time reduce its taxation.  It says there will be no output test whatsoever. At the end of the year I will be very interested to find out how many companies have been in a position to take advantage of this concession.  I anticipate that, even with relatively modest inflation and relatively modest productivity, a huge number of companies will be able to claim this concession without substantially increasing their employment and at the same time very largely increasing their profitability.</P>
    <P>How likely are companies to put their money into jobs?  We have some guide from the performance of companies in the past, and it is not a very <Col N="1637" /> hopeful one for the Minister.  The spring 1978 edition of <i>Trade Union</i><i>Information</i>, and excellent publication which I recommend to the House, points out that, in relation first of all to 28 public companies which reported in the second half of 1977, the total amount paid in dividends by the companies rose by 34 per cent while retained profits showed an increase of only 16 per cent.  Directors' remuneration rose by 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Translated into ordinary language for the benefit of such common men as may be amongst us, this means that reinvestment, retained profits, were barely as much up on the previous year as the money the directors put into their own pockets and less than half of what was paid out in dividends to shareholders.  We see what the companies' priorities are.  I do not blame them.  They are in business to make money for themselves, for their directors, for their shareholders.  Therefore, it is inevitable that the huge bulk of their profits will go to their shareholders and that they will reinvest only as much as they fell is absolutely essential to ensure the continued existence and increased profitability of their companies.</P>
    <P>The same publication, dealing with the 95 public companies, excluding the banking groups who reported in 1977, notes that dividends paid by the 95 companies were increased by 31 per cent and retained profits rose by 22 per cent.  The increase in directors' remuneration was 18 per cent.  In other words, when we look at the whole year and at these 95 public companies we see a marginal increase in the amount of reinvestment almost matched by an increase in directors' remuneration and a very slight overall decrease in the amount paid out in dividends.  The increase in the amount paid out in dividends is a steady 10 per cent or more higher than the increase in the amount set aside for reinvestment, that means in the amount set aside for jobs.</P>
    <P>It is already obvious that the private sector is not at all happy with being cast in the role of fairy godmother to wave the magic wand over the very ugly infant that is this Government's fiscal <Col N="1638" /> policy.  On the 9 May 1978 the CII, according to <i>The Irish Times</i>, called for an increased effort on the part of both Government and business to raise the capital intensity of industry so that competitiveness will be improved and jobs created.  I like the line &ldquo;and jobs created&rdquo;.  That is the saviour.  Their hierarchical values are, first of all, raise the capital intensity of industry; secondly, improve competitiveness; thirdly, if you are lucky, jobs will be created.</P>
    <P>If I were Minister for Finance I would regard that as a slap in the face to my employment policy.  At the same time the Minister for Finance must recognise that job creation in private industry is not the essence of private industry.  We in the Labour Party have never believed it was.  We in the Labour Party would find it difficult to blame private industry for not meeting the target that we do not believe they can meet, that we do not believe they are structurally equipped to meet&mdash; that massive target of job creation which was demanded by the Government and offered to the private sector with the series of bribes contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Private industry has not been slow to indicate its own concern.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 1 May 1978, appropriately on May Day, Mr. Ronnie Hoffman writes:</P>
    <P>To a businessman, the creation of new jobs might be the happy byproduct of expansion and development. A businessman employs people to produce things or services. Within reason, the fewer the people and the more they produce, the better.  Profit lies in the direction indicated by the cost-effectiveness curve.  Job creation outside these parameters can lead only to financial trouble.</P>
    <P>Further on in the same article, he writes:</P>
    <P>No one who works for privatelyowned, financially motivated business can honestly declare an interest in job creation except as an integral part of profit creation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> Another journalist, even more colourful in his language, Mr. Hugh Munro, writes in <i>Hibernia</i> of 11 May:</P>
    <P>Factories are built because their owners want to make products, not because their owners want to make jobs.  If they have any sense, if they are the kind of owners we need to see around,...</P>
    <P>His &ldquo;we&rdquo; excludes me, I hasten to add,</P>
    <P>they want to make as much as possible of product with as little as possible job content.  People who build factories to give employment are not business men; they are philanthropists.</P>
    <P>That is the authentic voice of capitalism and of Irish capitalism at that.  We on these benches find ourselves in the unusual position of coming in here to defend the private sector against the charges that are being laid at its door by the Government in its fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>It is certainly true that profit creates jobs.  We do not deny that.  What is also true, and the truth of this is not widely recognised and has never been recognised by Fianna Fáil, is that it never creates enough jobs.  If we had the safety valve of emigration this would not matter so much.  But anybody who believes not just that private industry and its profitability will create jobs but enough jobs is flying in the face of every aspect of recent Irish economic history that any of us is in any way familiar with.</P>
    <P>While we are talking about industry, let us ask ourselves who pays the cost of these jobs.  There is a section in this Finance Bill which allows industries to claim against tax liability the amount of money they have to spend on pollution control.  Deputy Ruairí Quinn has waxed eloquent on this and I do not propose to repeat what he said or to go into it in any detail, except to point out that this is a classic example of the way in which the invisible social costs of capalist commodity production are rising immeasurably and are being passed on in prices and taxes to people who can least afford to pay them.  It is because they are passed on to people <Col N="1640" /> who can least afford to pay for them&mdash; the working people of this country, by and large&mdash;that we have such an outcry about wages.  People are insisting on higher wage levels.  It is the only way they know how to claw back some of the ground which they have lost to the price and tax policy which is inevitable under our present private industry system.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other sections which are important in connection with company legislation and to which I should like to refer briefly.  One of them is section 7, which allows unrestricted interest relief to any individual in respect of borrowings made to enable him to acquire shares in a private trading company in which he is engaged either as a full-time employee or in a part-time capacity.  The section also allows interest relief up to a maximum amount of £2,000 to any individual in respect of borrowings made to enable him to acquire shares in a public trading company of which he is a full-time employee or a full-time director.</P>
    <P>This section is universal in the way that it is framed.  We all know that it cannot be universal in the way in which it is taken up.  Anybody who suggests that this section will be of the slightest use to a shop floor employee in a major industrial undertaking needs his head examined.  We all know who it will be of use to.  It will be of use to people who have credit-worthiness &mdash;people who can afford to borrow and who, being able to afford to borrow and having the credit-worthiness of the banks and other financial institutions, can increase their own financial income at comparatively little risk to themselves and at somebody else's expense.  This is a section which allows the directors of companies to increase their holdings in companies.  While one would like to think that the money would be used for investment in companies, we have no guarantee that this will be so.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the personal taxation package of this Finance Bill.  It is here that the Bill is open to its most serious criticism.  We have been told that the total amount of money being given by way of personal tax concessions in the Bill is of the <Col N="1641" /> order of £63 million.  The punters are always amazed at figures with strings of noughts on them.  There are a lot of noughts in £63 million and that is a lot of money, but the question now is not whether £63 million is enough or too little or too much.  I accept for the purpose of argument that this £63 million is all that can be applied in personal tax reliefs this year, but I am asking why the Government chose to distribute this £63 million so unevenly across the population.  They chose the crudest possible way and the most socially regressive way of giving away £63 million.  I do not know how Departments of Finance work, I do not know how accountants work, but I would think it extraordinary if the Minister and the Government when making their decision on the distribution of this £63 million did not have a number of options before them some at least of which would have steered the concessions towards the poorer and weaker sections of our community and the people with families.  If they had such options they rejected them in favour of this crude mechanism which will put much more money where money already is.  This is the inevitable result of simply increasing individual personal allowances.  It means that people who earn more get more.</P>
    <P>It is not inevitable that it be done this way.  It can be done in other ways which are socially progressive.  The same amount of money could be pumped into the economy and into the kind of purchasing that produces jobs in Ireland.  It could be done in a socially valid way and not in a way that is socially lazy and irresponsible. It would have been much more complicated, but nevertheless a much more socially progressive approach not merely first of all to distribute that £63 million so that it affected the lower income groups proportionately more, but also to change the bands on which rates of income tax become payable. As an alternative the Government could have changed the bands at which rates of income tax became payable and also could have increased children's allowances.  These mechanisms are not difficult.  They have an enormous <Col N="1642" /> social implication.  If the Government considered these options, they rejected them.  If they did not consider them, they ought to be ashamed of themselves.  Fundamentally they have chosen the lazy way out because they have given a disproportionately high amount of this £63 million to people who are already comparatively well off. That is the very grave danger of underwriting patterns of consumption that do less and less for Irish industry and more and more for the industry of other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 May 1978 in an article entitled <i>The Good Times</i>, Mr. Colm Boland describes in an impressionistic way some of our current spending patterns, and I quote:</P>
    <P>With the average price of a new car now gone well over the £3,000 mark, new car buying would appear to have ascended into the luxury spending category.</P>
    <P>I have just bought a car, the most expensive car I have ever bought in my life and I paid £1,600 for it.  I do not know where the money is coming from, but it is perfectly obvious where it is going.  The money spent on cars is not being spent on Irish industry.  It is being spent on imported products which need imported oil in order to run.  There is of course a domestic element in the motor industry and it is not very substantial in general terms, but it is substantial in terms of the total amount of money which we spend on oil imports and on the imports of motor vehicles.  I quote again from the same article:</P>
    <P>Foreign holiday bookings too have taken a leap this year.  Crossing their fingers in hope that the Aer Lingus strike will be settled soon, travel agents are predicting a hefty 25 per cent increase in package holidays from Ireland this year.</P>
    <P>How much of this money is staying in the country?  How much of it is going to the good trade unionists of the Costa del Sol, God bless them, of Greece and of other places?  All this money is going out of the country.  The Government's consumer boom is taking place in the Datsun factories, in the Spanish <Col N="1643" /> hotels and places like that.  The article says further on:</P>
    <P>Reflecting the same trend has been the relative upsurge since last year in demand for credit to fund purchases of the more expensive household items such as freezers and fridges, vacuum cleaners, washing machines with double glazing and home improvements and extensions on the increase as well.</P>
    <P>This is not a scientific article and I doubt whether its author would claim scientific validity for it.  However, it does give reasonable and literate expression to what we on this side of the House have been saying, that this is the wrong kind of boost to consumer expenditure which does nothing for Irish industry and everything for the industry of some of our competitors. Even in the area of expensive household domestic appliances it is as likely that we will be subsidising our British competitors as that we will be subsidising our own firms and their employees.</P>
    <P>In evaluating the tax savings which the Government say will be made on the budget under this Finance Bill, we first of all have to look at the rates of tax people are paying before we can determine what is their increase in take-home pay.  Increases in take-home pay are what count.  Because the higher the income the higher the rate of tax charged, it follows that the higher your income is the greater is the value to you of these increases in the personal allowance.  For example a married man gets an increase of £630 out of this Bill. If his taxable income is in the first band, up to £500, he will take home an extra £126.  If his income is in the second band he will take home and extra £157; if it is in the third band he will take home an extra £220; in the fourth band an extra £283; in the fifth band an extra £315.  In the £7,000 plus bracket he will take home £378 extra.  This is the money that is being put not into our economy but into the economy of our competitors and into foreign trading interests.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the example I have given that the Minister's proposals put <Col N="1644" /> almost £400 a year into the pockets of married men with £7,000 of taxable income.  When we consider that a married man with a couple of children buying his own house and likely to have about £4,000, if he is lucky, in personal allowances, it is probable that his gross income is of the order of £11,000 per year which by the time it has been taxed will be about £7,000. Therefore, we can say that generally the Finance Bill will mean an increase of £7.27 per week for married couples with annual incomes of more than £11,000 gross.  This compares with a budget increase of only £2.55 per week for a couple of old age pensioners. Had the distribution of these concessions been directed in the other way&mdash;if the benefit had been given to social welfare recipients, to old age pensioners and to the unemployed, not only would the distribution have been more progressive socially but it would have been far more likely to have been more spent on Irish-produced would have been far more likely to have been spent on Irish-produced goods and services because the pattern of our consumption shows that the lower down the income range the more likely is it that spending will be on basic essentials.  By and large we produced basic essentials more cheaply than we can import them. These basic essentials form a large part of the overall consumption and expenditure pattern of the poorer groups.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will no doubt argue, the percentage increase for those in the higher income bands will be lower but we must not allow ourselves to be baffled by percentages.  The percentage tax saving on the income enjoyed by a married man with two children and a wife who is not working is 100 per cent on an income of £2,000 whereas the saving on a £20,000 income would be only 4 per cent.  These are dramatic figures.  They illustrate the social concern and responsibility of the Minister but let us examine the cash figures involved. The 100 per cent saving for the man earning £2,000 a year amounts to only £84 while the 4 per cent saving for the man earning £20,000 amounts to £378.  We must not ignore the reality behind the percentage figures which are used as a smokescreen to <Col N="1645" /> conceal the social and cash effect of these changes.  As any husband or housewife knows, what counts is the money that is taken home, not gross income.  If one wishes to argue about percentages what happens in this kind of situation is that the higher up the income scale a married man goes, the greater is the saving in terms of income.</P>
    <P>When we look at this Finance Bill it is essential that we keep our analysis in terms of money as distinct from terms of income.  A 100 per cent increase of nothing is still no increase but the most alarming, depressing and cynical aspect of the Bill is its impact on family income and on family finances.  Section 5 which provides for tax relief makes no provision for any increase in personal reliefs in respect of children.  The effect of this omission needs to be spelled out.  It means that a married man with no children or whose children are working qualifies for exactly the same tax relief as a married man with five, eight or even ten children and there are still families in Ireland in which there are ten children.  When we remember also that for the first time in six years the social welfare provision of the last budget did not increase children's allowances, we are entitled to ask what have the Government or what has the Minister against children or against Irish families that they should treat them in this extraordinary fashion?  Is it not worth while spending money on families, on children?  If increases can be given for children the £63 million I have talked about already could have been redistributed in favour of families and of larger families particularly.</P>
    <P>It is inescapable that by structuring the tax concessions in the manner proposed in this Bill the Minister has given money basically to those who need it least, those with the highest incomes and with the smallest families. Nothing the Minister may say can convince me that the situation is otherwise. The situation must be emphasised in order to underline the anti-social implications of this Bill.  If the people with families and on low incomes who are being discriminated against positively <Col N="1646" /> in the Bill were to realise what is being taken from them and what is being offered to those who do not need the concessions, their opinions and comments might be almost unprintable. It is our job on this side of the House and particularly on these benches to ensure that this vicious anti-social equation is explained fully to the people during the remainder of this year and indeed during the coming four years also.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Bill which is almost equally regressive in its impact on individual and family welfare.  I refer to the limiting of the personal tax reliefs in respect of widows to the same level as applies to single people, that is, £200.  In this way the personal relief for a widow is only £70 more than for a single person.  This injustice has not been tackled to any degree.  The irony of it is that in 1977-78 a single person's allowance was £665 while the allowance for a widow was £735.  Both categories are now being allowed the same level of increase despite the fact that the system to which the equal amount is to be applied recognises the need for a differential between an allowance for a widow and an allowance for a single person.  The differential still exists but it is being reduced to £70 and will not be of any real advantage to the widows concerned.  If, for example, the tax-free allowance for widows were to be increased at the rate for a married couple, one of whom was working, it should have increased by £419 rather than by £200.</P>
    <P>We should be comparing here not merely individuals but families.  A married couple with only one of the partners working will qualify for an additional tax-free allowance of £630 while a widowed person, regardless of whether he or she has family responsibilities, will qualify for an increased allowance of only £200.  Therefore, one kind of family is being discriminated against and this is the kind of family who are least well able to bear the shock of price increases and financial stringencies of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I am trying in this part of my speech <Col N="1647" /> to illustrate for the benefit of the Minister the way in which his concessions savagely discriminate against some kinds of families and particularly against single parent families.  Not all single parent families are those of unmarried mothers, despite what the opponents of social welfare schemes would have us believe.  There are families maintained by widows and widowers and by deserted wives and deserted husbands.  There has been no thinking out of the consequences for the family of this series of tax concessions.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate the point more graphically by giving two examples. Let us take the case of a married couple with three children who are both earning and whose total income amounts to £6,000 and, secondly, a widow also earning £6,000 who has three children.  The married couple will pay £987 tax on their income of £6,000, while the widow will pay £1,345 tax on the same income.  This is a particularly gross anomaly.  The Minister instead of discriminating against single parent families in this way should have been thinking of discriminating in favour of them such as by the introduction of a single parent family allowance.  This has been done in the UK.</P>
    <P>What other help is given to a person looking after a single parent family? The answer is none.  There is an allowance of £165, which is given to a widow or widower who employs someone to look after his or her children. This allowance was not increased in the budget and therefore it does not feature in the Finance Bill.  It is important to recognise that this housekeeper allowance, as it is called, also applies to deserted wives and husbands. It is the easiest possible case to make that this allowance should have been increased.  At present it does not even cover the cost of the employer contribution to the social welfare stamp.  The Minister could not have done more to encourage people who are often in desperate financial straits to break the law by not stamping the card of someone whom they may employ in this menial position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> In the 1973 Budget the National Coalition Government did away with the employee's part of the contribution to the social welfare stamp of the employee of a widow who was looking after her children.  This is the direction in which we should be moving.  Where someone is employed to look after the children of single parent families, there should be no obligation on the employee or on the employer to stamp a card, while at the same time we should ensure that such employment is considered insurable so that people may benefit from the State social welfare system if they have been employed in this capacity.  I can think of few areas in which a comparatively small financial concession would do more to increase employment.</P>
    <P>There is an overall problem to which I would ask the Minister to pay some attention.  It is the extent to which these concessions really amount to concessions and whether the real burden of taxation on some wage earners may be expected to increase. When they were in Opposition the present Government made considerable play of the necessity, as they saw it, to index tax allowances of all sorts &mdash;allowances for income tax, wealth tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.  The present Minister was particularly strong on this point when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I have my difficulties about indexation, but certainly it is undeniable that this formed a major part of the strategy of the then Opposition.  There was even an extraordinary statement in the speech by the Taoiseach to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis which was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 20 February 1978 as follows:</P>
    <P>The goal should be a country where money can keep its value; where £1 this year buys the same amount as £1 last year.  That is the norm for a healthy economy.</P>
    <P>If that is the norm for a healthy economy, I should be glad if the Minister would point out any healthy economy in the world, with the possible exception of Cambodia where they have achieved this amazing feat by apparently abolishing money altogether. <Col N="1649" /> If the Taoiseach is proposing a Cambodian solution for our economic problems, the House would prefer him to be more open about it.  Of course, he is not doing that.  He is just committing a financial and economic solecism.  The problem about the £1 in the pocket this year and in the pocket next year maintaining its value is based on the assumption that one does not need any more £s in one's pocket, but there are very many people in our society who do need more £s in their pockets. If one rigidly adheres to indexation, one not only freezes tax liability but also freezes social expenditure in real terms, preventing the possibility of the sort of redistribution of income which is supposed to be brought about by a taxation system.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to be consistent, this first Finance Bill of theirs should have limited the increase from income tax receipts to the same level as the increase in prices.  If we accept that in 1978 the rate of inflation will be about 8 per cent, then in order to be consistent with their position in Opposition Fianna Fáil should at least have restricted the growth in income tax revenue to 8 per cent during the financial year 1978.  The concessions given in section 5 of the Bill fail to do this and we could argue that the level of personal reliefs does not keep pace with inflation.  Perhaps the budget increases the burden of income tax on some people.</P>
    <P>According to the 1978 pre-budget estimate, income tax revenue would be about £664 million.  This would amount to a 21 per cent increase on 1977.  On the other hand, the concessions announced in this Finance Bill add up to only £70 million, which is approximately an increase of 14 per cent.  If the Minister was determined to finish up with an increase of revenue of 8 per cent, then he should have given concessions amounting to £100 million and, since he gave back only £70 million, it is clear that for some reason £30 million has been kept for the Exchequer, while at the same time the Minister has been pretending that he has been giving real cuts in the level of income tax.  If that £30 million had <Col N="1650" /> been given to social services, to health, social welfare or education, we might not be complaining too much, but it is not being given to these areas.  I suspect that it is being used simply to reduce the size of the deficit.  It may be argued by the Minister in his reply that there is autonomous growth in tax revenue, and this is true; but we are being asked to believe that the autonomous growth in the tax revenue in the coming year will amount to some £30 million.  That strains credulity to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <P>What happened to indexation? Where has that £30 million gone or more appropriately, where is it coming from?  The situation is further confused by a paragraph on page 14 in the report of the Central Bank on the national economy which said that taxes on personal income were forecast to rise by approximately the same rate as the increase in personal incomes.  It went on to say that the effect of increasing personal income tax allowances in the budget is to halt the growth over recent years in the share of taxation in personal income.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconcile that with the figures and with his policy on indexation.  I suspect that the real thing that has happened is that the ostensible concessions given in this Bill are going to be swallowed up. They are only concessions if all other things are equal.  They are only concessions if the person who is expected to enjoy them is paying the same rate of tax before and after he gets them. The Minister and the Government have not changed by as much as one iota the bands of income.  There is a very real possibility that because of rising incomes many people will be put into a higher tax bracket and that this increase&mdash;the £30 million more which the Minister is going to take out of the system above what might be expected under indexation&mdash;will come from an increase in the average rate of tax.  If that is the case these are not concessions and perhaps even represent a charge on some sections of the community and almost definitely on those sections of the community which are least will able to afford them.</P>
    <P>There is one particularly controversial <Col N="1651" /> aspect of the tax concessions, and that relates to the question of tax concessions for married people.  The Minister has made much play of anomalies here and asked the Labour Party to state whether they support the creation of further anomalies in the tax system.  From his attitude one would think he cannot stand any unfairness in the tax system at all.  The situation which he affects to be worried about&mdash;one is that there is a greater tax on the single income family for a given income than for a two income family&mdash;is merely an inevitable reflection of a system in which every worker, except the wife, is given a tax free allowance, a set of rate bands, against which the income in a given year is taxed.</P>
    <P>If the Minister really thinks it is so terrible that a husband and a wife on £5,000 a year each should get more take home pay than a husband on £10,000 a year, I should like to hear his views on some of the other anomalies which he continues to enjoy in the tax system.  For example, there are two couples saving to be married. One couple earning £5,000 each and the other earning £3,000 and £7,000 will have different tax bills.  A man earning £3,000 and £7,000 in two successive years will pay more tax than his neighbour earning £5,000 in one year and £5,000 the next.</P>
    <P>The Minister's solution to the heavy tax bill paid by the working wife, without creating unfairness towards the non-working wife, is to accord her husband, along with the two income families, an extra set of rate bands. Here it can be argued he departs fairly radically from the present system where each person earning an income receives a basic tax free allowance and one set of rate bands with extra allowances for extra dependants, whether they be wives, children or relatives, but in no circumstances an extra set of rate bands.  By doing this he is creating a special category of dependant, the nonearning wife, who is worth an extra set of rate bands.  The problem about this is that any other type of dependant, who instead of being able to look <Col N="1652" /> after a house might be old, frail, young or helpless, will not contribute a claim for such an extra set of rate bands.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of controversy about the Minister's proposals about taxing married couples who work.  One is at the least interested to see that in this Bill he is providing some kind of solution to a problem to which in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 February 1978 he claimed not to know the answer.  I am delighted that at least partial wisdom has come the Minister's way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's partial answer is the formula known as incomes splitting, a system whereby the total income of a married couple from one or more sources is aggregated and the couple are taxed as if they were two single people earning half that income each.  In the context of the 1978-79 tax year income splitting would result in all married couples earning over £3,780 paying the same or less tax than two single people with the same incomes.</P>
      <P>If I may, I will give some examples which will help make the situation a little clearer.  Take a total income of £7,000, of which £3,000 is earned by the female partner and £4,000 by the male.  If this couple were unmarried they would be paying approximately £1,494 tax.  If they were married they would be paying £1,593, but with income splitting their tax burden is reduced to £1,414.  In that situation they are effectively paying slightly less tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are disadvantages about income splitting, which I should bring to the Minister's attention and on which I would like him to comment, in the context of the present system and together with many other aspects of this Finance Bill.  It discriminates against widows and widowers who are already <Col N="1653" /> unfairly treated because they have no spouse with whom to split their incomes. It discriminates also against low income families and in some cases against single people.  In conjunction with the other concessions in this Bill, about which I have already spoken at some length, it gives more money to the better off married couples and to this extent can also be unfair.  It still does not concede the right of a married person to be taxed on his or her own income.  It is somewhat ironic, to put it mildly, for the Minister for Finance, in view of some of the more controversial comments he made, to be introducing a system which in conjunction with the skewing of the tax concessions I have talked about will end up giving substantially more real disposable income to the persons the size of whose heels he has been complaining about.  If income splitting is to be introduced as it may have to be it should at least be an option also available to one-income families, including widows and widowers and to the lower paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>How would one split the income in a one-income family?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the combination of income splitting and the skewing of the income tax concessions in the Finance Bill discriminates very seriously against families. The Government should be thinking in more detail of allowing more concessions to families who through no fault of their own are being denied the advantages conferred by income splitting.  If it is properly implemented and used in conjunction with a socially responsible distribution of tax concessions it is an improvement on what we have but it does not give the nonearning wife an income of her own which, perhaps, it could be argued is something she should have if she is a mother.  She will still have to be dependent on her husband for every penny.  She certainly will not be getting any more from the State this year by way of children's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of taxation in relation to family income is a complex one. One would be more in favour of the income splitting which is being introduced by the Minister for Finance if <Col N="1654" /> it had been accompanied by any socially responsible attitude to the question of tax concessions generally. One most controversial aspect of the Finance Bill has been the decision not to proceed with any further collection of moneys due under the wealth tax passed by the previous administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not take it from what I have said that we are against income splitting <i>per se.</i> One must look at income splitting in the context of total fiscal policy.  It is in the context of the fiscal policy contained in the Finance Bill that the way in which income splitting is going to be introduced will benefit the wellheeled women the Minister was complaining about.  It will benefit them more than anybody else in cash terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>If it is not being introduced in this Bill perhaps the Minister will explain what precisely is being introduced.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the unfortunate fact&mdash;I am not aware which Government introduced <Col N="1655" /> it&mdash;that the possibility for the Opposition to put down amendments of certain kinds to Finance Bills is fairly limited.  Within those limitations the Minister will have a fairly good idea when we are finished of what we are for.</P>
      <P>I should like to indicate some of the objections we have to the section of the Finance Bill which proposes to abandon the collection of the wealth tax.  One of the strange things about this tax is that it was introduced at a time when there was comparatively little knowledge about the extent of wealth ownership here or the pattern of wealth distribution.  There have been a number of good articles by various academic authors attempting to find out what the situation is.  One of the fundamental articles appeared in the ESRI review of October 1975 and was written by M. J. Harrison and S. Nolan.  In that they examined an earlier series of assertions about the distribution of wealth in Ireland and asked whether or not it was equitable.  Mr. Lyons of Trinity College concluded, they noted, that there was substantial inequality in the distribution of wealth here.  They noted further that even if Mr. Lyons's assumptions were to be corrected in ways in which they felt they ought to be corrected the wealthiest 5 per cent of the population owns about 70 per cent of the wealth as compared with Mr. Lyons's figure of 72 per cent. Their analysis also suggests that the bottom 65 per cent in population rather than owning no wealth at all owns about 2 per cent of the wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They went into it further and their final conclusions suggest that the wealthiest 5 per cent of the population owns about 66 per cent of the wealth and that the poorest 65 per cent owns about 7 per cent of the wealth.  Nonetheless, they added, the conclusion appears to stand that personal wealth in Ireland is distributed very inequitably. They want on to find that even if one further refined the assumptions it did not make a great deal of difference to the overall distribution of wealth pattern.  What we see in these academic dissertations is a refinement <Col N="1656" /> of an analysis based on such information as many may be available.  That refinement reduces the proportion of wealth which is owned by the top 5 per cent of the population.  However, even the most stringent analysis still leaves that top 5 per cent owning and controlling a very substantial sector of wealth here.  Even on the most conservative estimate that 5 per cent is thought to own about 66 per cent of the wealth.</P>
    <P>Further to that we have the excellent paper by the Central Bank economist, Mr. Brian Nolan, which was reported in the journal <i>Liberty</i> in February 1978.  That paper pointed out that more than 75 per cent of the total household gross income went to 50 per cent of households in the Republic in 1973 thus leaving less than one-quarter to be distributed among the other 50 per cent.  Mr. Nolan's study also showed that the trend in the distribution of household gross income in the period 1965-66 to 1976 in urban areas was one of decreasing inequality in the years 1965-66 to 1974 followed by a reversal to a trend of increasing inequality in the years 1974 to 1976. That is a tragedy but I was glad to see that at least in the initial years of the last administration there was a deliberate attempt to reverse an inequality pattern.  This, like the study I quoted, is very technical.  It would probably be physically impossible to reproduce in the Offical Report some of the equations on the pages of the ESRI review, so I will not go into it in detail.  All we know with any degree of certainty is that a comparatively small number of people are comparatively wealthy and that the distribution of wealth is in some senses better than in some countries and in other senses worse.  It was to meet this situation and to provide a redistributional effect that the previous Government introduced a wealth tax.  It was a very generous wealth tax compared to wealth taxes in other countries, where they have not caused anything like the same complaints. Its exemptions were set at a very high level and its yield until comparatively recently was very small.  On 1 December 1977 I asked the Minister for Finance to state the number of <Col N="1657" /> people paying wealth tax, the categories in which they were and the amount of wealth tax collected from each category.  I was told that there were 1,713 individuals regarded as assessable persons, 929 discretionary trusts and 1,267 private non-trading companies.  This is a comparatively small number of people.  On the facts they must control a very large proportion of the wealth.  It is not much to seek that they should be asked to continue to pay that small share of their wealth for the improvement of the social services.</P>
    <P>On 24 November 1977 I asked the Minister the number of persons paying wealth tax in each of a number of years:  What puzzled me about the Minister's answer is that in each of the three periods mentioned the number of persons paying wealth tax according to the Minister was put at 5,000 subject to a proviso that these were up to date estimates.  It is extraordinary that the number should be the same, even allowing for the proviso, and that it should not have increased over the period of the three years.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this when replying. On 29 November 1977 I again asked the Minister for information about the range of taxable wealth and the number of individuals in each of the ranges.  According to the information I received there were 226 people in the £70,000 to £100,000 range, 1,170 in the £100,000 to £¼ million range, 257 with a range of taxable wealth of between £250,000 and £500,000 and 60 people with a range of taxable wealth above £500,000.  We do not know who these people are but <i>The Sunday Press</i> on 26 February 1978 attempted to identify them.  Mr. Brian O'Connor in an article in the same paper said that the ending of the wealth tax was a timely boon for some of Ireland's top entrepreneurs because the rapid rise of the Irish stock market over the last year had left many of them with paper fortunes of £1 million or more, which would have attracted considerably increased wealth tax bills. The wealth tax was just beginning to bite.  Just at the time when it might have begun to fund some of our badly-needed social services we have a situation <Col N="1658" /> in which these people are being left completely off the hook.</P>
    <P>I derive some small consolation from the knowledge given to me by the Minister for Finance on 25 April last that on the basis of the latest figures available the amount of wealth tax assessed as payable and not yet collected on 31 December 1977 was £301,957 and that it was expected that this would be collected in full.  The Minister will have my full support in the collection of this tax, and I hope he will pursue the collection of it with at least as much vigour as he is pursuing in this Finance Bill the distribution of large amounts of money to people who hardly need it.  There are varying estimates of what it is costing us to abolish the wealth tax but a reasonably modest estimate is about £8½ million.  That would have financed an extra 4 per cent increase in social welfare from October next.  Of course the £8½ million or £9 million has already been borrowed and more will be borrowed to pay for necessary improvements in our social services and it is inevitable that the total will add up to more than the amount the Minister is foregoing.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say that this tax was a disincentive and that therefore it had to be removed.  It is up to the Government not necessarily to remove a tax like this but to decide how in social terms this revenue could best be spent.  There is a social reality of the rich and the poor and, according to surveys published in the EEC, we have a very low opinion of poverty. Apparently we tend to believe that people are poor because they drink too much.  We may drink too much.  However if we believe, as my party believe, that the distribution of poverty is directly related to the kind of economic and social system we have, we will view with horror this financial provision which by further exalting the social status and the economic power of the wealthy will further disimprove the lot of the poor.  The Minister claimed that the tax was a disincentive. If the tax was a disincentive the Minister should have abolished it completely but he has not done this. The Minister is trying to have it both ways or may be he is leaving it there <Col N="1659" /> for us to reintroduce when we get back.</P>
    <P>In my experience of budget debates in the other House, it became obvious that the real disincentive to industrial effort was not the wealth tax but the top marginal rate of the tax, and when that was reduced by the National Coalition from 77 per cent to 60 per cent, suddenly the moaning and the groaning about the wealth tax disappeared. I do not recall having heard any serious sustained criticism, institutional or individual, of the wealth tax after those budgetary changes.</P>
    <P>A point often lost sight of about the wealth tax is that it is part of the redistribution mechanism of tax in general.  The opponents of wealth tax will argue that redistribution will not make any difference because there are so few really wealthy people that if we took off their entire wealth of £25,000, £30,000 or even £100,000 and distributed it across the rest of the population at large, everybody would have the price of a pint&mdash;we would have this immense peace of social engineering of the fiscal policy which would give this tiny result, a couple of quid extra to every man, woman and child in the country.  Of course the point about redistribution, if it is to have any value, is that it takes place from the people who have it and do not need it to the people who need it and do not have it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when we talk about redistribution we should not be talking about redistributing the revenue from the wealth tax across the population in general but from the top to the bottom where it is needed and where it will do most good.  There are many people in the middle who will not need it.  That is the fundamental redistributive aspect of the wealth tax which I am delighted to say was part of our policy in the last Government and which I am sorry to see being removed. One of the most interesting academic comments on all this is contained in page 73 of the same article. It states:</P>
    <P>...there remains a fundamental corpus of official statistical information <Col N="1660" /> on wealth in Ireland.  Indeed, in view of the data problem which necessitates the kind of fiscal speculation about the degree of wealth, it seems rather remarkable that important legislation on capital taxation has just passed through the Oireachtas apparently smoothly.  In addition to the methodological criticisms, the present paper should be viewed as a plea for radical improvement of the situation that obtains in regard to offical statistics in the area of Irish wealth and income.</P>
    <P>What we have in this Bill with the abandonment of wealth tax is the abandonment of some of the few absolutely reliable statistics we had about wealth distribution in Ireland.  I should like to think that the Revenue Commissioners in the goodness of their hearts will continue to maintain statistics of this kind but I think it is highly unlikely&mdash;they are overworked as it is&mdash;that they will put themselves out to collect information which would not be used as a basis for tax assessment.</P>
    <P>With the wealth tax, we were at least beginning to find out something factual about the distribution of wealth resources.  Now we are not only losing the revenue from that tax but we are losing the basic information on which we could found some kind of social and economic policy.  The question of taxation and redistribution is a highly complex one and my fundamental criticism of this Bill is that it is an unsophisticated, crude and lazy remedy for serious problems. Worse than that, it is socially regressive, it gives money to people who do not need it and it will disadvantage seriously the position of many of the worse off, large family, low income groups in our society.  On top of that it will fail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not propose to take up much of the time of the House but there are a number of things that need to be said and I propose to say them. As we know, the Finance Bill gives legal effect to the Government's taxation proposals as outlined in the <Col N="1661" /> budget.  It is clear that neither this year's budget nor the Finance Bill represents the considered social thinking or the economic philosophy of a Government concerned about the effects of their policies or about the method of paying for them.</P>
      <P>In my respectful submission, this year's budget and the Finance Bill represent a political gamble taken by Fianna Fáil in Opposition, a gamble which they hoped would bring them into Government, and which did.  It appears to me that Fianna Fáil, from the Taoiseach down, are terrified because the gamble has to be paid for. We have been told by the Taoiseach that the purse strings will have to be tightened and that public sector spending will have to be cut-back drastically. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development is now peddling the same policy.  He has told us that borrowing will have to be brought to an end, that there will have to be a cut-back in the public sector, in what he calls the non-job-creating sector.  He includes in that social welfare, health, and as far as I can ascertain public authority building.  He has told us that if there is not this drastic cutback in borrowing and spending in the public sector, the only solution will be the Russian or Cuban solutions, whatever they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a dramatic change in the Fianna Fáil approach to the economy in less than 12 months.  About this time last year we had solutions for everything from Fianna Fáil.  Those solutions were outlined in the now famous manifesto. Those who wanted houses were to have their problem solved by £1,000 free grants.  We know now that that £1,000 has been eroded, that it is more difficult to acquire a house now than it was 12 months ago.  Those driving cars were simply told that tax on cars would come to an end.  Insurance premiums payable on cars are so high that the benefit of the concession given in the removal of motor tax has been eroded and the people are no better off.  Domestic rates were abolished as was promised by Fianna Fáil.  We were told by the Taoiseach that there would not be an increase in rates in other spheres but since then the agricultural <Col N="1662" /> grant has been removed.  Although the Bill in question was piloted through the House by the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Finance has his hand in the pie also because he regulates in his Department and in the Finance Bill the thresholds at which the agricultural grant will be abolished.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the Fianna Fáil manifesto that the Government would create 25,000 jobs by the end of this year.  This morning Deputy Callanan expressed surprise and disappointment at the performance of the private sector who are now expected to create the jobs promised by Fianna Fáil.  The stop-go, green light-red light approach to the economy by Fianna Fáil, as set out in their manifesto, has done nothing to restore confidence in the private sector and that is the reason that sector is not delivering the jobs promised by the Government.  We were told they would create 25,000 jobs by the end of this year but at this stage they have provided only between 5,000 and 7,000 jobs.  It cannot be forgotten that some of those jobs have been created abroad because emigration has come again, somewhat to the relief of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government said they would restore confidence but at the moment uncertainty prevails.  We are discussing the Finance Bill which gives effect to the budget and which is supposed to implement the promises contained in the manifesto.  At the same time the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development outside of this House are conditioning the people for a vicious, savage budget in 1979.  I cannot interpret their approach as meaning anything else. The conditioning has started already. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development last year had the tall hats, the white rabbits and the magic wand but now they are conditioning the people to accept austerity.  The people were persuaded last year to vote for Fianna Fáil on the basis that we were entering a land of milk and honey but now they are being prepared to accept cut backs in borrowing and in public sector spending.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to ascertain the exact position with regard to expenditure <Col N="1663" /> on hospitals.  Perhaps I will get the relevant information shortly.  That item falls into the category of public sector spending and into the spending of money that we are providing in the budget and in this Bill.  There seems to be uncertainty about the hospital programme and I should like to know if that is what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development had in mind.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to expect the private sector to have confidence.  We are implementing the measures in the manifesto but, at the same time, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development are preaching hair-shirt policies and cutbacks.  Is it not clear that people with money to invest do not know where they stand?  It is not surprising that that is the position because when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they were reckless. It was a case of &ldquo;promise and be damned&rdquo;.  It was a case of getting the party into power at any cost and then dealing with the situation as it arose. That is what has put them in their present position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan said that the budget and the Finance Bill were anti-family measures in more ways than one and I agree with him.  There were no additional reliefs given to the married man with a large family.  The married man with no children or with a grown up family gets the same relief as a person with seven or eight children.  I attribute that to the manifesto also.  The manifesto did not go into details.  It was easy to say that there would be no tax on cars and to talk about a £1,000 grant for a new house.  It was easy to say that there would be an increase in the income tax allowance for a married man but the manifesto did not go into details.  There were four or five punch phrases that were put across in three weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister showed the manifesto to me.  Before I leave this I want to say that this is really the small print in the insurance policies.  The canvassers and the local minimanifestoes did not spell out what the people were to expect.  They felt there was to be no more income tax.  It is very anti-social to neglect in this year's Finance Bill the family man and not to make any provisions at all for him. It would be impossible to understand this if we had not the small print in the manifesto to fall back on.  That is why this document becomes relevant to this debate now and again.  Not alone has no provision been made in the Finance Bill for an increased allowance in respect of income tax for the family man but there has been no increase in children's allowances for the first time in several years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This appears to me to be an anti-family approach.  I ask the Minister to explain how he can reconcile giving the same increase in the budget this year in respect of income tax allowance to a married man with no children and a married man with several children.  I believe it is relevant <Col N="1665" /> to deal with the capital acquisitions tax in the same context as this.  When we were in Government we introduced the capital acquisitions tax to replace income tax.  We gave an assurance at that time that the thresholds would be revised this year to have regard for inflation.  I expected the Minister to implement that promise because when he was on this side of the House he was for larger thresholds and against them in some cases.</P>
    <P>What do we find here?  There are four tables which deal with the thresholds in regard to the application of capital acquisitions tax.  The threshold in the case of a stranger who gets a gift is increased by 100 per cent from £5,000 to £10,000.  We find in the case of a brother, sister or a nephew that the threshold is increased from £10,000 to £20,000 and in the case of grandchildren, who are not minors and parents, the threshold is increased from £15,000 to £20,000. There is no increase whatever in the case of the child.  Would the Minister explain that?  I want to put it on the record of the House that it sounds to me like the re-introduction of death duties.</P>
    <P>The value of land has increased dramatically since 28 February 1974 but the Minister has the same threshold here for gift tax at £150,000. Even in the poorer counties, like Cavan and Monaghan, it is not unheard of for a farm of land to be sold at £150,000.  Will the Minister explain to the farmers of Louth, Kildare, North Tipperary, Carlow and Kilkenny who voted for him why he has not increased the threshold for capital acquisitions tax in respect of the father to a son or in respect of the father to a minor grandchild by one penny?  Will the effect of that not be to restore death duties at the rate of 25 per cent upwards?  We must take into account that this attack is being made on the family man in regard to capital acquisitions tax.</P>

At present 45 welfare officers are assigned to probation work and other forms of supervision directed by the courts.  Of the total of 1,600 persons being so supervised at present, approximately 330 are under 16 years of age but no welfare officer deals exclusively with persons under that age.  Since 1971 the number of welfare officers on this work has increased from six to 45 and a further 18 are now being recruited.</P>
      <P>In regard to the last part of the question, the role and functions of the welfare officers assigned to the courts will continue to be</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> There are two committees which consider complaints against solicitors, the Registrar's Committee of the Law Society and the Disciplinary Committee which is appointed by the President of the High Court under section 7 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960 and which reports to the High Court.  The registrar's committee may, in appropriate cases, recommend disciplinary action by the Law Society themselves, or they may refer complaints to the disciplinary committee.  The latter may also investigate complaints lodged directly with them by members of the public.  Communications to the registrar's committee may be addressed to the Director General, Law Society, Solicitors Buildings, Blackhall Place, Dublin 7, and communications to the disciplinary committee may be addressed to the Clerk of the Disciplinary Committee at the same address.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which must be given by an adoption society when applying to An Bord Uchtála for registration is set out in the Adoption Rules, 1976, (S.I. No. 216 of 1976).  Those rules include a prescribed form of application, namely <Col N="1674" /> Form 8, which sets out the details required of an applicant society.</P>
      <P>The Board have not cancelled the registration of any adoption society in the last five years.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question. I think there may be a misunderstanding. The board are not dependent on the powers of inspection in section 38 which are not general powers of inspection but powers that relate only to the inspection of books and documents in the possession or control of an adoption society.  The extent to which the board may exercise the particular powers conferred by section 38 is a matter for the board and I do not think it either necessary or appropriate to ask for information about it as it is not in fact a measure of the extent of the board's supervisory work in relation to adoption societies.  The board's duty to supervise those societies is not exercised primarily by formal inspection of books but by a combination of means including periodic general inspections, by which I mean inspections of a wider nature than just an examination of books or documents and, most important of all, through the constant contacts that take place between the board and the various societies in the course of the day-to-day discharge of the board's general functions.  In fact, the nature of the board's duties in relation to individual applications for adoption orders is such that the board are kept continuously aware of the standards of work of the various societies and are, therefore, in a position to take action if that should be needed at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together. The Deputy is incorrect with regard to the Amnesty International statement. Amnesty International did not deny that they had been invited to submit specific complaints.  What they said was that they had not been directly invited to do so.</P>
      <P>The facts are that I issued a public statement last October and sent a copy to Amnesty.  That statement, dealing with the complaints that have been made to Amnesty, pointed out that investigation of those complaints depended on the co-operation of those making them.  The first step in such co-operation would be&mdash;as my statement made clear&mdash;the submission of specific particulars and my statement said that special arrangements to investigate would be made if specific complaints were submitted.  If that was not an open invitation both to Amnesty and to those who had complained to them to come forward with identifiable complaints, I do not know what it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, I should like to make it clear that I never suggested or implied that it was the duty of Amnesty to make specific complaints.  I acted on the assumption that they might wish to do so and, had they done so, this would have been one way that would have enabled an investigation to be carried out.  Another way would have been for the individuals concerned to make a complaint.  Amnesty could be under no misapprehension about that if only because a letter from my office <Col N="1680" /> to the Secretary General, dated 11 November 1977, pointed out that persons with complaints to make were well aware that they were invited to make them but that they could not be compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>In the Amnesty letter of 5 May, Amnesty made the point that in any event it is not their policy to represent individual complaints in national legal proceedings.  The Amnesty policy in that regard is entirely irrelevant since nobody ever suggested that they should or could do so.  The legal proceedings in question, as Amnesty themselves recognise, are criminal proceedings and, as I am sure some of the people advising Amnesty know very well, there is no such thing in our law as the representation in court of a witness in a criminal case.  Since the letter in question came from their London office, it may be worth mentioning that the same obtains in that country.  Consequently, I consider it necessary to say that I do not understand why they should have chosen to introduce such an obvious irrelevancy.</P>
    <P>The question whether any further reply is called for to Amnesty's latest letter is one which I am considering but there is, as should be quite obvious, no question of the Government setting up a public inquiry to investigate what in fact have been clearly acknowledged by Amnesty themselves to be allegations of criminal offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply but is he aware that a spokesman for the Garda Commissioner said that the matter of appointing a senior Garda sergeant was under consideration and that this indicated that even the Commissioner was of the opinion that the Minister intended to appoint such a person?</P>

I may add that the fact that I have not reappointed some persons, like Deputy Keating, who were appointed by my immediate predecessor does not mean that I consider them unsuitable.</P>

      <P>I accept that but is there not a striking coincidence regarding those people who were purged when their term of office expired at the end of last year and the people who replaced them and who seemed disproportionately to be from the party of which the Minister is a member, while those who were purged seemed to come from parties on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I reject that there was any purge whatever.  The Deputy <Col N="1682" /> need look no further than the Deputy immediately behind him, who is a member of a visiting committee.  Perhaps the Deputy is talking about 1973, not 1977.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that at present there are boards such as the one involved in the question which do not have representatives of the total political spectrum as they always had in the past?  There were representatives of all political parties on visiting committees and for the first time this is no longer the case.  There seem to be omissions.</P>

Has the Minister any position on that?  As public representatives, in what way can we have access to prisons?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of welfare officers exclusively attached to the prison system; the number of welfare officers in each of the State's ten civilian prisons in each year since 1969; the functions of the prison welfare service; the number of released <Col N="1683" /> prisoners placed in (a) part-time (b) temporary and (c) permanent employment, by the prison welfare service; and the figures to indicate the numbers of releases from each of the State's ten prisons placed for each year since 1969.</P>

      <P>Twenty welfare officers and two senior welfare officers are employed in the prisons and other places of detention under the aegis of my Department.  The distribution of those officers throughout the ten institutions is indicated in the attached table which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  In addition, five welfare officers from my Department will shortly be assigned to work in the special schools operating under the aegis of the Department of Education.  To complete the picture it is important to understand that these welfare officers form part of an integrated service, which, in addition, includes six senior welfare officers and 39 welfare officers operating throughout the country on what is generally <Col N="1684" /> referred to as probation work and who liaise with their colleagues in the institutions, so that a service can be provided to the offender in his home setting as well as in the institutional setting.</P>
      <P>In relation to persons in custody, the welfare service strives to provide as comprehensive a counselling service as is possible with a view to the resocialisation of the offender.  Efforts to secure employment for offenders who wish to work on release are only a part of the work of welfare officers and detailed statistics of employment secured have not been kept.  The available statistics, all of which relate to settled as distinct from casual employment, are as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of released prisoners from each of the State's ten prisons since 1969 who had no homes to go to, or were not wanted at home on release i.e., who were virtually homeless; the number of such prisoners from each of the State's prisons who were (a) found accommodation by the prison welfare service, (b) assisted in finding accommodation by the prison welfare service, and (c) given financial assistance in finding accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics in relation to the number of released prisoners who had no homes to go to or who were not wanted at home on release have not been kept.</P>
      <P>In 1977 close to 200 persons were assisted in finding accommodation on release from the prisons and places of detention.  In some cases the accommodation was in hostels which are maintained in part from funds made available by my Department.</P>
      <P>Most persons are paid a gratuity while in a prison or place of detention. A portion of this gratuity is retained by the prison authorities and paid to the prisoner when he is released.  A number of voluntary organisations exist which help persons after their release.  Some of these organisations receive grants from the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that imprisonment and discharge from imprisonment, usually to an alien and hostile world, is a particularly traumatising experience for the individual and it is at that time that he needs support in a home? In order to try to reduce the recidivist rate, the Minister should see that these people are properly looked after and placed in suitable homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If some special research project into the causes of crime were to be undertaken, I do not <Col N="1687" /> consider that the establishment of a commission would be the way to go about it.  That point apart, I know of no reason to think that the causes of crime or the factors contributing to crime in this country are in any significant way different from the causes of crime or the factors contributing to it in many other countries; and I am not prepared to ask the Government to divert funds from other pressing social needs in order to finance a project which would be both expensive and a duplication of the extensive work that has been done, and that continues to be done, both under the auspices of universities and otherwise, in a number of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we have always taken the position that we have a unique culture here and for that reason it is not easy to extrapolate the findings of other societies in relation to the origins of crime and that a special commission would be required here to find out the effects on young people of TV violence or the frustration of unemployment or changes in family life.  There is a special question which is worth inquiring into in order to know how we should approach the matter and deal with it, rather than the haphazard method of locking people up in bigger prisons and giving them longer sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that in reply to his question I said that we are very much in touch with the research being carried out in other countries.  We have available to us reports on various projects carried out.  Knowing what the costs of such projects can be, I am of the opinion that any moneys that might be available for this would probably be better spent in other ways, possibly in improving the situation dealt with in the last question.  We are in a position where we are co-operating with other administrations in Europe and elsewhere with regard to research carried out by them.  I might add that in my opinion a great deal of it would not be of any great interest to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's position that we are not a unique <Col N="1688" /> society and that there are no special considerations in Irish culture which could be factors leading to the alarming increase in crime among young people at the present time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to look at this but as it stands I am satisfied that the research done in other countries is of assistance to us.  If I can be convinced that there is room for research here because of our particular position I would be quite prepared to consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely in agreement with the trend of what Deputy Browne says because I agree with the Minister's point of view that this is essentially a matter for people whose business it is to study such things in our universities and elsewhere. I hope the Minister will ensure that his Department will be openminded to any requests from these quarters for access or facilities in the pursuit of their studies and that he will not regard the results obtained in other countries as being necessarily 100 per cent applicable here.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of recent allegations of victimisation, particularly in relation to promotional opportunities, of Garda officers who had been responsible for exposing irregularities in the Technical Bureau; and whether he will take steps to ensure that no such victimisation is allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would normally not be prepared to comment on matters of internal Garda administration but, because the allegations in question are a serious reflection on the integrity of senior Garda officers including the Commissioner, I want to say categorically that I am satisfied that they are wholly without foundation. I would furthermore point out that if individual members of the gardaí consider that they have reason to feel aggrieved about promotional opportunities or other conditions of service there are adequate and recognised procedures whereby these matters can be taken up through the Garda associations.</P>
      <P>As this question is connected with the problems that arose about fingerprint identification, I should like to take this opportunity to add a brief clarifying note to my detailed reply of yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that reply, when dealing with the case relating to the murder of the British Ambassador, I explained that when, in October 1976 my Department were informed by the Garda Síochána that a finger mark had been linked with a particular person, the Department <Col N="1690" /> were told that the identification was subject to a reservation or qualification. In that context I mentioned a note that was made at the time in my Department and that confirms what I had said.  All that was correct and was the point I was making.  However, when referring to the reservation or qualification that had been made, I said that it related to the need to obtain better quality prints.  That was included as explanatory material for the fuller information of the House, but it was inadvertently put in a way that would suggest that the departmental note that was made at the time included that particular detail.  For the sake of accuracy, and having regard to the conflicting interests involved, I would like to make it clear that that is not so and that the detail about better prints is based on other material.  This does not affect the point at issue, which is that allegations were publicly made that what my Department were given was an unqualified identification on which the expert or experts concerned had expressed themselves as willing to go to court.  The departmental note shows that that was not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and No. 19 together.</P>
      <P>It will not be possible to close the existing women's prison in Mountjoy until a new women's prison has been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A site for a new prison in Kilbarrack, Sutton, was purchased in 1972 but because of the opposition of some local interests, who have been proposing that the site be used as an amenity area for <Col N="1691" /> local children, a final decision on the matter has not been taken.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a need for a new women's prison but, even if a decision as to a site was taken soon, it would be a few years before building could be completed and the prison brought into operation.  In the meantime, although there are limits to what can be done because of the age and lay-out of the buildings, I am arranging to have the existing prison improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if one looks at the crime reports the type of crime for which women are in jail fall into three relatively trivial categories, drunkenness, soliciting and larceny and in the circumstances that some other more humane way could meet the needs of these ladies in their distress, such as supervision after sentence by the court or the extension of the use of hostels rather than putting them in jail for such negligible crimes?  Even the figures are small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The main categories of women in prison are as follows: soliciting, drunkenness and vagrancy 35 per cent, offences against the person 8 per cent, offences against property with violence 13 per cent, offences against property without violence 29 per cent, fraud 3 per cent and under the heading of &ldquo;others&rdquo;&mdash;and this covers a very wide area&mdash;12 per cent. I understand that generally speaking the courts commit women to custody only as a last resort.  It is probable that, if a women's prison were available with all modern treatment facilities, in an effort to help them the number of women committed to custody would be greater.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in relation to women there is the special question of children being involved, the break-up of the family and separation of the children from the mother, creates a special problem which could be better handled by a more humane approach, such as an increase in the number of welfare officers, the provision of ready access to the family and coming into the prisons for work daily, in other <Col N="1692" /> words, any other way but total isolation from the family?  In this way we are creating another generation of alcoholics, female prostitutes and so on, in these disturbed children.</P>

      <P>A site of six-and-a-half acres at Kilbarrack, Sutton, for the building of a prison was purchased in October 1972.  This Government and the previous Government ran into many difficulties with regard to getting this project started.  Unfortunately the site, which was zoned for industrial purposes, is in the centre of Kilbarrack Estate, which has about 3,000 houses. It is the only six-and-a-half green acres left there and it is being sought after very strongly by the people as an amenity centre for the children.  I met these people and listened to their objections and I can see their point of view.  Since I met them the Board of Works and officials from my Department have been trying desperately to get another site.  We have failed up to now but within the last week we have made reasonable progress.  We hope we are on to something that will materialise and if so I would be prepared to ask the Government to give us the green light to go ahead on the new site straight away.  The plans are ready to go ahead if we can get the site and the money.</P>

In view of the very limited facilities available, where for instance there are 82 Soccer and Gaelic teams with only one pitch, I would be very grateful if the Minister would tell us what progress has been made to date in the efforts to find an alternative site?  The community appreciate the approach which the Minister is taking to this problem.</P>

      <P>A proposal which would envisage the compulsory application of control, be it called after-care or otherwise, on persons who have completed their sentences would raise very serious issues.  On the other hand, <Col N="1694" /> the vast majority of persons in custody are seen by a welfare officer shortly before release and are offered voluntary after-care.  About 10 per cent accept the offer.</P>
      <P>Some are offered accommodation in hostels, which receive financial assistance from my Department.  These are Priorswood House, Coolock, which is operated by PACE&mdash;Prisoners Aid through Community Effort&mdash;the Dublin Central Mission, which is run by a church committee; Sarsfield House, Ballyfermot, which is operated by the Sons of Divine Providence; and Argus House, Cork, Los Angeles Hostel and Sherrard House, Dublin, which are managed by voluntary groups with whom the welfare service maintains a close liaison.  Two further hostels, which will also get financial assistance, are being provided in Waterford and Limerick.</P>

    <P>In all cases where a boy or girl between 15 and 17 years of age is committed to prison, the warrant from the court must include a certificate that the boy or girl is of so unruly <Col N="1695" /> a character that he/she cannot be detained in a place of detention or a certificate that he/she is so depraved a character that he/she is not a fit person to be so detained.  A total of 377 boys and 119 girls in this age group were so committed to prison between 1966 and 1977.  Of the total committed it is estimated that approximately half were between 15 and 16 years of age.</P>

      <Col N="1696" /> In the vast majority of cases, the sentence imposed was one month.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is a serious state of affairs where 500 youngsters, both boys and girls, have been put into jails of this kind which are completely unsuited for their care, assistance and rehabilitation?  Is it not another major scandal in relation to our prison service over the years that nothing has been done but to put these youngsters in a position where the majority of them must become criminals for the rest of their lives?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy said, there are approximately 500 people between boys and girls in the ten year period, which is an average of 50 a year.  This is far too high.  It is regrettable.  But that is the answer to the question asked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the present position concerning the cross-Border proposals for the Derry-Donegal area as outlined in the cross-Border study commissioned by the EEC in conjunction with the British and Irish Governments; and if he will explain the unusual delay in commencing work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are at present engaged in an examination of the report on cross-Border communications for the Derry and Donegal area which contains a wide range of proposals relating to road traffic, freight transport, public passenger transport, port development, air transport and postal and telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the recommendations of the consultants urge the need for cross-Border coordination in relation to the development of the area as a whole and for joint action by the two Governments in relation to certain specific projects in these fields of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of discussions of the study which I had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in <Col N="1697" /> Dublin on 5 May both sides agreed that a joint committee of officials from North and South should be set up to ensure a coordinated approach on the part of the two administrations in relation to the recommendations of the study and, where appropriate, possible applications for assistance to the EEC and to monitor the implementation of the report.  I anticipate that the first meeting of this committee will take place at an early date.</P>
    <P>In relation to a number of aspects, for example, roads and telecommunications, funds have already been allocated which will give effect to certain of the recommendations and I anticipate that work in relation to these will get under way in the near future.</P>
    <P>I hope that this will satisfy the Deputy that the Government are pursuing the follow-up to the report as rapidly as possible and that there has not been any unwarranted delay in the matter, as his question seems to imply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a report has been in his Department since shortly after he took office and that it is rather alarming that now, nine months later, there is no definite decision to go forward?  I appreciate that the Minister has been in contact with the Secretary of State in the last fortnight; but unless the Minister makes up his mind that progress will be more rapid than it has been in the last nine months I will ask more questions about this.  When the Minister is talking about the financing of this he continually mentions a figure of £40 million.  What figure is recommended in the study?  Does that figure relate to 1977 values or does it relate to values when the scheme is initiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there has been any delay in my Department.  The House and the public will know that this matter has been pursued very expeditiously since we came to Government.  Certain steps have already been taken by both Governments. Moneys have been voted in relation to roads within County Donegal in our case and for telecommunications. <Col N="1698" /> Even at this stage that gives the go ahead in respect of the responsibilities of both Governments. At the meeting I had with the Secretary of State a committee was set up to monitor the implementation of the report, not just to make recommendations. I assure the Deputy that it is proceeding at a pace much faster than anything hitherto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clear up this misunderstanding?  The Minister should know that people in Brussels and London have been asking me what the hell are the Government in Dublin doing about this.  It is more in the Irish Government's interest than of anybody else, but there is no movement. I have been asked why the Government are not getting things moving again.  The attitude in Brussels and in London is that the Dublin Government are not serious about this.  Would the Minister tell me what is the amount of money&mdash;is it £50 million or £40 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The total figure mentioned is not in any event a final figure because in some cases the consultants were not able to give precise estimates as to cost.  Therefore, any figure I might give now would not be the final figure.  However, I can say it is in excess of £40 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to tell the Deputy that in regard to the matters earmarked precisely, the figure is considerably in excess of £40 million. I have also told him there are other projects for which the consultants did not provide adequate cost estimates. Perhaps that explains the matter of disagreement the Deputy has been talking about.  The figure will be agreed between both Governments when the work has been undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the world tug-of-war championships are scheduled to be held in Ireland next September and that a team from <Col N="1700" /> South Africa, which is affiliated to the international body, is to participate.</P>
      <P>In reply to questions in the Dáil on 14 February last the Minister for State outlined on my behalf the steps that had been taken to convey the views of the Government on apartheid and sport to the Irish Tug-of-War Association, and the decision of the Minister for Education to refuse a grant to meet part of the cost of the event because it appeared likely that the South African team would not be selected on a genuinely multiracial basis.</P>
      <P>As the Government's views have been made known to the Irish Tug-of-War Association in the course of a number of contacts with the Department of Education, I do not feel that further steps in this regard are necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we could contemplate that in the circumstances. I think the Deputy has acknowledged that this Government's position and that of the previous Government have been consistent in regard to the Deputy's queries.

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the trial of Dr. Yury Orlov constitutes a breach of the Helsinki Agreement; if so, if he has joined in the protest to the Soviet Government; and, if not, if he will outline his reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the decision of the Soviet authorities to prosecute Yuri Orlov and the sentence passed on him are contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Helsinki Final Act.</P>
      <P>The 7th Principle of that document guarantees &ldquo;respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief&rdquo; and it confirms &ldquo;the right of the individual to know and act upon his rights and duties in this field&rdquo;.  The 9th Principle, on Co-operation among States, explicitly recognises the &ldquo;relevant and positive&rdquo; role to be played by persons and organisations as well as governments and institutions in contributing to the achievement of the aims of co-operation.</P>
      <P>The Final Act is not of course a binding legal instrument.  But all of the 35 participating states, including the Soviet Union and Ireland, undertook a common commitment to implement in full all its provisions, and then reaffirmed this commitment at the Belgrade review meeting which concluded in March of this year.</P>
      <P>The Soviet authorities hold that Dr. Orlov's trial and sentence were in accord with Soviet law and are a purely internal matter.  I believe that the common commitment that we and the Soviet Union have made gives us the right to express our views in the matter. The attitude of the Government to the right of the individual and of organisations to participate in the implementation of the Final Act has been consistently made clear.  On 15 February I said in this House:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> We feel strongly that the Governments who signed the Final Act and accepted its human rights provisions must ensure that their own citizens are free to exercise the rights which have been explicitly recognised and that they are free from official intimidation, harassment or arrest&mdash; free indeed from any abridgement of their rights merely because they have invoked them.</P>
    <P>This view was also stated on several occasions by the Irish delegation at the recently concluded Belgrade meeting to review progress in the implementation of the Final Act.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government are profoundly disturbed and distressed by the action of the Soviet authorities with regard to Dr. Orlov.  I have made this view known to the Soviet Government through the appropriate channels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the trial was in breach of the Helsinki Agreement and, having accepted that the Soviet Government are the greatest suppressors of human rights in the world, can he tell us the nature of the protest the Irish Government made to the Soviet Government in relation to Dr. Orlov's trial and sentence?  Will the Minister specify the nature and the content of the statement he submitted to the Soviet Ambassador here, or through other channels, to the Soviet Government regarding our opposition to their activities so far as the Orlov trial and many other trials in that country are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the House that on Friday 19 May I had the opportunity of conveying very clearly and forcefully the concern of the Government, and I believe the concern of all parties in this House and of the people, to the Soviet Ambassador. I expressed it on the basis as outlined in my reply that we as well as the Soviet Union and other countries are parties to the Helsinki Agreement and that as parties to the agreement obviously we are concerned with what appears here to be a clear breach of the spirit and the letter of that agreement.  I explained to the <Col N="1704" /> Soviet Ambassador that to me this cuts across the very purpose of <i>détente</i>, with which all of us have expressed ourselves to be in support. I can tell the House that I have just been informed that a statement will issue on behalf of the nine members of the European Community within the next 30 minutes which, with the permission of the Chair, I shall make available to Members by placing it in the Oireachtas Library.  This statement will express the concern of the nine members of the European Community, arising from a meeting which I had with my colleagues at the weekend.</P>

The terms of our protest should be set out in writing so that the Soviet Ambassador may be aware of our opposition to this kind of activity in a country that signed the Helsinki Agreement.

The Deputy will also be aware that it is part of a continuing process that will continue in Madrid, and even now subcommittees are preparing for that renewed meeting.  The Deputy will also be aware that this is one element in the overall question of association with the countries involved and with bringing about greater understanding and <i>détente.</i>  I appreciate the support of this House which I anticipated when conveying my views to the Soviet Ambassador.  We are very anxious to ensure that <i>détente</i> will be seen to be indivisible and consistently applied in all its aspects.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When I moved the adjournment of the debate I pointed out that the Bill contains a number of anti-social provisions and that it discriminates against the family in more than one way.  I find it difficult to understand why in this &ldquo;giveaway&rdquo; year, the year of the goodies, no additional allowance has been given to the family man in respect of income tax.  A married man with no <Col N="1721" /> family or with a grown up family enjoys exactly the same allowances for income tax purposes as a married man with seven children.  I want the Minister to explain the philosophy and meaning behind that.  This year for the first time in the past six years there has not been any increase in the social welfare code for children's allowances. That is another discrimination, another attack on the family.  I should like the Minister to deal with those two specific points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot deal with social welfare in this debate, and neither can the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am asking him to deal with it in the light of the overall financial position for which he is responsible.  I cannot understand why extra provision has not been made in the matter of income tax allowance for the family man who has five or six qualified children as opposed to the man who has no family or has a grown up family.  I want to protest against the action of the Government in not making any provision with regard to children's allowances.  These are two glaring examples of discrimination&mdash;it is a word I do not like &mdash;against the family.  When we go to another stratum of society we find that the Capital Acquisitions Act, as amended by this Bill, again has a swipe at the immediate family circle and treats it less favourably than the donees who are more distantly related than children.  I appreciate that there is a much bigger allowance for exemption from capital acquisitions tax in respect of the child but that has always been the case since this code was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has increased the threshold in respect of the stranger, the brother and sister, the nephew and niece, the father, grandfather and grandchild but he has not increased the threshold by one penny as far as the gift from the parent to the child is concerned.  It is very difficult to understand that.  It is true that the capital acquisitions tax only applies when the gift from the father to the child is <Col N="1722" /> £150,000 but that was the case on 28 February 1974, when the tax became effective.  The Minister and his party then said that that threshold was not high enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We said that one was too high but that the others were too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I accept what the Minister says but the Government of which I was a member went on record then as saying that the thresholds in all those capital tax cases would be revised in 1978 to have regard to inflation and the change in money value.  It is true that in 1974 £150,000 would buy a very sizeable farm of land and that it was a generous exemption.  The value of money has changed since then and the value of land has increased steeply.  I am not exaggerating when I say that a farm of land valued at £150,000 on 28 February 1974 would now be worth at least £300,000.  The Minister will invade that transaction and take from that family £75,000. That is the effect of the proposal in this Bill.  It is very difficult to understand that.</P>
      <P>In 1973 and before that there was great concern here about death duties because they imposed a great hardship on families when the breadwinner died. People were very concerned about the effect of death duties in breaking up family businesses and family farms.  I am speaking about family farms because I am closer to the farm than I am to the business but what I say about the farm also applies to a family business.  The value of that has changed, whether it is a public house or any other business.  A public house which was worth £70,000 in 1974 is worth at least three times that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This party and the Labour Party undertook to abolish death duties within the family.  We did that by introducing the threshold which the Minister says was too high.  We told the people we would replace death duties by a small annual tax on the very wealthy.  We did that but the Minister in this Finance Bill is abolishing wealth tax.  Is he re-introducing <Col N="1723" /> death duties?  That is the effect of what he is doing.  He is abolishing wealth tax this year and relieving the very wealthy people of paying about £8 million in wealth tax.  I am protesting about this as loudly as I possibly can because this will bring death duties into the immediate family circle, particularly the agricultural family circle.</P>
    <P>A farm of land of 70 or 80 acres in a good part of the country with good buildings on it will realise much more than £150,000.  If we take into account a farm with 100 acres or 150 acres we will get into the £300,000 bracket.  The Minister will, through the Revenue Commissioners, relieve that transaction of £75,000.  There is not one penny increase in the threshold.  There is an increase in the threshold in the case of the stranger from £5,000 to £10,000, a 100 per cent increase.  There is an increase in the case of the brother and sister or nephew and niece transaction from £10,000 to £20,000, another 100 per cent increase.  In the case of a transaction between the grandfather and the grandchild there is an increase from £15,000 to £30,000, another 100 per cent increase.  The gifts which are not to be taken into account at all, even by way of aggregation, are increased from £250,000 to £500,000, another 100 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister done nothing in respect of the transaction within the immediate family circle?  The result of this is bound to force sales of agricultural land or force sales of comparatively small businesses on the death of the breadwinner.  This is a re-introduction of death duties.  Wealth tax was a small imposition.  I have even heard people paying it say it was really nothing, only a mere bagatelle.  The imposition in this Bill is a reversion from the wealth tax system to the death duty system which was a crippling tax and in relation to the present values of property will be very crippling indeed. I want an explanation from the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with tax on farmers' profits.  I do not think I am being unfair to the Fianna Fáil Party or to the Minister when I say <Col N="1724" /> that, in effect, they campaigned in the last election on the basis that farmers might forget about taxation.  That was the impression given.  The manifesto is there&mdash;it can be quoted to prove almost everything&mdash;but the general advice given to the agricultural community was: put back Fianna Fáil and forget about taxation. That was the canvass.  That is what got Fianna Fáil the votes of the people of Kildare, Louth, Carlow-Kilkenny, North Tipperary and Laois-Offaly. I wonder what these farmers are thinking and talking about now, having had the promise and seeing the performance, because the first thing this Government did was to reduce the threshold for farmers' income tax from £75 to £60 PLV and increase the multiplier from £65 to £90.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister says farmers are agreeable to fair taxation.  That is so.  He also says farmers can elect to be taxed on accounts or on the notional system.  If a farmer elects to be taxed on the notional system he will be buying a pig in a poke. Farmers do not like buying pigs in pokes.  They like to know what they are getting.  But here I say the farmers are buying a pig in a poke because, if they elect for the notional system, they will be tied to that system for three years and there is no indication whatever what the multiplier will be next year or the year after.  As Deputy Callanan said this morning, farmers are entitled to know.  They are entitled to know how the system will operate for three years and I want the Minister to spell it out when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government say the farmer may take credit for his rates against his income tax.  That is in the manifesto.  What is not in the manifesto is the fact that the Government had plans to revise the whole system of rating on agricultural land. For the first time in living political memory they introduced a Bill here which reduced the agricultural rates relief grant down to £75 from 1 January this year and down to £60 from 1 January next year.  They have taken away completely the agricultural grant from 23,100 farmers&mdash;<Col N="1725" /> from 15,300 as from 1 January this year and an additional 7,800 as from 1 January next year.  That is something the Fianna Fáil Party or Fianna Fáil Government kept from the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Now many farmers, perhaps thousands of them, will not be liable for income tax because of family commitments, because of the employment they are giving, because of the interest they have to pay on money borrowed, or because of the expense in running their farms, but they will have their rates increased this year by 33? per cent rising to over 80 per cent next year regardless of their ability to pay, regardless of their liability for income tax and regardless of whether they put in accounts or rely on the notional system.  Is the Minister not ashamed of himself for playing that sort of confidence trick on the agricultural community once he had got his majority here of 84?  This needs explanation.  It is a sort of pea in a thimble exercise, juggling the pea from one thimble to another.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for the Environment is here I am told I cannot relate this very closely to income tax because it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance is here now and it is he who fixes the ceiling for the agricultural relief grant.  He does it in his Finance Act and the figure as from 1 January this year is £75 and it will be £60 from 1 January next year.  We do not know, as Deputy Bruton pointed out, when the Minister will introduce another Finance Bill this year and reduce the figure of £60 from 1 January next year to £50 or some lower figure.  This was a shabby confidence trick perpetrated on the farming community.  It was a piece of despicable doublecrossing and it needs explanation.  I have a fairly good memory and good hearing, and when the National Coalition's first budget was introduced here and the Minister for Finance was sitting on these benches beside the present Taoiseach his first question&mdash; not very loud&mdash;was: Are you not taxing the farmers?  That was in 1973.  We know what the farmers can expect from the Minister now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> Now, if the intention is to abolish the wealth tax and substitute for it under another name, death duties, I am dead against that.  Death duties are quite terrifying.  They are most unfair.  I also believe we should not borrow £821 million and use part of that huge sum in order to abolish wealth tax.  That is not sound financially and I should like to have the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <P>There is an innovation in section 45, a very dangerous innovation.  Under that section the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister's agents, will be able to disclose confidential information they have received from a taxpayer to a local authority so that the local authority may scrutinise that information and decide whether a farmer is entitled to the agricultural grant against his rates.</P>
    <P>The same section authorises the Revenue Commissioners to make available to the Department of the Environment confidential information which they have received from the taxpayer in order that the Department of the Environment may decide whether the taxpayer is entitled to this £1,000 grant for a house.  The only result of that will be to discourage people from applying for housing grants.  Our history as a people is that we are terrified of the Revenue Commissioners whether we are on PAYE or not and whether we have small or large incomes.  One agency that no Irishman wants to bring down on his house is the Revenue Commissioners.  They are as objectionable to the average Irishman as is a mad dog.  I ask the Minister to tell us the thinking behind writing this section 45 into a Finance Act whereby for the first time information is going to be given by the Revenue Commissioners to the county council to enable them to check and re-check a man's entitlement to the agricultural grant, and to the Department of the Environment in order that they may check and re-check a man's entitlement to a housing grant.  What is the thinking behind it?  Why has it been written into this Bill?  It is new, and it is sinister and a move in the wrong direction, because the information given to or extracted from a taxpayer by the Revenue Commissioners has <Col N="1727" /> always been regarded as confidential, should be treated as such, and should not be passed on to anybody without the consent of the taxpayer.  Here all that is changed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other objectionable performance of increasing the rates of farmers who could come within the income tax bracket, I have protested about that.  It is wrong.  I was talking to somebody who seemed to think it was all right and that farmers should be discriminated against in this way, but never in my political memory has any provision been made to increase rates by abolishing grants.  The argument was put to me by this person that because farmers are liable for income tax of course there is nothing wrong with increasing their rates.  I find it difficult to follow that line of argument.  Many people in this country use their dwelling-houses for professional purposes and for earning their living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In another section it is proposed to abolish the rights accruing from the power of revocation.  In other words, up to now if a man of property transferred his property to his son or to anybody else subject to power of revocation, the stamp duty on that was virtually nil, and that has been the case since I qualified as a solicitor, which is quite a few years ago.  The provision was that a man, be he farmer or business man, could transfer his property to his son subject to the right to revoke the transfer.  It operated in two ways.  It gave the son an interest in the property and it encouraged the son at the same time to be reasonably sensible and to co-operate in the running of the place.  The Minister is changing that, and if a father transfers his property to his son now subject to power of revocation, stamp duty to the tune of hundreds of £s will have to be paid on the transfer.  That is new and it is a move in the wrong direction.  It is a <Col N="1730" /> re-introduction of something like death duties.</P>
      <P>The whole trend in this Bill seems to be to impose tax on family transactions. The power of revocation was invariably a device used within the family for two-way purposes, namely to give the child ownership in the property and at the same time to encourage the child to remain at home, to manage the property well and to treat the parent well.  Also let us realise that the parent usually got the old age pension as well, but there was no stamp duty on the transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible to get the old age pension if the power of revocation is retained?</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is news to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I must admit that when I first heard that, which was a long time ago I, too, was surprised but it is possible to receive the old age pension so long as the power of revocation has not been exercised.  I am inviting the Minister to think about this and to allow the power of revocation to remain.  Have there been major abuses in this regard outside the family?  It is not totally correct for me to say that the Minister is taking away the power of revocation but where that power is inserted in an instrument the Minister is proposing to stamp the duty on the full value of the property passing, irrespective of the power of revocation.  I am asking him to allow the old system prevail in cases of family transactions because in most cases there would not be capital acquisitions tax payable eventually but the Revenue Commissioners would collect the £400 or £500 or whatever amount is involved.  This is a new way of collecting money.  I do not know to what extent there have been abuses but I refuse to believe that where this device was operated in the family there was an abuse.  Rather, that device was the type of prudent precaution that would be taken normally and which would normally be advised.  It is a different matter if there were transactions outside the family which could <Col N="1731" /> be regarded as abuses but in the absence of any such abuses I am asking the Minister to have another look at the matter and to allow the old procedure prevail in regard to family transactions.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the social welfare aspect of the Bill I omitted to point out that the qualifying age for the old age pension has not been reduced.</P>
      <P>This Finance Bill gives effect to a budget which was based not on social or economic considerations, but on the major political consideration of Fianna Fáil being returned to office.  They were returned to office but what is the situation?  Today Deputy Callanan expressed disappointment with the performance of the private sector in relation to the 25,000 jobs that were promised by Fianna Fáil but for the creation of which they would rely on somebody else.  Deputy Callanan is disappointed that only a fistful of those jobs have materialised.  This is the situation with only a few months left before the losing post, as it will be in this case, is reached.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach may not realise that we are talking about the 1978 budget at a time when we are going into the second half of the year and when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development are warning the people about next year's budget and telling them that the purse strings will have to be tightened, that borrowing will have to be cut back and that public expenditure will have to be reduced dramatically. How could the private sector be expected to get on with the task of creating the jobs promised by Fianna Fáil when there is an atmosphere of stop-go in the economy?  However, this situation is not surprising.  It was bound to follow on the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the first opportunity the Government have had of giving legislative effect to their proposals as outlined in the budget, in the White Paper on National Development, 1977-80 and, of course, on the <Col N="1732" /> famous manifesto.  Whether in or out of Government each of us must recognise that while we have very many serious problems and have had these problems for decades, one of the biggest problems and one of the most challenging is that of providing increased growth and increased employment. I can see that it has not been absolutely possible for the Government to put into effect between July last year and the introduction of the budget early this year everything they promised. However, in the budget and now in the Finance Bill they give teeth and authority to these proposals.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Government seem to have employed three strategies in an effort to provide for growth and for an increase in employment and, consequently, for a decrease in unemployment. The strategy appears to be to increase personal expenditure in order to increase consumption and demand and the all-important employment. The Government have adopted specific measures to this end.  I presume they are confident that the measures designed to increase personal expenditure and demand will result in more jobs.  They have adopted also a proposal to abolish rates on private dwellings and to abolish car tax on cars of up to 16 horsepower.</P>
      <P>In the second case the Government have provided for a reduction in taxation on business enterprise, abolishing wealth tax&mdash;a matter to which I will refer later&mdash;and in reducing taxation on business enterprise for the purpose of boosting business confidence and the hoped-for investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third part of the strategy involves direct State expenditure for the specific purpose of creating jobs particularly in the construction industry, in the public sector and by way of special youth employment projects.  I suppose much could be done in that respect.  There are people who would regard that sort of work as being unproductive but it is necessary that proper amenities be provided apart from the all-important consideration of providing employment.  This money can be spent on housing, roads and various other public projects.  One is reminded when talking about roads of the extraordinary <Col N="1733" /> statement by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development when he suggested that if we were to dig holes and fill them in again it would be worth while because new employment would be created.  The roads are in such a bad state that the holes are there already and only need to be filled in.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill is designed to provide for increased growth and increased employment.  The Government set as their target in the manifesto the reduction of unemployment by 5,000 between taking office and the end of 1977.  It is possible that this has been done, but they went on to say that there would be a reduction of a further 20,000 by the end of 1978.  I would dearly love to see the situation in which unemployment could be reduced by 20,000, but the measures in this Finance Bill and the proposals in the manifesto will not give us that reduction. The Fianna Fáil Party overbid their hand in the general election.  It is the wont of those in Opposition to promise more than those in Government. But one is surprised that the Fianna Fáil Party, with such experience of office during the past 45 years, would attempt such a &ldquo;try on&rdquo; with the people in their efforts to get back into office.  A reduction of 20,000 would mean a live register figure of 90,000 at the end of the year.  The present figures are in the region of 106,000, so there is quite a lot of leeway to be made up.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the proposals in the budget with regard to personal tax, the reduction of taxation on business, the abolition of rates on private dwellings and the abolition of tax on cars of 16 horsepower and under.  These things are good in themselves, but it is clear from the speeches being made by those in Government that they still depend on, or hope, that private enterprise will take over, in the words of the Minister, the &ldquo;engine of growth.&rdquo;  I do not believe that will happen, but that is the belief of the Minister for Finance and the Government.  They have raised their sights high.  I do not object to that, but they should be realistic as well.</P>
    <P>As far as inflation is concerned, <Col N="1734" /> their target for 1978 is that it will be 7 per cent.  They say we will have a growth rate of 7 per cent and that unemployment will range between 85,000 and 90,000.  They have provided for a budget deficit of £405 million and borrowing stands at the massive sum of £821 million, which represents 13 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>I will not transgress the rules of the House by being irrelevant, but it is well to recall that the economy was back on the growth path at the end of 1975, following the recession of 1974 and early 1975.  Though Fianna Fáil refused to admit it and blamed all the ills of the time on the then Government, there was a recession which shook the whole world and there was massive unemployment not only in this country but throughout Europe, Japan and the United States.  Despite that, there was a recovery towards the end of 1975 and we were back on a growth path by the end of that year.  It is obvious that the present Government took over an expanding economy.  I am not saying that the expansion was spectacular but at least the economy was growing and in 1976 that was represented by a 3 per cent growth. The volume of production was 9 per cent and exports grew by 20 per cent. That favourable trend continued in 1977 under the policies of the Coalition Government plus the international economic upturn.  If there had not been this international economic upturn the recession would have lasted much longer.  We predicted at the beginning of 1977 a growth rate of 5 per cent and that was met.  Unemployment was slightly down, but only by a matter of hundreds.  I am not boasting that unemployment had begun to settle when we were in office in 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>If there had not been the Government stimulus, the economy would have grown in 1978 by 4 per cent or 5 per cent.  Possibly people would say that this was not enough, but it would still be a growth in comparison with the two previous years.  The Government have opted for a massive stimulus on the assumption that there will be an increase in growth over and above the 4 per cent or 5 per cent which would have occurred if there had not <Col N="1735" /> been such a stimulus.  They have declared a policy which would mean a reduction in unemployment of 25,000 per annum.  I would like to see a growth rate of 7 per cent, but I have my doubts in view of the approach of the Government in their financial proposals. I believe that a great proportion of the increased personal spending which is provided for through income tax allowances will go on imports rather than on home produced goods. This is very unfortunate, but because of our international commitments <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC we have little control over our imports.</P>
    <P>People are not as conscious of buying Irish as they might be.  We are told in the manifesto that a 3 per cent switch from foreign to Irish goods would yield 10,000 extra jobs, a worthwhile exercise if we could get the people to engage in it.  I know that many such campaigns have been mounted by various Governments, way back to the Cosgrave Government in the early thirties.  One of the first political speeches I ever heard was in the Bull Ring in Wexford when the then President, Mr. Cosgrave, spoke in a Buy Irish campaign.  It did not seem to be successful.</P>
    <P>I was present at a meeting in Wexford recently which was attended by Deputy Burke, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  He acquitted himself reasonably well, but it appeared to me&mdash;and I said it at the time&mdash; that there was no follow-up to this.  I may be a bit premature in offering this mild criticism but the Minister of State could well be engaged full time on that assignment if, as the manifesto says, a 3 per cent switch would mean the creation of 10,000 extra jobs.  This is a massive number of jobs for such a relatively small exercise by the Minister and it should be pursued in a much more vigorous way.  Perhaps the campaign has not gained full momentum as yet.  What concerns us is whether the target for employment will be met.  The manifesto and the White Paper, &ldquo;National Development, 1977-80&rdquo;, provides a reduction of 25,000 in numbers out of work by the end of 1978 <Col N="1736" /> compared to the time when this Government took office.</P>
    <P>That also visualised a live register of from 85,000 to 90,000.  The unemployment figures given must be confusing to the ordinary public when various figures are thrown from both sides of the House.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, said recently that by the end of 1978 the figures would be between 92,000 and 100,000. It is very difficult to know what figure the Government are aiming at or what the result will be after the financial proposals are implemented, particularly so far as job creation is concerned. That prediction by that Minister is not very optimistic and cannot be reconciled with the Government's anticipated number of jobs to be created and to the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>It is true that unemployment has fallen by 6,000 since the Government took office but there is still much leeway to be made up.  In mentioning unemployment it is important to note with some anxiety that at present we have about 10,000 emigrants.  That figure has not been contradicted and is as high as it was in the sixties.  We all hope this trend will not continue because over the last 30 or 40 years we have lost too many of our young boys and girls to Great Britain in particular and to other countries.</P>
    <P>I regret that I do not believe the employment targets will be met, even through the proposal to provide jobs by direct State employment.  I say this because my experience with Fianna Fáil Governments in respect of many other public works and the provision of money for them is that while they say they have the money and provide for it in the Estimate, they do not spend it. Therefore, I would urge the Minister to ensure that any money, whether for housing, road construction or any other works, will be spent.  These jobs can be provided if the Government put up the cash, but reliance on private enterprise will not create sufficient jobs.</P>
    <P>I am not aware if what I am about to quote has been quoted already but <Col N="1737" /> the Confederation of Irish Industry recently held a survey the results of which were published on 28 February last.  In that survey one of the questions posed to the member firms was</P>
    <P>What employment increase would be associated with actions to increase output by up to 30% over the next two years?</P>
    <P>The response as described by the CII was as follows:</P>
    <P>22% of firms saw no employment increase ensuing but the main concentration of employment increase was in the 5% to 14% range&mdash;that is 56.1% of firms.  The implication of the distribution of anticipated employment increases would suggest that many firms see scope for achieving output increases from increased productivity rather than increased employment....</P>
    <P>From the results of this survey it is clear that 22 per cent of the manufacturing firms surveyed saw no employment increase associated with the 30 per cent increase in output while 56 per cent of firms felt that a 30 per cent increase in output would on average involve only a 10 per cent increase in employment.  I am sure that was brought to the Minister's attention the day after it was published.  The Minister has an obligation to comment on the results of that survey because the CII say in no uncertain terms that so far as the Government proposals in respect of industry are concerned, they will not produce the number of jobs the Government expect.  It is no secret that the Labour Party have always believed that there has been too much dependence on the private sector and that that would not solve our unemployment problem.  That has been spelt out very clearly in the CII survey.</P>
    <P>At the last election and at our annual conference this year we confirmed a policy for the establishment of a national development corporation which would be under the direct control of the Government and whose main function would be to participate in industry and to assist industry in every way possible because we cannot <Col N="1738" /> depend on private industry to provide more jobs.  It always appeared that Fianna Fáil placed too much dependence on the private sector.  We believe that the establishment of an institution, such as the national development corporation, would enable this very important and serious work to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to question the wisdom of the provisions in this Bill which are designed to stimulate investment by giving incentives through tax cuts.  I have already mentioned that as far as personal cuts are concerned we hope any money that accrues from such a measure will be spent on Irish goods and will not be sent abroad to pay for imported goods or materials.</P>
    <P>Section 21 extends entitlement to free depreciation for new plant and equipment for an indefinite period. These allowances are given for a period of two years and may be extended by two years.  What will this measure cost?  If private enterprise say they cannot provide jobs why should we give them this concession?  Section 24 applies the same principle in the matter of free depreciation on new industrial buildings from February this year.  Taking sections 21 and 24 together must mean a big tax saving. In my view that will mean increased profits, not an increased number of jobs.  If that is the case I again ask the Minister are the provisions in sections 21 and 24 really necessary?</P>
    <P>In the matter of allowances, section 19 refers to a measure introduced by the National Coalition Government in their last budget in 1977.  We introduced a reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 45 per cent to 25 per cent for manufacturing companies who could show an increase in employment and in sales.  Section 19 of this Bill amends our policy by removing the sales test and the main criteria for tax concessions will now be an increase in employment.  I agreed with the Coalition proposal and I am not opposed to section 19 of this Bill.  This was only introduced at the beginning of 1977 but I would like to know how many companies have claimed tax concessions under the provisions in section 19.  Is <Col N="1739" /> this proposal, initially introduced by the Coalition Government, working? One must question all types of assistance to industry.  I am not against helping industry in order to provide employment but recently the Minister for Labour said that the employment premium scheme is not working as well as expected.  That is disappointing. This scheme was introduced by Deputy O'Leary, the former Minister, and was continued and the premium increased by the present Minister.  The premium is very generous, so it is difficult to know how industry can be assisted.  As far as concessions to business are concerned there are better ways of spending money than by giving tax concessions to private enterprise. More money could be invested in State enterprises in order to provide for more efficiency and to provide for more employment.  Next year's Finance Bill must come up with better ideas or else the job targets will not be met.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on national development introduced by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development described the Government's economic strategy as a gamble.  That was a most irresponsible statement.  It should not be a gamble.  The Minister has no right to gamble with the future of this country.  Fianna Fáil regard themselves as the party of reality and they will certainly be up against reality in the next few years.  Borrowing £841 million and describing as a gamble the strategy employed by the Government is scandalous.  I do not know whether the Minister qualified it or not but he certainly did not present the Fianna Fáil party as a party of reality in that statement.</P>
    <P>The main objection we have is to the abolition of wealth tax.  The provision for the collection of wealth tax was not abolished but section 36 provides for the non-operation of the wealth tax for this year and I presume this will be repeated in the next budget.  Alternatively the Minister might realise that the wealth tax should be collected this year.  The abolition of this tax means a loss of £8.5 million a year.  The present Minister for Finance when in <Col N="1740" /> Opposition vigorously opposed the introduction of the wealth tax and said it was a disincentive to investment and that it favoured foreign investors rather than home investors in industry. That is not a fact but a belief of the Minister.  The decision not to collect wealth tax will cost the Exchequer £8.5 million per year.  This is not a large amount in the context of all the Estimates and it is certainly a small amount out of over £2,000 million but it is not small so far as social welfare recipients are concerned.  That £8.5 million could increase social welfare payments by 4 per cent, it could provide for the increases in social welfare benefits in October next; it could provide 2,000 jobs in the health services, or it could allow the local authority to construct 700 houses per annum.  While the amount might be trivial in relation to all the Estimates it is not trivial as far as the use to which it could be put is concerned.  Contrary to what has been stated it will not mean an extra job.</P>
    <P>There is moral justification for such a tax.  People who have amassed enormous amounts of money have an obligation to contribute to the rest of society.  People should be rewarded for initiative, effort and investment but I would question how large sums of money have been amassed.  There are only 24 hours in a day and there is a limit to what people can do.  I suspect that many of the people who complain about the imposition of wealth tax amassed money in a short time by deals, mergers, exploitation and high prices.  These people are not interested in the welfare of the country, they are only interested in money.  These people are only asked to contribute 1 per cent of their wealth after very generous tax concessions are allowed.  There was never such a clamour about a tax since the imposition of the turnover tax.  This group of people who own £1,000 million are a very small but vocal group.  We are told that this wealth tax is against the interests of the country but it is not peculiar to Ireland.  Countries such as Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Iceland, India, Norway and Sweden have a <Col N="1741" /> wealth tax.  Their economies are not much different from ours but the wealth tax has not held back their economic growth.  The economic argument against the wealth tax is not proved but the moral argument in favour of it is overwhelming.  In abolishing or not collecting wealth tax and in easing capital gains tax the Government have given £2,000 per annum to the wealthiest 5,000 in our society and by contrast the increase given to the old age pensioner for the coming year is £50.</P>
    <P>When one considers the immorality of section 36 it is not surprising to find the same lack of moral concern in section 5 dealing with personal income tax concessions.  It is amazing that section 5 does not contain any reliefs for children.  Section 5 discriminates against families.  Deputy Fitzpatrick gave an example of what it would mean to families.  It is enough for me to say that a married couple with all their children out at work get the same tax relief as a married couple with six, eight or any number of children.</P>
    <P>For the first time in many years the Finance Bill does not give any increase in children's allowances.  What has the Minister got against families? Why are they discriminated against in section 5?  The income tax allowances generally should have favoured the lower income groups and larger families.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the abolition of car tax on vehicles of 16 h.p. and less.  That was a very attractive promise by Fianna Fáil before the election and it bought many votes.  So did the abolition of rates on private dwellings.  I do not think the abolition of car tax on 16 h.p. vehicles has taken the motorist out of his troubles because in the last 12 months there has been a colossal increase in car insurance which will blot out the tax concession.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I do not object to the concessions granted, but incomes are being eroded by price increases.  The Government should have another look at their manifesto, paragraph 4, in relation to <Col N="1742" /> prices.  It promised full dissemination, at least once a week, to radio, television and newspapers of comparative prices of the most frequently purchased consumer goods in supermarkets in different parts of the country.  I do not think that can be operated, valuable as the idea was.  I suggest that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn should have a look at that paragraph.</P>
    <P>This first Finance Bill of the Fianna Fáil Government panders to the rich, not unusual as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  For much needed employment dependence is almost entirely on the private sector, and I suggest that is a completely wrong approach.  The Bill gambles with the future of the nation. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development, young in his membership of the House, considers the framing of a Finance Bill and the running of the economy to be a poker game&mdash;he described it as a gamble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill is not a measure on which one can make a general speech.  First of all I will refer to column 552 of the Official Report for 9 May 1978 where the Minister is reported as follows:</P>
      <P>The generous increases in the personal income tax allowances were a vital element in securing an orderly and moderate development of incomes. As Deputies are aware, agreement has been reached since the budget on a national pay agreement.</P>
      <P>The effect of that agreement is that the restraints of the workers this year will result in a huge increase in Exchequer receipts.  When we were in office I saw year after year that, as wage agreements were ratified after bargaining, a huge sum of money became available to the Government for dissemination. We have a mixed economy with many people such as farmers, shopkeepers and professional men self-employed. They get higher increases than those given to workers in national agreements. That means higher revenue from VAT and other taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have the Minister for Finance making speeches to the effect that the hair shirt must be put on. Could anything be more dishonest? <Col N="1743" /> Let us consider the various items the Minister put in his shop window.  At column 552 of the Official Report, volume 306, the Minister referred to the various incentives designed to encourage what he called &ldquo;the spirit of enterprise and expansion in the private sector&rdquo;.  These included corporation tax reliefs for small companies.  If small companies are any good they will become larger companies by re-investment of profits in the form of capital expenditure.  That means they do not pay corporation tax.  Indeed I suggest that taxation lies very lightly on business in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech spoke of simplification of the arrangements covering a special reduced rate of corporation tax for manufacturing companies which achieve expansion. Before this Bill reached us the situation in relation to what a company could set against net profits in respect of capital expenditure&mdash;machinery and plant&mdash;was wholly adequate.</P>
    <P>On the question of continuation of stock relief, about two-and-a-half years ago there was a huge increase in the cost of stocks and the Coalition Government introduced stock relief. This meant that the person who had a huge investment in stock which was necessary could set that against his tax and defer payment of the tax.  That situation has not changed this year.  As there has been some levelling out in the cost of living it may be that next year the Minister will make an adjustment, but nothing has been given this year that was not given before.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very vocal about well-heeled ladies.  At column 553 of the Official Report of 9 May he stated:</P>
    <P>Section 2 changes the basis of division of their personal allowances and reliefs between spouses in cases of separate assessment.  The section provides that where separate assessment has been claimed or is claimed in future, the allowances and reliefs of the married couple will in general be divided equally between them instead of in proportion to their incomes as has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> That is all very well, but how much extra money does it give the husband and the wife?  What is the difference in the tax on the total income?  My view is that it makes no difference whatever.  I should like the Minister in his reply to tell us what difference that has made to a couple having a joint income of £5,000.  I am suggesting that the answer is nil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be right.  I never suggested that these changes will change the total tax payable by a couple.  They alter the imposition of tax on one as against the other, but I never suggested anything else.</P>

      <P>At column 553 of the Official Report the Minister states:</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that every married woman who has income of her own will become aware of her rights under existing tax laws, including in particular her entitlement to be separately assessed to tax and to make a separate return of income. I have, therefore, arranged that the Revenue Commissioners will issue to married women with incomes of their own a leaflet explaining entitlements under tax law and a simple form by which a married woman may, if she so wishes, exercise her right to claim separate assessment.</P>
      <P>No group knows its rights better than does the married woman.  The various associations have excellent, vocal people and I have met them in my political and business life.  While a man may be a little slack with regard to seeking his entitlements, the woman with the shopping basket knows all about the bills she will have to pay. Sending out a leaflet, as suggested by the Minister, will make no difference whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the provision where interest on borrowings for capital investment in a company will be charged against tax for the personal investor. <Col N="1745" /> This country has large industries such as Cement-Roadstone, Guinness, Waterford Glass and so on, but the small companies that are privately owned total far more than the large undertakings.  They may not hit the headlines, they may not have large advertisements on television and in the newspapers but, added together, they are far more important.  I am glad that interest on borrowing for investment in such companies can be charged against tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the fact that there were no increases granted for children's allowances or increases for social welfare for children. That is a public scandal.  Deputy Fitzpatrick also referred to the capital acquisitions tax and the question of valuation as set out on 28 February 1974.  He said it was quite improper that this was not increased in relation to the value of property.  Even though farmers are doing extremely well, perhaps even having their best decade since the State was founded, the return on capital for them is far lower than in any other branch of production.  If a person calculates the return on land that costs £2,500 or £3,000 per acre one can see that the return is extremely low.  The Minister for Finance may not be aware of this because of his urban background but it is well known to the Chair and many of us here&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The return on agricultural land is lower than in any other sphere of productive activity and the reason is very simple.  There is not much point in my buying 50 acres of land in County Wexford because I could not administer it, but if that acreage came onto the market within one mile of my farm I would feel like borrowing in order to buy it, and so would ten other people.  They would <Col N="1746" /> be interested because they could work the land and get to it easily.  They could do what I did yesterday evening &mdash;walk through two fields of barley to make sure there was no disease in it What is important in this matter is scarcity value.  If a farmer has 150 acres and is getting a reasonable profit and if 50 acres adjoining his land comes on the market, he will set aside portion of his income for the next five or ten years.  He will pay far too much because it may be his only chance to extend his holding.  I do not have to remind the House of the problems of agricultural holdings in this country and the aims of the Land Commission. It is connected with the fact that holdings are far too small.  That is why land has reached such a value.  That is why the capital acquisition tax was not corrected.  When Deputy Fitzpatrick was speaking this afternoon the Minister intervened and said that on 28 February 1974 we set a figure of £150,000 before a person started to pay tax on a gift to his son.  He did not say that before the election.  It is very interesting to see what Fianna Fáil said before the general election.  I should like to quote from page 20 of the infamous manifesto.</P>
      <P>A farmer can opt for assessment by submitted accounts with the option of averaging his profits over a 3-year period, due to the cyclical nature of farming or by the notional system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They did not tell the farmer that if he opted for the notional system he had to stay with it.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, he had to buy a pig in a poke, because his figure had been brought from 65 to 90 and it stood at 90.  He did not know if it would be ten next year or 190, but if he went for one year on the notional system he had to stay with it.  That meant that no matter how bad a harvest might be, no matter what losses the farmer had with brucellosis or TB in his dairy herd, no matter what happened to him in whatever sphere of agriculture he was engaged, he had to stay with his notional system for three years and multiply his valuation by 90, or some other figure that nobody knows, <Col N="1747" /> deduct the various deductions and pay on what was left.  That is totally unfair.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 on page 20 of the manifesto states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will allow rates on land as an instalment of a farmer's tax bill resulting in a tax saving for farmers of £10 million.</P>
    <P>The removal of the agricultural grant is very close to a similar figure.  Fianna Fáil in the manifesto told farmers that they could set off their rates against their tax bill but they did not say they would remove the agricultural grant. They gave them one side of the ledger but did not give them the other.  The situation is quite simple at the moment.  The agricultural grant looks quite small, although it was increased from time to time.  It could mean to a farmer employing five men a few hundred pounds and to a small farmer a smaller sum.  This went to almost all farmers.  In addition there was the agricultural grant in respect of the first portion of the valuation not being rated.</P>
    <P>What will happen when the agricultural grant is deducted and the farmer can set his rates against his tax bill? I do not want to quote from columns I have here from the Irish Farmers Association.  I simply want to say that they said that with £60 PLV, the net amount payable is £224, an increase of £87.5 and, with £200 valuation, an increase of £592 or 59 per cent.  This is an outside body with obviously an interest of their own.  The Minister should disprove those figures or he should accept them.  He should admit that Fianna Fáil did not tell the farmer they would get rid of the agricultural grant.  They just told him that he could set his rates off against his tax bill.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of farm family labour.  If a man goes for the notional system, there is no provision in the Finance Bill for family labour. The farming organisations have submitted to the Government a system which will remove any abuses which could occur if this allowance were restored&mdash;in other words, a proportion of the employment grant.  That would <Col N="1748" /> be registration for PAYE, limitation of the allowance to children engaged full time on the farm, an age limit of 16 years or over, an encouragement for family labour in line with the encouragement for industrial labour which, following on the Coalition Government's line, is now being given by this Government.  Those things have not been done and the farmers must suffer.</P>
    <P>We would have allowed contractors' charges against the tax bill and we would also have allowed depreciation on machinery.  As Deputy Corish pointed out, we were rising from a very bad depression.  We had gone through a period when Fianna Fáil were trying to pull us down instead of trying to build up a Government in trouble, just as all Governments in Europe were in trouble.  No depreciation has been given as far as farm machinery is concerned. I cannot understand why it is not possible to give this.  I want to question the figure, given by the Minister in his speech, of £14 million collected in farmers' tax last year.  He said that it was far too small and that another 7,000 had to be brought in in the interests of equity.  He said at column 555 of volume 306 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The need for these measures is clear from the low yield from farmer taxation in 1977-78, which is expected to be about £14 million.  The new measures are estimated to yield about £24 million from farmers in the tax year 1978-79.</P>
    <P>How could the Minister hope in the first year of farmers' tax to collect it all?  The Government seem to be setting out to tax all the farmers of the country.  If the Government want to do that, or even to tax a small number of them, their numbers are so large that, with the existing number of Revenue staff, it is not a job for a month or a year, but one for five years.  I suggest that when the Minister gives £14 million in respect of tax paid by farmers last year that that figure is far too low and that the tax payment will amount to far more than £14 million.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill will not pass through the House easily.  On Committee <Col N="1749" /> Stage many amendments and votes will be necessary.  At that time it will be possible to give even better exposition of the duplicity of the Government. I hope to be right in there battling when that occurs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>The affairs of high finance are seldom clear to the average person.  As I look on myself as an average person, I have no intention of pretending that I am qualified to speak with any authority on its complexities. However, I am confident to speak of what I regard as the bread and butter issues of the financial structure of the country.  I do not know where the Government are heading and, like so many others, I am confused to a degree that there are times when I have to stop and think in the hope of making sense of the situation.</P>
      <P>The members of the Government promised the people the best the world could offer when they sought their support this time last year.  The people who voted for Fianna Fáil must be questioning their decision today.  Who could blame them?  The country is in turmoil financially, industrially and socially.  Yet we have the Government stating there are no problems that cannot be solved.  What concerns me is the failure to solve the problems and I am even more worried by the apparent lack of concern on the part of certain Ministers with the various pimples breaking out on the face of Ireland.  Any good doctor will tell us that prevention is better than cure.  I am inclined to think this Government have gone beyond the stage of prevention after less than one year in office. What is needed now is the urgent attention of specialist skills in the financial ills of the community if those ills are to be cured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look around my own city and I see many young couples almost in despair because they cannot afford to buy the houses they had hoped to call their own eventually simply because prices have jumped away out beyond their means.  Many cannot even raise the deposit now.  The Government told the people they would make it easier for everyone to buy a home.  They made quite a big thing out of it, and rightly <Col N="1750" /> so, in view of its importance.  Were the Government deliberately misleading the people?  Perhaps they were but, if they were not, would they now admit they have bitten off a great deal more than they can chew.  Are we to take it the housing situation is to suffer drastically within the next year or two simply because Fianna Fáil were completely reckless in their promises of a better Ireland?</P>
    <P>What have they done to halt the exploiters in the building trade?  This could be an awkward question to pose in this House in view of the many vested interests in the industry and the huge profits produced by the industry. Nevertheless, if Fianna Fáil are sincere, they will come out now into the open and tell the people just what is happening behind the scenes where housing costs are concerned and where the provision of local authority housing schemes is concerned.  Am I to go back to Limerick and tell those who are clamouring for houses that they will have to wait for some time yet because the Government cannot afford to meet their needs or because the Government are, in fact, broke?</P>
    <P>There is no great harm in borrowing money provided it is borrowed with the intention of putting it to good use.  I would not condemn using borrowed money to create good employment because that is an investment that will give a good return in the long run but I am at a loss to understand why any sane Government should borrow money so that the rich can grow richer while the poor grow poorer.  A close look at what has happened with our borrowed money will show that it has quite simply been used to cushion the hard boards we may yet have to sit on.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset I am no expert on finance but I am trying to figure out just what happened to the investment that was supposed to provide badly needed employment for so many of our young and not so young people all over the country.  I cannot see any great urgency in the Government's task force to deal with unemployment.  It is very easy to talk about unemployment when one is oneself employed in a secure job.  It is very easy to sit back <Col N="1751" /> and discuss plans for the future development and prosperity of the nation in the years to come.  No one who has a job would appear to be in any great hurry to help those who are unemployed or to find a job which would offer them a fair return.  As I see things today the greater part of the problem where unemployment is concerned stems from too much talk and not enough action.  All the reports presented to the Government over the years remain on the shelves awaiting consideration, reports which, if implemented, could change the economic face of the land right now when thousands of our young people are facing their leaving certificate.  What kind of future is in store for them? What is the purpose of their education if it cannot be put to the benefit of the nation and themselves?</P>
    <P>Our whole approach to the existing crisis of unemployment is all wrong. The Government are well aware of the urgent need to provide bridges, roads, houses and schools, just to mention a few outlets which could provide good employment.  When the local authority of which I am a member seeks prompt attention to its proposals every excuse is offered to delay implementation of those proposals.  In Limerick we need two bridges over the Shannon, if we are to prevent the entire region from slipping back into a state of chronic disruption.  But we cannot get the co-operation of the Government to go ahead with these bridges.  I know there is a great deal of red tape involved but I cannot over-emphasise the volume of employment that would be available in both the city and county if only the Government would cut through the red tape and move fast so that these two bridges could be built as quickly as possible.  The Government should lead the way.  It should show the country it is sincere in its efforts to wipe out unemployment.  Make no mistake about it unemployment can be wiped out if the Government treat it as an emergency.  An emergency is just what it is, probably the worst and greatest emergency we have suffered in our time.</P>
    <P>Finance must be made available to tackle this problem without any more <Col N="1752" /> delay because through the provision of finance for such a vital purpose the Government will be investing money in men and women, the best and most important investment of all. The more we have in employment the more money there will be in circulation and, the more money there is in circulation, the more people will find employment.  It has often been said that one must spend money to make money.  Never would this apply more forcibly than in the unemployment crisis of today.  I cannot understand the mentality of some of those who claim to be concerned with the problem because I am satisfied that very few indeed have rolled up their sleeves to tackle the biggest challenge this country has faced.  It is about time the Government faced up to the challenge, or else resigned and let those who are prepared to do it get on with the job.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that while the Government are barely a year in office there is considerable unrest throughout the country because of the manner in which certain sections of our commercial interests are getting away with high profits while the man in the street is crucified with all kinds of taxation, particularly income tax.  Surely the Government are fully aware of the feelings of the people who put them into power. More than one Minister has stated frequently that Fianna Fáil have the trust and confidence of the people.  In my book, either Government Ministers are closing their eyes to reality or else they are trying to bluff the people into believing everything will be all right tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The big question that bothers the small man like myself is simply just where is all the money going?  I am well aware that, if I take time out to study what I will call our balance sheet, I will see there all the details. But I am sure I am not the only one here who cannot fully understand the contents of such a document.  In fact, I am wondering whether some of our top economists and accountants understand it.  Certainly one cannot be blamed for getting the impression that even they get bogged down in the <Col N="1753" /> maze of figures that make absolutely no sense.  One thing is certain: such figures fail to tell the tragic story of how so much money has been so badly spent on such useless projects while the man on the ground can only gaze now and then at the growing number of ivory towers, the privileged occupants of which seem to enjoy their own laws and their own dictates in the influential sphere of life, and slot away the knowledge that every penny he has earned is carefully recorded against him by his employer, an employer who is now in fact acting as an agent for the Revenue Commissioners. The sooner we bring this scandal out into the open the better for the country.</P>
    <P>We have national wage agreements to keep the worker in his place.  But while this applies to workers at all levels&mdash;and anyone who earns his or her living may be regarded as a worker &mdash;there are those who find no problem in getting away with many additions by way of cash payments.  If they are entitled to these payments, the best of luck to them.  However, I will not be happy until the Government take some action and have a closer look at the workings of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to income tax.  The men and women working in the offices of the Revenue Commissioners are in no way to blame.  They do their best to help and advise people, and but for their co-operation many a hardworking person would be grossly overtaxed.</P>
    <P>What a stupid attitude the Government are adopting.  We are urgently in need of greater employment and greater production in order to compete against the best in the Common Market, but we are obstructing such development.  Why can we not give the worker an uplift and an incentive to work harder if he wants to?  No matter how good a person's pay packet might be, the extra few quid are always welcome, perhaps to buy something special for the home or for a good holiday.  The cost of living today makes it almost impossible to achieve anything, and this position is aggravated by the amount of income tax people have to pay.  Surely the Government <Col N="1754" /> can show their faith in the workers by the creation of a new form of income tax which would enable those who want to earn more and to prove their worth to their families and their country to do so.  Is it because our top brass do not want to be disturbed from their slumbers that this country is being allowed to drift into decay?  Unless the finances of the nation are handled properly and unless every Government Department is made aware of the crisis we are in, then God help Ireland in the years ahead.  There is far too much slumbering in the Government and in the civil service.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I do not presume to know a lot about high finance, but in my day I was a punter and I used to go to the races, as did a lot of my friends and colleagues.  None of us ever made it pay.  The Minister for Finance has been quoted as saying on a few occasions that his budget was a gambler's budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very interesting and revealing debate, not only in relation to the provisions in the Bill before us but also, more particularly, in relation to the underlying economic policy involved in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry will recall hearing me on quite a number of occasions, when I was sitting where he is now, pointing out that, no matter how good a policy any Government had, if they did not have or were not in a position to generate confidence in our people then their policy would not work. I said it repeatedly when I was in his position&mdash;he might even say <i>ad nauseam.</i>  It is interesting to know that that confidence is now there.  We are talking about the underlying policy involved in this Bill, and the most important thing is to recall that that confidence is there.  Without it we can do nothing; with it and with the right policies we can accomplish a very great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A continuing theme running through this debate, and one that was contributed to by Deputy Cluskey outside the House and by quite a number of speakers on the other side in this debate, was reference to the Taoiseach's speech to the Confederation of Irish Industries and to other Ministerial speeches in which reference was made to the fact that we are going to have to restrain public expenditure in certain areas.  In particular in regard to the speech by the Taoiseach but also in regard to the other speeches, Deputy Cluskey said there <Col N="1756" /> was recognition by Fianna Fáil of the failure of their policies.  Other Deputies said it was said we were indicating how we were going to pay for our promises.  Where were these Deputies during the past few years? Seldom has a policy been more clearly and consistently spelled out.  Back as far as the autumn of 1976, when Fianna Fáil were in opposition, we issued a document on economic policy.  In that document we said there were three major problems facing the country, namely, unemployment, inflation and the state of the Government's finances.  We went on to say that even Fianna Fáil could not tackle these three problems together, that we would have to choose our priorities and the priorities were unemployment and inflation, and thereafter the state of the Government's finances would have to be tackled.  That was in the autumn of 1976.  In our manifesto, on page 8, we said of the economic action programme which we outlined in it:</P>
    <P>It will lower inflation, cut unemployment dramatically and then restore stability to the Government's own finances,....</P>
    <P>It went on to set out clearly that we propose to reduce borrowing as a percentage of GNP.  Having increased it this year, we propose to reduce it next year with a further substantial reduction in the following year.  The same policy was spelled out in the budget speech and in the White Paper and is now repeated in the Taoiseach's speech and the other speeches referred to.  Where have these Deputies been when all this was being said?  Why is this a big surprise?  Why is it evidence, according to them, of the failure of the Fianna Fáil policy?  It is evidence, of the consistent application of Fianna Fáil policy enunciated over the past few years as being the only way forward to tackle the major problems which we have inherited from our predecessors.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Parties would like everybody to forget the shocking state in which they left the finances of this country.  They piled debt upon debt with very little to show for it.  The major test of success of the Government <Col N="1757" /> policy is and will continue to be the situation in regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk in this regard during the debate but I noticed that when in Government neither Fine Gael nor Labour had any remedy for unemployment and when it came to the election they offered no remedy either.  But in a state of panic half way through the campaign they produced a document which purported to deal with this question.  However that document was discredited the moment it was issued.  Apart from its intrinsic lack of merit the members of the then Government at the press conference at which the document was launched were so much at odds among themselves as to what was involved, as to the number of jobs and the cost, that the document never got off the ground.  What is interesting is that although they had no policy or no remedy for unemployment while in Government or during the election campaign, they have no policy yet in this regard.  Indeed, their general attitude seems to be the same as when they were in Government&mdash;the attitude that we must drift along in the hope of an upturn in the world economy. There is the infamous expression of my predecessor that our economy was like a cork on the oceans of the world and that we had as much control over our destiny as that cork would have.</P>
    <P>That is the attitude that is put forward clearly in this debate.  Thankfully those parties are no longer in office because if they were in office and we were waiting for an upturn in the world economy we would be in a bad way now.  Such upturn as there has been in the world economy took place at the end of 1975, through 1976 and petered out in the first half of 1977. That was before we came to office. Despite the fact that the upturn has petered out we are making the progress we said we would make and, luckily, the country is not waiting for an upturn in the world economy and that there is not a Government which says that nothing can be done about our situation.  I have always maintained that the worse the situation became the greater was the obligation on the <Col N="1758" /> Government to try to counteract it in so far as that is possible.  I have never pretended either in Government or in opposition that we are not affected seriously by developments outside but I have contended always that we have an obligation to bestir ourselves in so far as we can in controlling our own destiny.  That is what this Government are doing despite the petering out of the upturn in the world economy.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Quinn the Labour Party's answer to the problem of unemployment seems to be to wave aloft a banner with a strange device&mdash; socialism&mdash;and a very strange device that was on this occasion because Deputy Quinn said that socialism had achieved full employment.  He did not say where this had happened but later in his speech when he referred to Cuba and, I think, to China&mdash;although it may have been Russia&mdash;I asked him if he were holding these countries up as ones that we should emulate.  The Deputy denied this hastily and said he would tell us about that later.  Very significantly, though, he did not tell us about that later.  This ritual invocation of socialism can hardly be thought of by anybody with any degree of intelligence as being an answer to the problems facing this country.  If people want the public in general to believe that socialism provides an answer to our problems there is an obligation to spell out precisely in what way socialism can solve our problems.  It is not enough to repeat parrot-like the words &ldquo;national development corporation&rdquo;, something about which we have heard so often.  It is necessary to say what is proposed to be done and how it is proposed to do it.</P>
    <P>We in Government have committed ourselves to specific targets of job creation.  When Labour or Fine Gael are prepared to do likewise and, like us, to demonstrate how they propose to achieve the targets, they can criticise us but unless and until they do so they are largely irrelevant to the real problems facing our people.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk of the Fianna Fáil manifesto and in particular of the proposals for job creation.  It is of some significance that efforts are being made by our opponents to confuse <Col N="1759" /> the situation that arises.  It is fairly evident that they expect us to achieve our targets and that they are trying to prepare the ground for pretending that we have failed. They are doing this by shifting around the targets.  They seem to have confused even some political commentators, one of whom has referred to the numbers game in a way that implies that we are altering the figures as set out in our manifesto.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey is reported in the newspapers as having made a speech outside the House in which he contended that we had undertaken to reduce the live register by 25,000 by the end of this year.  We did not undertake anything of the kind and the Deputy knows that well.  However, is he making these contentions because he is afraid that we will produce 25,000 new jobs by the end of this year?  I think he is so afraid, but whatever is his reasoning he might explain at some stage why he misrepresents deliberately what is stated clearly in our manifesto.  In any discussion of this matter what must be understood first is that every job created reduces unemployment by one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development that is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a basic truth but let me develop it.  Whether the creation of a new job reduces the live register depends on whether the person going into the job is on the live register but if there is created a job into which goes a young person who is not on the live register, is unemployment being reduced?  It is self-evident that it is being reduced.  The other aspect is that if a job is created and is filled by somebody who is on the live register and if a redundancy occurs somewhere else, is employment being reduced? Again the answer is &lsquo;yes.&rsquo; otherwise the unemployment figure would be one greater.  Therefore, it is clear that every new job reduces unemployment by one.  If the Deputies grasp that point and then consider the manifesto they will realise that it is precisely what is being said.</P>

      <P>The semantics are on the other side.  However, what I have explained was the basis on which we prepared our manifesto.  In this connection I would refer the House to page 7 of the manifesto where there is a large heading which reads &ldquo;Provide 20,000 new jobs within twelve months,&rdquo; and underneath is spelled out the way that is to be done.  If the Deputies turn to page 9 they will find set out a table in which it is clear that the 12 months referred to are the 12 months of 1978.  It will be seen that it appears there under the heading &ldquo;Reduction in Unemployment&rdquo;. Any reasonable reading of the manifesto shows that what was meant by a reduction in unemployment of 20,000 in 1978 was the creation of 20,000 new jobs in 1978.  One cannot read the manifesto otherwise.</P>

Did we not talk repeatedly about the creation of 20,000 new jobs in the first year?  Is not that what we said time after time? Is that not what the people understood us to say?  Why do we have this nonsense of trying to confuse the issue? That is what the people understood and that is the way we will be judged. I suggest that Deputies should judge us in the same way that the people, the ultimate judges, will judge us on the basis of what they understood us to promise.  They know what we promised and they will decide whether we have fulfilled our promises.</P>

      <P>I will issue an invitation to Deputy Barry, if he wishes to test this, to go out and knock on a dozen doors anywhere he likes and ask people what they understood Fianna Fáil to promise about unemployment in the first year.  I guarantee that nine out of ten will reply that Fianna Fáil said that they would create 20,000 new jobs in one year.  If that is true, why are we wasting time here?  If it is not true, I trust Deputy Barry's honesty to come in here and tell us that result.  Deputy Barry may do this on his own or with me.</P>
      <P>We heard a great deal on this topic from people claiming that our job programme has failed.  I noticed at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis that Deputy Garret FitzGerald has been learning a little: he is sounding a note of caution and saying that they should not say it has failed before it has because they have not the evidence.  He is very wise in saying that.  If it fails we will hear about it soon enough from across the House, but the Opposition should not tell us that it has failed when the evidence is that it is succeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some information I should like to give the House on the question of what is actually happening.  The most regular source of information on unemployment is the weekly live register and the latest figure is for 12 May 1978.  At that date the live register stood at 105,176, which is a fall of 7,800 or 7 per cent on the corresponding week in 1977.  This is the largest fall in the live register since it started showing year on year declines in early 1977.  The register has fallen by 6,000 since the end of March.  There is a message in this and people should not deny what is happening.  On a seasonally adjusted basis the register has fallen by over 7,500 since last June, there being a drop of 1,700 in April alone.  We all know that the live register is not a perfect measure of unemployment. Its most serious deficiency is that it excludes first-time job seekers.  For that reason the drop in the register understates the total fall in unemployment and the rise in employment. Thus the improvement in the live register since the Government took office implies a much higher <Col N="1762" /> figure in terms of increased employment. There is every reason to expect that employment will continue to expand sharply in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute have noted that a slow fall in the live register, seasonally corrected, should not be used as evidence of a failure of employment to grow.  As I pointed out, seasonally adjusted figures have fallen sharply since mid-1977 and this is a further point in support of the claim that numbers at work have expanded substantially.</P>
    <P>The question of unemployment is perhaps the major test of success of the Government's policy, but we have had a number of references to emigration in the course of the discussion on unemployment.  The figure which is commonly tossed around for emigration last year is 10,000.  That may or may not be true; we do not know yet, I hear Deputies talking about emigration and seemingly trying to attribute it to this Government.  I recall that when we left Government in 1973 not alone had emigration ended but there was net immigration.  We have now inherited a situation from the Coalition in which there is emigration of an unknown figure, possibly in the region of 10,000 in the year.  That is no joy to anybody. I thought we had finally put an end to the evil of emigration.  We find on resuming office that emigration has begun again under the previous Government. One of the most important aspects of our job creation programme is the restoration of the position as it was under Fianna Fáil when emigration had ended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan raised some questions about the employment incentive scheme and qualifications for it.  It might be a bit time consuming to go through all the details, but I have here the answer to the questions he put and I will furnish these documents to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy and at least one other Deputy asked me about the implications of section 45 of the Bill in regard to the disclosure of information by the Revenue Commissioners.  In regard to the new scheme giving grants of £1,000 to first-time owner occupiers of new houses, the Minister for the Environment <Col N="1763" /> is concerned that the scheme should not be open to abuse.  To prevent this he requires to be able to verify from official income tax records statements made by applicants for grants. Section 45 empowers the Revenue Commissioners to provide the Minister with such information.  I can assure Deputy Treacy and anybody else who is concerned about this that the only information on a person's income tax return which would be of interest to the Department of the Environment is in relation to a claim for mortgage interest relief; in other words, if a person has claimed for mortgage interest relief, on the face of it he is not a first-time buyer.  That is all that is involved in this.</P>
    <P>As regards the other part of the section, which deals with the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, Deputy Treacy seemed to suggest that this was an ominous measure.  I would like to reassure him on that.  The provision is an enabling one and has been included to facilitate local authorities in the operation of the system of national aggregation of valuations which is provided for in the 1978 Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill when such aggregation is introduced. In other words, if we do not have a method whereby we can discover whether a farmer owns land outside a particular rating area, there could be very considerable abuses in regard to the agricultural grant.  This is merely a method of enabling a local authority to get the information necessary to ensure knowledge of what was the total holding of the farmer concerned to see where he fits into the scheme for relief under the agricultural grant.  Without this provision the only information available would relate to a particular rating area and one can see clearly where this could be abused.</P>
    <P>As I said when introducing the Second Stage, a similar provision was introduced in regard to a Social Welfare Act under the previous Government. I was somewhat surprised that two former members of that Government seemed to be expressing considerable misgivings about this <Col N="1764" /> without referring to what had been done under their Government.  As far as I know no problem has arisen in regard to what was done under the previous Government and the furnishing of information of this kind.  As far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, they give no information other than what they are authorised by statute to do and such authorisation, including the authorisation proposed in section 45, is extremely limited and only for the purposes therein mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry and others raised the question of indexing income tax allowances. I suppose he has to do this kind of thing, but he has a bit of a nerve to put this forward considering this Bill provides for very substantial increases in the personal income tax allowances which far exceed the current rate of inflation.  The increase of 57 per cent for a married person is much greater that the total increase given by the previous Government in the past three years and the percentage increases for single and widowed persons are almost equal to the total increases given to them over the previous three years.  At the same time we have reduced inflation substantially as compared with that experienced under the previous Government. Therefore, the real value of these increases is even greater.  I doubt very much if indexation would be a very popular measure at a time when inflation is reduced and is likely to be reduced further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The bands are not adjustable for inflation.  The levels of the bands are adjustable but not for inflation; that would have to be in the allowances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to another point.  A number of Deputies, speaking of the allowances and the bands, pointed out various people who did not, according to them, get relief under this Bill.  All taxpayers got relief.  One of the big points made was <Col N="1765" /> that there was no increase as regards the tax allowance in respect of children. That is true, but everybody&mdash;single person, widowed or married&mdash;got a very substantial increase which applies to all whether they have children or not.  If you had children you got a very substantial increase.  Why did we not provide the other allowances that were desirable, such as children's allowances and so on?  We would love to have done so, but we have to be realistic. The amount of money involved in the tax concessions this year far outweighs anything ever seen before. Furthermore, we specified precisely what we were going to do in our manifesto and that is exactly what is in this Bill, no more and no less.</P>
      <P>I will let the House into a little secret.  Despite the praise which has been lavished on the Fianna Fáil election campaign as an election campaign, we made one fairly serious slip up&mdash;our advertisements did not do justice to our manifesto.  They gave figures of reductions in income tax which were considerably less than implied in the manifesto and considerably less than what we are doing in this Bill.  We still have a little room for improvement.</P>

We have done what we said in the manifesto and in this year I could not have undertaken to do more or to do less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn seemed to be concerned about section 25, which provides tax relief in certain circumstances for measures designed to prevent pollution. I do not know if he is aware of the fact that firms are already entitled in computing their taxable profits to make deductions in respect of outlays directly incurred by them on the control of effluent resulting from their industrial operations.  It is only reasonable that they should be so entitled since such costs are a necessary expense of the enterprise.  If costs of control of effluent were not allowed as a deduction in computing taxable profits, this <Col N="1766" /> would clearly operate as a disincentive to industrial development, would amount to a significant harshening of the tax régime for industry and would act as a temptation for firms to skimp as much as possible on effluent control. Firms already have this relief.  All that is provided for in section 25 is that, where there is an operation carried out by a local authority which may benefit a number of firms together so that the contribution is made indirectly by the firm instead of directly&mdash;in other words, they have to contribute to the local authority instead of spending it directly&mdash;they would get the same tax treatment as if they had spent it directly.  I do not think there is any need for anybody to worry in that regard.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spent a considerable amount of their time talking about the abolition of wealth tax which is provided for in this Bill.  Whether or not one wants to argue about whether it is abolished or suspended&mdash;my intention is that it be abolished&mdash;I think it is necessary to treat is as it is treated in this Bill because of the continuing liability mentioned by one of the Deputies for outstanding wealth taxes yet to be collected.  As far as we are concerned wealth tax is abolished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> In relation to wealth tax, when this matter came up under the previous Government, the introduction of wealth tax seemed to be a crazy idea.  I am more convinced now than ever that it was.  Leaving aside the merits or demerits of a wealth tax the time at which it was introduced could not have been more inappropriate. There must be few people who could argue with that proposition. When it was introduced it could only add to the burden that was already bearing down on the economy.  Until our economy is vastly more developed than it is now the idea of a wealth tax would still be crazy in economic terms. If we ever reach a stage where wealth tax is feasible whoever is responsible for our affairs will review the matter again but in this situation which is likely to continue for a number of years the idea of a wealth tax does not make economic sense.  We have a lot of arguments about the social aspects and so on but it is incontrovertible that the wealth tax was operating against Irish people in favour of foreigners.  Nobody can deny that.  My predecessor did not deny it.  In terms of what we talk about as a return in the context of redistribution, the return was derisory.  We know that in specific cases jobs were lost directly as a result of the wealth tax being introduced. What we cannot quantify is the number of jobs indirectly lost or the number of jobs that might otherwise have been created but which were not. Various people have different ideas on this but as for redistribution nobody in his right mind could contend that the wealth tax as we had it was operating as a form of redistribution.  There is some evidence of an outflow of money as a result of that being introduced.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should know very well that the issues involved in this are wider than the wealth tax and cannot be interpreted in any reasonable way on the basis of the balance of payments.  The Deputy knows that and if he does not he should not pretend that he knows anything about economics.</P>

      <P>That fact is that that tax was totally inappropriate to our circumstances, it discriminated against Irish people and, perhaps most important of all, it was interfering with the provision of jobs.  Here I refer to something which Deputy Corish said earlier.  If he did not say it, I apologise to him in advance.  Deputy Corish talked in the context of social or moral concern.  The greatest evidence of social or moral concern that can be shown by any Government is a determined effort to provide jobs for those who have not got jobs.  That is the first and most urgent social concern, and that is the reason behind the abolition of the wealth tax&mdash;to try to ensure <Col N="1771" /> that we do not produce a situation which will hinder the creation of jobs, but on the contrary will encourage it.</P>

      <P>I would remind the House that this debate has gone on for a long time and it was particularly marked by lack of interruption. Each Deputy made his point.  I do not think the debate should be reduced to the kind of crossfire we have been having in the past few minutes.  I will not allow it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your remarks but you will be aware of the reason for the interruptions.  Anybody who has spent any time in the House is well aware of what has provoked the interruptions.  I am afraid the point is getting home to Deputies opposite, and they do not like it.</P>
      <P>Deputies Barry, Bruton, Fitzpatrick and others referred to the threshold for class 1 beneficiaries for capital acquisitions tax.  They said it had not been increased and they referred in particular to the effect of this on farmers.  As I explained to Deputy Fitzpatrick, I did not increase the threshold because I considered it was already at an adequate level.  Indeed I thought it was too high when it was introduced and I said so in this House. I do not think there is any point in trying to speculate what the Coalition might have done about this threshold if they had been in office, but I can refer to the White Paper on Capital Taxation issued by the Coalition and quote from paragraph 122 which is headed &ldquo;Review of Thresholds&rdquo;:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> The Government recognise that in terms of inflation capital taxes may all the time be taking a bite of capital which represents an increase in nominal values as distinct from a real increase in asset values.  To cope with this problem, the thresholds set out for the new capital taxes would need to be reviewed at regular intervals.  Such review would however be less necessary in the case of the threshold for liability for capital acquisitions tax by the immediate family in view of the high exemption figures proposed.</P>
    <P>That is the only indication we have of what Deputies opposite would have done if they were in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Minister for Finance gave an undertaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that under this provision, if a farmer wants either to leave or give a gift to one of his children of farm land and stock, the value of what he gives must be more than £¼ million before a penny of capital acquisitions tax is paid, and if it becomes payable it is only on the excess over £¼ million.  Given that, I do not think anybody will be surprised when I say that a search of the tax records has not revealed a single case of where a farmer's son or daughter, within the meaning of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, had been liable for the payment of tax on agricultural property.  So please do not let us get dramatic in the way some Deputies opposite did.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton suggested that I have not implemented my proposal in the budget to double the thresholds in Tables II, III and IV.  He appears not to understand the meaning of &ldquo;threshold&rdquo;.  Indeed the extract from my budget speech which he quoted draws a distinction between thresholds and ranges.  The doubling of the threshold of course involves adjustments to the various ranges within these tables, and I have done precisely that.  The increase in the threshold is added to the lower and the upper limits of each range and the result is that each part gets the benefit of the rate of the threshold.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be talking about something different from what he referred to in his contribution. He was wrong in what he said then and he was also wrong when he referred to a case of a transfer to a nephew who is living and working with his uncle on a 150-acre farm valued at £1,600 an acre.  If the nephew is living and working with the farmer one would expect that under the provisions of the original Act he would not be liable at all, but if he were liable he would not be liable for the £67,000 alleged by Deputy Bruton but for £38,900.</P>
      <P>A question was asked about the options, about opting for the accounts or the notional system under the income tax code for farmers and about being obliged to remain with the option for three years.  I have discussed this matter in relation to the option for the notional system with interested parties, including farming organisations. I do not accept the proposition that somebody is entitled to know three years ahead what the tax will be.  Nobody can know that&mdash;income tax rates may be changed any year.  However, I can accept that there could be a situation under the notional system where one would be taxed on an income one did not have at all, which is a different proposition, and in the light of that risk I have arranged that discussions which are taking place between the Revenue Commissioners and farming organisation representatives on certain other aspects of tax mentioned in our manifesto will also include a discussion on this problem.  I am sure a suitable solution will emerge.  If it does and it is followed by the people concerned, then those who opt for the notional system in 1978 will not be committed to continue for three years. There can be an amendment of the Act next year in line with any solution that may emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> A question was raised in regard to deduction on the notional basis for wages paid to family members employed on a full-time basis.  This matter has been abused grossly in the past and I am not prepared to agree to the proposals put forward.  However, I would be prepared to agree to deductions in cases where the sons or daughters, as the case may be, are paid not less than the minimum agricultural wage as laid down.  I am satisfied that an allowance on this basis will meet the needs of the farmers concerned but will preclude the type of abuse which necessitated the previous restriction as to registration for social welfare purposes, and I am prepared to introduce the necessary amendment on this during the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry's criticism of section 27 is not well-founded.  He criticised the section as involving a reduction in the income of shareholders in Irish companies and so discouraging investment in such companies.  The basic principle of corporation tax is that double taxation of Irish companies and their shareholders is mitigated when the shareholders are being assessed for tax by crediting them with a fraction of the corporation tax on the companies' profits out of which they receive their distribution.  The tax rate was fixed at 35/65ths of the cash distribution when the main corporation tax rate was 50 per cent.  When it was cut last year to 45 per cent a tax credit of 35/55ths of the cash distribution made out of profits was given subject to that new rate, and this means crediting shareholders, and paying to them in many cases, a larger fraction of the underlying corporation tax than before.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of the reduction to 30/70ths.  It maintains substantially the fraction of the corporation tax to be credited to shareholders.  It should be clear that companies' post-tax profits have increased as a result of the cut in the corporation tax from 50 per cent to 45 per cent.  Therefore, companies that continue to distribute the same fraction of their post-tax profits as before will distribute more cash and there will be no reduction in the income of shareholders arising from the reduction in the rate of tax credit.  In fact, <Col N="1775" /> shareholder's incomes would increase marginally in those cases.</P>
    <P>Of course, the companies will also have more cash to plough back into their business because they will be dividing the five points' reduction in the corporation tax paid between them and the shareholders.  However, if some companies now decide to distribute a smaller fraction of their post-tax profits and to hold on to most, if not all, of the benefit of the five points' cut in the corporation tax, I suggest that is a matter between the company concerned and the shareholders.  Certainly it has nothing to do with the Revenue.</P>
    <P>I would mention also that my predecessor indicated quite clearly that there would be a change in the reduction in this tax credit when he spoke as reported at column 494, Volume 306, of the Official Report of 10 May 1977.  He made it quite clear this would have to be done.  That is as I see the situation at the moment but I am open to persuasion and if it can be shown that the position is not as I have outlined or that it genuinely will operate to the detriment of Irish companies or investment in Irish companies I will look at it again.  However, the position seems to be as I have outlined it.</P>
    <P>Some people seemed to say we were giving far too much to the private sector but Deputy Donegan said we were giving them nothing.  It is true that we are proposing to rely substantially on the private sector but let us not mistake the fact that we are relying substantially on the public sector this year and that reliance on the private sector <Col N="1776" /> will begin to operate substantially from the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>There is a grave misunderstanding&mdash; it may be more than a misunderstanding&mdash;about the role of the private sector. It is axiomatic that industry must provide goods to the domestic and export markets at competitive prices and they must make sufficient profits to finance investment and to give an adequate return on capital.  Nobody can seriously suggest that employment in industry will be maintained, yet alone expanded, if profits are nonexistent. Profits are an essential source of investment financing, and thus of job maintenance and job creation. Profit is a legitimate return to those who risk and sometimes lose their capital.  We must live with these facts of life.  Therefore, I have no apology to make for the basic strategy that we are relying on and which we have outlined. We are relying on the public sector in the first year and thereafter on the private sector.  I have made it clear that if the private sector does not perform, we will review our stance on this.  I would say that those who talk about the public sector would do well to specify where precisely they see the public sector performing and how in the creation of jobs as against what we have committed ourselves to.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I hope to get the opportunity to go into detail on a number of points that were raised and perhaps on some of the points of principle in relation to particular sections.  However, I understand my time is up now.  I wish to commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. Youth Policy: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Kenny on Tuesday, 23 May 1978:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government either to immediately publish its own comprehensive Youth Policy or to adopt the <i>Policy for Youth and Sport</i> published by the then Government in May 1977, and to ensure that aid to voluntary youth organisations is such that their programmes can be maintained and expanded.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the Government's policy on Youth and Sport and acknowledges the progress that has been made to date.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Education).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment last evening I was taking up the point the Minister of State raised about the relationship between youth work and the educational system. The Minister of State asked whether or not we should be expecting youth services in the Department of Education's youth work to plug the gaps, as it were, left by the educational system and he said he thought not.  This is a difficult area, because youth is very largely the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  I would certainly agree with the Minister of State that using youth service grants and structures to make good the deficiencies in another part of our public service is a very wasteful way of using public money.  But we cannot ignore the fact that there are deficiencies in other parts of our public service and in the educational service as well.  I was referring to the fact that we now have, courtesy of the EEC, special pre-employment courses in some schools.  When you consider that some 80 per cent of our second level schools are going on to employment in any case&mdash;hopefully to employment rather than on the dole&mdash; it seems extraordinary that one should <Col N="1781" /> have to put down something separate and special and call it a pre-employment course because that is what school itself should be.  It should be many other things as well, but it should certainly be a pre-employment course for our young people who are going on to take their places in the labour market.</P>
      <P>I would like to make one clarification of something I said last night, something which evoked vigorous disagreement on the far side of the House.  I referred to the amount of money made available for the youth services this year and where the major increases are.  I specifically suggested that the major increases were only in the area of sport and this the Minister of State disagreed with.  I now have a reply from the Minister for Education to a parliamentary question outlining the total amount of money available for the Government youth programme for 1978 and the main components of that programme.  The answer given today indicates that in addition to the substantially increased sports grant, there is a £300,000 temporary grant scheme for youth employment and £106,000 for grants to vocational education on the specifically youth side.  This is no doubt what the Minister of State had in mind when he shook his head in disagreement at my suggestion that the larger part of the increase was going into sport.</P>
      <P>Now what I had in mind, and what I want to be more specific about, was the relative standstill in relation to grants to some youth organisations, a relative standstill which has caused these organisations no little hardship. I think the House will be glad to hear from the Minister of State whether or not, for example, one particular youth worker who is paid out of the Comhairle le Leas Óige grant-in-aid and employed in a parish in his own constituency will have his job saved for the next 12 months, because the latest I heard was that his job cannot be guaranteed since An Chomhairle have not got enough money to maintain all their existing programmes at the level at which they would like to maintain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question this motion asks is what is the Government offering by <Col N="1782" /> way of a youth policy.  The official publication of Fianna Fáil, <i>Iris Fhianna Fáil</i>, published before the election, contained several pages on the second national Fianna Fáil youth conference and a full page article by Pearse Wyse, TD, headlined: &ldquo;This Government Has No Youth Policy. We have and here it is&rdquo;.  In this article I would draw attention in particular to the section headlined: &ldquo;Training&rdquo;.  There are just two brief paragraphs.</P>
    <P>I propose the setting up of a structure for the training of full-time and voluntary youth leaders.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a regional development plan and the employment of regional development officers to examine and recommend the priorities of youth work, to take account of regional advantages, or the lack of them, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>It is fair now to ask the Minister of State where is this structure that was promised?  Where is the regional development Fund?  Where are the regional development offices?  To the best of my knowledge we have not got them. All we have is an advisory committee.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to have a policy. Words on paper are a policy, but a policy is only a policy the people will respect if it is implemented.  We have been waiting now for almost a year for the implementation of this policy and all we have got is an advisory committee.  There is a very grave danger that if the work of this advisory committee is unduly prolonged the youth policy will have missed the boat by the time it reports.</P>

It is good to have a <Col N="1783" /> subhead sometimes so that one can add to it at certain points, but in terms of setting up the structure that might be needed it is a drop in the ocean.</P>

      <P>The fundamental point I am trying to raise is that there is a grave danger that money will be wasted unless the structures are appropriate.  In their pre-election statement they see a need for structures, and we do not yet have the structures that will consolidate and co-ordinate, they will see to it that the money is not wasted and that it is put to the best use.  What I fear is that, if the Government miss the boat on youth policy there will be another boat and the people who will be on it will be mostly young.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy Horgan corrected for the record his statement last night in relation to the allocation of moneys from the Department of Education under the aegis of the Minister of State, Deputy Tunney. I have sought information on the allocation of this money, and I find that the overall increase in moneys allocated to sporting and recreational activities amounts to 48 per cent, which is a very sizeable sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take some of the figures mooted here last night.  Deputy Kenny's contribution in particular was concerned about the allocation of money.  In 1974 his predecessor in office did not allocate anything.  He might have asked his predecessor about the extraordinary allocation for the nine-month transition period that year when with a 20 per cent increase it would have been reasonable to expect approximately £190,000 for the nine months April to December 1974.  Instead £23,000 was allocated.  The books were fixed for that nine-month year, and this meant that at least £170,000 which could have helped to develop youth and sport was withdrawn never <Col N="1784" /> to be recovered.  I challenge the next speaker to refute what I have stated here in connection with the amounts of money allocated for the financial year 1974.  It is worth adding that the grant to youth and sport in 1975 stood at £390,000.  It increased by 2 per cent in 1976 to £400,000 and in 1977 there was no increase at all and it remained at £400,000.  In 1978 this Government have given a 10 per cent increase to that grant.  I was appalled by some of the statements.  I would like to deal with Deputy Horgan's while he is here.</P>

      <P>I would like Deputy Horgan to know that there will not be a youth organisation of note in this country who will not read the entire debate taking place this evening.  All the major youth organisations will be reading this debate.  One thing I have always been conscious of is the tremendous interest that youth organisations take in anything mentioned in this House regarding youth in the little enough time that it gets here.  I would like to say for clarification to Deputy Kenny now that, when I told him earlier today about the £3 million, I stated clearly that I was not speaking for the Government or for Fianna Fáil.  I was speaking in a personal capacity.  I was not a spokesman for youth in the community.  I suggested that £3 million a year should be allocated to this.  I maintain that view and I urge my Government to allocate that amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, all speakers will agree that money alone does not solve all the <Col N="1785" /> problems we are facing.  Indeed, the youth organisations are not demanding money alone.  There have to be certain back-ups.  In various debates we were requesting a policy document from the last Government.  I quote from the Official Report of 28 May 1975, Volume 281, column 1142, where I said, speaking on the youth development policy motion which was moved by us:</P>
    <P>It was to come out before Christmas 1973, then the summer 1974, then Christmas 1974, and we are still waiting for it.</P>
    <P>We then jump to 10 February 1977, Volume 296, column 1317:</P>
    <P>3. Mr. Wyse asked the Minister for Education the reasons for delay in announcing the Government's comprehensive youth policy: and if it will be announced during this Dáil session.</P>
    <P>Mr. P. Barry: The main reason for the delay in the publication and implementation of a youth and sports policy was the prevailing financial situation.  To publish a policy without a reasonable prospect of its implementation would create only frustration.  The position of the document is now being reviewed.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Barry was then Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>We know what happened.  Within a few months the election was called and suddenly what purported to be a policy was produced.  I do not intend to be harsh, but from listening to Deputy Kenny last night one would get the impression that every youth organisation welcomed this with open arms.  That is not so.  There were certain things in it which would form the framework of a policy, but there were also certain things which we would not agree with.  For example, I quote from the document <i>A Policy for Youth and Sport</i>, page 43, under the heading &ldquo;Major Proposals&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>(i) That additional funds be provided by the Department of Education to Vocational Education Committees for assistance to youth and sport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> (ii) That provision be made as an experimental measure for the employment of Community Animateurs in four areas outside Dublin who will motivate people to set up organisations for youth, sport and recreation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was that teachers would be allocated by the VECs to look after sports and recreational facilities rather than that youth organisations themselves would put up full-time youth leaders.</P>
    <P>This is vastly different from what the youth organisations would have wanted.  They would not have wanted a situation in which teachers would be allocated by the vocational educational committees.  It was advocated that a new sports council be established. That has been done.  It was advocated also that the vocational education committees implement the policy decisions regarding youth and sport, in other words, that that responsibility be handed over completely, that it would be taken away from the Department of Education. That would not be the right way to proceed.  It is for a Government to assume responsibility for any youth policy they may implement and not to allocate the money to the various local authorities for them to spend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred also to the lack of amenities but I would remind him that the Coalition removed the £600,000 amenity grant and then announced an increase that year in the physical education section of the Department of Education.  They tried to maintain there was a big increase in the vote for that year when in fact there was a net loss of about £300,000.</P>
    <P>There was much fuss about the resignations from Comhairle le Leas Óige.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments allowed that body to give grants to the county council and to Dún Laoghaire Borough and it was conditional that the money spent came from the allocation.  However, the Coalition were not prepared to continue that policy and on one occasion I found it necessary to produce a statutory document in the House in order to demonstrate to the then Minister <Col N="1787" /> that the council were not allowed legally to continue the situation that had existed.  Finally the Minister agreed with me that there was some question of a legal problem.  It transpired that the situation during the term of office of the Coalition was that if Comhairle le Leas Óige allocated £600,000 to County Dublin in one year they would receive an allocation of only £140,000 in the following year because their grant would be based on the amount that was spent within the city of Dublin; and if in the following year again they gave £40,000 to the county they would receive an allocation of only £100,000 the year after. That is the sort of conduct in which the last administration engaged.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred last night to the quarter parliamentary secretary, the man who was in charge of physical education and recreation in the Department and whose section was comprised only of a couple of part-timers. Not only has the section controlled now by the Minister of State doubled in terms of staff, but they have been responsible for a great input into youth and recreation facilities generally.</P>
    <P>We all share a common commitment to youth.  I do not think young people would enjoy being made political footballs of.  My commitment to youth goes back to 1972 because since then I have been involved actively in youth work. Deputy Horgan did not agree last night with what was said about the voting patterns of young people.</P>

      <P>What happened in the last election happened not simply by way of a vote for Fianna Fáil but because there was a complete rejection of the then Government.  The Coalition's neglect in the area of youth was tragic.  This year a sum of £919,000 is being made available for expenditure on youth activities.  This is irrespective of sports.  The grant-in-aid in respect of youth organisations is £278,000. Comhairle le Leas Óige will receive £200,000 in this regard and there is a temporary grant scheme of £300,000 in respect of youth employment.  It is <Col N="1788" /> important to recall that last year the National Youth Council did a tremendous job in finding work for people up to 21 years old.  I should hope that each youth organisation will avail of this scheme.  It is important that young people are occupied.  In the case of Stewart's Hospital the project continued into December.  This year there is a grant to vocational education committees of £106,000 for such projects.</P>
      <P>We are engaged already in in-service training.  Deputy Barry has said that policies are not everything, that action is what counts, but we have allocated £35,000 for what is known as in-service training&mdash;youth exchanges and youth encounter projects.  In addition the youth will benefit from the £462,000 that is available by way of grants to supporting organisations, sports councils, sports exchanges and major schemes.  This is a sizeable increase and is a measure of the intent within one year of what the Government are doing in this area.  An excellent council has been set up by the Minister under District Justice Sullivan.  All the people concerned are known for their association with sporting and recreational facilities.  I was delighted to note that the principal person concerned with the provision of amenities in Dublin city is an excellent official, but the Rules of the House prevent me from naming him.</P>

      <P>I saw him here a few moments ago for the vote.  It is <Col N="1789" /> interesting that there is an overemphasis on the votes of young people and that there is the belief that by bribing them they will vote for one at election time.  That is not so.  In this connection there is an interesting anecdote regarding something that occurred some years ago in Dublin Corporation when it was proposed that sixpence in the rate be struck for youth work and recreational facilities. The proposal was agreed unanimously and a couple of years later when I proposed that the grant be doubled there was again unanimous agreement. However, the chairman of that committee&mdash;not a member of my own party&mdash;at the next meeting took to task one member of the council who had gone to the newspapers and taken credit for what I proposed.  I told him not to worry because the councillor who proposed the original amount being struck in the rate lost his seat in the local election.  No one should think that there are votes in youth work.  It involved dedication, concern and interest.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny and myself were present at the launching of the National Community Games and we heard the Minister's statement.  We saw there real value for money.  The Minister has given a 40 per cent increase in their allocation this year. They were very pleased, and I hope it will continue to grow each year.  The Minister deserves some credit for this. The community games involve both north and south, bringing together young people in a sporting atmosphere. This is something which we all laud.</P>
      <P>Criticism should be constructive.  I believe that all the criticism which I levelled at the previous Government was constructive and based on my own knowledge of the scene.  I believe that, given the right structures and framework, which is all that the various youth organisations are looking for, we will succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has started very well. He is not merely interested in producing a document for the immediate gratification of certain people.  I do not know how much went into the Coalition document.  It was supposed to have been leaked to the press a year <Col N="1790" /> early.  Perhaps they are waiting for a general election or perhaps, as the Minister of the day said, there was no money to implement it.  Reading through it, I do not know that it would have cost very much to implement.</P>

      <P>The Minister reflects all of us in his commitment to nurturing the vital forces in Irish society, those who are committed to the development of our young people.  They will not find him or his administration lacking in response to their needs.  I say that confidently.  I am satisfied that we as a Government have the imagination and the resources and, with the co-operation of voluntary organisations, parents and other volunteers, we will succeed.  The manifesto is very succinct, precise and deliberate.  We said we would do certain things.  We have already commenced in a very laudable way and we will continue our good work.  We believe in action, not words.</P>
      <P>When we get the interim document in four months' time from the O'Sullivan Committee, who are working very hard and devoting whole days in certain instances to their deliberations, we will have something which will be welcomed by the youth organisations.  It is important to stress that youth is impatient, youth always will be impatient.  At the end of four years I will be very happy to compare our record with that of the Coalition. The time of reckoning comes at elections, and I have no doubt that youth organisations will see the commitment of Fianna Fáil to youth and sporting activities and to the provision of recreation centres and the Minister and the Government will have their applause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> Last night we heard a reference to the lounge bar society.  It was Deputy O'Leary who used the term and it was one of the first occasions on which I could agree with what he said. This is a situation from which we are trying to get away.  We want something more for our young people.  One suggestion is that the post-primary schools should be provided with recreational facilities.  It is important to realise that it was the policy of the previous Government not to have gynmasia and sports complexes attached to these schools.  It is time for this Government to look at this again.  I am confident that the Minister will push this matter and that provision will be made for gymnasia and other facilities for school and afterschool leisure activity.</P>
    <P>When allocating money one should know exactly how it is to be spent. Taxpayers' money should not be spent wildly.  The Minister, on assuming office did the right thing in inviting an input from various organisations.  At that time these organisations were fairly frustrated because they had been dangled to and fro for four-and-a-half years.  They probably felt that their case would be put on the long finger again.  I think they now realise that this is not an attempt to put anything on the long finger.  The Minister wants to know their thinking.  He appreciates their dedication and involvement and the knowledge they have about what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I remember going to a youth club some time ago and they were very disenchanted with one of the major youth organisations because they felt that it had become very bureaucratic and out of touch with the people.  I wrote to the general secretary of that organisation telling him that this was the feeling.  If they are not careful youth organisations can get out of touch with the people on the ground. Everyone associated with youth organisations, particularly at bureaucratic level, should be involved in some club or organisation where young people are active and should know what their thinking is.  Thinking changes all the time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> I look forward to the day when we will have full-time youth workers in every major area.  This is a tremendously important facet of youth policy. If all of us were given the same task we would not carry it out identically; we would have our own priorities.  My priority would be to send into an area three full-time youth workers, one to look after youth clubs, one to look after unattached youth who will not join clubs, and one who would be in charge of administration.  Much of the time of youth workers can be taken up by administration.  Perhaps the Minister would bear this suggestion in mind.  These youth workers would go into an area of about 10,000 people, spend about two or three years there building up leadership and then moving to another area.  When youth leaders are too long in the same area they become dulled by the monotony and difficulty of their task and it is important that they should move from one area to another and train youth leaders in other communities. This is something which is very close to my heart.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the House how impressed I am with the Minister of State's performance in this area.  The youth organisations are also very impressed by him.  He has not been holding 19 clinics a month.  I do not want to get nasty, and if I could I would like to delete that from the record.  The Minister of State goes out and meets the people in the youth organisations. His whole attention is riveted to the very big task before him.</P>
    <P>I believe the last Government did not appreciate the importance of this. If we go after the youth as politicians looking for their votes and bribing them with this, that and the other, they will lose respect for political institutions and we will bring ourselves into disrepute.  We should be putting our heads together and making constructive suggestions for a youth policy, constantly adding to it and improving it. We should learn from other people's experience, but we should rely particularly on experience gained in our own environment.  That is very important. It is good to see how clubs in other countries operate, but we have more <Col N="1793" /> voluntary workers per head of population than any other country in the world.  Where the professional worker takes over&mdash;and youth organisations recognise this&mdash;there can be a very dangerous situation.  When the voluntary worker says &ldquo;He is getting paid for it, why should I not be paid?&rdquo; that is the end of the youth organisations. By its nature it must be voluntary. I hope that train of thought will be acknowledged by members of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;endorses the Government's policy on Youth and Sport and acknowledges the progress that has been made to date&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are all interested in youth development, otherwise we would not be contributing on this motion.  I have not yet seen any policy emanating from this Government on youth.  To talk about endorsing something they have not got is being less than honest, in my view.  Last evening the Minister spent the whole of 25 minutes attempting to denigrate two people.  Deputy Kenny is a young man who is dedicated to sport.  Since he became spokesman in this area a short time ago he has made a very big impact on the various bodies involved.  While I respect the Minister outside this House, when he comes here he is a different person.  His attack on Deputy Kenny last night was unwarranted and he did not produce any facts to substantiate what he was saying. What he did last night was little credit to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out how well-got he was with various youth bodies. He said &ldquo;the youth clubs know precisely where they stand, especially so far as I am concerned&rdquo;.  In <i>Youth Forum</i> March-April 1978, No. 45, the headline is &ldquo;Long Finger&rdquo;.  Deputy Briscoe mentioned something about putting things on the long finger.  The article said that frustration and puzzlement were the first reactions from youth organisations to Deputy James Tunney's decision <Col N="1794" /> to set up an advisory committee on youth policy.  Over the last four years these bodies have been submitting report after report to the Department. The Department know what is wanted to provide a good youth development programme.  What is required is the will to implement such a programme and, sadly, that will is lacking.</P>

      <P>The youth groups did not wait.  They were conscientious and sufficiently dedicated to submit these reports.  The Minister of State talked about four years in office but Fianna Fáil were 16 years in office and not even a Yellow Paper emerged. After a short four years the last Government submitted a comprehensive policy on youth and the youth movement accepted that as a working document.</P>
      <P>The day a Government bring out a document that is satisfactory to all will be a wonderous day.  When Fianna Fáil were in office for 16 years there was no youth policy and there was no sign of a youth policy until the Coalition came into office.  Admittedly it took them four years to get the document out and possibly it could have been done in a shorter time.  Nobody will deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does this Minister of State do? He sets up a committee.  When you want to do nothing but you want to buy time, you set up a committee. That takes the Minister off the hook. If you ask a question he can say the committee are sitting on it.  And how they sit and keep the lid on it.  I see a need for some committees but this advisory committee have still not yet met, although it is now late May and they are supposed to have an interim <Col N="1795" /> report by August.  June, July and August are holiday months so we know what type of report we can expect from the committee.  I am not casting aspersions on the committee who will be used as fall guys if things go wrong. This forum says that there is no clear picture on what youth work is about. That is the comment coming from a responsible youth body on Deputy Tunney's thinking.</P>

      <P>Professional youth officers should be assigned to large urban areas.  We must establish ratios so as to know where to appoint them, if we wish to evolve a proper youth policy.  I know that will cost money but if a national emergency were to arise tomorrow money would be no problem.  We are heading for a national emergency in relation to the youth population.  An <i>ad hoc</i> committee will not be adequate to deal with this problem, which is getting worse.  This problem must be tackled at top level.  This will cost money but if we take the cost of vandalism in the community and the cost of imprisoning young people and balance it against the cost of providing proper <Col N="1797" /> youth services, it will be seen that it will cost very little.  Deputy Briscoe mentioned a sum of £3 million in some broadcast recently.  There are dedicated people involved in youth work but they can only do so much without the proper structures and back-up services. Last evening the Minister said that he would not see youth development as a prop for bad formal education. We have bad formal education particularly in deprived areas.  Nobody can deny that.  Consequently youth clubs and groups have a major role to play in education.  Education is basically being able to develop all aspects of people's mental and physical make-up.  There is no doubt that youth clubs have a very important educational role to play.  The youth people will readily admit that this is something that should be reckoned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy but would the Deputy accept that there would be an obligation on them to indicate how the formal education curriculum should be changed rather than try to co-operate in something with a Department, if the curriculum is unsuitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Department of Education are not aware of the defects in primary school curricula, we are all in trouble, particularly our young people.  The Minister knows what I am talking about.  I am just elaborating on a point he made last night.  So long as the system we have remains and so long as we have socially-deprived areas we will have serious problems which will fall for solution to the voluntary organisations. In socially-deprived areas usually there is a lack of self-confidence, a lack of real home environment.  In central city areas there are bad schools, there is a dislike of schools and of formal education.  We cannot run away from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youth organisations have a great role to play here, and I speak with a special knowledge of socially-deprived areas.  That is why I stress the desirability of establishing reasonable teacher-pupil ratios in such areas as <Col N="1798" /> distinct from better-off districts which have back-up services.  There is a great challenge here but at the moment there is a great gulf which must be crossed as early as possible if we are to avoid serious trouble for the nation.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to get down to proper professional training for our voluntary workers because the professional service will be only there as a back-up.  We must encourage trainee voluntary workers when they are being trained.  When attending such courses they must be paid in full by the State which is there to support such a service and not to supplant it.  In giving that support the State must be seen to be generous.  It must not cheesepare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister agrees.  Take Macra na Tuaithe. They get £70,000 from the State to help them in their work.  It is only a pittance by comparison with their needs to finance their services.  They have firstclass structures throughout the country mainly financed by various bodies.  We can learn a lesson from the type of back-up facilities they have got.  The Government should stop shilly-shallying in this matter.  I have no doubt the Minister knows the problems. These problems will not go away and therefore the Minister must involve himself, communicate, stop talking about setting up committees, get down to the practicalities.</P>
      <P>We have heard that an interim report will be published in August.  It is only an interim report, a sketchy document.  The Minister should not wait for such a report.  He has sufficient knowledge and evidence in the Department of what is required and he should proceed straight away with the professional training of youth officers.  We need an abundance of such workers not like the currant here and the currant there that you get in the fruitcake nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Youth organisations suffer enormously from lack of accommodation&mdash; many of them operate literally in hovels.  At the same time our schools remain dormant at night time when they could be used as youth centres. <Col N="1799" /> There is tremendous potential here. Life is not without problems but they must be tackled.  We cannot any longer continue our amateur approach to these serious problems and I therefore ask the Minister to forget his amendment which means nothing.  It is only a Government subterfuge to get around the excellent motion proposed by Deputy Kenny.  It is political gimmickry.</P>

      <P>It was published on 10 February 1977.  On that day Deputy Wyse asked when the Department of Education would announce the Government's comprehensive youth policy and he questioned whether it would be announced during the Dáil session. Deputy O'Brien remembers that this time last year the then Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael took a stroll as far as the Park and blobs of sweat came out on the people on those benches. The reply of the then Minister for Education was that the main reason for the delay in the implementation of the youth and sports policy was the prevailing financial situation.  This is stated at column 1317 of the Official Report of 10 February 1977&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the document that was resurrected, it is out of print at the moment.  Deputy Killilea spoke about blobs of sweat.

I know Deputy Killilea of old; the only place to tackle him is at a church gate with a loudspeaker.</P>
      <P>With regard to my comment yesterday that Deputy Briscoe in 1974 on the &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; programme had committed his party to spend £3 million, I indicated that might have been due to the fact that it is an early morning programme.  However, after discussions with him today I withdraw the remark that he committed his party to that expenditure. It was indicative of his own wish that £3 million would be granted.  On a technical point I am glad that he is in favour of allocating £3 million.  I do not want youth work to become completely professional because if that happens we will do away with the concept and ideal of voluntary work which is such a strengthening factor in the moral fabric of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State spoke in this debate.  He indicated I did not read the document or that I lacked comprehension.  I do not know how he came to that conclusion but if he wants to take me up on a wager as to whether I read it, I can assure him I am on a winner.  He is a master of verbiage, political and personal. Going through his speech I get the impression <Col N="1802" /> of what I might call &ldquo;Brutonmania&rdquo; because every second paragraph has a reference to his predecessor, Deputy Bruton.  He referred to the fact that Deputy Bruton had 19 or 29 clinics in his constituency, but I do not know what that fact had to do with the Deputy's youth policy when he was Parliamentary Secretary.  Deputy Bruton, as a rural Deputy, was constantly meeting many people, particularly young people, and he got their views on what they wanted the Government to incorporate in a youth policy.  I understand that since the Deputy left the Department his number of clinics has increased to 40.  When he returns to office as Minister he will be in a position to draw up policies on many aspects.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is sitting in the Taoiseach's seat and he has 84 votes behind him.  I should have thought he would be able to give a clear statement regarding a youth policy so that the youth organisations might know the position clearly.  I thought his speech would have dealt with the motion before the House to such an extent that we would not be able to make any criticism of him.  I thought he would have left us standing idly by with no criticism to make.  That was not the case.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister said he could not do anything with the document brought in by the previous administration because there was nothing in it to implement.  However, he picked out some morsels here and there which makes me believe he must have considered there was some merit in it.  The Minister should have been able to strike a definite blow for future generations.  He should have shown that here was a man who would draw up a policy for youth organisations that could be copied not only throughout the country but internationally. It was his first time to speak on youth affairs in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I meant in this Chamber.  He had an excellent chance to put forward his policy.  If <Col N="1803" /> he was not so interested in political matters, in talking about me and what he called my lack of comprehension regarding the document and about Deputy Bruton's clinics and his attendance at the Department, we might have got on much better.  The youth organisations throughout the country are anxious to know where the Government are going.  All that has been said and done from 1900 to 1977 is past. That is water under the bridge.</P>
      <P>The policy introduced by Deputy Bruton was not a perfect model.  It had faults.  Every organisation in the country did not give it a whole-hearted welcome.  Some of them were critical of it, but at least he put forward proposals for the immediate future and he provided a long-term philosophy of where the Government stood in relation to our young people so that youth organisations could draw up their plans and work within the very flexible framework contained in it.  In the policy which has now been introduced we do not know how the fitness levels and participation levels in the sports for all areas are to be monitored and measured by the sports council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall wait and see. As Deputy Horgan said it is a drop in the ocean providing £5,000 for an in-service training scheme.  I am sure that the Minister of State has some influence at the Cabinet table and I compliment him for providing £200,000 for the sports area.  He should go more often to the Cabinet table, and if he wants me to go with him I will.  Most youth organisations are in financial difficulties such as Macra na Tuaithe to the tune of £27,000, the Scouts Association, £15,000 and other organisations are spending all they have as best they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the youth organisations are doing their best to maintain existing standards, and with the greatly increased numbers joining those organisations they will find in a short period that they will not be able to maintain their existing standards.  The Minister should realise that he was speaking for half the population and <Col N="1804" /> that they deserve more than they have got to maintain their existing standards.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for a civil servant to accurately assess the benefits to an urban child or a rural child of what they do in an informal setting.  If professional people cannot join voluntary organisations, because of lack of financial assistance from the Government, the finger of shame points squarely at the department concerned. The sports council introduced by the Minister has definite potentials.  The people in it have actively participated in sports.  Some of them are heroes and heroines.  They know what is needed to get to the top.</P>
    <P>This sports council is different from the sports council proposed by Deputy Bruton in his document.  He wanted to have the sports council co-ordinating all the different areas of sports from each department.  He wanted civil servants on it.  We have to take into account that Bord Fáilte, the Departments of Health, the Environment, Education and Defence and the local authorities are concerned with sporting activities.  It is only natural that they should be co-ordinated into a central body as well.  That is the reason why Deputy Bruton wished to have civil servants on the council.  I do not want to give the idea that the council should become completely bureaucratic.  Deputy Bruton's plan had merit from the point of view of co-ordinating all sporting activities.</P>
    <P>The COSAC organisation had gone beyond their terms of office.  They were extended by Deputy Bruton.  The people in the area I come from never heard of COSAC.  That is no reflection on the people in the organisation but is possibly a reflection that something new is needed.  The system under which they operated was not adequate. The COSAC idea was terminated.</P>
    <P>The idea of the voluntary organisations filling the gaps left in formal education is a very complicated area because there are inadequacies in our educational system.  Every Deputy in the House could speak all night on education and we still would not come to a consensus as to what should be done.  The Minister for Education could spend £100 million tomorrow <Col N="1805" /> and he would not see any concrete results for quite a long time.  Voluntary organisations provide a very necessary personality ideal in young people.  That comes from an informal area of education where they can follow their desires to a better degree.  They may be shy and timid but in an informal setting they can develop their personalities to a much higher level. Voluntary organisations have a very important role to play in the education of our children.</P>
    <P>Many voluntary organisations feel that the setting up of further committees and working parties leads to the idea of cynicism that the Department are not willing to implement a policy.  If that continues the Government would appear to be the undisputed champions of procrastination.  I believe I said prognostication last <Col N="1806" /> night.  I should have said procrastination. Any Government should not have that title.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister review the youth policy idea so that voluntary organisations can say that the Minister of State has produced something they can work within and that they can strive for?  Will the Minister also look at the organisations that are in financial stress?  It is a disgraceful situation if they have to let people go or if their value is hindered in any way.</P>

      <P>It is considered that the existing <Col N="1707" /> second-level school accommodation available in Galway city generally, together with the planned extension to the Moneenageisha Vocational School, will meet the second-level educational needs of the Renmore-Mervue area for a number of years.  It is expected, however, that a further second-level school will be required in the area in due course and the situation is being kept under review.  It is not possible at this stage to state when the school will be required or what size it may be.</P>
      <P>A request for the establishment of a community school in the area has been received.  It would not be in accordance with normal practice to say who made the request or what action might be taken in regard to it before the stage had been reached when negotiations in relation to the matter would be undertaken.</P>

      <P>Information is available on Ireland's receipts by way of grants and subsidies from the European Communities and on Ireland's payments to the Communities. This information is set out in the attached statement, which also shows the amounts of loans approved for this country from Community sources.</P>
      <P>The figures included in the statement for receipts by way of grants and subsidies represent the amounts of money actually received under the various headings during the years in question.  They differ in some respects from the figures published in Annex II of the six monthly Reports to the Oireachtas on Developments in the European Communities which represent the amounts of grants and subsidies approved.  This is because there is normally a time lag between the approval of grants and the date of their payment, with the result that receipts from the Community to date have been somewhat less than the amount of grants approved.</P>

    <P>1 Receipts under the Guarantee Section include amounts of £24 million in 1976 and £128 million in 1977 for the UK and Italian MCA import subsidies which have been administered by Ireland in respect of Irish exports to the UK and Italy since 17 May 1976.</P>
    <P>2 This figure includes £0.59 million in respect of amounts approved for projects relating to hydrocarbons and uranium in 1977.  Information is not available on amounts actually received in 1977.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will advise Roscommon County Council to have the connection to the No. 2 sewerage scheme carried out free of charge to the householders, particularly those in areas such as Galway Road, Another Road, The Walk and Circular Road, or alternatively, if grants are available for such works, or if he will make grants available.</P>

      <P>Roscommon County Council do not intend, I understand, to levy a charge in respect of the connection of existing houses to the new sewers being laid as part of Roscommon sewerage scheme, stage 2.  A point of connection will be provided for each house but the provision of the service drain between individual houses and the point of connection to the new sewer will be a matter for each householder.  Where the existing sewerage facilities are seriously deficient the cost of connecting to the public sewer would be eligible for grant, subject to compliance with grant requirements generally.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if a person (name supplied) in Dublin who purchased his house from Dublin Corporation about three years ago and paid cash after one year is now entitled to some financial concession in the context of any proposals he might have with regard to changes in the purchase scheme for similar tenants.</P>

      <P>The recently announced concession to purchasers of local authority houses under the pre-July 1973 tenant purchase schemes applies to persons who redeemed the purchase annuity on their houses on or after 1 March 1978.  As the annuity of this house was redeemed in February 1975 the concession is not applicable.</P>
