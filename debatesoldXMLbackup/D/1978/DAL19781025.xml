      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 7 (resumed), 8 (resumed), 9 (resumed), 10, 11, 4 and 5: Private Members' Business from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.&mdash;No. 17 (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, in view of the fact that we have had an indication from the Government that there will be a further debate on the EMS, that there will be a Bill dealing with adoption, a Bill dealing with contraceptives and one would assume an Adjournment Debate and as there are only approximately 20 sitting days between now and the Christmas recess, will the Taoiseach indicate if there are any other Bills coming before the House that he anticipates will be dealt with before the Christmas recess?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the dismal performance of his Government up to now with regard to legislation is a matter of genuine concern not only to Members on this side of the House but to the country in general?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing it on the grounds that a draft scheme of a Bill to repeal and replace the National Monuments Acts of 1930 and 1954 is being prepared and it will be introduced by the Government as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is opposed on the grounds that Senator Robinson's Bill was shot down repeatedly in the Seanad six or seven years ago.  We are still awaiting a Fianna Fáil Bill on that subject. Senator Robinson's Bill was trampled on on the grounds that Fianna Fáil were preparing a Bill of their own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I think it disgraceful that an opportunity is not being given to have a debate on an important matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Chair has ruled that there is no debate to ensue on this motion.  Is that the position?  I suggest that the Chair puts the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it seriously intended that we will not be allowed to discuss this matter in our own Private Members' Time?  Is that the way the Government intend to do business in this House?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The Deputy can put down a motion if he wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be clear about this.  Is it the intention of the Government to prevent the introduction of Private Members' Bills in this House, a right that Members have always had?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter before the House at the moment is a motion that this Private Members' Bill be <Col N="1086" /> read a Second Time in Private Members' Time and I am now putting that motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in order in the procedure we have now, introduced in order to prevent the voting down of Bills on First Stage, that the Government can move in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has no option but to put a motion when it is proposed.  The motion is before the House.  It is no business of the Chair to deny its being opposed or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Member proposing a Bill the right to make a statement in favour of such a Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at this stage.  The subject matter of a Bill cannot come up for discussion at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say why he is prepared to vote down a Bill tabled by an Opposition party which they are prepared to discuss in Private Members' Time, traditionally the time when Opposition parties have an opportunity of discussing such matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has given notice that he is opposing it and that he can give reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons being that a Government Bill is in the course of preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the change in Standing Orders relative to the introduction of Bills in Private Members' Time, will the Chair rule that the Government have no power whatever in relation to Private Members Time for the taking of the Bill?  This resides entirely with a group of Deputies and the indication given by the Taoiseach is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. The Bill must go to Second Reading by motion and the motion is that the Bill be read a Second Time in Private Members' Time.  That is the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1087" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that we had a precedent in the last session of the Dáil.  The Standing Order in question does not indicate that the Bill &ldquo;may&rdquo; go to Private Members' Time. The Standing Order clearly indicates that the Bill &ldquo;shall&rdquo; go to Private Members' Time and there is no residual right on the part of the Government. This was changed by an all-party committee headed by Deputy O'Malley, now Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The right does not reside with the Government and Deputy Bruton is entirely correct in moving that the Bill be transferred to Private Members' Time and it must be taken at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Chair to read out the appropriate Standing Order under which the ruling has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that we have gone through all of this before.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The ruling of the Chair is that there is a motion before the House which the Chair has no option but to put.  Otherwise there would be no need for a motion.  The question of automatically fixing a date has been argued before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am asking is that the Chair would read out the appropriate Standing Order under which the ruling was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order 88 (3) states:</P>
      <P>A member of the Government, Minister of State or a private member nominated for the purpose under Standing Order 85 (2) may present a Bill without previously obtaining leave of the House and any Bill so presented shall be printed and an Order for its second reading shall be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the Standing Order.  The Standing Order is relative to a group of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  When a motion is before the House the order shall be made.  We have gone through all this before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is the order which prevents the House even from debating Deputy Lalor's motion and differentiates that motion from every other motion before this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going into the merits or demerits of what is happening here.  We are merely interpreting Standing Orders as they are supposed to be and as they have been by precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Chair tell the House for its guidance which rule differentiates the motion before the House which is moved by the Minister of State from every other motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I demand the right to speak on my motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a further one.  I am entitled to do so.  I ask you, Sir, to read the Standing Order whereby a group of Deputies of this House are entitled to put forward a Bill for Private Members' Time.  Once the Deputies, that designated group, move that the Bill shall be taken in Private Members' Time so shall it be taken, and there is no authority on the part of any other group in the House to prevent it being moved in Private Members' Time. I challenge you to quote Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the proper interpretation.  &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; is used in Standing Orders throughout the entire Standing Orders and it is not mandatory. There is a motion necessary and <Col N="1089" /> the motion may or may not be defeated. In this case it is opposed and the Chair must put it whether it is carried or not. The Deputy is alleging that it should automatically go to Private Members' Time without a motion.  The Deputy states it must and I am putting the motion now.  I have no other option.</P>

My understanding is that a motion when put must be debated and the proposer of it is entitled to explain why he has put the motion and the opposer is entitled to give his reasons against.

      <P>On a point of order, I point out that when this problem arose in the last session you ruled erroneously and the argument became so heated that you had to adjourn the House and we gracefully, with deep respect to you, Sir, got you off the hook.  There is no need to impale yourself on it again this morning. In the report of the Dáil Informal Committee on Dáil Procedure chaired by Deputy O'Malley the subsequent amendment of Standing Orders clearly indicated that a group of Deputies in this House in Opposition had an absolute right to transfer any of their business, including a Bill, into Private Members' Time and that no prevention was authorised whatsoever on the part of the Government of the day.  It was so amended and so enacted in the last Dáil. I think, a Cheann Comhairle, that your two advisers in front of you know that perfectly well.</P>

      <P>Order.  The Chair has ruled that there must be an order and an order must go before the House.  Regarding the interpretation of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, that is used in relation to every stage of any Bill in Standing Orders.  It says that Second Stage, Third Stage and so on shall be taken and it can be opposed.  There must be an order for <Col N="1093" /> Final Stage of any Bill and the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used throughout.  If we are going to change it in relation to this it must be changed in all Standing Orders.  &ldquo;If leave to introduce the Bill is given, an Order shall be made for its second reading and the Bill shall be printed.&rdquo; You may define every single one of those despite the fact that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used throughout.  The Chair cannot find an easy way out of that.  The decision must be in accordance with the proper interpretation.</P>

      <P>My basic reason for moving that this Bill be taken in Fine Gael time, time which we could use to discuss other matters in this session, and a deliberate choice having been taken by our party in that matter, is that we believe that the subject matter of this Bill is so urgent that it must be discussed before the recess.  The information was already elicited, in response to a question from the leader of the Labour Party, that we already have more than enough Government Bills to occupy all Government time between now and the recess. There is only one way in which the important subject matter of this Bill, the protection of our national monuments, can be debated and decided in this House between now and the recess, that is by the acceptance of this motion, which would enable this Bill to be taken in Private Members' Time.  The Bill is urgent for a number of reasons.  First of all, we have the proposition of the Government to destroy a national monument which has been declared to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sure that you will agree, in discussing that, though not the generality of the Bill, I am entirely in order and entirely within the terms of this motion.

      <P>I do not propose in the statement I am making in this motion to discuss the general merits of the Bill.  I recognise that this would not be in order or in conformity with your ruling. Although I may dispute that ruling and dispute the order under which it is made I must accept it.  I submit to you that it is patently obvious that if this motion is not accepted there will be no opportunity to discuss the subject matter of this Bill or any other Bill of a similar subject matter before Christmas because the Government time is already used up with Bills which may have been delayed for a very long time but which are now in prospect.  The only way in which this important matter can be discussed in the House is if this motion is accepted and Fine Gael are allowed to use their own time, which we could be using for <Col N="1098" /> destructive criticism of the Government, but which instead we have chosen to use for a constructive purpose, to debate this motion.  If we are not allowed to do so we will be forced into the tactic, which was used throughout the last Dáil by the then Opposition, when they never put forward a single constructive proposal but satisfied themselves with destructive criticism which, if it were to be turned into a constructive proposal, would have involved us in large-scale expenditure of public funds.  We in Opposition now seek to use our Private Members' Time constructively to put forward Bills which, if enacted, will improve our laws.  We are to be prevented from even having these Bills discussed by the use of this artificial strategem and are forced into the type of pointless destructive criticism which was typical of Fianna Fáil when they were in opposition.  I believe that the standards of this House will be lowered and that parliamentary democracy will be damaged by the exercise of this jackboot power by Fianna Fáil in voting down the opportunity to discuss in Fine Gael time a Fine Gael Bill.  That is what it amounts to.</P>
      <P>I have said that I intend to confine my remarks in support of my motion to the need to have this matter dealt with before Christmas.  I do not propose to discuss the general subject matter of the Bill.  I merely propose to discuss those aspects of the Bill which are directly related to the time in which it is taken.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I now propose to deal with the brief contribution made by the Minister of State in opposing my motion. The reason he gave was that a Government Bill on this subject would be introduced as soon as possible.  Those hallowed words which we have heard under successive Governments mean nothing.  There is no commitment on the part of the Government to introduce this Bill at any time.  There might be some prospect of the House being advised to accept this motion if the Government had said, &ldquo;We propose to introduce a Bill before Christmas&rdquo;, or &ldquo;We propose to circulate a Bill before Christmas and it will be discussed in this House before Easter&rdquo;.  Instead of doing that they deliberately chose not to give a commitment. I wonder why, in using this unusual stratagem to prevent discussion of a Bill on the ground that they had their own Bill, they could not do better than say they would introduce their own Bill as soon as possible.  &ldquo;As soon as possible&rdquo; could be any time within the next ten years.  There is great public interest in the subject matter of this Bill.  There is a demand for legislation on this subject not only from those who are directly concerned with conservation but from concerned people everywhere, from people who have demonstrated in the streets.  These people want legislation on this subject, and all the Government can offer is that they will introduce a Bill of unknown content as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister of State know when the Government Bill will be introduced? Does he know if the heads of the Bill have been approved by the Government?  Does he know if the Bill has gone to the Parliamentary Draftsman? Does he know if the draft of the Bill has been circulated to Departments? Does he know if the draft Bill is on the Government agenda?  Does he know if any of those steps have been taken to bring the Bill before the House?  I believe that no more than one of those steps has <Col N="1102" /> been taken to bring the Bill before the House.  I believe that we will not see a Government Bill on this subject this year or next year.</P>
    <P>I believe that in saying this Bill will be introduced as soon as possible, as the Minister states, he is in bad faith because he knows as well as I do that this Bill and its subject matter are very low in priority with the present Government. They are not interested in this Bill; they do not want this matter discussed here because it would embarrass them.  That is why they try to prevent discussion on the matter on this motion and, in opposing this motion, to prevent discussion of the matter in general in Private Members' Time.  They do not want the matter discussed.  If they were sincere in believing this Bill would be introduced as soon as possible they would have no objection to allowing our Bill to be discussed, because we know that if they dislike certain aspects of that Bill they have a majority.  If they allowed the Bill to go to Committee they could make whatever change they liked.  They could delete sections or amend sections <i>ad lib</i> because, although we might oppose in the division lobbies some amendment they wanted made to our Bill, we would have no power to stop them because of their majority in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They would, and that would be difficult.  If they believed such a Bill was to be introduced as soon as possible they could have no objection to discussing a Bill from the Opposition in Private Members' Time and ultimately in Committee because they could amend it as they wished to conform to their own desires.  Indeed, they would be using Private Members' Time that we could utilise for other purposes to achieve their own legislative objectives.  They could amend the Bill as they willed and they would in fact find themselves using our time for their purposes.  No, they did not decide to exercise that option.  Why? Because they do not want national monuments discussed.  They do not want national monuments legislation, and they are in bad faith in saying they <Col N="1103" /> would introduce such legislation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>If they were sincere in their wish to introduce national monuments legislation as soon as possible, as we are told, even if they were not prepared to accept the Bill, going into Committee and amending it as I suggested, a discussion on Second Stage on the subject matter of the Bill introduced by Deputy Donnellan and myself would allow general issues of national monuments policy to be discussed and give Members on either side an opportunity to express their views.  Even if the Government were going to reject the Bill the Government would have heard what Members of the House felt and in framing their own Bill to be introduced subsequently they would be able, so far as they deemed it politic, to take account of the views not only of the Opposition but of their own back-benchers who no doubt would have a very useful contribution to make on national monuments.  I do not want to name any Deputies but I know there are Members behind the Government who are interested in this subject and could make a useful contribution which the Government should be anxious to hear in Private Members' Time.  If they were sincere about introducing a Bill as soon as possible I believe they would be anxious to hear those views and take them into account even if they were not accepting our Bill as a framework for action. I believe they should have accepted our Bill on that basis, but even if they did not, even if they allowed the matter to Second Stage and then defeated it, I believe they would then have had the benefit of the views of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask: why would a Government not want to hear the views of Members of the House on national monuments? Why should they want to silence the Opposition and, perhaps more significantly, silence their own back-benchers on a matter of this sort?  Why would they be so sensitive as not to want the matter even discussed here in time provided by the Opposition?  I think we are entitled to an answer to these questions.  I do not believe we will get a satisfactory answer. We are entitled to ask the questions, and I hope the Government's spokesman in <Col N="1104" /> discussing this Motion will explain why they do not want to hear national monuments discussed.  Why this thin skinned approach, this wish to remain deaf and blind as regards the preservation of national monuments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of great importance that it be open to Private Members to introduce legislation, and Standing Orders were altered some time ago to allow this to be done and allow Bills to be published, as my Bill was published with the support of a group of Deputies, without necessarily having first to obtain the approval of the Government to its publication.  To my mind, this was a very laudable move initiated by a Committee on Dáil Reform chaired by the present Minister for Commerce and Energy.  If we look at other parliaments in the English speaking world&mdash;it is easier to get information about those&mdash;we find special procedures are available for discussing Private Members' Bills.  In Britain there is a procedure where Members enter a lottery and names are drawn out of a hat.  The Member whose name is drawn may introduce a Bill and nobody can prevent that Bill being discussed, Government or Opposition.  In America, all the legislation is sponsored by Private Members, and there is ample opportunity also, I believe, in continental legislatures for Private Members to introduce constructive Bills intended to change the law of the land.  Obviously, the majority can decide to reject or amend or change those Bills in any way, but in no other parliament to my knowledge is there a systematic policy such as now seems to be in the course of being initiated by the present Government to prevent discussion of Private Members' Bills where these Bills are in the slightest way embarrassing to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our function as Members of the House is to be legislators.  We were not elected, either Opposition or Government Deputies, to become destructive critics of every constructive move made by the Government.  I do not see that as my mission in politics.  I would not be in <Col N="1105" /> politics if that was all I could do.  I would not make the sacrifice that I and every other Member must make just to come here every day trying to trip up the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or some other Minister. That would not give me or any other Member sufficient reason to be in politics.  I say that sincerely.  The main reason I am in politics&mdash;and I am sure I speak not just for myself and I say it in no pious sense&mdash;is that I may put forward constructive proposals to improve the law of this land.  I believe that is the motive of every Member of the House entering and making the sacrifices which must be made by anybody wishing to enter the House.</P>

There is no political content in it.  It is not designed to damage the Government in any way.  If we wanted to damage the Government there are many other ways in which we could do it. There are many more constructive uses in that respect to which we could put Private Members' Time.  We have chosen not to do that.  We have chosen to use our time to introduce a constructive Bill like this to improve the law of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Opposition Deputies are to be prevented from putting forward constructive legislation proposals of this sort, not only will it be damaging parliamentary democracy, but we will be <Col N="1106" /> initiating a process which will make us worse in terms of a diminution of the rights of elected representatives than any other member state in the European Community.  Are there any other members of the European Community in whose Parliaments it would be impossible for private members to have Bills discussed?  We have been told we went into Europe to contribute to the democratic traditions of Europe, to contribute to making Europe a better place, to contribute our insight.  Is our insight to be a refusal in this Parliament to allow Bills to be introduced by the Opposition and discussed because the Government have an overwhelming majority?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to accept your ruling, Sir, on the force of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; until Standing Orders are revised.  When Standing Orders were amended, clearly it was not the intention to eliminate the First Stage provision which enabled the Government of the day with a majority to prevent a First Stage debate.  When that reform was brought in, clearly it was not the intention that power to prevent debate would simply be transferred to the Second Stage.  Accepting the Chair's interpretation of the wording, and accepting the Chair's ruling, it is clear that there was a misunderstanding and a misapprehension and that, in the redrafting of Standing Orders, an error was made and the intention of the parties in the House was not carried through.  This is a matter for rectification.  I submit, however, and I do not propose to go outside the Chair's ruling, that we have been put in a somewhat ludicrous position.  Though entitled to speak to the motion that this Bill be given a Second Reading in Private Members' Time, and that motion is opposed, we are not permitted to say why the motion should be accepted.  In all logic one cannot say why the motion <Col N="1111" /> should be accepted unless one refers to the motion.  It is a situation in which we are expected to be permitted to speak on the question of why the motion should be accepted without even saying what the Bill is about or why the Bill has an element of urgency in it.</P>
      <P>I submit that ruling is not called for by Standing Orders.  Therefore I would hope that on further reflection the ruling will be reconsidered, though I am not challenging it at this time.  The illogical result of such a ruling requires further reflection.  Admittedly, the public know what we are discussing, and through the media they will know the subject matter even though we are not allowed to mention it.  It is a subject matter in respect of which tens of thousands of people have marched already.  There will be no doubt in people's minds as to the importance and urgency of it.  I submit that though you must rule on this issue, it was improper for the Government to use an ambiguity in the revision of Standing Orders to prevent discussion just because they have a majority of 20, and that exercise and abuse of power will not necessarily benefit the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that on reflection, and in the light of the reactions there may be in public opinion to the debate and to the curtailment of discussion, though we have been unable to mention the subject matter, the Government will reconsider the dictatorial and illiberal and arbitrary tactics adopted by them here, especially because this issue is of such widespread public concern.  The Government may have calculated that by suppressing Private Members' Bills in this Dáil&mdash;this is the second occasion they have done so&mdash;they might obscure the contrast between their record of negative Opposition, almost exclusively through motions attacking the Government of the day, and our positive approach which has been of introducing legislation in our own time to deal with matters, urgent matters in particular, for example, in relation to the inadequacy of penalties for infringements of our fishery limits following a court decision, and on this occasion the protection of national monuments because the danger of their destruction arises for the first time in the <Col N="1112" /> history of this State as a result of an unprecedented Government decision which no one anticipated ?  Government would or could take.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say at this point because of the restrictions on the time of the debate.  However, I would ask you to reflect further on the limitation imposed on the discussion.  It seems totally illogical. I suggest we will have to come to terms with the whole question of Private Members' Time if this Parliament is to be seen to be a legislative assembly in which there is the right of free speech and the right of Members of the House to put forward proposals and to be protected in that right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will also restrict myself to the reason why I believe this Bill should be given a Second Reading in accordance with your ruling, but I do so, Sir, without prejudice to any action my party may see fit to take with regard to our judgment of your ruling.  Deputy FitzGerald, to my mind, has conceded somewhat that your ruling was correct.  I do not share his interpretation of Standing Orders, and though one would naturally wish to be co-operative and restrained in any dealings with the Chair in the House, that cannot be done at the expense of democracy.  Every Deputy in the House has a right in regard to parliamentary debate and this right cannot be sacrificed in order to be seen as being restrained, co-operative and gentlemanly.  Democracy is far more important than any of these elements, desirable though they may be, in one's approach to business in the House.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that there is any ambiguity in regard to the Standing Order in this respect.  Indeed a similar situation arose previously in the House and after the Chair had made the ruling and the Dáil had been adjourned, on reflection the Chair saw that a wrong decision had been made.  It is regrettable that the Chair is now repeating his previous mistake, which he so graciously and courageously corrected on that occasion. It is regrettable that he is doing the same thing again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Standing Order was changed in order to permit Opposition Deputies to put forward constructive Bills where in <Col N="1113" /> certain areas of national policy the Government had been either reluctant or neglectful in taking action.  We have been told here this morning the reason why this Bill may not be read a second time in Private Members' Time&mdash;I emphasise that it is not a question of looking for Government time but to utilise the limited amount of Private Members' Time that is at the disposal of Opposition Deputies.  What is being denied here is the right of Opposition Deputies to use the extremely limited amount of time they have to put forward Bills which they consider to be in the national interest.</P>
    <P>We have been told here this morning that the Government are opposing the Second Reading of this Bill because they are coming forward with a Government Bill covering this subject matter.  There seems to be a definite inconsistency in that approach.  There is a Private Members' Bill before the House at the moment&mdash;it was introduced last night by Deputy Eileen Desmond and the debate will be resumed on it tonight&mdash;dealing not only with adoption and the position of adopted children but also the rights in law of illegitimate children and the extension of eligibility of children for adoption.  That Bill, which the Government opposed, was not denied a Second Reading, for an obvious reason&mdash;the reason is obvious now, it was not obvious yesterday&mdash;because the Government wanted to do a P.R.O. job on a Labour Party Bill on a matter that covers such things as the security and the well-being of children and the mental anguish of more than 50,000 people, parents and children.</P>
    <P>The Government have not taken action on these matters, and when we introduced that Bill we extracted here last night from the Government, reluctantly, a suggestion that they will introduce a Bill before Christmas to deal with one aspect of this problem&mdash;the Labour Party Bill covered three aspects of child welfare.</P>

That is the point I am making, and it is completely within the compass of your ruling.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is dealing with the Chair's ruling rather than with the question of whether the motion should be taken.  I would point out that we had this discussion on a previous occasion and, contrary to what has been stated here today, the Chair did not change its ruling.  On that occasion Deputy FitzGerald undertook to raise the matter at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the appropriate place to raise it.  The Chair can only interpret Standing Orders as they are before the House, and there are no grounds now for a prolonged debate on this issue.  The strategy appears to be to discuss the merits and demerits of the Bill concerned.  The Chair will not permit that.  The House is aware that any Stage of a Bill may be opposed and there is nothing new in that.  The Chair is not concerned with what is contained in a Bill or who is embarrassed by it but must rule in accordance with what is in Standing Orders.  I will not permit a prolonged debate unless Members are in order.</P>

We have been told that there is a Bill pending, but I want to highlight the behaviour of the Government last night during Private Members' Business when we discussed a Labour Party Bill.  They did not oppose a Second Reading but the Minister for Justice indicated that a Bill would be introduced before Christmas to deal with one important aspect of it.

      <P>On the Order of Business, in pointing out to the Taoiseach that we have approximately 20 sitting days before the Christmas recess, I stated that he had told us that before Christmas there would be a further debate on the EMS proposals, that the Minister for Justice had announced that a Bill with regard to adoption and the rights of adoptive parents would be introduced, that the Minister for Health had stated yesterday that a Bill would be introduced to deal with the sale or availability of contraceptives, and that we would have the normal Adjournment Debate covering about three days. It is expected that that business will be dealt with before Christmas, but now we are told that the Government are preparing a Bill to cover aspects referred to in the Bill dealing with national monuments before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most controversial issues in this Bill is the question of Wood <Col N="1118" /> Quay.  Some weeks ago the Government made an order extending the time for the excavation of Wood Quay for seven weeks.  It is clear that the Bill the Minister of State referred to will not be circulated to Members before Christmas.  This is clearly a political ploy and, unfortunately, the Chair's interpretation of Standing Orders is lending itself to that political ploy.  We have had a dismal record of legislation from the Government since they took office.</P>

The only hope of getting constructive legislation through the House is for us to use the limited time in Private Members' Business.  That right is being denied to the Opposition this morning.  It is not a question of personal frustration for a few politicians on this side of the House.  It is something which is basic and fundamental to the democratic procedures which we observe and respect here.  We cannot be denied our rights simply because there are 84 pairs of feet ready to walk into any lobby the Government wish.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle unfortunately due, I presume, to his very lengthy parliamentary experience and the fact that this House has always regarded the taking of Bills and the proceeding of the Stages of the Bills as being entirely a Government prerogative&mdash;in the amendment which we made to Standing Orders I would refer the Ceann Comhairle to the 1972 report of the Informal Committee on the Reform of Dáil Procedure.  Both the Ceann Comhairle and I shared membership of this committee. Paragraph 49 of that report says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> we believe it to be unfair that in all cases the private Member must in effect be dependent on the Government to secure a Second Reading debate in Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>It was because of that observation shared by Deputy O'Malley who was then Minister for Justice, and by Deputy Andrews that the Standing Orders were amended.  Deputy Richard Burke, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy now a Minister and the late Deputy David Thornley were all members of the committee. In the last session when a motion was being opposed I was provoked to implore the Ceann Comhairle not to make a precedent, and the Ceann Comhairle correctly said that we would go ahead and let the motion be taken in Private Members' Time and that it had nothing to do with the Government.  I would appeal to Deputy Lalor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude.  Unfortunately Deputy Lalor, myself and Deputy Donal Creed did not have an opportunity to discuss this matter before this morning.  Had we done so I am sure we would have come to an amicable agreement on the matter.  Unfortunately, typically, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance rushed Deputy Wyse into saying &ldquo;throw it out. We will not have it&rdquo; and then we all reacted.  The matter can be resolved. Deputy Lalor need only indicate that if we wish to take the Bill in precedence in Private Members' Time under Standing Orders, by all means take it.  That is all Deputy Lalor need do.  There would be no hassle and the matter would be resolved without involving the Ceann Comhairle in further destructive scenes in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole debate has been preposterous.  The way we conduct our business in this House would make one sick.  For ten years I have fought to get these awful Standing Orders revised. They are decrepit, they are incredibly bad, and they are not worthy of a banana republic.  We should have the <Col N="1122" /> Standing Orders properly revised, but in the meantime what we have we hold, and let us behave ourselves as parliamentarians earning £7,000 a year.

It had nothing whatever to do with the ruling of the Chair.  Until Standing Orders have been discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this is not the place to discuss it.  While the Standing Order which I read remains the Chair is bound when a motion is before the House to permit a division to be taken on it.  The Chair has no option.  A Bill cannot go to Private Members' Time without an order of this House, and an order of this House means that it may or may not be opposed.  As long as it is being opposed the Chair must accept that and put it to a division.  The Chair is not actuated by any motives other than his interpretation of Standing Orders as they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I dealt with a number of aspects that were relevant to the debate and some that were not.  Of the issues which were relevant, those that are necessarily of a rather technical nature&mdash;such as the respective merits of a parity grid versus a basket approach to the actual mechanisms for calculation <Col N="1129" /> intervention limits and so on&mdash;were touched upon.</P>
      <P>I went on then to deal with the basis for the sum of £650 million which the Irish Government have suggested as being the appropriate level of aid during our transitional period over the next few years.  I think I dealt adequately with the reasons that other figures which have been mentioned in this House and elsewhere are not particularly appropriate.</P>
      <P>I went on to deal also in general terms with the question of the likely value of the Irish £ in the event that we found ourselves joining the European Monetary System while sterling remained outside.  I illustrated the reasons why there should be no simple or clearcut approach to that question.  I spelled out some of the reasons why one would continue to expect changes in exchange rates from time to time even if inflation were to disappear completely and we know, of course, that the presence of inflation, especially the presence of widely differing inflation rates, can cause changes in exchange rate currencies.</P>
      <P>I then went on to deal with the question of whether or not the proposed European Monetary System would have a deflationary impact on the Irish economy.  That was a point on which I spent a little time.  I thought it right to try to tease it out because I wanted to draw an important distinction between deflation in the precise sense of that term&mdash;that is, developments which would lead to a reduction in the rate of inflation&mdash;and to contrast that type of deflationary impact, which would be a good impact in our view, with the other sense in which the deflationary impact is frequently used, namely, the sense in which it would have some adverse effect on our growth, output and productivity. Indeed, here I cannot help digressing for a moment to comment that, given the rather slipshod way in which these terms are bandied about, the man in the street must be frequently confused because he is told inflation is a bad thing and in the next breath he is told deflation is a bad thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But reflation is <Col N="1130" /> sometimes a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but how does one get to a position of reflation if one is not permitted to either inflate or deflate?  I was trying to draw a careful distinction between inflation and deflation, applying the latter to measures which would slow down the rate of inflation pricewise in the economy, regarding that as a very beneficial effect, and, if that correct deflationary result can be brought about by the introduction of the European Monetary System, then that will be a good thing.  Of course, if the impact of the EMS were to come in the wrong form it would have the other type of what is loosely described as a deflationary effect, namely, an adverse impact on our rate of growth and output. I spelled out the reasons why I thought we could avoid any such harmful effect on our growth rate, and this was one of the reasons why we had sought a particular level of financial aid, because such aid would enable us to sustain and, indeed, accelerate our growth and output and productivity.  We envisaged any such aid being used for investment purposes, and the inflow of such funds would, of course, also ensure we would not have to worry about any balance of payments problems.  We would have the ability to finance the balance of payments deficits bound to occur during a period of rapid growth and development.  It was important, therefore, as I said, to discuss this question of the possible deflationary impact in the European Monetary System and to say that part of the necessary conditions for ensuring a beneficial impact was that we should be enabled to press ahead with a rapid programme of investment and productivity growth and should not have to worry unduly about possible balance of payments constraints. Those would be external requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then emphasised that these external conditions would have to be accompanied by the appropriate domestic behaviour.  In this context, the appropriate domestic behaviour means we must avoid producing any excessive cost and price increases within our own economy.  If we fail to do this, if we allow <Col N="1131" /> ourselves to produce excessive cost and price increases, then obviously the emergence of the EMS and the tighter monetary disciplines that would accompany it would produce the harmful results we seek to avoid and would, indeed, result in some adverse impact on our growth rate.  If, on the other hand, we can exercise the appropriate degree of discipline&mdash;I know some speakers on the other side object to the word &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; but it is nonetheless the appropriate word&mdash;in the conduct of our own economic affairs, then we can ensure that our behaviour does enable us to sustain a rapid growth in real output and real living standards.  If we behave in an undisciplined or inappropriate way we simply impose a fresh burden of inflation, slow growth and get no improvement in living standards.</P>
    <P>In that context, it is important to emphasise that in our view it would be totally unrealistic to expect our EEC partners to help us during the early years of the European Monetary System, whether by financial aid or other measures, if we were to display an unwillingness to help ourselves by the appropriate management of our own affairs. Perhaps I could digress for a moment here to deal with a question raised by Deputy Bruton.  He asked were there any conditions attaching to any loans raised by the Government.  Not that I am aware of, and there has been no suggestion that any conditions would attach to any aid we are seeking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said in his introductory statement that conditions as to economic policy might be imposed in the medium term loan system for support of the currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Might be.  I am making the same point.  I said it would be unrealistic to expect our EEC partners to help us if we were not to display a willingness to help ourselves by the appropriate management of our own affairs.

      <P>That is an impossible question to answer.  One discusses likely courses of action in many forums, whether here or elsewhere outside <Col N="1133" /> the House, with various bodies and so on.  One frequently has discussions on the nature of economic policy, budgetary policy, monetary policy and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of trying to anticipate future arrangements at which we might arrive, whether for domestic reasons or as part of some new set of arrangements which might emerge in the European context.  I was emphasising the importance of applying appropriate policies and ensuring that we operate the proper domestic arrangements if we are to derive the maximum benefit from participation in the European Monetary System.  Those were the essential points in that area.</P>
      <P>Then there was the question of what would happen if we were to join and the UK were to remain out.  There were a number of points on this heading, one of which I did not deal with yesterday and I will do so, briefly, now.  The question was raised by Deputy Barry.  He emphasised the importance of the position in Northern Ireland and this was also referred to by many other speakers. It was said that if there were to be any change in parity between the British £ and the Irish £, this would introduce a new situation in the Northern part of the country.  If Britain were to be outside the system and we were to be a member, this could give rise to exchange control arrangements and so on.  While I would fully agree with speakers who cast their remarks and questions in the form that we should not do anything that would hinder progress towards Irish unity, I do not see this as in any sense implying that we cannot go ahead and participate in the EMS even if Britain should decide to remain outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the implied argument is that we must always maintain the <i>status quo</i> in Northern Ireland, then by implication one is trying to say that there is no choice of exchange rate before the Irish <Col N="1134" /> Government and that we must always automatically lock ourselves into sterling so as to maintain the existing circumstances in the North.  I would reject that approach.  One could equally envisage that perhaps the fastest way to promote Irish unity is to demonstrate that an independent Irish monetary system is part of a set of economic arrangements which are accompanied by a faster rate of progress in the economic area than would be experienced as part of a sterling system.</P>
    <P>That decision, therefore, has to be taken on its merits at the time in the light of the circumstances then prevailing and that is the only sensible course of action for any Irish Government to adopt. They should look at the situation as carefully as possible, assess the merits and demerits of either course of action and, when they come to weigh up the implications for Irish unity, they should choose that course of action which in their view will have the most favourable impact on that objective.</P>
    <P>That brings me into the more political arena of the attitudes and stance adopted by many of the speakers on the other side of the House.  I had started to deal with what I regarded as a tendency to display an excessive reliance on simply following the British position on these matters.  I gave examples yesterday and there is no need to repeat them again.  I went on to make the point that, while there are of course areas in which there might be a similarity of interests between Britain and ourselves, it is equally possible that on a number of items there are significant differences between British interests and Irish interests, between their circumstances and ours and between their expectations for the future and ours.  Therefore, given those different circumstances, it would be perfectly rational for us to pursue a separate course of action from theirs.  Incidentally, I cannot resist making the point that everyone talks about breaking the link with sterling if the situation were to arise in which Ireland would participate in the EMS and the UK would remain outside. Surely the more technically correct description in those circumstances is that Britain would be refusing a link with the Community and that Ireland, in <Col N="1135" /> common with the seven other members, would be sharing in a common European system.  I would rather look at the matter in that context.</P>
    <P>Having noted what I described as the &ldquo;stage Irish&rdquo; mentality, which may have been good entertainment, when it came to the actual question of identifying a course of action and deciding which action to take and which policy to pursue, there was an immediate shying away from all these serious matters and instead we had the deferential attitude that we should follow what the British do&mdash;if they go to certain meetings, we should do likewise; if they hang back, we should do likewise; if they take an initiative, we should support it.  I reject all that approach. I concentrated in my examples yesterday on the Fine Gael speakers in illustrating this.  Perhaps I should make it clear that I regard this inadequate approach as extending also to the Labour benches.  If I were to summarise the overall approach of the Opposition, I would say that they were trying to pursue a tactic that can best be described as backing every horse in the race in order to back the winner, so as to be able to claim afterwards that they had indeed picked the winner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of that issue does not hinge on precise quantified data.  Either it is important or it is not.  Either the nature of the system is such that it is of substance or it is not. That is not a question which hinges on whether some particular number turns <Col N="1136" /> out to be 100 million or 90 million or whether another number turns out to be ten or 20.  Let us deal with the important things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. I am making the point that, while some speakers on those benches seemed to think it was important, others seemed to think it was relatively trivial.  Some seemed to think it was very important to keep the sterling link, while others seemed to think it was important to break it.</P>
      <P>The greatest area of confusion in this attempt to back every horse in the race was in the whole approach to the negotiating position and tactics. Naturally the Opposition wanted to get themselves into the luxurious position of being able to say that, no matter what the Government did, the Government were wrong and they, with their superior wisdom and insight, would have done a far superior job.  I dealt with some of the examples where they were claiming this innate superiority for their performance. To crystallise it into one single example, it was the whole question of whether one should reveal the bargaining position early on or conceal it.  A number of speakers criticised us for taking too early an initiative: the Taoiseach was too enthusiastic after Bremen and Copenhagen, in contrast to the British who were far more cautious and circumspect. Then we had other speakers criticising us for concealing our position and asking why we were not giving more information and spelling out far more clearly the merits and demerits of various possible outcomes.  These are the ultimate extremes I have chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to this debate, I was turning over in my mind how we were supposed to pursue a highly complex bargaining position where we were, as one speaker said, dealing with ruthless interests that would stop at nothing, and how we were to do this if we were also being required, sometimes by the same speakers, to come into the House and spell out fully <Col N="1137" /> and clearly all the possible courses of action open to us, the likely consequences of various solutions and how precisely we had settled on particular components in our approach.  That cannot add up to a consistent approach.  Either it is sensible when one is in a negotiating position to keep most of one's cards close to one's chest or it is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. <Col N="1138" /> The Deputy can so describe it if he wishes.  I will debate the merits of it afterwards.  Now that the Deputy has interrupted me let me pick up one remark that he made&mdash;I was going to let it go but the Deputy may as well have it now&mdash;the Deputy was listing a number of things that he felt ought to be supplied by way of information.  He eventually produced the really hilarious suggestion of insisting on an item that would be impossible to supply.  The Deputy told the House at one stage that not only should the Government spell out the various implications of how aid could be used and so forth and made clear his own preferences on the manner in which financial aid might be supplied but he said that the Government should also indicate the opportunity cost, the alternative ways in which this money would be used and the results that would follow if it were left to individuals, farmers, and so on to dispose of it.  That is impossible for any Government.  The Deputy is asking the Government to look into the hearts and minds of the people who might or might not get their hands on various parts of this sum and also establish how much each of them is or is not likely to use.  We are asked to establish the nature of the investments they might or might not make, the consequences that would follow from those investments which they might or might not make at a level undisclosed and to inform the Deputy and the House as to the alternative results that would result from that course of action.  That was a marvellous example of the brilliant flights of fancy which came from the Opposition benches.  But this did not surprise me because, as I am trying to illustrate, in order to be able at some distant date in the future to claim how wise and all-seeing they were, the Opposition speakers went for the standard tactic of, as I have described it, trying to back every horse in the race so that they can always claim that they backed a winner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In closing I cannot resist taking up more specifically one or two of the attitudes flowing from the Labour Party benches.  If some of the Fine Gael speakers were taking up positions with which I could not agree they were at least expressing themselves.  The overriding <Col N="1139" /> impression that I got from the Labour Party speeches was that they were not for or against anything.  They did not appear to know where they stood, where they had come from, where they were going.  Having dissipated their energies in trying to be all things to all men they now have nothing to offer other than a kind of foggy inertia, a misty kind of emptiness that enables them to express no positive attitude for or against anything.  The only specific feeling or thread running through their remarks that I could identify was that whatever else they were they certainly were not part of a group which could be described as socialist in the sense of subscribing to such noble ideals as a national brotherhood of man.  To hear the way they were telling it at times one would think that most of the people one meets once one gets outside the shores of Ireland are to be at the least viewed with the greatest suspicion or that one should flee from them in peril of losing one's life and one's virtue.  In case they think that means that they can say they were expressing the correct sentiments of Irish nationalism and so on in adopting this kind of negative approach to the outside world let me hasten to disabuse them on that.</P>
    <P>Again I want to pick a remark which at first struck me as incongruous and inappropriate. The Labour Party Leader, Deputy Cluskey, said that Fianna Fáil had a romantic approach to this subject; we had this romantic idea of breaking the link with sterling.  At first I was inclined to smile and think that, whatever else one might say about this debate on a highly technical subject, one would hardly describe it as romantic.  But on reflection he was right.  We do stand convicted as romantics.  It points to the contrast between the Labour Party and ourselves.  By now in their posturing and their meandering and attempting to be all things to all men they have simply dissipated all their theories, their policies, their ideas and they have nothing better to offer than a foggy and confused meandering whereas to be romantic implies having some sort of conviction, some sort of ardour, some sort of a vision for the future.  It implies <Col N="1140" /> having a belief in the Irish people, a commitment to shaping our own affairs, to exercising the power that has been conferred on an independent Government, to adopting a truly republican stance and saying &ldquo;It is Government of the people for the people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Whether it results in mistakes or in the right conclusions the crucial thing is for the Government of the day, whoever they are, to have this romantic approach, to believe in things; above all to believe that there is a way in which Ireland can play its part among the nations of the earth and make a contribution. We do not have to suffer from a massive national inferiority complex; we do not have to spend our time tied to mother England's apron strings rather than run the risk of developing any monetary or other policies of our own. That ultimately is the difference between the two sides of the House.  Right or wrong we believe in what we are doing. We believe that there is the possibility of making progress in this European arena. If we were to listen to the other side of the House we should run scared for cover.</P>
    <P>All that one leading speaker, Deputy Barry, could suggest was that the only reason we were interested in entering the EMS was because we were searching for alibis.  We are seeking no such thing.  We do not need alibis.  What we are searching for is opportunities and the way to approach this European Monetary System is to view it as producing opportunities for further progress in the European arena.  There is no guarantee that any particular opportunity will be converted into a worth-while reality.  That depends on the behaviour of the people concerned.  We know we are only a small part of the European Community but it depends in part on our behaviour just as it depends on the behaviour of those other member states in the Community.  Surely the correct approach for any Irish Government which believes in itself and believes in its right to speak for the people is that it should be willing to go out and to adopt a positive stance towards bringing about a better Europe in a better world.  That is the approach we have adopted and we make no apology for it.  We will continue <Col N="1141" /> to pursue it and we will defend our record.</P>

      <P>The Chair said that it would allow a few brief questions when the Minister had concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points that I want to put to the Minister for clarification.  In fact, there would have been four but this morning he reverted to what he had said about deflation and in doing so he clarified what was perhaps a bit confused in some of the reports of his speech this morning on this issue.  I was glad he clarified the point that the terms on which we shall enter, as negotiated by his Government, will not have adverse effects on the rate of growth of output.  Some of the reporting this morning may have confused that issue but I do not think I have to pursue the point any further.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to ask the Minister one point arising out of the discussion this morning.  First, he spoke about conditions applying to aid.  I was not clear whether aid meant the £650 million grant being sought.  I was not sure if he was talking of the possibility of future loans.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this question of conditions in relation to the £650 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear that no conditions had been attached to any financial transactions in the Community up to now, that nobody had suggested yet any specific conditions. In reply to the further questions from Deputy Bruton when he was trying to elicit what would be our future position, I was adopting what I regarded as the sensible approach of saying that I refused to indicate what would happen in the future because one does not know what a Government would agree to in certain circumstances.  In the general European context one has to say one could envisage circumstances where individual member states, for the greater good of the Community, would accept some agreement on what we might call the performance criteria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press that further because the Minister must be left to negotiate and bargain in that area and probably it is not a matter that can helpfully be developed further on the floor of the House.  I merely wanted to clarify what he was talking about when he made the statement.</P>
      <P>The second question I wish to put arises out of what he said yesterday about the rationale of the £650 million. While I tried to listen carefully, what came across to me&mdash;and I do not think it can have been the Minister's intention&mdash;was that the figure was arrived at because we could not use any more than that.  I do not think the Minister could have meant that and perhaps he will clarify what he was trying to get across at that point as regards the reason for the choice of this figure.  It was not clear to me, and perhaps to others, in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that we could look at two characteristics of this level of aid.  One was what scale of aid would be relevant in the short term as helping with our balance of payments financing.  The second was that if one was seeking aid that had a performance condition attached to it written in by ourselves, namely, that we would only seek aid for investment purposes&mdash;aid that would enable us to press ahead more rapidly with investment in various areas of our economy&mdash;that clearly there was some limit to the extent to which the economy could absorb additional investment spending.  I went on to make the point that while it would be nice to have other forms of more general aid, budget transfers or financial transfers which arise in the MacDougall Report context, I did not regard those as being realistic in present circumstances because we were not discussing the kind of framework in which those types of transfers were likely to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dissatisfied with the reply but I am glad that I am clear in my own mind about this matter.  It is surprising that the Government could not envisage, even after five years, finding anything useful to do with more than £130 million a year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister seemed to be saying.  The last question I wish to put relates to the basic issue of monetary union.  Yesterday the Minister did not seem to have listened to or to have taken account of the point I was making here and I should like him to clarify his thinking on this.  The point I put to him was the following and I shall quote what I said:</P>
      <P>Only to the extent that the Minister proposes to enter without accepting a commitment to maintain parity of currency with others and with the idea of devaluing from time to time could this be described as other than a monetary union or its effects on us be different from monetary union.  I presume it is not his intention to pursue such a policy which would, apart from its effect upon our relationships with our partners, involve continuing reimportation of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to obscure the issue here and I should like him to state clearly where he stands.  Are we going in with the intention of maintaining parity?  If that is the case, in what way is this different in its effect from monetary union and in what way will it require any less aid than a monetary union?  Is the Minister going in on the basis that we do not have to bother about the commitment because we can devalue whenever we need, that therefore there is no monetary union involved and we do not need £650 million?  The Minister should answer that question.  He has not done so up to now.  He has tried to obscure the issue by his references to what I said about monetary union.  I might add that some Fianna Fáil speakers in the debate were quite clear that this is monetary union. I would refer the Minister to column 782 of the Official Report where a Fianna Fáil speaker specifically said, &ldquo;Now is the right time to have the opportunity of joining the monetary union&rdquo;, and also, &ldquo;it is opportune that the monetary union discussions are taking place...&rdquo;. Some people on the Minister's side think that what is involved is monetary union. I did not allege it was but I put the point <Col N="1144" /> that unless it is proposed to devalue from time to time its effects are the same and the aid required is the same as identified and measured by the Minister in that report.</P>

      <P>Yesterday we listened to Deputy Ryan who allegedly has some experience in this area and he was very careful to make the point that he envisaged that exchange rates would continue to change in the proposed EMS.  I have made clear all along that the proposed EMS is not a monetary union and my reasons stem from the nature of the information we have from the Bremen discussions.  The outline of the scheme that was released after those discussions makes clear that while it is hoped that exchange rate changes would be few in number and limited in extent, nonetheless they could still continue to occur.  I gave reasons, even if the whole Community succeeds in wiping out inflation completely, why some such changes in exchange rates could be required from time to time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a very tricky area.  There is no way in which I can deliver myself of remarks that could be then interpreted outside this House as giving an indication of the likely value of the Irish £ or the nature of the exchange rate policy which the Irish Government will pursue in the coming months and years.  If the Deputy wants to call that concealing information from the House let him go ahead and I shall not mind in the slightest.  I have no intention of uttering a word on those specific areas.  In order to deal with the general nature of the problem, within the proposed EMS it appears to envisage occasional changes in exchange rates and it is clearly not a monetary union.  Therefore any attempt to import into the discussion or the necessary conditions for the system characteristics that are appropriate in a monetary union is not relevant or helpful.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to give a firm date to the House for the publication of the White Paper. Obviously the publication date must in part depend on the content of the paper. In the light of some of the remarks which I have made both on my own behalf and in reply to questions, the <Col N="1146" /> House will recognise that one would say different things after the decision period. Let us assume that the final decisions are taken in Brussels in the first week in December; then the content of any document compiled after the meeting in December would differ from the content of documents compiled before the meeting in December.</P>

      <P>Deputies are asking questions and before I finish replying they are devouring the questions. Either they want me to reply or they do not.  I am trying to give the easiest illustration as to why precisely the content of a White Paper will be influenced in part by the timing of its publication.  We have here two matters to resolve, the timing and the content. Even if we are to fix on a date today we are not necessarily producing any noticeable progress because the content of a paper to come out on an agreed date would then be determined in the light of that agreed date.  It may be in the interests of all of us to retain some flexibility as to date as well as to content.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an unusual matter to have before the House.  Am I to take it from what the Minister has just said that he contemplates the possibility of not publishing the White Paper until after the Government have made explicit commitments at a Council of Ministers meeting as to their final position?  If so, could he indicate what value, if any, such a White Paper would have in terms of assisting in the decision-making process if a decision is already taken?  Is <Col N="1147" /> there any likelihood of any change in exchange control between this country and Germany as a result of our joining the EMS?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the second question first.  I said that I had no intention of going into any references to the nature of the policy we will pursue over the coming months in respect of sterling and so forth.  It is equally essential for me to avoid making any specific statements about what consequential changes in monetary arrangements might arise between Ireland and any other member state of the Community. If such changes are required as a result of the precise form of the system&mdash;if such a system is agreed&mdash;and if we agree to join, then such consequential changes will be made.  For the reasons already given I do not see that it would be in any way helpful to indulge in speculation in these matters at this time.</P>
      <P>The other point was about the time of the publication and whether it is being published before the final decisions are taken, that is, let us assume, before 4 or 5 December.  I have tried to illustrate my view on that matter.  I am not committing myself and it is not for me to commit the Government at this juncture to the publication on any date.  I was simply suggesting to the House that it might well be that the Opposition would prefer different documents and different dates. Let us leave ourselves some flexibility on that.</P>

      <P>While recognising the dilemma of the Government about supplying us with up-to-date information, the publication of the White Paper after the decision has been taken on 4 or 5 December would mean having a debate on a <i>fait accompli</i>.  There is need for an informed debate but a decision should be made to publish the White Paper and have a debate on it a week preceding the <Col N="1148" /> decision-making process on 4 or 5 December.  Anything after that would be taking away from the Dáil the powers to have an informed discussion and a decision on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as clear cut as that.  I can see the case, but the document which we will get before the Brussels summit clearly will be cast in much more general terms than will any document we might get after it.  If you are concerned about the sovereignty of the Dáil you could consider as a valid possibility that, although you would not have a White Paper published and debated until after the Brussels summit, if the House so decided it could, before adjourning for the Christmas recess, repudiate or amend any decisions which the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government would have taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress on this Bill I was referring to the efficacy of a positive approach to this problem with a view to a reduction in cigarette smoking generally and I made the point that the ambition of the Minister was to see to it that the approach now being made would effect a reduction in the smoking habit.  I suggested that prohibition in any form might not be too successful, while a more positive approach towards some <Col N="1149" /> idea as to how people could be induced to kick the habit of smoking would be much more acceptable.  Many thousands of people are searching for this kind of advice.  The Minister promised that he would give the House and the country the benefit of his experience of getting rid of this habit and I look forward very much to hearing what he has to say on that.</P>
      <P>I now go on to the portion of the Bill concerning partial prohibition and to deal with it not in the way in which it might be dealt with in Committee but in a more general way.  The Bill refers to &ldquo;prohibition of advertising of particular kinds of tobacco products&rdquo;.  I appreciate that it is drafted in such way to allow for substantial intervention by the Minister at any time through the ministerial order device, bringing orders before the House, but I suggest that in its present form the Bill is very vague.  There is no specific mention of what particular kinds of advertising might be prohibited.  We understand from the statements made by the Minister that he is concerned with outdoor advertising of tobacco and other products related to tobacco.  We have nothing more in the Bill than the framework in which he can exercise absolute power in complete prohibition or a degree of prohibition which he thinks is desirable.  He can do what he thinks fit.</P>
      <P>This is causing a certain amount of concern to the public at large, the tobacco companies and the people who receive sponsorship from those companies, but I believe it is also causing concern among some of his ministerial colleagues, particularly when one considers the vast amount of revenue the State receives from the industry in general.  We know that the Bill will be concerned with particular types of advertising, but this needs to be spelled out more clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a section which deals with offences in connection with advertising. Has the Minister considered the implementation of whatever orders might result from the enactment of this Bill?  I am considering this in conjunction with the Consumer Information Act, which is exclusively concerned with <Col N="1150" /> advertising and a proper code in connection with it.  It is concerned with misleading advertising and offences under the Act.  The provisions of that Act will be implemented through a director of consumer affairs, who has to be appointed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has in the Bill before the House set up a new framework which will monitor advertising in the tobacco industry, and he is handing over the monitoring of it to the officers of health boards.  I believe that there are two parallel monitoring systems here, one under the Consumer Information Act and the one proposed under this Bill.  I can visualise cases, and I am sure the Minister can also where there could be overlapping and problems relating to who is responsible for monitoring a particular type of advertising.  It is necessary to know if it comes under the director of consumer affairs or under the health board officers.  This is rather sloppy legislation when one considers the very specific terms of reference in the Consumer Information Act with regard to the responsibilities of the director under section 9 of that Act.  The Bill would have been much tidier if the Minister decided to allow the proposed monitoring of the advertising of tobacco to come under the aegis of the responsible authority in the Consumer Information Act, because we are dealing with the same thing.</P>

      <P>The information published under the heading &ldquo;Industrial Inquiries&rdquo; on pages 126 to 145 of the June 1978 <i>Irish Statistical Bulletin</i> relates to the monthly index numbers of industrial production up to March 1978, and the results of the quarterly industrial inquiry up to September 1977.  Further results of the monthly inquiry up to June 1978, and of the quarterly inquiry up to March 1978 have been issued in stencilled form.</P>
      <P>The information published under the heading &ldquo;Industrial Production&rdquo; on pages 109 to 126 of the same bulletin shows the detailed results of the 1974 Annual Census of Industrial Production as they become available.</P>
      <P>There has been an exceptional delay in the case of the 1974 census results due to a change in the classification system being used to bring it into conformity with the more detailed system adopted by the European Communities. It was necessary to reclassify all the 1973 census details on the new basis as well, to provide a linkage between the new and the old systems.</P>
      <P>The Annual Census of Production inquiry is dependent on very detailed returns based usually on the firms' final accounts.  In many cases the basic returns are not furnished until some considerable time after the census year to which they relate.  This time-lag has tended to increase in recent years, with consequential delays in the processing and publication of results.</P>
      <P>Because of this the Central Statistics Office is appointing a number of officers to make direct contact with individual firms to ensure that returns are received with the minimum possible delay.</P>

I am, however, aware of a report which draws attention to the increased risk of attacks which jogging may precipitate in those who already have coronary heart disease.</P>
      <P>I am conscious, as are all responsible bodies promoting health, that people should take exercise in moderation, having regard to age and medical condition. If a person is in any way worried about taking exercise, he should consult his family doctor.  I am sure the Deputy will be aware that both the Health Education Bureau and the National Sports Council have emphasised both these points in their campaigns to promote exercise and sport.</P>

In fact it is entirely beneficial, and I would urge as many people as possible to take up this or any other suitable form of exercise.  I mentioned in my reply that the emphasis should be on exercise in moderation having regard to the age and medical condition of the person concerned, but subject to that I should do nothing but encourage the undertaking of good sensible programmes of exercise by every section of the population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying. Everybody should exercise moderation and ensure that the exercise programme which they undertake is suited to their age and medical condition. If any person has any doubt he should consult his physician, but there is no doubt but that a good sensible regime of exercise is desirable for everybody provided it is undertaken sensibly, with moderation and regard to the age and condition of the person concerned.  I wish Deputy Boland would not attempt to create an impression that exercise is in any way detrimental to health and well-being. It is not.  The thing we want to try to encourage more people to do is to engage in good, sensible, healthy exercise, sensible diet and avoid, as far as possible, those things in modern living which contribute to ill-health.</P>

It is wrong and irresponsible to try to create any impression that there is something inherently dangerous in exercise; there is not.  Exercise is good and is a natural thing to undertake. The only addendum I make to <Col N="1154" /> that statement is that it should be undertaken in moderation and related to the particular individual's physical condition and age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons suffering from asthma who are covered by medical cards obtain drugs and general practitioner care free of charge.</P>
      <P>Persons with limited eligibility are entitled to claim a refund of part of the cost of prescribed medicines so that the net cost of drugs in respect of a calendar month will not exceed £6.50.  This particular scheme will be extended to the remainder of the population in April next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that date therefore all asthmatic <Col N="1156" /> sufferers who do not have medical cards will be entitled to their drug requirements free to the extent that these exceed £6.50 per month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand from the Minister's reply that there is a limit to the covering of expenditure by the asthmatic patient who is entitled to limited eligibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Unless he has a medical card, the person concerned would have recourse to the drugs refund scheme, which refunds anything over £6.50 a month.  The person may have to pay up to £1 or £1.50 a month out of his own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is represented to me that there is heavier expenditure than is normal&mdash;if one could use that term&mdash;associated with some aids required for asthma, the inhaler and equipment of that sort, for those entitled to limited eligibility.  Is any consideration being given to the rather exceptional costs involved for many of these long term patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now for the limited eligibility category it does not matter and from April next it will not matter how excessive the cost may be; the person concerned will only have to pay a maximum of £6.50 a month.  Even at that stage if the person concerned has not got a medical card he could still apply to the chief executive officer of the health board under the hardship provision if the £6.50 a month was too much in his case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As in relation to coeliac sufferers last week, would the Minister not accept that while that provision may apply, in many cases people have need to get their local GP on a number of occasions during the month and that can involve very heavy costs on families where there is an allergy such as this. Would he consider, as I suggested in relation to coeliacs, that a medical card might be issued solely in relation to the sufferer from the allergy and not in relation to the entire family?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is something that can be considered.  The usual request in regard to coeliac sufferers and asthma sufferers&mdash;the latter particularly&mdash;is that they be included in the long term in this scheme.  Unfortunately, in regard to asthma sufferers it is difficult to define asthma; it is not a very clearly definable clinical condition.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a national council for the aged, which had been recommended by the inter-departmental committee on the care of the aged, was considered in 1970.  The main objective of the council would be to promote the growth of voluntary organisations dedicated to the improvement of services for the aged.</P>
      <P>It was, however, considered undesirable to establish a national council which would have the sole function of dealing with the aged.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if manual workers earning between £50 per week and £96 per week approximately will have to make heavier financial contributions than at present, under the terms of the proposed revised health scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission, of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The flat rate health contributions originally fixed in 1971 have been increased at intervals to allow for increases which were taking place in the cost of the limited eligibility services.  A further increase would have been necessary in the coming financial year to cover cost increases.  This factor should be kept in mind when assessing the points at which persons at present liable to pay contributions at the existing flat rates may be paying more under the new scheme of income related contributions.</P>
      <P>As the new scheme is income related it is inevitable that some persons will pay more but those with lower incomes, and in the case of farmers, those with lower valuations will pay less.  This is one of the primary objectives of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that although the information given is useful and factual he has not really replied to <Col N="1160" /> the question?  Can he say whether farmers whose PLV exceeds £31, whether non-manual workers whose income exceeds £2,600, and whether manual workers earning between £50 and £96 per week, will be paying more under the proposed so-called free scheme than they are paying at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that I cannot give any definite answer to that question because by April of next year it is certain that the existing level of health contributions would have been increased.  We do not know by how much, but it would certainly have been increased in accordance with normal annual practice.  We would have to compare the amount payable under the new pay related scheme with what the amount would have been if the new pay related scheme had not been introduced. It is difficult to settle that point.  In the case of the worker I should like to make this additional point, that somewhere around £50, £60 or more the insured worker may be paying more under the health contribution but up to about £80 he will be paying less under the social welfare pay-related scheme.  I am sure the Deputy will agree the worker does not go to great trouble to see what particular deduction is going where.  It is the effect of the combined deductions in which he is interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the insured person to whom I referred now pays 50p a week or £26 a year and, under the terms of the scheme as announced by the Minister some time ago, he will be paying 1 per cent of his income? Is it not the case that people earning over £2,600 per annum will be paying more under the terms of the new scheme than they are paying at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>He will pay more than he is paying at present, but he would have been paying more anyway next year in the normal course of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The general justification is that if you have a pay related scheme&mdash;and I am sure the Deputy will <Col N="1161" /> subsribe to this principle&mdash;the idea is that you help the lower paid, and if you help the lower paid and you want to give the same level or a better level of services, somebody must pay a bit more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I subscribe entirely to that, but would the Minister not agree that it is incorrect to term the scheme a free scheme when, in fact, it is an insurance scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if manual workers earning in excess of £5,000 per annum will lose eligibility for the refund of maternity and other costs under the terms of the proposed revised health scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the proposed changes in eligibility any person whose income is over the limit of £5,000 per annum will be responsible for paying the doctors concerned for whatever services they provide.  This includes medical fees for maternity services.  His or her entitlement to services will not otherwise be affected.</P>
      <P>I should add that in the light of the proposed changes the Voluntary Health Insurance Board have agreed to include in their scheme a substantial provision for maternity care.  The details have not yet been fully settled but the board will give adequate notice of their proposals.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have in mind specifically the subsidy which is paid by health boards towards the cost of private or semi-private accommodation in hospitals and nursing homes.  Under the revised arrangements everybody, irrespective of income, will be entitled to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that manual workers who are covered at present for in-patient maternity services and <Col N="1162" /> consultants' costs will lose their eligibility for those services under the proposed new scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some will.  Some workers who are at present entitled to limited eligibility, if their income exceeds £5,000 per annum or whatever the limit may be fixed at, will lose the benefit of consultants' fees on the one hand and maternity benefit on the other.  We are making very adequate provision for those people under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  The Deputy will understand there has to be a break-off point somewhere.  I think everyone in the House agreed that the old system was entirely unsatisfactory and gave rise to enormous difficulties in administration and discontent among the general public.  Therefore, we had to have some clear line of demarcation and £5,000 a year is a reasonably generous level.  It is one and a half times the latest published average industrial earnings figure, and it will be reviewed again before the scheme comes into operation finally on 5 April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>The waiting period for admission to hospital can vary from one hospital to another, and according to the condition to be treated and the degree of urgency of treatment required.</P>
      <P>From inquiries made from health boards and some of the larger voluntary hospitals I understand that the average waiting period for admission for general medical and surgical treatment is around four to eight weeks.  For some specialities, such as orthopaedics, ophthalmic surgery and ear, nose and throat conditions, the waiting period can be much longer.  Steps are being taken to improve the position in these fields by providing additional facilities and appointing extra medical staff.</P>
      <P>Persons requiring treatment urgently are, of course, admitted to hospital without delay.</P>

The problem is that it is difficult to decide on the best screening procedure.  They have not come to any decision on that in Britain. This is not like providing a mass X-ray system; it is much more complicated and there is the problem of whether the setting up of a pilot scheme is the best basis on which to work.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the estimated effect upon the living standards of social welfare recipients, such as widows and orphans, old age pensioners and those who are ill or unemployed, when the Government's proposal to abolish the subsidies on essential food items is put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's expressed intention to ensure that social welfare payments will be raised in line with increases in the cost of living.  If at any time the level of subsidy on essential foodstuffs were altered, this undertaking would ensure that social welfare recipients would be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Government's <Col N="1184" /> policy to increase them in line with the CPI or in line with the food element in the CPI?  Food represents a higher proportion of their budget for people in this category than for people in other categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The CPI rate is at 8.2 per cent over 12 months up to the middle of August.  The biggest item of increase in that rate was for food, which was 10 per cent.  The Government should raise the level of social welfare payments in line with the food element in the index and not total index, which embraces drink, mortgages, tobacco and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that the current practice of stopping all social welfare payments to persons under investigation by his Department until the investigation is completed constitutes a grave hardship in many cases; and whether he will change this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that it is not the normal practice in my Department to suspend social welfare payments while continuing entitlement is being investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual practice is to allow payment to continue while investigations are being carried out and it is only when the <Col N="1185" /> investigations have been completed that the question of suspending payment would be considered.  Suspension of payment before investigations are completed is exceptional, and it would arise only where there is conclusive evidence to indicate that a claimant no longer satisfies the conditions for the receipt of the benefit or assistance being paid to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to take issue with the Minister, but from my experience payments of benefits and assistance have been terminated while investigations are taking place.  As any Deputy can confirm we were all approached by people looking for supplementary welfare allowances to tide them over the period while investigations were taking place because their payments had been suspended.  If the result of the investigation is that everything is all right they are paid a lump sum.</P>

      <P>I would assure the Deputy that that should not happen, and if he knows of any case where it has happened he should draw it to my attention. The policy is that unless there is absolutely clear-cut evidence that the benefit or allowance is to be discounted, payments should continue while an investigation is taking place.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Before lunch I was referring to the section dealing with advertising.  Perhaps the Chair will bear with me if I seem to be repetitious in my approach, but because of the fragmented nature of the debate it is difficult to retain a logical train of thought in the matter.</P>
      <P>I had been pointing out to the Minister the problems that might arise with regard to the control and/or prohibition of certain kinds of advertising and I referred in this context to officers of the health board and their role in implementing these controls.  I was making the point that under the present legislation, that is, the Consumer Information Act, there are specific controls in relation to certain advertising, namely, misleading advertising.  Provisions of that Act that relate to misleading advertising are to be implemented by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I can see problems here.  I can see overlapping of responsibility, but I can see also a grey area, the brightening of which will depend entirely on a definition of what is misleading advertising and, secondly, of what kind of advertising the Minister for Health and Social Welfare has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I can see that the Director of Consumer Affairs will be responsible in the area of misleading advertising, the officials in the Department will be responsible for certain kinds of advertising. Are we to take it that this certain kind of advertising need not be misleading advertising, that it could be legitimate and lawful advertising and, if so, is there raised any legal or possibly constitutional matter?  If the Minister says that his officials will be responsible for certain types of advertising which are legitimate, whose responsibility will it be, for example, if an advertisement appears which concerns the tobacco industry but <Col N="1212" /> which is misleading?  Will the responsibility then rest with the Director of Consumer Affairs or will it rest with officials of the Department?  There is a conflict here which I trust the Minister will be able to clarify.  We will have now two parallel controlling bodies working largely in the same area with one given over totally to the question of misleading advertising and the other to the advertising of tobacco and tobacco products, with the two being kept apart.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has specified outdoor advertising.  I think I am right in assuming that he is talking about advertising on hoardings, shop fronts, the exteriors of buildings and so on.  If that is so, we are into an area where the provisions of this Bill can be side-tracked very easily through what is known in the business as in-store advertising. I am sure that at this moment the tobacco industry is giving some thought to expansion of in-store advertising.  It can be done, and is being done, through the provision of certain kinds of display stands and other devices to attract customers to purchase specific commodities. I would like the Minister to clarify if the prohibition on advertising extends to all types of advertising, apart from radio, television, hoardings and public displays in the open air.</P>
    <P>We now come to what I would regard as a rather difficult area&mdash;if we apply the criteria laid down by the Minister with regard to outdoor advertising&mdash;that is, shop fronts.  The name of the shop owner is over the door, put there in many cases at substantial expense, in a very decorative manner and often incorporating an advertisement for a particular kind of tobacco product.  To eradicate the reference to the tobacco product would involve defacing that decorative name sign which, in turn, would involve the shopkeeper in substantial expense replacing possibly the whole unit.</P>
    <P>I know for a fact that at this very moment there are certain sign manufacturers smacking their lips at the thought of the vast expansion in their business through the demand there will be for the replacement of these shop signs.  Consequently, we are back to square one.  If that situation comes about through <Col N="1213" /> ministerial action, the shopkeeper will be involved in substantial expense because I understand these signs can be very expensive. Naturally we can expect the cost of this imposition will be passed on to the consumer in the long run.  These are but a few of the grey areas which I can visualise arising out of the proposed legislation in its present form.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill is but a framework in which the Minister is given absolute power to amend, change, expand on or eliminate any idea he thinks might be suitable at a given time.  The Minister in his wisdom may be able to surmount these problems and come to an amicable agreement with the industry and the people involved but in the case of advertising he is not dealing with the tobacco industry alone, he is dealing with a vast area of other activities&mdash;the provision of signs and people's jobs.  I am sure the Minister in no way intends to do anything that would worsen the unemployment position.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Bill to which I object strongly&mdash;so far I have been trying to be constructive&mdash;is the provision in section 3 where the regulations made by the Minister are laid before the House.  I tried on one occasion to have an order which was laid before the House discussed within the statutory time.  I was given to understand that the normal procedure was that the Government provide time for discussion of such an order.  My experience was that the Government failed to make Government time available.  I was told that if I were to pursue this matter I should make the time available out of Private Members' Time.  This is a parliamentary device. But in dealing with this kind of legislation, which is so vague and so open to ministerial intervention, it is unfortunate that the precedent has been set where the Government need not make time available for discussion on the proposed annulment of an order.</P>
    <P>The Minister could stand up here and give an assurance that this will not happen in this Bill but he would be foolish to do that because he would not be able to stand over that guarantee.  The position is that the Minister can introduce certain <Col N="1214" /> orders, efforts may be made to have them brought before the House and discussed with a view to annulment possibly in some cases, and the Government on precedent may not allow the time necessary to discuss them.  Therefore, what we are talking about is legislation by stealth in what the Minister has stated is a very important Bill.  This is a basic weakness in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to reiterate one point concerning sponsorship. The Minister said he did not visualise that existing sponsorship would be interfered with, even though there is nothing in the Bill to say that this is so. In the past few days a major sponsoring firm have withdrawn sponsorship, even though they were not asked to do so.  I presume they felt there is no future in continuing with this sponsorship.  I do not know what reasons the company gave for withdrawing it.  The recipients involved were very fortunate that there was somebody else available to take up that sponsorship, but that may not be so in other areas where existing sponsors may see fit, for reasons best known to themselves, to withdraw.  While the one example we had in the past week of withdrawal of sponsorship has now been rectified through a substitute sponsor coming in, there will be cases of withdrawal, and possibly in the very near future, where no substitute sponsor will take up the slack.  Could we have a guarantee from the Minister that in the event of a sponsor withdrawing and nobody else taking up that sponsorship he will step in and provide sponsorship in that case?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the kind of budget made available to the new monitoring section to be set up to monitor advertising.  I presume to do the job properly will entail a substantial undertaking which will cost money.  I hope that the health boards, who will be charged with this responsibility, will be given sufficient funds to deal with this new area of activity, and that they will not be fobbed off by being given a block allocation and told: &ldquo;Cover A, B, C and D and also E, which is your new area of responsibility&rdquo;.  I hope they will be given an adequate budget to live up to their responsibility of monitoring advertising, <Col N="1215" /> be it legitimate or misleading, because it would seem that we are now entering the whole new area of the prohibition of legitimate advertising.</P>
    <P>In principle I am in agreement with the Minister in what he is endeavouring to do.  He has my goodwill in his approach. I would be indebted to him if he could tell me how to give up smoking, and there are thousands of people who would owe him the same debt of gratitude, which would constitute a much more positive approach than some of the negative aspects of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly commend the introduction of this Bill.  I view it as a courageous one.  It is a new dimension in legislation emanating from a Department of Health, showing themselves to be aware of the enormous problem confronting the health of the nation, not in any way inhibited by massive pressures from companies that can afford to apply such massive pressure.</P>
      <P>The last speaker referred to the fact &mdash;and I should like to mention this point straightaway&mdash;that a major company withdrew sponsorship only the other day.  Very bluntly I say: so what?  I think people will respond to the Minister for Health, realising that he is up against it when it comes to endeavouring to make an impact on such major companies. The Department of Health have afforded every possible opportunity to commercial companies in the past to toe the line in their standards of advertising&mdash;colourful, provocative, unrealistic advertising.  The stand the Minister has taken here within the framework of this Bill goes far beyond what previous speakers suggested. Naturally it has to be a basic framework, as is all legislation.  In practical terms all it means is getting down to structuring out levels of fines or prosecutions for anybody who seriously sets out to injure the health of the nation.  That is what this Bill is all about.  I do not see it weak in any way whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to an aspect of cigarette smoking, terribly important now, and that is that there are so many people at present endeavouring to give up the habit.  Perhaps the Minister, while introducing this legislation, could give <Col N="1216" /> serious consideration to the establishment of smokers' advice centres.  With the very harmful effects of smoking so convincingly documented it is time that, amongst other things, smokers' advice centres were set up to provide constructive advice, free on demand, on how to give up the habit.  As we all know, smoking is primarily a dependence on the drug nicotine.  It is comparatively easier to break a habit of this kind by, say, a group therapy approach rather than by a single individual.  I foresee three main purposes for such group therapy: first, to inform people accurately of the dangers of smoking&mdash;which I think is being done quite effectively at present; secondly, to assist them practically to give up the habit, and thirdly, there is the most important aspect of all, to assist people during their withdrawal period.  In London, at Clayton Park, there is such an advice centre very actively supported. Certainly Dublin is in need of such a centre and perhaps other cities also.  This London advice centre has been in operation for the past 14 years.  A recent study of its operations showed that it was being very actively supported.  Weekly clinics are held there which help people tremendously who are trying to break away from the habit.  Referrals come to the clinic from doctors and hospitals.  It is a practical clinic where people can go and receive advice during the withdrawal period from the habit.  Equipment at such clinics includes anti-smoking films, slides, literature, even X-rays showing people in serious medical conditions as a result of smoking.</P>
    <P>All in all this is a courageous Bill.  It is a serious and positive attempt to show that the Minister is going to confront the vehicle being used to cause such illness to the nation, that is through the direct means of advertising.  Of the insidious techniques used by cigarette manufacturers the most appalling is the subjection of young people of an impressionable age into feeling that cigarette smoking and being grown up are synonymous.  All advertisements in the past have given this impression, something I deplore.  Within this Bill the Minister has the power at his disposal to take firm steps in this direction.  People do not realise that even one person <Col N="1217" /> smoking in an enclosed area results in everyone in that area being affected.  The smoke impregnates the whole atmosphere. The provision of non-smoking zones could be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>This will be a tough battle.  It will be difficult to make any inroad into the subtley of the advertising techniques used by manufacturers.  For example, in the USA the relevant department there adopted a slogan on billboard advertising.  Unlike our somewhat puny advertisement to the effect that smoking can damage one's health, the warning in the USA read something like this: &ldquo;It is the opinion of the surgeon general that smoking can be harmful to you&rdquo;.  The emphasis on the danger of smoking was more or less reduced because it depended on whether the surgeon general was competent to make such a judgment.</P>
    <P>We must fully support the Minister here.  He is not adopting a position of confrontation with the manufacturers.  I see him as offering the manufacturers an opportunity for co-operation from the point of view of a more moderate approach than they have shown in the past.  The Minister needs a strong base by way of legislation from which to work in case co-operation is not forthcoming.  That is the way I interpret this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a great deal of advertising carried on in supermarkets where cigarettes are handed out free of charge, sometimes to very young people. There is the technique of leaving packets of cigarettes in public places, even on the streets, something which contributes to the problem of litter, to say nothing about pollution of the environment.  It is all part of an advertising campaign designed to convince people that smoking helps one to relax.  This sort of erroneous and inaccurate advertising will have to be stamped out.</P>
    <P>This legislation will make an enormous contribution to preventive medicine. A small percentage of our health budget is directed towards preventive medicine.  Since the Minister took office, through his Department and through the Health Education Bureau, a positive <Col N="1218" /> move has been made to create a public awareness of better health as a result of moderation in both smoking and drinking. There is no point in adopting a killjoy attitude where smoking and drinking are concerned.  Both can give pleasure. We must have a sensible approach.  We must strike a proper balance.  People must no longer be bombarded with exotic but erroneous advertising. Sometimes this advertising seems deliberately designed to make them feel in some way inadequate if they do not indulge in smoking.  In fact some advertisements advertising other products in which cigarette manufacturers have a vested interest use subtle techniques showing participants smoking or, indeed, showing smoke billowing in the background, giving the impression that it is part of the enjoyment of whatever the product is.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Irish airlines having non-smoking zones.  That is very welcome, and the idea could be extended with great advantage to other areas, such as theatres, cinemas and so on. People who do not like smoking are entitled to consideration, and they should not be compelled to suffer just because others want to smoke.  This Bill deserves the support of this House.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to advertising, the Minister will want to ensure there is no spin-off here from advertising in Britain and Northern Ireland.  That is something that must be considered.  Our partners in the EEC could help.  Young people move around a great deal nowadays, and it would pay a dividend if our partners in the EEC adopted an attitude in this matter similar to ours.</P>
    <P>Withdrawal from smoking should be a gradual exercise.  A gradual withdrawal is much easier than an abrupt stop.  A slow phasing out of advertising will have a better return than an abrupt stoppage of advertising.  I think all advertising of cigarettes and tobacco should be in black and white only.  Again, why not advertise pipe tobacco and chew tobacco rather than glamourise cigarettes?  I admit that these tobaccos are possibly not regarded as being as glamourous as cigarettes.</P>
    <P>On the question of revenue, quite frankly we will have to face up to the <Col N="1219" /> situation and adjust our housekeeping. Revenue will have to be derived from some other source, and certainly not from the ill-health of our people.  I have in front of me an advertisement which appeared in a British newspaper.  It shows a little child of about three or four sitting in a high chair with a cigarette in his mouth.  The question asked is: &ldquo;How many cigarettes a day does your child smoke?&rdquo;  And underneath it says: &ldquo;Few children smoke at this very early age, but adults are doing it for them.&rdquo;  These are the huge pressures on young people. People are subject to smoking and the smoking environment whether or not they want it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a lead, but let us have no illusions.  It will need an enormous follow-up from every Member of the Oireachtas.  The example which could be given by Members of this House in regard to smoking could go a very long way in assisting people who look to those who are prominently featured in newspapers and are also influenced by sports personalities. Members who may not completely give up the habit should show their support without criticism of this legislation.  Having read through the Bill very carefully, I find it difficult to pinpoint any area with which I am in disagreement.  It is easy enough to say that it does not go far enough and is not comprehensive enough.  The only way in which I think it does not go far enough is that the fines are not as severe as they might be.  People will respond in a practical manner if they have to pay for any deliberately misleading advertising.</P>
    <P>I appeal to manufacturers involved in this huge industry and those who have diversified into other areas to set about giving a lead in trying to develop other business interests and to get out of this area altogether, if possible.  I will not give a specific example of a manufacturer who is actually engaged in an area of business diametrically opposed to the advertising of cigarettes.  It is appalling to think that a firm which is promoting and selling anti-smoking devices is, at the same time, advertising smoking products.  This is not good enough.  The evidence and the cost to the nation are <Col N="1220" /> there.  There are people in hospital at this moment suffering from a series of problems directly associated with cigarette smoking.  These people need a sympathetic and helping hand, supported by legislation that will not put this product in front of them.  A person can be brainwashed into buying a product whether or not he or she actually wants it.  A product can be manufactured and sold to people who buy it like sheep although they may not want it and certainly do not need it.  Such is the case with cigarettes.  Manufacturers are not caught out here because they have the means of diversifying into other areas and they are doing so at present.  My attitude is to give them every encouragement. Certainly jobs should not be put at risk.  Through an intelligent approach to this, people could be placed in other jobs.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that cigarettes are associated with sporting activities. This I abhor, especially the &ldquo;cool as a mountain stream&rdquo; approach and the association of smoking with yachting. Those who are familiar with sailing will find it very difficult to light up cigarettes frequently if they are serious about their hobby.  Anyone who is serious about training would never smoke a cigarette. Advertisements which depict players lighting up cigarettes after a match are absolute nonsense.</P>
    <P>These are the areas in which the ethics of advertising are being openly flouted. The Minister cannot do anything effective about it unless he has the support of strong legislation, so that he can demand a responsible attitude.  That is the way to progress.</P>
    <P>Despite what people say, the habit of smoking is getting worse in Ireland.  It is not so much that more smokers are being drawn into the net but those who are smoking are smoking more and this is more serious than anything else.  The Department of Health, through the Health Education Bureau, are taking positive steps to discourage great numbers of new smokers.  I think the direction should be towards established smokers in an effort to help them.  The Minister's action in trying to curtail the advertising of cigarettes is a positive step in that direction.  I should also like to see <Col N="1221" /> an advice centre being established in Dublin and I ask the Minister to give this matter serious consideration.  This would be a venue where people could get advice through the Health Education Bureau on how best to give up the habit. The figures show that nine out of ten deaths from lung cancer, six out of ten deaths from chronic bronchitis and three out of ten deaths from coronary thrombosis are directly linked with cigarette smoking.  I suppose that in ten or 15 years' time we will look back on the habit of smoking as a recipe for narrowing one's life span.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations for the control and regulation of advertising of tobacco products.  That is all-embracing, in that it covers cigarettes, cheroots and cigars.  I should like the Minister to make it obligatory for the manufacturers of tobacco products to advertise together. A person trying to kick the habit of cigarette smoking might decide to try smoking a pipe.  We must try to help people who are caught up in their present predicament.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  It is a practical step forward.  It deserves the complete support of this House and also the example of the House.  It has been welcomed in the medical profession. There are no illusions about the difficulties of implementing the legislation. Congratulations are certainly due to the officials of the Department for fastening down the legislation so comprehensively and so workably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very much welcomed by the House and by the individual Members of the House.  Indeed when one remembers the origin of the spread of tobacco in the western world, when one realises that a drug such as nicotine could be promoted to the extent that it has been to provide so much money for the companies which sell this product and when one remembers that the introduction to nicotine leads not only to illness but may be accompanied by feelings of nausea, cold sweat, drop in blood pressure, pallor, increase in salivation, it was indeed a wonderful act of promotion and advertising which effectively <Col N="1222" /> convinced people that they should continue using it.  Everybody who has smoked cigarettes will remember the first cigarette he smoked; he will remember the feeling of nausea, sickness and biliousness and possibly even vomiting that accompanied it.  It was, indeed, a tremendous success story to be able to promote in the western world something which initially caused repugnance in the body and mind.</P>
      <P>It is not true that cigarette smoking and tobacco intake is injurious to everybody.  Indeed one or two cigarettes a day would not be harmful just as one or two glasses of chilled white wine a day can be beneficial.  However, once again it is lack of moderation which causes concern.  It is lack of moderation that does injury to the body and lack of moderation on the part of the manufacturers and suppliers of tobacco has caused the introduction of this Bill.  This Bill is necessary in order to curtail further expansion of advertising of tobacco products.  The reason why it is necessary is that the promotion has been so successful.  Indeed, it is fair to call it the success story of advertising in this country.</P>
      <P>One of the important things and something that the Minister might have overlooked in producing this Bill is the initiation to cigarette smoking.  Most people were introduced to the most facile form of consumption of tobacco which is cigarette smoking and not cigar smoking or taking snuff.  Despite the success of advertising it is fair to say that advertising itself does not result in a person taking up cigarette smoking.  Most people are introduced to their first cigarette by another person.  I do not think that a person walks into a shop, buys a packet of cigarettes and starts to smoke on his own.  If that does happen it happens very seldom.  I do think that the person, the nipper going to school, the chiseller around the corner, gets that cigarette sometimes as a token of reward, sometimes from a friend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have outlined earlier, the nauseous effects of the first cigarette can be most repugnant and there is a follow-up mechanism on the psyche of the taker.  What is that follow-up?  Certainly the second and third cigarettes do not <Col N="1223" /> cause the same type of effect and after a while, as all smokers know, the initial unpleasant side effects disappear.  The Minister should try to attract attention to the initiation to tobacco smoking through a health education section in his Department.  His efforts should aim towards the adolescent or first cigarette consumer; many people do not smoke cigarettes until later on in life.  Just as with many other forms of drug-taking, initiation comes from a personal contact and I believe that the same holds for cigarettes.  Many cigarette smokers and tobacco consumers would agree with that opinion.  The ideal society, of course, would contain people who do not smoke, drink or take supportive drugs.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is attempting to abolish one of the factors responsible for inhibiting the achievement of the aim of the ideal society and he deserves the support and backing of every Member of this House and every member of the community and the nation.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to consider the educational aspect of this problem. This Department should discourage the handing out of samples around the country, which is a way of introducing people to one brand and also a way of inducing people to change from one brand to another.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very concise and effective and one could not criticise it except in regard to one or two minor omissions, one of which I mentioned.  Possibly it is there and I cannot see it.  Possibly it is in section 2 (2) (i).  If it is not there I am sure the Minister will see to it that it is placed there.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the concern felt by many people that this legislation might not in any way be effective in a great part of our society due to the fact that many products are advertised on other TV channels by tobacco companies outside this State over which the State has no jurisdiction.  I would urge the Minister to try to obtain the co-operation of the British Department of Health in curtailing the advertisements which appear on their channels.  There could be an intensification of advertising on the British channels to offset the loss <Col N="1224" /> here.  Radio, newspapers, bill-boards and so on should be taken into account; they have all proved to be effective in the promotion of the tobacco products.</P>
    <P>We are mainly concerned with the consumption of cigarette tobacco.  The Minister did not refer very much in his speech to cancer of the liver caused by pipe smoking or cancer of the jaw caused by cigar smoking although in an overall way he does refer to the associated illnesses resulting from tobacco consumption.  We are concerned primarily with cigarette smoking and its prevention or curtailment.  I wish the Minister luck.  I hope the companies will co-operate with him and that it will not be necessary to enforce the provisions of the Bill.  I am pleased to see that it contains a provision stating that the regulations can be annulled by the House if that should prove necessary.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to get away from the &ldquo;hard-man&rdquo; attitude, the glamour attitude, with regard to smoking. It had gone from the sublime to the ridiculous where smoking was being promoted at sporting functions.  We had nearly got to the stage on television where the winner of an Olympic marathon was going across the line with a cigarette in his mouth.  The George Raft / Robert Mitchum / Humphrey Bogart tough guy image must be curtailed. George Raft blames his emphysema on cigarette smoking and Humphrey Bogart attributed his lung cancer to cigarette smoking.  In America television programmes were made of famous people in the film world and elsewhere who were dying from lung cancer because of cigarette smoking. The effects on their families were shown to the television public.  Nicotine is an addictive drug and it is very difficult to give up cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's attitude that it is far easier not to start smoking at all than to give it up.  The statistics of death caused as a result of smoking are just the tip of the iceberg and the Minister referred to this in his opening speech.  The morbidity rate in the community, particularly in the upper age group, is very severe.  A man of 70 years who smokes heavily can get breathless putting on his clothes whereas another <Col N="1225" /> 70 year-old who does not smoke can lead a very active life and still play a brisk 18 holes of golf.</P>
    <P>Side by side with this legislation, the Minister has launched a campaign to encourage national fitness and he must be complimented on his participation in this programme, as must all other Members who have attempted to set an example in this regard.  However, I must point out that last year, and possibly this year, Members of this House actively competed for a &ldquo;pipe smoker of the year&rdquo; award and they posed in various aristocratic intellectual poses so that they might obtain the award.  I do not know if there have been any winners on this side of the House but I know that it was popular and regarded as vote-catching to win that award.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to reverse all of these matters in the legislation he proposes.  People will say if it is all right to smoke a pipe surely it is all right to smoke cigarettes, just as they said with regard to drugs.  It was sad to see in this House recently the Minister for Health, a former Minister for Health and a pretender to that office trying to suggest that cigarette smoking was much more dangerous than cannabis, marijuana, hashish and so on.  It was a sad day for the nation and for the Department of Health to see that triumvirate engaged in that short consultation.  I sincerely hope that the attitude of the Department with regard to that matter will be more responsible in the future.</P>
    <P>I referred to the elderly smoker who gets breathless putting on his clothes or tying his shoe laces and to the illness caused by bronchitis, emphysema, angina, hardening of the arteries, indigestion and the many side-effects associated with smoking.  The Minister has been more than conservative in his approach to these figures.  He would have been justified in quoting higher figures for morbidity associated with cigarette smoking.  The figure of 70 per cent in respect of people dying from lung cancer is conservative but I admire the Minister for this.  He has not presented spectacular frightening figures.  He is taking the lower end of the scale but it is up to <Col N="1226" /> Members of this House to state that the figures possibly are much higher.</P>
    <P>This legislation deals with cigarette smoking.  We are not dealing with cigars, pipes, snuff or chewing tobacco.  We can draw a distinction between certain types of cigarettes.  The medical profession know that it is the temperature at which the tobacco is inhaled that is the most aggravating factor.  The length and width of the cigarette and the amount of filter are contributory factors.  I am glad the Minister has not hidden behind the lack of statistics concerning diseases such as bronchitis, heart disease, emphysema and cancer of the lung in relation to tipped cigarettes.  Some statistics were produced years ago and while they did not prove conclusively that cigarettes caused bronchogenic carcinoma the manufacturers agreed that the evidence was so overwhelming that they had to put a warning on the cigarette packs. The warning stated that cigarette smoking could be injurious to health but did not state that it was definitely injurious. It is about time that we ignored the vested interests and said that cigarette smoking causes ill health.</P>
    <P>One compliments the Minister again on his Ard Fheis performance.  Nobody was smoking this year at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.  That is quite an achievement. Their nerves should have been at them then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the problems their manifesto was giving them.  It would be important to take a good, hard look at any intention the Minister has of instructing the health boards to ban visitors from smoking in hospital wards. He should instruct the health boards to impose an out and out ban against visitors smoking in hospitals.  When visiting hospitals one sees an ashtray perched on the patient's chest, possibly another on his knees and another on his ankles, because three people on each side are smoking cigarettes and putting them out, and the patient might have bronchitis or a heart condition.  I was in hospital a few years ago and three people would line up on each side of the bed. I was off smoking at the time.  They <Col N="1227" /> would be blowing smoke into my face.  I could not wait for the visiting hour to finish.  Eventually I got the porter to buy me the biggest cigar he could get and the next time they came in I was fully prepared and blew black, dirty smoke back at them.  But this was no good for the other patients in the public ward at that time.</P>
      <P>Smoking should be forbidden in our hospital wards.  If a patient is not well enough to get out of bed to go to the toilet or to a smoking area in the hospital for a smoke, he might be discouraged from smoking altogether.  From a professional point of view the ideal time to encourage a person to give up smoking is when that person is a patient in hospital. All the circumstances are right.  The sedatives and so on are there, plus the fact that the patient will see around him in the wards those suffering the ill-effects of cigarette smoking.</P>
      <P>On another occasion in hospital a fellow in the ward smoked right through the night until 5 or 6 a.m.  He chain-smoked. Although certain notices were put up in the lifts and around the hospital wards they were not adhered to. This can be very annoying and upsetting for the patients and their relatives.  I would like the Minister to give direct attention to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Smoking should be curtailed in cinemas and other places, just as it is in libraries.  People of our generation were never allowed to smoke in libraries even though we used them quite a lot as students. Smoking could be discouraged in pubs and bingo halls.  The Minister does not like taking a hard line on this, but he could discourage smoking in public places.  It is generally recognised that smoking in the business and academic world renders a person 5 per cent deficient in ability.  An athlete is rendered 5 per cent deficient, as is an academic, a business executive or a managing director. That very small margin of 2 or 3 per cent deficiency can mean a lot when one considers that such a small percentage is necessary to be successful in life.  These are all facts we learned in college as students, but they never seemed apparent to the public.  The more one talks to the public about it the more one regrets <Col N="1228" /> some of the vacuums that exist in our overall educational process.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of some form of bonus or recognition for non-smokers.  One has recognition for being a smoker, but non-smokers have no recognition.  Possibly some form of aid or grant could be introduced. A lot of people come to my private surgery asking for help to give up smoking.  If it was as easy as that most people smoking nowadays would not be smoking.  The Department should launch a campaign showing what aids there are.</P>
    <P>As regards the effect that this Bill might have in curtailing the promotion of sporting activities here, particularly in the field of boxing, golf, soccer and tennis, smoking advertising has indeed eaten its way into the promotion of major sporting events.  I never thought I would see the day that Landsdowne Road would have to accept advertisements in order to remain financially viable and to able to expand to cater for the number of people going there, but that is the way it is.  Most of the other advertisements there are by the banking groups, and that is not good for one's nerves.  You will probably smoke a little more if smoking is advertised heavily, but if you are in the red in the bank you might end up chain-smoking at a football match when you see all the different banks there are.  There would be need to replace in some way the money spent by tobacco companies in the promotion of sport.  I heard only the other day that Carrolls are going to withdraw their sponsorship from the GAA All-Stars for next year.  How true that is I do not know, but it would appear that some of the tobacco companies are beginning to co-operate with the Minister.  None of this legislation will be necessary if the tobacco companies co-operate.  Recently I was on a tour of the port and docks as a guest of the Port and Docks Board, and a warehouse there has sufficient tobacco to keep everyone going for the best part of half a decade.  It must be the most valuable square footage of commodity in this country.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring briefly again to the television radio, newspapers, billboards and personal sales promotion of cigarettes.  I hope the <Col N="1229" /> manufacturers will co-operate with the Minister.  It is unfortunate that this Bill has to be introduced but it is very necessary. We only have to look at the effect which hardening of the arteries has on a vast number of people in our society.  It affects more elderly people than anybody else.  Those people are a great problem at the moment with regard to identification and back-up services.  It is believed that cigarette smoking is a contributory factor to hardening of the arteries.  There are many people also in the 40 to 50 age group who have had strokes, which it is now believed have been brought about by excessive cigarette smoking.  Cigarette smoking in early life may be described as a dirty habit but later on in life it becomes very expensive on people's systems and also on the resources of the State.</P>
    <P>We have been told one day's fog in the Manchester area results in 10,000 deaths from bronchitis and emphysema. The Minister in this Bill is attacking the source of injury to our community which can be eradicated to a large extent. He deserves our full support for doing this.  It was only when a member of the British Royal family in the early part of the century died that any attention was paid to the injurious side affects which cigarette smoking can have.  More attention is now paid to this by the medical profession.  Before that it was very fashionable to be a cigarette smoker.  When the suffragettes broke the barrier and started to smoke on the streets ladies became subject to the ill-effects of cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not attempted to break down the figures he presented us with into sex distribution.  There is a sex differentiation here and if the Minister concentrated on that the figures would be far higher for male smokers than for females.  We are told that females are protected from certain illnesses up to a certain age.  I hope the British Department of Health will be consulted and that the World Health Organisation will be informed of the steps taken by the Government to attempt to eradicate the sale of tobacco.  A careful monitoring of sales and consumption should take place as this legislation is introduced to see if it <Col N="1230" /> has any effect.  If it has we should try to quantify what that effect is.  We should report to the World Health Organisation on the results we have noticed.  We should try to monitor the number of admissions to hospitals which directly result from cigarette smoking to see if those have dropped.  We should try to monitor birth anomalies which can occur and see if those are affected by this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am sure it will take about ten years to see if this Bill is effective.  At the end of that time the then Minister for Health should come back with stronger and more effective legislation.  If cigarette advertising by Irish manufactures ceases as a result of this legislation but it does not stop manufacturers outside the country from advertising on our television screens we can take a hard look at the matter and report to the proper authorities.  Many of us thought when we entered the EEC that they would have taken the initiative in this regard and directed member states to bring in uniform regulations because the problem in regard to cigarette smoking is the same in all those countries.  We welcome the discouragement of cigarette smoking and advertising as well as sales to juveniles.  We wish the Minister every success and we look forward to hearing what effect this legislation will have if a monitoring service is to be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution on this Bill will be relatively short.  I have been in the House since 1951 and we have had more discussion during the past few weeks on the scourge of smoking than in all the years from 1951 to 1978.  I am amazed that former Ministers for Health did not bring this scourge to our notice.  Since this Bill was introduced we have listened to all the members of the medical profession who are in the House condemning smoking. The Minister for Health started this campaign against cigarette smoking.  I believe he used to have a few puffs but during the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, when this no smoking rule was brought forward by the Minister we read how the Taoiseach and others had to move out into the corridor to have their puffs.  I <Col N="1231" /> understand that was the foundation stone of this measure.  Lay Members of the House cannot take issue with Deputies like Dr. Byrne, who is qualified to speak on this subject.  I wonder if they are over-emphasising the issue.  If it is such a scourge, why did more members of the medical profession not bring the matter to our attention before now? Many people believe that smoking has an advantageous effect in that it helps them to relax.  I cannot contradict the medical profession when they say that smoking affects health but I believe that the pills of one kind or another being prescribed by the medical profession as a substitution for smoking are a greater scourge.</P>
      <P>When I was a young fellow few people went about their daily business carrying boxes of pills in their pockets but it is not at all unusual today.  We know from the hefty returns of the health boards that there has been an alarming increase in the use of this type of medication.  Do the members of the medical profession think it advisable for a man to smoke whenever he feels like doing so or do they think it would be better for him to take a few pills instead? I am availing of this opportunity to bring this new factor in our life to the attention of the House.  As a layman I believe that these tablets are unnecessary in most cases.  I know many people who take yellow pills in the morning, blue ones in the afternoon and white ones at night and all these pills have been prescribed in order to help them.  Having made some inquiries I discovered that the pills were not prescribed to cure the scourge of smoking.  I believe that a great amount of public money is wasted on the provision of pills for people who do not need them.  I also believe that the taking of pills is a greater scourge than the smoking of tobacco.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne and other speakers mentioned the desirability of prohibiting smoking in public places.  Neither Deputy Byrne nor any other Member of the House has the right to say that people must not smoke in certain places.  It may be all right to ban smoking at large gatherings such as football matches or in confined areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> Another aspect of this Bill to which I have taken exception is the free advice from the medical profession to hospital matrons and supervisors to prohibit smoking in hospital wards.  I agree that visitors should not be allowed to smoke in hospital wards.  However, the smoking of pipes and cigarettes benefits many patients as it would be difficult for them to stop smoking at short notice.  I cannot see any justification for this House to pass legislation prohibiting hospital patients smoking.  The Minister may say that he has not that in mind, that the main reason for the Bill is to ban tobacco advertising.</P>
    <P>I am sure that few people read the Dáil debates, but those who read the reports of our proceedings in the newspapers will be terrified if what some Deputies have said is correct.  There is evidence that non-smokers suffer from chest ailments such as bronchitis and asthma and that they often suffer from heart disease.  A great deal has been said on this subject by the medical profession and I believe that they should elaborate more for the benefit of the public.  Do they differentiate between the different types of cigarettes and pipe-smoking or is their condemnation global?  Do they believe that those who smoke in public do harm to others?</P>
    <P>I have indicated that I think that is overstated because if it was so bad and if the position was as outlined by so many speakers, particularly by the medical men, we should all be indicated for not dealing with this matter down through the years.  I know that doctors advise people to stop or curtail their smoking habits.  That advice is right and it is then up to people either to agree with that advice or take their own course.  I disagree with some of the assertions made in this debate that smoking should be prohibited in public places.  I emphasise again that I should like more information. I know the Minister is not a medical man, although one could use the term in respect of him that he is a jack of all trades, and I do not say that in any derogatory way.  The Health Estimate might be a more appropriate occasion but this matter is deemed to be a health matter and if there is any medical man left in the debate I should like him to address <Col N="1233" /> himself to the merits of smoking versus pills.  Recently, there was some talk about a particular pill but as far as I can judge all kinds of pills are now being provided.  While possibly I would agree with the comments made here by some speakers that smoking, particularly cigarette smoking, can be harmful to health and that possibly there is an obligation on the Minister to bring the matter before the public, as has been done already as regards notices on cigarette packets, I believe that the case made for this measure is overstated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to follow Deputy Murphy because I share some of the reservations he has expressed.  I do not fully share the enthusiasm of some of my own colleagues for the Bill.  In this country, as elsewhere, there is a history of resurgence when it is sought to suppress anything.  There are many examples of that in Ireland and in other par s of Europe.  The effort to suppress something is very often a lifeline for the particular cause or thing.  That is the first reason I do not share the enthusiasm of the Minister and some Deputies about the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I am not enthusiastic, not because I do not think smoking is harmful&mdash;it is and should be discouraged and everybody would be better off smoking less or perhaps not at all&mdash;but because I have heard arguments in this debate and outside the House related to cigarette advertising standards which apply generally to advertising.  I think it was Deputy Woods who in the last hour or so&mdash; and Deputy Byrne&mdash;spoke about the sailing boat and the cigarette.  That type of thing is done with bars of chocolate and with almost everything.  This misuse of advertising is not just confined to tobacco.  There are political figures in the country, not least the Minister himself, who are excellent at advertising.  There is certainly a problem about general advertising standards.  The things I see on television and in newspapers and magazines glamourised by beautiful women and good looking men in different combinations of scenes are not confined to cigarette and tobacco advertising. <Col N="1234" /> Those who put forward arguments against glamourising tobacco should also talk about the glamourising of other commodities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases cigarettes do harm especially in cases of excess use but excessive eating of chocolate also does much harm, although admittedly not on the same scale.  But my point is that glamourising products is not confined to tobacco; it is general.  Perhaps what we should be discussing here today is an advertising standards Bill.  There is general glamourising of everything so that in most cases the presentation bears no relationship to reality.  It is a pity that tobacco advertising should be singled out because I do not think it would make a bit of difference to the amount of cigarettes smoked.  In fact it could increase the amount of tobacco smoked in accordance with what I said earlier, the belief that what is repressed must be exciting and interesting.  I put that forward as a serious contribution.  It will also have the disadvantage, I think, of depriving many good causes, including sport &mdash;although I admit there is somewhat of a conflict&mdash;of support if the Minister uses these powers to have regulations, as he said he would, to deprive sporting and other worth-while organisations of very valuable sponsorship.  Perhaps that will be the sole outcome of this Bill. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider whether he wants a Bill whose only value will be to deprive sporting and other worthy organisations of very important sponsorship.  The fact is that without much of the sponsorship that sports get we would be in a very poor way in regard to sport.</P>

      <P>I want to talk now about the effect or lack of effect of this Bill on Exchequer receipts.  Obviously this would be of great concern to the Government before approving the Bill, because Governments here and elsewhere depend so heavily on revenue from the duty on tobacco.  I should like the Minister to tell me what is the estimated effect on Exchequer receipts in the next 12 months and the following 12 months.  This Bill will not cost the Exchequer one penny. The Minister knows and the Government know it will not affect the consumption of tobacco.  It is just political window-dressing.  Earlier I talked about advertising standards and the ability of advertising agencies and politicians to advertise themselves.  The Minister is the arch-exponent of doing everything that costs nothing.  Since he became Minister, he has done nothing which cost anything.  This is a case in point.</P>

      <P>The Bill is an exercise in political window-dressing.  It will not have any effect on the consumption of tobacco and, what is more important for the Government, it will not have any effect on the revenue which tobacco consumption has been bringing in.  When he is replying I should like the Minister to tell the House what will be the effect on revenue in the next 12 months or the 12 months following that, on the assumption that there will not be further increases in duty.  I will be shattered and shocked if the Minister can tell me that it is expected there will be a reduction in revenue because of this Bill.  I want to expose the Minister and the Bill, and I want to repeat two things: I have no vested interest whatever in any tobacco company and I have not consulted anybody and I have not acted on behalf of anybody but myself.  Second, I believe tobacco smoking to be injurious to health and that it should be discouraged as far as is possible.  However, I will not tolerate window-dressing, and that is what this Bill is about.</P>

      <P>It is all the same to me.  The Bill has had a mixed reception in the House, on the one hand from those who think it does not go far enough, and from those who for <Col N="1241" /> some reason best known to themselves saw fit to oppose its introduction altogether.  Perhaps the fact that a number of Deputies have contributed to the debate is encouraging because it indicates an interest in the House in the problem of cigarette smoking and the need, or otherwise, to do something about the encouragement of cigarette smoking by advertising.</P>
      <P>It is important that I should clear up some misunderstanding about the Bill which seems to have arisen in the House and outside.  Perhaps I contributed to that misunderstanding myself in an endeavour to be helpful to the House, and I want to make a clear distinction between what the Bill provides for, the powers which the Bill confers on the Minister for Health, and what I indicated I intend to do by way of implementation. They are separate things, and I want to re-emphasise that the Bill is very comprehensive in the powers it confers on the Minister for Health.  It gives him complete, absolute power at his discretion to deal with this problem of the promotion and advertising of tobacco products.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne was totally erroneous in his understanding of the situation in that regard.  He seems to be confused about what I said of my proposals to implement the Bill and what is actually in the Bill.  There is no doubt that under this legislation any Minister for Health can do almost anything he wants to control, regulate or prohibit the advertising and promotion of the sale of tobacco products.  Whether any Minister for Health would wish to avail of these powers to the full or not at all is entirely a matter for the judgment and the discretion of the Minister for Health of the day.  All I am doing, what the House will be doing in this legislation, is giving to me or to any future Minister for Health the complete power to control this situation if he should wish to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the Bill I thought it would be helpful to the House if I went on to give some brief outline of how I intend to implement the provisions of the Bill because, as some Deputies have pointed out, the Bill is simply a basis, a framework.  What will be important and <Col N="1242" /> significant in regard to the Bill will be the regulations which can be made under it, and I wanted to outline for the House the sort of regulations I intend to make.  I am afraid that has got a bit confused. Let us be clear that as far as the legislation is concerned it gives comprehensive and adequate powers to me or any other Minister for Health to do what the situation may demand.</P>
    <P>In an effort to deny me credit for having brought in the legislation Deputy Browne looked around and suggested that perhaps we were being compelled by the EEC to bring in this legislation.  I assure the House that is not so.  I wish it were so; I wish the EEC were as forward-looking and progressive in this area as they are in many others.  They simply are not.  There are only faint stirrings at community level as yet about the problem of tobacco advertising and promotion.  Preliminary studies and surveys are being carried out, possibly with a view to taking future action, but I am afraid that any action by the Community is not likely to be immediate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne therefore must deprive himself of the little consolation that perhaps this Government do not deserve credit for bringing in this legislation&mdash;that they were forced to do so by the EEC.  It is simply not true, but it is true that when the House has passed this legislation the Irish Minister for Health will be in a fortunate position among his colleagues in Europe in that the Irish Minister for Health will not have any problem about implementing any provisions the EEC decide to bring in, through this legislation.  He will be in a much happier and more fortunate position in that respect than most of his European colleagues.  To that extent this Bill is looking ahead and providing us with a readymade machine, an instrument to implement any decisions or directives which the Community may bring forward in this area.  I do not think we need wait for the Community. The problem is serious and urgent enough for us to go ahead and act now.</P>
    <P>I should now like to return to a statement I made when introducing the Bill, that this legislation should be set against the background of our general health policy.  As Deputies are aware, an important <Col N="1243" /> part of our current health policy is a programme of positive health-preventive medicine.  We are endeavouring to build up side by side with the curative structure in our health services a preventive structure.  We are trying to develop programmes and policies designed to ensure that people do not become ill and that healthy people stay healthy.  This is a significant and important element of that policy.  We cannot have any credibility trying to propound or implement a programme of positive health if we are attempting to do that in an atmosphere and environment which is saturated with advertising for alcohol and tobacco.  Those things are contradictory. It is essential on the broad issue that we take power to control the scope, the form and the content of tobacco advertising in the community from the point of view of the importance of tobacco and also as something which is part of a much broader approach, that is a programme of positive health.  I do not think that the arguments against cigarette smoking need be reiterated.</P>
    <P>With one or two minor unimportant exceptions the House generally accepts that the arguments against cigarette smoking are overwhelmingly medically established.  Only a fool or a knave would attempt at this stage to suggest that the elimination of cigarette smoking from our community is not a desirable objective if it could be achieved.  I gave some very conservative figures in my introductory remarks when I told the House that in 1975 at least 2,000 of our citizens died earlier than they should have because they smoked cigarettes.  I told the House that 2,000 deaths in 1975 were directly attributed to cigarette smoking.  That is the minimum figure and, as Deputy Byrne pointed out, it is probably much greater.  When one compares that with, for instance, the number of people killed on our roads surely if there is anything we can do, if there is any activity open to us which would help to curb cigarette smoking, we should engage in it.</P>
    <P>No matter what anybody says, advertising, skilful promotion and sponsorship directly contribute to cigarette smoking. It is idle, useless, silly and nonsensical to <Col N="1244" /> suggest otherwise.  The very shrewd commercial people who run our tobacco companies do not spend millions of pounds on advertising, promotion and sponsorship to no avail.  They know they will get a return for that money.  They are commercial people and any money they spend on advertising or promotion must show a return.  That is the conclusive argument in favour of controlling promotion, advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of sponsorship, a matter which has attracted more attention in this debate than anything else.  We must recognise that sponsorship is advertising in another form.  A tobacco company, a drink company or any other company promotes a sporting event because they want to avail of that sporting event, of the people attending it and the people watching it, to promote their product. They use it as another occasion for the promotion of their product, to advance sales or to promote goodwill for their company&mdash;another way of promoting sales of their product.  We should be absolutely clear on this matter.  This sort of artificial demarcation we are making in our own minds between sponsorship and advertising is unreal.  They are the same thing; they are just two different mechanisms for achieving the same end.</P>
    <P>There may be some executive or other in the cigarette-tobacco world who favours a particular sport and would like to encourage it.  He may be altruistic in his approach but that is not the rule.  The reason for sponsorship is to promote the sale of a product and to avail of the opportunity to do that.  The reason is that the tobacco and drink companies by and large do not sponsor small remote sports meetings.  They go for the big spectacular occasion, the big golf tournament which they know will be on television. There are many people connected with sports and athletics who deplore this modern tendency towards sponsorship. It is their view that in the long run it is bad for most sports because it concentrates all the attention on one big great spectacle every year and ignores the normal routine of the sport.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health I am as anxious to ensure the promotion of sport as <Col N="1245" /> anybody else.  It is vitally important to me that there should be a high level of participation in athletics and sporting activities here.  I have no concern about that but I know that many people who know the scene well decry this modern reliance by some sports on sponsorship. What is important about sport is getting the maximum number of people to compete, not assembling thousands of people to look at one spectacle a year as sponsorship does.  Except on rare occasions tobacco and alcoholic drink sponsorship of sporting events concentrates on one big spectator event.  If one is only interested in sport as such there are grave doubts about the value of sponsorship and whether in the long run it is for the benefit of any sport.</P>
    <P>Setting that aside, I feel that some sporting organisations have come to rely on sponsorship in recent times and I would not wish, and I do not believe any Member would wish, seriously to disrupt the level of activity as it is at present.  I should like to mention that the level of funds being poured into sports sponsorship here by the tobacco firms or companies involved in the brewing of alcoholic drink is not as vast as some Members imagine.  In fact, it is not all that significant.  If one takes out some of the major spectator events which are of no benefit whatever to the ordinary sportsman from the scene, then the amount of money devoted to the sponsorship of sport is small.  I do not think it is something that any Member need be unduly concerned with.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to make some sort of a sensible and reasonable approach to the situation I intend to permit most of the existing sponsorships to continue for the present.  We will certainly control the input of advertising of the particular product at the sponsored event.  That is an important aspect.  It is the extent to which a sporting event is used to promote and advertise a particular product that is important.  For the present at any rate we propose to permit most of the existing sponsorships to continue. There seems to be a sort of blind myopia on the part of some sporting organisations, sports writers and Deputies, that the only people who can <Col N="1246" /> sponsor sporting events here are the tobacco companies.  There are plenty of other commercial concerns who are quite anxious to take up sponsorships. Even if all the tobacco companies were to back out of all the sponsorships tomorrow morning there would be other comparatively wealthy organisations ready to step in.  No sporting organisation who feel they should not in future accept sponsorship from a tobacco company will have any great difficulty finding an alternative source of sponsorship. It just happens that because of the way the situation developed, to which Deputy Byrne drew attention, and because of the keen and highly developed selling techniques of the tobacco companies they were probably more alert and quicker to realise the advantages of sponsorship than other commercial firms and therefore they monopolised that field to some extent. Also, because tobacco companies are dealing in a product which is an addiction product, their profits are considerably in excess of profits in other areas and they therefore have more money to put into advertising and sponsorship generally.  It would be wrong for anybody in the sporting world to despair because of a restriction on the sponsorship of sporting events by the tobacco companies.  There are plenty of other commercial firms quite ready to take up sponsorships if they are made available to them.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I gave some indication as to how I propose to proceed with the implementation of this legislation.  It will be done by regulations, which will be laid before the House and which are capable of being annulled by the usual procedures.  The Opposition have no genuine grounds for complaint in that regard.  They will be fully aware of what is in the regulations and they will have an opportunity to ask the House to reject them if they wish.</P>

      <P>In this connection Deputy O'Toole made a very valid point by asking me if I could give any indication as to how somebody could give up cigarette smoking. Unfortunately, we cannot do a great deal at this stage.  It is largely a matter for the individual concerned.  A report of the World Health Organisation expert committee on smoking and its effects on health says, in page 63, that:</P>
      <P>At the present time extensive behavioural research is going on into the process whereby people stop smoking, the factors that contribute to behavioural change, and how those factors interact (92-94).  Although this research is far from complete, it is clear that the process of giving up smoking begins with the simple awareness of the dangers of smoking and proceeds through a more thorough perception of and concern with the threat posed by smoking, requiring some kind of conscious decision-making in an attempt to change.  Success in stopping smoking requires both an immediate decision to give it up (short term success) and a continued determination not to resume (long term success).</P>
      <P>I am not sure that that adds a great deal to the Deputy's knowledge of the situation but it is an indication that the World Health Organisation is looking at the problem.  There are also a number of other publications on this subject. Deputy O'Toole asked for what advice I could give to somebody who wished to give up cigarette smoking and I might mention my experience in that regard.</P>

If people realise that it is fatal they will be motivated to try and stop. The next step is to encourage them to consult a physician.  Increasingly the medical profession are aware of the dangers of smoking and general practitioners would be in a position to give help, advice and encouragement.  There are different techniques, and I suppose a technique which works for one person will not work for another, but the basic thing common to all techniques should be a realisation of the reality of what cigarette smoking does to a person. From that realisation would come the motivation which would suggest some technique.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies mentioned the question of the revenue from the sale of tobacco products.  This Government have no particular concern in that regard.  It would be an interesting equation for some health economist or statistician to work out whether or not if all the revenue which accrues from the taxation of tobacco products, which at the moment is about £90 million a year, were to disappear because of a complete cessation of smoking, we would reap a corresponding benefit in the area of health expenditure.  We probably would, but the cause and the effect would not be direct enough to become a matter of practical politics.  The cost of cigarette and tobacco smoking to our health services is enormous.  I gave a tentative estimate of about £45 million a year in relation to direct costs.  That is half way towards the income from the taxation of tobacco products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that the Minister for Finance in particular and the Government in general were not prepared to allow stand in the way of this legislation any possibility of a diminution <Col N="1249" /> of revenue if it were demonstrable that it could contribute to the better health and welfare of our people.  That is a good and sound decision on the part of the Government.  A Minister for Finance could be shortsighted about a matter like this and could oppose any attempt to curtail the sale and promotion of tobacco products, but it would be irresponsible to act in that way.  It is understandable, though, that a Minister for Finance would be tempted to take that attitude, but this Minister for Finance has not acted in that way. Clearly, he recognises that if this legislation can contribute to the better health and welfare of the people it is worth any fall in revenue that may result.  I could not possibly attempt to qualify what might be that fall or even to say whether there would be any fall, but I should hope that at least there would be a stabilising in revenue, indicating an overall reduction in smoking.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance recognises also the importance of health education. Most Deputies know that it is not very easy to persuade a Minister for Finance to increase a budget readily, but our Minister for Finance agreed unhesitatingly to an increase last year in the budget of the Health Education Bureau, bringing their budget to £1 million. Again, that is indicative of the general attitude of the Government to these questions.</P>
    <P>Regarding the positive implementation of the legislation, it is my intention as I have said already, to proceed on a number of fronts simultaneously.  The most urgent problem is to have put out of the way the saturation type of outdoor advertising, because this form of advertising has a significant effect on the situation.  Regardless of which area a person is walking in or driving through he is confronted with these quite attractive and appealing outdoor signs and advertisements for tobacco products.  I propose to phase these out as quickly as possible and to prohibit immediately all advertising in cinemas for tobacco products and to proceed then to control the volume and the content of advertising of these products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> I do not think that Deputies have been giving enough attention to this aspect of my remarks.  These are two important aspects of the same question.  First, we must restrict the total volume of money spent on advertising and, secondly, we must control and regulate the advertising. Deputies will be aware that much of the advertising of tobacco products in our newspapers is of a very compelling and seductive nature.  The advertisements are very striking and attractive, but we intend to control rigorously the contents of the advertising.  In that connection I shall be looking at the format of the health warning on packets of cigarettes.  The wording needs to be strengthened and made more prominent. The regulation will impose fairly strict control on what may be put into any advertisement.  In addition we will control the overall volume of the money that may be spent on advertising.</P>
    <P>There are other steps with which we hope to be able to proceed on a voluntary basis.  I have mentioned that we are hoping to persuade various bodies and institutions to introduce no-smoking zones and areas.  Some progress has been made in that direction but not enough.  Those Deputies who travel frequently to and from the Continent will have noticed in many places&mdash;for instance in departmental stores and supermarkets&mdash;that smoking is prohibited. Slowly but surely we must increase here by persuasion&mdash;I do not intend attempting compulsory powers in this respect at present&mdash;the areas and places in which smoking is not acceptable.  I am sure Deputies will recall that not too long ago there were smoking rooms at railway stations, so that rather than smoking in any place in the area of the station one went to those rooms.  We must endeavour to bring about a situation again where in general smoking will not be inflicted by smokers on non-smokers and that smokers will be restricted to certain areas.</P>
    <P>That brings me to my final point, and this is related again to the question of a general programme of positive health.  I might digress here for a moment to say that the attitude of some of the Deputies in the Opposition intrigues me in this regard, especially the point of view expressed <Col N="1251" /> rather lugubriously by Deputy Mitchell when he was accusing me and attacking me as Minister for Health in respect of taking steps that were not costing any money.  Some other Deputies made the same point.  They indicated that I was engaging in activities designed to benefit the health of the community which were not costing the taxpayer any money.  To those Deputies that situation was a cause for concern. In other words, they seemed to be under the impression that unless something costs the taxpayer money it is not of any value and should not be engaged in.  I would have thought that any Deputy with common sense would agree that, if we could improve the health of our people while not incurring any cost for the taxpayer, we should do so and that the gain would be an all-round one. However, perhaps those Deputies concerned will clear their minds on this point.  Are they convinced that, unless money is being spent and perhaps even wasted, nothing can be achieved and that it is wrong to bring about some improvement in general health and welfare if there is not involved taxpayers' money?  That would be an extraordinary point of view but it may be the Fine Gael point of view.  If I am correct in this assumption I should like the Deputies to explain better what they are complaining of.</P>
    <P>One of the major ambitions and objectives of our health policy today must be to endeavour to make improvements that do not cost a great deal of money.  If we can do that by promoting positive health, by preventive medicine and by keeping out of hospital people who need not be sick in the first place, surely we are effecting ultimate benefit for all our citizens.  The greater number of people we can succeed in keeping healthy, the more resources we will have to spend on those who really need attention.  This principle seems to me to be so absolutely clear-cut and fundamental that I find it difficult to understand the reason for any argument.  We must do everything possible at every level to promote positive health, to activate people into looking after their health, into keeping fit and well, into engaging in good physical exercise, <Col N="1252" /> into being careful and sensible about their diet, into being moderate in their drinking habits and, if possible, into cutting out smoking.  The more success we have in these matters, the better it will be for every member of the community. That should be one of the main thrusts of our health policy now and increasingly in the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to see our national radio and television network playing a much greater part in this area.  The power of radio and television today is very great, and can have enormous influence for good or otherwise.  This is one area where the national radio and television service has a wonderful opportunity to perform a public service.  The scope for sensible, well produced, attractive programmes on health on radio and television is enormous.  This could be very good television and radio because most people are interested in their health, want to know more about it and would like to know how they can improve and maintain good health.</P>
    <P>We have been in discussion with the RTE Authority with a view to seeing what can be done in this area.  We have found a very helpful and co-operative attitude there.  I would like to express a wish that this can be brought to fruition because this is an area where RTE and the Department of Health can combine to achieve something worth while and significant for the benefit and welfare of the people.  It is said that the potential for dissemination of knowledge and understanding about health matters on radio and television is infinite.  I hope we will be able very soon to bring these discussions to a successful conclusion and be able to actually get worth-while programmes on the air and on our screens.</P>
    <P>I hope I have replied in some measure to most of the points raised on Second Reading.  I am glad to note that a number of Deputies are interested in this subject.  I was disappointed in particular that Deputy N. Browne did not afford this legislation a much more enthusiastic welcome.  I acknowledge that he has been campaigning for some action in this area for a long time.  I would have thought that when some action was being undertaken he would have supported it rather than denigrated it as he did.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> I completely reject any suggestion that I am intimated or afraid to take on the tobacco companies, which he seemed to imply.  However, if I were and if there was some suggestion that I had a mighty struggle on my hands either with the tobacco companies or with my colleagues, surely any modicum of encouragement and support he could give me would be welcome?  Deputy N. Browne does not seem to see things that way.  I sometimes doubt whether he is actually concerned with the reform and improvement itself or whether he is not more concerned with preaching his particular message, and when one actually delivers the goods he is not all that interested any more and he moves on to another area.</P>

      <P>This is very important legislation which will enable us to tackle firmly, definitely and effectively this problem and to deal with it.

We have been going very carefully into that and I am reasonably satisfied they will adhere to our statutory provisions, <Col N="1254" /> whether they are distributors, manufacturers or whatever.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven Deputies, mainly Opposition Deputies, expressed their concern at the abolition of rates which they said would highlight the need for local government reorganisation.  This is one of the questions which recently followed on the abolition of domestic rates. There have been two reports&mdash;a substantial one in 1971 on local government reorganisation, and subsequently in 1973 under the Coalition Government, there was a discussion document on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1971 document on local government reorganisation was very comprehensive and went into many aspects of the effect of local government organisation on local communities and on the council and corporation areas. This is particularly important when we consider the influence on the Dublin area.  In fact the 1971 Report, on page 33, devoted a special section to a proposed new authority for the Dublin area.  The objectives were set out fairly clearly.  There was an obvious intention that local communities would be involved and consulted.  It was said that special steps might well be necessary to secure adequate machinery for consultation with all sections of the population. If&mdash;as was suggested in the Report&mdash;local functions were delegated to committees, each committee could have its own offices and staff and these could be made the focus of as many public services as possible.  It was said further that the committees could be consulted on specified matters affecting <Col N="1255" /> their areas and could co-opt representatives of local development associations and other bodies concerned with local economic, social and cultural improvements. The report spoke also of &ldquo;approved local councils&rdquo; and, on page 45, dealt with the question of area committees, committees which would have particular responsibility for localised areas within the greater corporation organisation such as we have in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>These concepts and ideas are as true today as they were in 1971.  The discussion document introduced subsequently by the Minister for Local Government in 1973 largely set aside this Report and indicated fairly clearly that the Minister considered that a large and complicated system of authorities on the lines proposed by the previous Government would not be conducive to preserving the personal and human touch that should be a characteristic of local government.  Even from the viewpoint of efficiency it was felt it would not be desirable.  That is a sufficient indication that a very substantial and comprehensive local government reorganisation document was published by Fianna Fáil in Government in 1971.  In 1973 the various suggestions, proposals and other responses that came to that document were set aside.  In fact to date nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Minister, in his approach, has made it quite clear that he intends reviewing these various reports and taking some action in the near future.  This is particularly important because there is a special problem in the city and county of Dublin in relation to the meaningfulness of local government organisation.  We have a problem of under-representation, of lack of equity with the kind of local government system that operates in the rest of the country and over-centralisation in our corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to make a positive contribution in that sense, in that if we look at the number of voters per councillor on a national average, we find that, excluding Dublin city and county, there are approximately 2,030 voters per councillor.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to appreciate that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. When time ran out that evening I had mentioned several aspects of the Minister's speech.  I had come to the conclusion that these problems at present visualised by the removal of domestic rates could be ameliorated by taking positive action at this stage, such as reducing the overall areas which come within local government.  For instance, there are five-seaters; perhaps one might consider somewhat smaller areas, four-seaters, rendering them more relevant to the local community.  I believe also people should be given a consultative status rather than an electoral or voting status in relation to local authorities.  Whereas the local organisations suggested that they be built into the structure at local level I believe that a consultative arrangement with local councils and local area groups would be very valuable.  Provided local people are given a right of audience on such a consultative basis there would be genuine involvement <Col N="1257" /> in the local government process ensuring that Deputies' fears would not be realised.  In this respect the Minister has promised early action.  I believe it cannot come soon enough for the city and county of Dublin.  I believe further that people want to be involved and that it is desirable that new policies be implemented in this area at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the Bill which gives effect to historic and decisive actions in removing rates from domestic dwellings.  As a complement to this Bill I look forward to an early review of local government reorganisation, particularly in relation to Dublin city and county because it is principally in those areas this problem exists.  I look forward also to the inclusion within such reorganisation of some means of recognition and involvement of local community organisations on a consultative basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The abolition of rates on domestic dwellings and certain other types of property was something on which all political parties in this House were agreed for a number of years past. As proof of that there were in existence for some years the waiver of rates scheme which exonerated all those of little means.  It was of considerable help in easing the burden on those unable to bear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition Government were in the process of eliminating rates.  On taking office in 1973 that Government proceeded to remove the cost of the health services from local rates and also certain housing charges.  These they made a charge on central funds.  In 1977 the Coalition Government displayed their sincerity and earnestness in regard to abolishing rates when, in that year, the Government arranged that the rate demand was reduced by one quarter and it was intended to continue that process of phasing out rates until in a year or two rates were phased out entirely.  The exercise was being done gradually and on a planned basis having due regard to all the repercussions bound to arise from such a policy and having particular <Col N="1258" /> regard to the effects on local authorities. The Fianna Fáil Government decided it would be a good vote-catching device to wipe out the balance of the rates in one fell swoop, irrespective of the consequences that would ensue.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the rates in their entirety on domestic dwellings and certain other types of property became an important feature in the now infamous manifesto.  It should have been clear to all right-thinking people that the removal of such a vast amount of money from the coffers of local authorities would have dire consequences.  The loss of this revenue would result in a loss of autonomy and independence of action, something councils enjoyed all down through the years and something which was the keystone of their foundation and their continued existence.  The strangulation of local government by ministerial decree in this Bill and the cessation of bureaucratic control are now fast becoming a <i>fait accompli</i>.  All over the State the last spark of democratic control is fast dying out and will have been successfully quenched by the time this Bill becomes law.  When this Bill becomes law local government and local democracy will be as dead as the dodo.</P>
    <P>What a previous Minister for Local Government, Deputy Robert Molloy, sought to do in respect of the reorganisation of local authorities, turning these bodies into community councils, mere talking shops, this Minister for the Environment, Deputy Sylvester Barrett, has achieved by stealth, almost surreptitiously, without public clamour or protestation.  It does not seem to have dawned on the media, or public representatives, that when this Bill is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas there will no longer be public representatives. They will merely be puppets of the Custom House.  They will not have a bob in local authority coffers to call their own.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are now being placed in pawn by the Minister for Finance and, because local authorities will no longer be in control of their own affairs, essential services will suffer. There will be a setback in such services as is evidenced by the circulars emanating from the Minister's office.  I <Col N="1259" /> refer in particular to the infamous circular H.37/8.  Housing is bound to suffer. Local patriotism, civic pride, community spirit, all these things which form such an integral part of local government, are bound to be adversely affected by this takeover by central government. It is important that one should realise exactly what this Bill proposes to do and what the implications are for our people, especially those who believe in the maintenance of freedom of action, local democracy and the right of people to govern themselves, all constituents of the real meaning of local government as it is meant to be.</P>
    <P>Central to this Bill is the provision enabling the Minister for the Environment to direct local authorities with regard to the rate which should be struck.  It is significant that this direction of the Minister for the Environment will be in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  It is reasonable to assume that the power of determining the level of local public expenditure in any local authority area will be determined in future by some faceless principal officer in the Department of Finance.  When this Bill is passed the last vestiges of local democracy will have been removed.  A secondary, but nevertheless critically important, provision is the clumsy and legislatively inept provision attempting to give to tenants in private rented furnished accommodation the benefit of the abolition of rates, an abolition which, in the normal course of events, would be received directly by the landlord.  There is an attempt also to confer on such tenants the right to certain relief but, added to that relief, is the obligation of the collection of the benefit of the abolition. That, mark you, will rest on the tenants.</P>
    <P>Two procedural measures are proposed.  The first is that local authorities be relieved of the obligation of holding special rates meetings at which formally to strike a rate.  Many of us in this House have come up through local authorities and have entered this House by dint of our sacrifice and endeavour on behalf of our people on local councils.  I have had the honour to be a member of South Tipperary County Council and Clonmel Corporation and <Col N="1260" /> almost all of its subsidiary bodies.  I have the honour to have been chairman of Tipperary South Riding County Council on many occasions and mayor of my native town, Clonmel, on many occasions also.  For all of us on the local authority the preliminary meetings before the striking of the rate were all important.  We would have not merely one meeting but very many meetings before the final rate would be struck and we would exercise our power as members of local authorities to allocate those moneys to the maintenance of the essential services for our people and to the things which they desired to make for a fuller and happier life.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the members of local authorities realise that this Minister is saying it will no longer be necessary for them to hold a rates meeting.  The implications of that must sink in very fast. The political reality is that this is one of the few reserved functions vested in members of local authorities and it is now being filched from them in this Bill. The Bill proposes to take away from the democratically elected members that right and that is why we in the Labour Party will vigorously oppose this measure.</P>
    <P>The other procedural measure is that the county or city manager is no longer obliged to provide for his local authority estimates of expenditure prior to the year in which the expenditure is to occur. In such a situation no one knows where he stands.  The implication of this is that local authority representatives will have no initiative in proposing new services, will have no say whatsoever in the provision of services to meet the needs of their people or new courses of action requiring assistance, on the grounds that the manager will be capable of arguing that no provision had been made for them in the rates.  Some faceless officials in the Custom House will decide what is best for the people of rural Ireland in the years to come.</P>
    <P>This Bill also gives the Minister the power to direct local authorities to strike a particular rate.  Heretofore local authorities, in the knowledge that they must face the people in the next local elections, struck a rate which they deemed to be essential to maintain services <Col N="1261" /> for their community and to provide for new services.  They did this honourably, courageously and generously, without fear or favour.  That right is being taken from them.  I wonder if they realise it.  Do the media realise it?  What this Bill entails has not yet come across &mdash;the destruction of power at local authority level and the undermining of the rights of the members.  If a local authority propose to strike a rate in excess of the direction of the Minister, it will be deemed, as a result of the provision of this Bill, that the rate, which is the legally binding rate upon the property owners in the area, will be the rate as directed by the Minister for the Environment and as indicated by the county or city manager.  This provision gives further substance to the charge that the Minister has, in effect, handed over total financial responsibility for local authority finance directly and immediately to the Department of Finance. We have reached dictatorship with a vengeance in this country if this Bill is to be followed through to its logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>The irresponsible manner in which a large amount of revenue has been removed from the coffers of local authorities is bound to have very grave implications.  It is now evident that this Government have struck a deadly blow against local democracy, a blow from which it will be difficult to recover.  Local government, as we know it, is a thing of the past and on all our local bodies there is a feeling of bewilderment, confusion and despair.  In the past these authorities could plan for the year ahead, very largely from their own resources.  They were aided by State grants.  From now on it will be a hand-to-mouth existence. They are now thrown on the mercy of the Minister and his Department for all the essential moneys they require and every new circular which emanates from the Custom House will add to the dilemma of our local authorities and will erode still further the last dregs of confidence and autonomy which remain.</P>
    <P>I assert that as a result of this Bill, and in particular as a result of the failure of the Minister to reassure public representatives on this vital question of finance in the running of their affairs, all our local <Col N="1262" /> authorities are now virtually in a shambles. If any member of a local authority is asked how he feels about what is going on, he will say that among the members, the officials and all concerned confusion reigns supreme.  They do not know where they stand and they look to the future with fear and trepidation.  They do not know where they stand in respect of the roads programme, the housing programme, the sanitary services programme or any other essential service. A death blow has been struck at our local authorities.  They have been pauperised by Fianna Fáil, denuded of power, respect and authority.  They must now go cap-in-hand to the Minister and his Department and they must be greateful for the small mercies they are granted and the crumbs which fall from the table of the bureaucrats in the Custom House, O'Connell Bridge House or the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>From now on the local authorities will be told what to do and if they do not conform the big stick will be used by the Minister and his Department.  All local authorities are now beholden to the Minister and his Department for essential moneys to provide the services for the people they represent.  Let no one be under any illusion about future policy.  I believe that the old adage will apply: the person who pays the piper will call the tune.  The boys in the Custom House will never allow our county and city managers or the members of our local authorities to forget that from now on, that is, until the day when life and liberty, dignity and responsibility are again restored to our local authorities.  It is the committed aim of the party for which I speak here tonight to undo what has been done in this Bill and to restore democracy to our local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has yet an opportunity to assuage the fears of local authority members, to discount what I am saying here tonight when he comes to reply to this debate.  He has the opportunity of indicating to the councils that this is but a temporary device, that in the administration of the grants system there will be liberty of action, that they are not being placed in a strait-jacket and that he will devise ways and means of enabling local authorities to provide their own <Col N="1263" /> revenue as in the past even if that has to be done by way of lottery.  I assert that grants are no substitute for local revenue and never can be.  To be able to raise revenue locally with the approval of the people who elect one is fundamental to the life and work of our local authorities. To be able to meet the needs of the people and provide the money for that purpose is the very reason for the existence of local authorities.  Take that power away and there is nothing left, nothing but puppetry.</P>
    <P>What price the community spirit? What price local patriotism?  What price local democracy when Big Brother in the Custom House rules the roost?  An allocation of money will be available to local authorities, but we all know that invariably there are strings attached to all these grants; stringent conditions always apply.  Certainly, this Bill makes it clear that local authorities will not be allowed to exceed their allocation of money for any particular year.  For local authorities to be tied to a grant for an item of expenditure in this fashion is, in ever changing circumstances, to be in an impossible position.  They have the obligation to provide for social needs and services affecting the health and welfare of people. They must try to maintain jobs and perhaps try to cope with emergency situations, as can happen from time to time.  They must do all this in the operation of the many services to which I refer.  To expect a council to operate within the strictures of £x in such circumstances is simply intolerable.</P>
    <P>The Minister must remove these shackles.  The present situation is stultifying and soul destroying.  I submit that very few would be prepared to serve their local authorities or communities in the future by reason of what is happening in this Bill.  Heretofore councils did have control over their own affairs.  I have already mentioned that they had power to strike the rate and to determine what services would be provided for in that rate.  Under section 4, which was called notice of motion, they had power to direct that certain things be done and that the money be provided for these purposes.  This was a very effective power in the hands of local authorities, <Col N="1264" /> although it was sometimes abused.  But many a good job was done under section 4, many a wrong was righted and many an essential service provided.  I want to pose the question to the Minister, and I would ask him to reply to me at the appropriate stage, as to what now is the position with regard to the use of section 4.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond can congratulate herself on having won from the Minister the undertaking to deal with the problem which she has covered in the first part of her proposal for the amendment of the Constitution Bill, the security of parents who have adopted children and who were obviously disturbed by the Court ruling that children, for reasons of defect in the law, might be taken away from them.  I must accept the Minister's assurance in that regard.  That is certainly an advance.  But it is a peculiar criticism of our legislation that that should have taken 26 years from the time of the introduction of legislation in regard to adoption.  We are trying to get it right this time.</P>
      <P>I share completely the Deputy's view on the second question of legitimacy and I will not attempt to add anything to what she said.  She made a very compelling case and I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to it.  The idea that an innocent child should be discriminated against simply because of his or her birth seems to me unthinkable, a throback to the old days of the stoning of the lady caught in sin and visiting the guilt on the unfortunate child.  I hope the Minister will accept that this anomaly in the law should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of parental rights is the <Col N="1265" /> most interesting and difficult question of all.  Clause 1 of Part II of the Schedule states:</P>
    <P>Children shall enjoy special protection, by law and other means, to enable them to develop physically, mentally, morally and spiritually to their fullest potential and in conditions of freedom and dignity.</P>
    <P>Clause 3 of Part II states:</P>
    <P>...Where, however, the welfare of the child requires it, whether by reason of the death of the parents, or by reason of their unwillingness, neglect or inability to discharge their parental duties, the State shall supply the place of the parents by appropriate means, which may include the enactment of laws....</P>
    <P>This is very interesting and possibly it is a point on which a number of us might differ to varying degrees because it comes back to the case I made last night of the difficulties in attempting to arrive at a just decision, a judgment of Solomon, in relation to the right of the unfortunate girl who has had the child and who decides that she cannot rear the child.  Undoubtedly this imposes considerable emotional stress on her.  All the States who have adoption laws have the problem of deciding how long is long enough before the prior right of the child comes into force.  In our case that period is six months and after that time the State must intervene.  The child can be taken into adoption and held permanently by the adoptive parents.  That seems to be clear and to be accepted by all and I hope the Minister will provide security for that position.</P>
    <P>In relation to the anomalous position of the child whose parents die, perhaps they may be killed in an accident, and who cannot be adopted, I cannot think of any argument against giving to this child the right to adoption and to the security of a loving home and upbringing. I accept that without question.</P>
    <P>However, I am not quite so sure about the provision in Clause 3 which refers to unwillingness, neglect or inability of parents to discharge their parental duties.  I have seen a lot of this neglect, <Col N="1266" /> as one would in medical practice particularly on the psychiatric side, and it appears to me that this brings us into very deep water, this attempt by outsiders to decide on the effect that an insecure home background is having or is likely to have on the child.  During the years I have seen many children taken into care; fortunately it is not as prevalent as it was in the past where we had enormous orphanages filled with small children.</P>
    <P>We must consider the general principle of outsiders such as social workers, psychiatrists like myself, doctors and the various appointees of the State trying to assess the relationship between a child and one or both parents where <i>prima facie</i> the general impression is that there is a broken home because of drink or some other factor that the parents might not be able to control, the insecurity of unemployment, temporary desertion and, the case I met most frequently, the mental distress of somebody who is isolated for a long period in hospital. Where do we draw the line in such a situation?  How will we make a decision that the marriage has irrevocably broken down, particularly when we do not have divorce?  In the case of the unmarried girl we decide that six months is enough but I should not think that would be enough in the case of the disturbed home.  What is enough?  Is it one, two or three years?  People can come together. They can give up drink, they can get good jobs.  Their economic circumstances can change and the home could become a stable home.  I should like to know Deputy Desmond's conclusions in relation to attempting to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>Clause 3 refers to the inability of parents to discharge their parental duties and this is an even more complicated question.  During the years we have taken up a position in relation to people who would be unable to discharge their parental duties, deciding not simply on affluence or the absence of poverty, quarrelling parents, desertion or alcoholism but on the suitability of parents in respect of their religious and political beliefs.  I had an old friend, a lady whose husband died tragically during the War of Independence and as a <Col N="1267" /> result of the appalling stress she suffered she changed her attitude completely. After the death of her husband she went what was then thought &ldquo;way out&rdquo;.  She gave up her religion and became a Marxist and Communist and all that kind of thing.  It was the decision at that time that she should not be allowed to rear her children.  That is an extraordinary case, but it illustrates the possibilities in this sort of situation.</P>
    <P>There is also the position of parents having different religions.  I have had this experience myself; after my own children were reared my wife and I agreed that we would like to adopt a child and it was decided that we were not suitable because we had different religions.  That is another situation in which the State might decide that because of a norm&mdash;political or religious&mdash;that they had established the parents could not in their view discharge their parental duties, that is bring up a child to be a good Catholic, Protestant, Communist or whatever it might be. This provision in Deputy Desmond's Bill opens up a very wide opportunity for parents.  This situation is less likely to occur than it was in years gone by, but when there were intense differences and the level of political and religious bigotry was more perfervid than it is at present these were real issues, and this kind of thing can happen again.</P>
    <P>I agree completely with the first part of her Bill and I am glad that the Minister is going to do something about it.  I hope he will also do something about the second part.  It seems such a self-evident plea for a remedy that I hope he will take her suggestion.  In relation to the third and last part, I have had young children in my care, psychopathic and terribly disturbed youngsters who had lost their parents in car accidents and who ended up in institutions instead of being allowed healing of the terrible emotional wounds of the sudden loss of their parents and who became terribly socially disturbed.  Every kind of protest, conscious and unconscious, that they could make they made.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously the child who has lost parents in an accident or by death and to bring this into the ambit of <Col N="1268" /> the magnificent provisions of adoption, because the adopted child is the wanted and usually loved child.  It is probably the best emotional ambiance for any child in society because the adoptive parents go out of their way and put themselves to trouble in order to adopt the child and to give him a happy home background, to which every child should have access.  In relation to the State deciding that a family is bad or unsuitable or that here is a broken home or a neglected child, I share the Minister's fears about trying to legislate there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak in support of this legislation.  It is legislation which has not arisen overnight and various speakers, including speakers on this side of the House, have made it clear that both the last administration, and this one to a certain extent, share responsibility for the situation with which this Bill is trying to deal.  However, the present administration are the more culpable in view of the fact that the major part of that delay has occurred under them.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals basically with three main areas: adoption, legitimacy and the very complex question of the adoption or otherwise of legitimate children.  The first point I would like to deal with is the question of adoption.  I cannot improve on the case that Deputy Desmond has made in relation to the effects of the various court cases not merely on the adoption laws themselves but on the peace of mind of the thousands of adoptive parents and on the relationships between these parents and the children they have adopted.  Deputy Desmond referred to senior counsel's opinion and stated unambiguously that this problem was so serious that it could not be resolved without a constitutional referendum. Our approach to this matter is based, at least in part, on our belief that this is the right procedure.  That is why we have introduced this Bill which is of a kind rarely introduced into this House, an amendment of the Constitution Bill designed as the preliminary to the necessary referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the Bill, however, has been impoverished by the evident lack of any adequate response from the Government <Col N="1269" /> side of the House to any of the very substantial questions that have been raised.  The most substantial one is whether a constitutional referendum is necessary.  To put it mildly, we would have been grateful to have had the Minister's thinking on this.  He referred to the necessity for legislation; unless I am mistaken, he did not refer to the necessity for a referendum.  We are entitled to be told in this debate whether the legislation that the Minister proposes to introduce will be an attempt to remedy the situation in relation to adoption by purely legislative means or whether it will be the sort of Bill that we are bringing in here now, that is the preliminary to a constitutional referendum. I speak in ignorance of the Minister's intentions and his insights in this matter but he must be aware that if he attempts to solve this problem by legislative action alone there is a substantial danger that it will not solve the problem, that it certainly will not remove the real fears of adoptive parents who have been told on the very best authority that a constitutional referendum is necessary, and it may only postpone the day when the full, adequate and proper procedure of a constitutional referendum takes place.  I shudder to think of the cumulative anxiety and worry on the part of adoptive parents, actual or intending, in such an <i>interregnum</i>.  It is almost inevitable that unless this problem is resolved satisfactorily by means of a constitutional referendum sooner or later the natural parents of some child or other may again take the matter to the High Court and Supreme Court and the Supreme Court may find in their favour.  The Government will then have to start all over again the process that we want to start now.  We want to start it now because even though the people involved are a very small minority of the people of this State, some 80,000 adoptive parents, one cannot measure the anguish and uncertainty they experience.  It is impossible to count this but we know it is real and that is why we have brought this Bill into the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech told us that the subject matter of this Bill has had extensive <Col N="1270" /> detailed consideration in his Department.  I have no doubt that it has and I have no doubt that that consideration and consultation began before the change of Government.  It is not good enough for the Minister to come in here and say that there has been 16 or 19 months' thought given by his Department, with all the technical, legal and constitutional resources at their command and decline to give the House even a fragment of the benefit of that consideration carried out at public expense. I believe that the Minister, and presumably the Government as well, are fighting shy of a constitutional referendum on this issue or on any issue.  They know very well if they take a decision to put this issue to the people in a referendum immediately there will be an attempt, no doubt by people in the House and outside the House, to widen the scope of this referendum.  There will be an attempt to say that we are having it on adoption so why do we not throw in something else, why not throw in the National University of Ireland so that we can sort out the universities problem, why not throw in the prohibition on divorce?  I believe the Government do not want the scope of any constitutional referendum to be widened.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question is that if we believe that a referendum is necessary as we believe it is and as we have the authority of senior counsel that it is necessary, the Government should not run away from this issue.  We should be told now if they believe that a referendum is necessary, and if they believe it is necessary they should hold it.  It is their business, whether or not they respond to pressures or their own internal exigencies to widen it in one direction or another, but it should certainly be held on this issue.  That is why we are introducing this Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why we are dissatisfied with the brevity of the Minister's response.  Deputy Barry Desmond suggested that it would be possible to set-up an all-party committee on the matter.  I would like to take up that point and develop it a little further.  While I do not believe that it is necessary to set up an all-party committee separate from the House on the matter it is certainly essential <Col N="1271" /> that if this Bill passes the Second Stage debate in the House that we will have to set up a special committee for the Committee Stage because it will be absolutely essential to secure, as far as possible, an all-party agreement and specifically the agreement of the Government on the exact nature of the question or questions to be presented to the people in a referendum.  The reason for this is that, although to the best of my knowledge, the Constitution states that all amendments of the Constitution have to be, first of all, passed by the Dáil and Seanad in the form of legislation and then submitted to the people by a referendum there is absolutely no way that this side of the House can insist on the Government holding the necessary referendum even if this Bill were passed in three weeks' time.  This is why we need all-party agreement on the exact nature and terminology of the questions to be presented to the people in a referendum. That is why we need a special committee on Committee Stage of this Bill to conduct their work as expeditiously as possible and I hope in the absence of party feeling.</P>
    <P>I will have to leave that point there in ignorance of whether or not there will be any further contribution from the Government side on this issue.  I must put it on the record that this side of the House are disappointed at the lack of information and response because we know that the information is there, that the opinions are there, that the evaluations have been done, that the legal opinions have been taken by all the resources of the Department of Justice and we are not being told anything about any of them.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to the second aspect of this Bill, the complex question of giving to illegitimate children the same respect in real terms, the same legal status in real terms as those children born legitimately.  This question has a very high emotional content but I am glad to say that it is being debated in this House without any untoward emotional overtones.  The phrase of the 1916 proclamation &ldquo;to cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo; has been used so often in this House that unfortunately it <Col N="1272" /> is now a cliché.  It has become time worn and almost an electoral slogan to be used by whichever side happen to think it is most to their advantage to use at any particular time.  We can apply this phrase with particular appropriateness to the subject matter of the second part of this Bill, the rights of illegitimate children.  We are not cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  We are discriminating between one type of child and another, regardless of personal circumstances, simply because of the objective fact that his biological parents may or may not be married.  I am afraid that in this we are still substantially behind the legislative position in many other countries.  In the United Kingdom, for example an Act was passed in 1969 which, at least in a limited sense, conferred on illegitimate children the same sort of property rights as their legitimate peers.  I say in a limited sense because the 1969 UK Act enacted that if the mother of an illegitimate child died without having made a will that child would be entitled to her estate as if he were her legitimate child, providing there were no other legitimate children.  One might think that this was a comparatively small advance but an advance it was and we have still to make even such a small advance along the road to equality.</P>
    <P>The House may remember that in 1974 Senators Mary Robinson, Trevor West and I introduced a Bill entitled, as far as I remember, Illegitimate Children (Maintenance and Succession) Bill.  It was a Bill which had many objects, and those in relation to the maintenance orders, proofs of paternity and so on I will not go into here, but its fundamental effect would have been to radically change the succession rights of illegitimate children.  It was accorded the privilege of a lengthy and thoughtful debate, eventually adjourned without a vote being taken.  I think the House would appreciate the benefit of some of the arguments that were made then.  At column 85, Volume 79, of the Official Report of the Seanad I said:</P>
    <P>The key matter in all this, of course, is property.  If no human beings owned property I suspect the question of illegitimacy would never <Col N="1273" /> have arisen, or if it had arisen would never have generated one-quarter or one-sixteenth of the friction that it generates today.  This is a sad but certainly recognisable fact of modern times.  Many of the highly moral attitudes towards illegitimacy are in reality no more than a transposed and transferred or concealed justification of the rights of private property.  It is a justification which is fundamentally selfish and which fundamentally works against the best interests of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>I still hold that position and I believe it is relevant to the matter being discussed to-day. If we did not have such a hang-up about property we would not be in such an emotional pickle about illegitimacy; we would not be treating illegitimate children as objects of ownership rather than as objects of affection.  I want to make one other brief reference to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not quote from debates in the other House.  I have allowed him to quote from his own speech in the other House but otherwise it is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Chair's indulgence.  I have lost the quotation so I will not be disorderly, but I feel I can, without being disorderly, tell the House that on that occasion in Seanad Éireann the then Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Lenihan, fully and warmly welcomed the principle behind that Bill.  I believed that that was a responsible position by him at that time and I cannot believe that it was taken without consultation.  We should like to see more evidence from the other side of this House that the thinking which was forcefully and unambiguously expressed in the other House at that time is still part of the thinking of the Fianna Fáil Party.  But we have no such evidence in this House tonight nor did we get it last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point that I want to make in favour of the section of this Bill dealing with illegitimate children is that it <Col N="1274" /> operates to favour a small number of children in a particular category that has not been referred to yet in this debate. These are the children who were born to parents whose marriages were nullified by our civil courts.  Children whose parents' marriages are decreed to be null and void by the law are retrospectively turned into bastards.  They are made illegitimate by an act of the court, not just by the behaviour of their parents.  As things stand at present, these children&mdash;we do not know how many there are but they are as real a problem as any other child and one cannot measure their problem&mdash;are illegitimate in the eyes of the law despite the fact that they were produced from unions which most people thought were valid marriages.  They were legitimate up to point X and suddenly they became illegitimate; they suddenly joined the ranks of those&mdash;and their numbers are increasing&mdash;who are illegitimate <i>ab initio</i>, whose illegitimacy stems not from a court decision but from the fact that their parents were not married.</P>
    <P>It the State, to put it at its mildest, is going to allow and encourage the situation in which children formerly believed to be legitimate can be made illegitimate, the very least it ought to do is to pass this legislation.  It is ironic when we think about the problems connected with the introduction of civil divorce that at least civil divorce, no matter how awkward or how unsatisfactory it may be, makes some attempt to look after the children of broken marriages.  Our civil nullity procedure renders them illegitimate and says goodbye to them.  Our civil nullity procedure has nothing to do with arrangements for the welfare of the children of the union declared null and void.</P>
    <P>The third point that I wish to touch on is whether or not children who are legitimate should have the right to be adopted.  I phrase it in that way because I do believe that some children who are legitimate do have the right to be adopted because they have the right to a stable and happy family life and are unlikely to get it in the circumstances in which they find themselves.  On one reading of our Constitution this might be possible because the Constitution, in the <Col N="1275" /> order in which it approaches the question of marriage and the family, puts the family first and marriage second.  One might have thought that the courts in their series of interpretations of this constitutional law might have taken the view that family comes first and that marriage, although normally associated with it, is not always essential.  The courts have decided that the family and the right of the family as we know them are coterminous with the rights of civil legal marriage.  In doing so they have given the partners in a civil legal marriage substantial rights over their children, even in the many cases in which these rights are exercised to the detriment of the children.</P>
    <P>It is important when we look at the question of placing children, legitimate or illegitimate, in homes which would guarantee them at least a modicum of love and affection that we think not just in terms of the child that is being placed for adoption&mdash;let us assume for the purposes of argument that we are to change this particular part of the Constitution and make it possible for legitimate children to be adopted&mdash;but of an adult to be.  We should insist on the importance of this fact because that adult to be will also, in the fullness of time, most likely be a parent, and society has a deep vested interest in knowing whether an adult to be will be a competent and adequate parent or an inadequate one. Because of that, society should take all steps at its command to ensure that we have as many as possible adults to be who are not to grow up failures or inadequate parents.</P>
    <P>Society must use each child placement, including placement where necessary of legitimate children, as an occasion for protecting future generations of children by increasing the number of adults to be who are likely to become adequate parents.  Only in this way will we break the cycle of sickness, hardship and inadequacy which is still a blight on our society today.  I fully commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party in tabling this Bill endeavoured to make it as non-political as possible. To illustrate <Col N="1276" /> the lengths to which we went to do that, it is on the record of the House that before the Summer Recess, when we were asking the Government to accept this Bill and it was being resisted by the Taoiseach, I told the Taoiseach that if there were objections to certain sections of the Bill and there was acceptance by the Government of one of its provisions&mdash;the provision correcting the position in regard to adoption orders at present&mdash;we were prepared to have that section isolated from the Bill and passed through the House either in the name of Deputy Mrs. Desmond on behalf of the Labour Party or to have it introduced in the name of the Taoiseach or the Government and we would support it. Unfortunately, that opportunity was not availed of.  Even though we endeavoured to that extent to keep this issue a non-party political issue, last night and again tonight it has been blatantly and disgracefully treated as a purely political issue by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two reasons why I have regretfully come to that conclusion.  The Minister for Justice made what I have heard some people refer to as a speech. In fact, it was a two or three minute intervention last night in an effort to get the Government's feet out of their neglect in this area when he announced that the Government would introduce legislation in the present session to deal with one aspect of the Bill&mdash;the validity of existing adoption orders.  That, I accept, is a major advance and we are extremely glad that by tabling and pursuing this Bill we got the Government to move on this aspect of the matter.  But last night, when I asked the Minister to clarify the position in regard to the other two aspects of the Bill, he claimed that he could not give details of the contents of a Bill before it went to the Cabinet.  I accept that without reservation, but the Minister can and could have indicated whether it was the intention of the Government to deal with all three aspects of child care and welfare involved in this Bill.  While the move on adoption orders is most welcome and while we are most heartened that by the proper use by the Opposition of Private Members' Time we have been able to get that move, we feel that an opportunity <Col N="1277" /> was given in the contents of this Bill in its entirety to make substantial advance regarding our society's attitude towards children.</P>
    <P>What we sought in the Bill and request Dáil Éireann to support on the Second Stage of the Bill is, first to put beyond question the validity of adoption orders made by the Adoption Board. That is an aspect of the matter that is of very considerable public concern, has evoked considerable comment and has widespread support at present by many sections of the community.  I believe it is for that reason the Minister made the brief intervention last night, to indicate that on this issue he was prepared to make some advance.</P>
    <P>The present position in regard to adoption orders is that since 1952 approximately 25,000 adoption orders have been made.  If one were to take into consideration just those directly concerned in the making of those orders you would arrive at a figure of approximately 75,000 or 80,000 people.  It goes far beyond that.  It affects directly not only the people who seek to adopt children and the children themselves, but their relations and friends.</P>
    <P>This is a very emotional issue and it has the support of tens of thousands of enlightened people throughout our society with no direct or indirect connection with adoption who realise that the 1952 Act probably brought more happiness to children than any other legislation passed through this House since the foundation of the State.  Because of a constitutional challenge to the Act, adoptive parents were placed in a nightmare world.  When the McL case was going through the courts, parents of adopted children thought: &ldquo;Could my child be taken away from me?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Most if not all of these children have never known any other home or any other parents.  While a child cannot be formally adopted until he or she is six months old, frequently a child is placed in the care of adoptive parents long before that statutory age.  I know cases where people have had adopted children in their care since they were six or seven days old.  It is very difficult for anyone to imagine the mental anguish of adoptive <Col N="1278" /> parents at even the remote possibility that the established family unit could be broken up because of some defect in the law, involving the breaking up of a relationship between child and mother, and child and father.  There is no justifiable reason I can think of why, when given the opportunity before the summer recess, the Government did not put beyond all question the validity of adoption orders which had been made.</P>
    <P>When the Adoption Bill was before this House in 1952 the climate of opinion was not as well disposed towards adoption as it is now.  Society has seen it working extremely successfully and there is now a definite and general acceptance of the benefit of that Act. When the Bill was introduced the climate was much the same with regard to adoption as it is now with regard to the legal position and social status of illegitimate children.  I do not think I can hope with any degree of optimism that the attitude of the Government will be as enlightened on illegitimacy as was the attitude of the Government who introduced the 1952 Adoption Bill.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of each and every adult in any civilised society to ensure that no harm or damage, physical or mental is inflicted on any child.  The mental damage inflicted by this society on children who are termed illegitimate is very considerable indeed.  Apart from the social attitude, the stigma of illegitimacy is reinforced by the law as it stands.  We are asking to have this stigma removed.  One would hope that, by doing so, one would be able to have a more enlightened approach to people termed illegitimate.  It is only right to say there have been considerable advances in social attitudes and social thinking towards people who are termed illegitimate. As it stands, the law discriminates against that man, woman or child.  We are asking the Government and the House on behalf of our society to remove that legal stigma if we cannot immediately remove the social stigma which may still exist in some sections of our society.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes that the question of eligibility for adoption should be re-examined and that the child of a legal marriage in certain circumstances&mdash;and <Col N="1279" /> we qualify that; we emphasise that &mdash;should be eligible for adoption.  There are children at this very moment in institutional care and the people looking after them are totally convinced there is no possibility of their married parents assuming or reassuming their responsibilities towards their children.  As the law now stands, they cannot place such children with a couple who would be prepared and anxious not only to give care and affection and love, but also to receive love and affection from them, and to create an atmosphere and a relationship which by anyone's definition is that of a genuine family.  Children who have been abandoned by married parents, children whose parents have quite obviously not lived up to their responsibilities towards them, children the courts know, when they are sending them back into parental care, that it is not in their best interests, but they are inhibited from doing anything else because of the law on parents' rights which are far outweighed by parents'responsibilities to their children, and if they do not live up to these responsibilities it is the duty of Parliament and Government in civilised societies to guarantee the interests of children.  The interests of the children must be paramount, must have priority, in any family law consideration.</P>
    <P>There are two sides in our discussions on Irish adoption law.  We have been talking about the adoptive parents, but I often wonder if the six-months limit for the child's natural mother is long enough.  Many things have to be considered. In our society still, particularly in the rural areas, the unmarried girl expecting to become a mother is subject to severe social pressures.  Such pressure, especially from her family, can be so severe that she will undergo an extremely difficult time during pregnancy, imposing great mental anguish, even if there have not been any pre-natal physical complications.  Therefore, there are still enormous social and family pressures on the unmarried mother.</P>
    <P>When that girl decides to put her child out for adoption she is taking an irrevocable step, and I question whether the present six months post-birth limit is <Col N="1280" /> sufficient.  She has to decide whether forever she will forfeit her right to custody of the child.  There have been pre- and post-natal social, financial and family pressures on her to make a decision and I submit that in many of those cases the present six months is not long enough.</P>
    <P>The right of the child's natural father must be considered as well.  As I understand the legal position of a father whose child has been born out of wedlock, he may not claim the child and rear it as his own child.  Could it not be made possible legally for a man who claims to be the father of a child born out of wedlock, and who has gone to considerable trouble to have that claim substantiated, to be given custody of his own child?  There are many cases in which such a man could give to a child not only material advantages but love and affection.</P>
    <P>In family law reform legislation we must also provide for the pressures on would-be adoptive parents.  Sometimes they are given the care of a child when it is a week old, when it has been sent out of a hospital or a nursing home.  Final adoption papers may not be completed until six months later, but the Adoption Board are so overworked&mdash;I have been told they have to travel throughout the country&mdash;that it may be ten or 12 months later before final legal adoption occurs.  In the meantime the prospective adoptive parents have had the child in their care.  They have been ticking off the days until the statutory six-month period will have elapsed, and their lives become hell in case anything may go against them.  By that time a relationship has developed between them and the child and fear becomes terror that the child may be taken away.  There is a great deal of mental anguish involved.  We should ask ourselves if six months is long enough to give a girl an opportunity to make a decision and if it is not we should make it 12 months but once the time has expired and the girl has made a decision the formal adoption order should be made.  If necessary we should establish regional or county adoption boards to deal expeditiously with adoption orders.</P>
    <P>Next year is the International Year of the Child but our attitude to our children as reflected in our legislation leaves a lot <Col N="1281" /> to be desired.  I do not believe we are a heartless people.  In fact it is my belief that we have a great affection for children.  I do not believe that Fianna Fáil members are heartless and I believe that a majority of them are genuinely concerned about the contents of our Bill. If they are genuinely concerned do they not feel that they have an individual responsibility towards the welfare of children?  For that reason do they not feel that this issue should not be one that is subject to such a party political approach that we have not heard one speaker from the Government benches in the time we have been debating this Bill?  The only contribution from the Government benches was a three minute intervention by the Minister for Justice but even that intervention was made as a PRO exercise to try to take the political heat out of something we did not wish to make a party political issue of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say will also be by way of intervention rather than by way of a speech because the case that has been made by Members who contributed is overwhelming.  I plead with the Government either to allow this Bill through or introduce their legislation as a matter of urgency.  This is an extremely urgent matter because there are many children in orphanages throughout the country who, for all sorts of wrong reasons, cannot be adopted. Some have passed the age for adoption and others are approaching it.  They will never have a secure, permanent and loving home.  The Government should act on this matter and not waste any more time.  Next year being the International Year of the Child presents us with an opportunity of having a referendum on this issue so that we can guarantee the rights of our children.  I hope the necessary Constitutional amendment is carried next year.  I beg the Government to treat this matter as urgent because the situation as it stands is totally unsatisfactory: the rights of the parent are far superior to the rights of the child and that should be corrected.  Parents after all can fend for themselves but children in such circumstances have nobody to fight for their rights.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank those who contributed to this debate. The quality of the speeches was very high and the informal contributions to this issue and to the whole question of childrens' rights has made this a worthwhile exercise.  I appreciate the welcome extended to the Bill and the general acknowledgment that the presentation of it served a useful purpose. Deputies Cluskey and Horgan commented on the dearth of speakers from the Government side on this issue and I was also disappointed that we did not have more speakers from that side of the House on the Bill.  I echo what Deputy Cluskey said, that the fact that we did not have more contributions from the Government side did not reflect the interest of individual Deputies from that side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister intervened in the debate for approximately three minutes to inform us that he would be introducing a measure to allay the real fears of adoptive parents.  He told us that this measure would be introduced during the 21 sitting days before the Christmas recess.  I welcome that announcement.  Such a measure is long overdue but I urge the Minister to ensure that the Bill becomes law before Christmas.  We will facilitate him in every way in this regard.  We did not expect the Minister to spell out in detail what he proposes to include in his Bill but it was not expecting too much of him to answer when we asked whether he proposes to cover the two areas dealt with in our Bill.  Our Bill proposes to cover the two areas of discrimination against illegitimate children and extension of categories of children who may be adopted.  In the absence of any information from the Minister in these two important areas we have no option but to press our Bill to a vote tonight.  It is not our intention to be contentious about this issue because it is something which transcends party politics but we feel the Minister should have handled this situation differently.  As Deputy O'Keeffe said, the Minister could have accepted our Bill in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister with the benefit of the expertise which is not available to us had felt that an amendment was necessary we would have been amenable if it <Col N="1283" /> covered the area we wished to cover in this Bill.  The Minister could have accepted suggestions made by Deputies Barry Desmond and Horgan that an all-party committee consider the Bill on Committee Stage, as that would be the appropriate way to deal with a Bill such as this.  The personal expertise of people like Deputy Cluskey and the professional expertise of Deputy Noel Browne, who voiced a very real concern, could be brought to bear on the measure on Committee Stage if an all-party committee were to be established.  The Minister choose not to accept the Bill in principle and not to elaborate on his proposals so we are left with no option but to press the passage of this Bill into law.</P>
    <P>The two aspects of this Bill covering the broader issue of children's rights which the Minister refused to be drawn on and where he refused to give any guarantees are very vital issues.  We aim totally to eliminate the terms &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; as they apply to children.  We might start by eliminating the legal definitions of &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; and that would go a long way towards changing attitudes which bring a lot of heart-break to the children and their parents.  The social issues raised which hinged on the question of illegitimacy were very worthwhile and if the debate served no other purpose it served a good purpose in raising these issues.</P>
    <P>The Leader of this party said tonight that the six months' period during which an unmarried mother could decide whether or not to part with her child is too short.  I agree that this might be the case and a case can also be made in the context of a debate like this that the supports given to an unmarried mother to do otherwise than part with her child are totally inadequate.  The unmarried mother is not able to make a free choice. She is forced by prejudice, by social concepts and very often by economic necessity to part with a child which she might otherwise wish to keep.  The unmarried mother should be afforded every possible opportunity to keep her child and to make a conscious decision as to what is best for the child.  This debate has raised <Col N="1284" /> issues which we will have to face very shortly.</P>
    <P>No legal discrimination should be retained in the case of children born out of wedlock.  When introducing this Bill I referred to the Succession Act and was since asked whether an amendment to that Act would meet the case.  Such an amendment would not meet the case.  I want the terminology completely changed.  If a case in relation to discrimination against the children of unmarried parents were brought to court it might stand some chance of success having regard to Article 40 of the Constitution which gives equal rights to all citizens before the law, but no such case has yet been brought because unmarried parents are the most economically depressed section of the community and are not in a position to institute any legal proceedings, especially proceedings of such a highly speculative nature.  All the legal advice available cannot guarantee that such a case would succeed and children have no separate legal representation, which is another issue we will have to face shortly.  The best way to deal with this situation is by way of a Bill such as this which proposes to write into the Constitution that equality of rights under the law shall not be denied to any child on the basis of percentage or status at birth.  This would solve the whole issue.  Neither the Minister nor any member of his party have advanced contrary arguments so it seems that this principle is generally accepted, yet the Minister simply refuses to accept the Bill.</P>
    <P>There may be small reservations in relation to the extension of the categories of children who may be adopted.  Deputy Browne instanced some reservations he had.  I accept in that, even as I have accepted in relation to the Bill generally, that the expertise available to us advises that the best way to go about this matter is in the way we propose in this Bill.  If the Minister with all the resources available to him was to bring in a measure which would cover the areas covered in this Bill I would be prepared to withdraw this Bill in favour of his Bill if a time limit and some guarantees were given.  No guarantees were given in relation to illegitimacy and the extension of <Col N="1285" /> the categories of children to be adopted. All we have is a promise, which I presume the Minister will keep, in relation to the adoption orders, that the fears of parents will be allayed this side of Christmas.  I accept that, but we hope that the measure which the Minister proposes to bring in will not be confined <Col N="1286" /> to just these points but will also cover other aspects of the question of children's rights.  In the absence of any concrete information and in the absence of any guarantees I am putting this Bill to a vote in the House tonight.</P>

      <P>Deputy M. O'Leary will have ten minutes and the Minister will have five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I would have 20 minutes but I will do my best to make a few points in ten minutes.  I raised this question because, since the technicians rejected the latest settlement terms, I hoped a discussion would lead to early action.  If negotiations do not avert it, we will have a continuation of the kind of disruption we saw earlier in the year and of further dislocation of the country's already ailing telecommunications system.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to see negotiations recommenced as early as possible between the Department and the technicians. To the best of my knowledge a request for a resumption of negotiations has come from the executive of the union concerned and I do not know what the reaction of management to that request is.  I would recommend that negotiations start as rapidly as possible, beginning by analysing the reasons for the rejection of the recent proposals.</P>
      <P>Over the past 12 months the history of the dispute in this area shows that if an impasse is allowed to continue relationships harden between management and employees.  That danger exists in this dispute.  Probably the basic cause for the continued simmering bad relations between management and staff is, as the technicians will tell anyone who discusses the problem with them, their absolute distrust of management.  That is one of the impediments to securing non-interruption of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a trusim of industrial relations that problems are intensified one thousand-fold once distrust becomes dominant in relationship between management and employees.  This distrust comes to the surface as suspicion that any provision will not be interpreted in a normal rational way.  They feel the Department will interpret it in a narrow way.  The fact that this dispute reached such enormous proportions over the last <Col N="1288" /> 12 months&mdash;for many months no meetings were held&mdash;and that this impasse was tolerated, colours the present feeling of distrust too.  Negotiations must be reopened as rapidly as possible and the reasons for the rejection inquired into. The Minister should not delay in issuing a positive response to the request of the men for talks, which should start as soon as possible at departmental council level, if that is the appropriate area.</P>
    <P>I am not privy to all the elements that went into the reasons for rejection by the technicians of the latest offer but there is no doubt that the attitude of the employees to the proposed introduction of time clocks should be discussed in these early talks.  That practice has not existed up to now and it is felt that more negotiations should have been held before that proposal was put.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials are left with a situation abetted by themselves when they publicly charged the men's representatives with division during the past year.  There is no advantage in an actual dispute situation for the person charged with the ultimate responsibility of a settlement to enter the controversial area of laying the blame on one party or the other.  The Minister committed that error earlier in this dispute.  I hope he has learned since and does not succumb to that temptation again.  The important thing is to start these discussions as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister's task is simple in objective but difficult in practice.  His objective is to get a settlement and the means to achieve it are difficult.  In discussing productivity in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs a shortage of stores, through no fault of the technicians, may affect the validity of any measurement scheme that may be finally agreed.  That point too should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Overshadowing the Department and its effectiveness is a review body set up to inquire into a possible separate organisation for telecommunications.  I suggest that that is not the great issue at present.  The real issue is: what kind of management structure should govern this Department?  There will not be very much salvation for the Department in setting up a new semi-State body under that organisation if the management <Col N="1289" /> structure remains unaltered.  I suggest that the Minister might consult with his colleague, the Minister for Labour, to see if any element of worker participation might not be suitable for introduction in this area which has been troubled with such bad industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the telecommunications system is vital to our industrial well-being.  To some extent the Minister may not have appreciated this in the early months of office&mdash;that is the only conclusion one can come to&mdash;by virtue of the feeling conveyed by him that relations in the Department should reach their own level, that they needed no particular extra consultations. He may have abandoned that idea now and appreciates the importance of maintaining a good telecommunications system, vital to our industrial well-being. The judgement of outside authorities on the competence of a country is based on the performance of its communications system.  Ours has not been performing and the major reason is that it has been starved of capital.  That is a matter for which many governments must share some blame&mdash;lack of capital investment over the years, though the administration to which I belonged reversed that trend and put solid capital investment into the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now committed to a capital bill of something like £350 million up to 1982.  I suggest to him that this figure is inadequate.  The cost of the equipment in this area needs a far greater investment.  Of course it must add to the frustration of qualified technicians that their equipment so rapidly becomes obsolete and that they are faced with an impossible task.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is important that this dispute&mdash;simmering in the Department for almost 12 months, breaking into open disruption on occasion with pickets on particular sections of the Department &mdash;be brought to an end, that these talks should commence as rapidly as possible at departmental council level and that a positive response be given to that request of the union authorities for a meeting as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Our telephone system is the worst in Europe.  The number of telephones per hundred of the population is the lowest <Col N="1290" /> in Europe, which is an indicator of our economic under-development.  Like a hole in the head, the last thing we want at present is another long dispute in the telecommunications system.  I have recommended early discussion with the union to see whether any early resolution can be found for some of the problems that have prevented settlement on this occasion.  As the Minister knows, these matters related mainly to productivity and should be discussed as quickly as possible.  The question of separate organisation of the Department is not the main issue here.  The main issue is a management one and the bad relations that exist between management and staff.  That bad relationship must be dispelled. The start is for the Department to initiate these talks so that the community is not faced with further disruption in this important national service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said in a public statement that I am most disappointed that the settlement proposals on the Irish Post Office Engineering Union's re-organisation productivity claim have been rejected in a ballot of the union membership.  The proposals contained the following significant benefits for the staff: increases in pay ranging from £4 to £20 a week, with an average increase of over £9 a week; a lump sum of £400; a commitment that the staff will share in savings arising from future productivity improvements to the extent of 80 per cent of the net savings and the creation of three new higher grades and improved promotion opportunities generally.  In return the staff would be asked to co-operate fully in specific productivity measures and to continue to co-operate in other measures which would lead to higher productivity and improved service to the public.  The union's claim is still before the Departmental Conciliation Council and I assume the union will be reporting back to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should like to make some comments on the background to the matter for the information of the House. Deputies will remember that, when I assumed office in July last year, I found <Col N="1291" /> that the engineering staff were taking industrial action and that they had earlier taken industrial action in each of the two preceding years, 1976 and 1975.  The origin of the problem went back to 1972 when a claim for re-organisation of engineering grades in the Department involving higher pay was made.  It proved extremely difficult to end the industrial action despite the intervention both of the Employer-Labour Conference and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. However, immediately the industrial action ended in May last, negotiations on the Union's re-organisation claim were resumed at the Departmental Conciliation Council under the chairmanship of an independent mediator nominated by the chairman of the Labour Court.  In concentrated negotiations over the following three months proposals for a resolution of the claim were formulated. The Department made a number of offers but, while agreement was reached on many aspects of the proposed productivity scheme, it did not prove possible to reach agreement on the money terms.  In the circumstances both sides agreed that the outstanding issues should be referred for recommendation to a third party nominated by the Steering Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference.  I accepted the third party recommendations and the draft agreement was put to a ballot of members by the Union Executive with a recommendation for acceptance.  I think Deputies will accept that the fact that the Union Executive recommended the proposals to their members is the clearest possible confirmation that those proposals were reasonable and serious and contained benefits for the staff commensurate with what was required of them.  This is apart altogether from the fact that the money terms had been independently adjudicated upon.  The proposals would have enabled me also to press ahead with the improvement of the telecommunications service, which is so necessary. However the union's claim is still before the Departmental Conciliation Council and, in the circumstances, I do not propose to comment further at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies may be interested also in the various steps I have taken since assuming office to improve staff-management relations in the Department.  One of the areas about which discontent was expressed during the industrial troubles was the Department's staff rules and regulations. Therefore I arranged last May to have an examination undertaken of these jointly by the unions and the Department under the chairmanship of a mediator nominated by the chairman of the Labour Court to ensure impartial consideration and to bring in an outside view.</P>
      <P>Another stated cause of staff dissatisfaction had been that there was no independent appeals machinery for dealing with staff grievances.  To meet this I appointed a mediation committee presided over by a chairman nominated by the chairman of the Labour Court to issue recommendations on grievances which could not be settled in direct discussions. A number of such cases have been dealt with already by the new committee. I met the national executives of the main staff organisations in the Department and had very full and frank discussions with them on problems affecting their members so that these could be taken into account in my consideration of how relationships could be improved further.  I arranged also for a substantial strengthening of the staffing provision for personnel work in the Department which I had found, on taking up office, grossly inadequate in a situation in which there were 28,000 workers employed by the Department.  I did this at all levels, including district level.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware also of my recent appointment of a review group chaired by Dr. Michael Dargan to examine the feasibility of giving autonomy to the telecommunications service and how the postal service could be modernised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation both to the immediate issue of the engineering productivity claim and the improvement of staff-management <Col N="1293" /> relations generally, therefore, I would ask the House to accept that I, for my part, and my Department have done everything possible to bring about the industrial peace and stable relationships so necessary if the Department are to provide a proper service to the public. Indeed Deputy O'Leary professes to be very concerned about the provision of a solution to this problem.  I might say that that contrasts strangely with his inactivity in relation to it during the four years it was in hands while he was Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, I am normally a calm and patient man but this attempt by Deputy O'Leary to make political capital out of the predicament in which the executive of the union concerned find themselves is enough to make even me lose my patience.  The <Col N="1294" /> spokesman for the executive has been at pains to make it clear that they hope to resolve this matter by further negotiations. Even before they have time to reopen negotiations the Deputy comes in here with a speech designed to make it more difficult for all concerned to reach a solution and to create unnecessary public alarm.  Whatever temporary publicity the Deputy may hope to gain from this mischievous effort I have no doubt that the long-term consequences for him will cause him to regret it.  I am sure that the House and the country will appreciate that every effort has been made by me to reach a satisfactory solution and that I will continue my efforts.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed occupational injury benefit in November 1977 when he became incapable of work due to an injury sustained in the course of his employment.  His employers, however, did not confirm his statement, and it was found necessary to have the matter investigated by outdoor officers of my Department.  These investigations have now been completed, and his injury benefit claim has been allowed.  Payment of that benefit has now been issued to him.</P>

    <P>(1)  Farmers who, or whose spouse, are engaged in another trade or profession in addition to farming are assessable to income tax on their farming profits and are included in the figures in column (1).  They are precluded from opting for assessment on the notional basis.  This explains the differing figures in columns (1) and (2).</P>
    <P>(2)  As regards 1977-78, full-time farmers were, in the first instance assessed to tax on the notional basis but were given a right of appeal and the right to opt for assessment on the accounts basis. Final figures for that year are not yet available but the information so far available indicates that some 40 per cent accepted assessment on the notional basis and 60 per cent appealed and opted for assessment on the accounts basis.</P>

However, since the strike by the Irish Post Office Engineering Union conditions have not been normal; there have been shortages of trunk circuits and problems with the trunk network leading to difficulties in connecting trunk calls.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 437 to 439, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Slaughterings of cattle at licensed meat export premises up to 14 October this year, at 871,000, are running 30,000 above the corresponding period of last year and are at the highest level in any year except 1975&mdash;a year in which stocks were run down very heavily.  The position varies, of course, from factory to factory depending on their efficiency in keeping down costs, arranging for procurement of cattle and developing market outlets.  I have received representations on behalf of workers at the meat plant to which the Deputy refers about the employment situation there and I should say that slaughterings at that meat plant are nearly 2,000 head up on last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Live exports of 306,000 store and fat cattle in the period January to September 1978 are up about 15 per cent on the same period of 1977 but are still well below the levels prevailing a few years ago.  These have, of course, taken place without the aid of incentives which are not already available to the meat export trade.  It can be said in regard to the <Col N="1202" /> bulk of these live exports that the animals do not reach our factories because the factories are not competing effectively in price with the live exporters for them.</P>
    <P>In addition to these exports, an export trade in calves, mainly to Italy, has developed.  I do not like this trade, which is taking raw material from everybody concerned with cattle and the building up of the national herd&mdash;store cattle producers, fatteners, meat factories, local butchers and even the traditional live export trade in adult cattle.  I am having the whole position examined to see what action can be taken, within the constraints imposed by EEC law, to ensure that this trade, which is currently running at about 7 per cent of our output of calves, can be kept within acceptable levels.</P>
    <P>My policy about live exports generally is to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, our cattle are processed in Ireland and so create the maximum employment here.  It must, however, be appreciated that under EEC law it is not permissible to apply quantitative controls, levies or other restrictive measures on exports of live animals.</P>
    <P>Finally, the meat export trade have been pressing for the correction of a number of anomalies which they claim have been making carcase beef exports more attractive than exports of beef cuts.  The most important of these anomalies was satisfactorily resolved as part of the agricultural price arrangements negotiated earlier this year.  I am confident that the remainder, which are being actively considered by the EEC Commission at my request, will be disposed of before very long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been unable to trace the figure of 21.3 per cent mentioned by the Deputy.  Output of cattle and calves, including changes in livestock numbers, <Col N="1203" /> fell from 1,859,000 in 1975 to 1,769,000 in 1977, a decline of 4.8 per cent.  The reason for the drop was the exceptionally heavy level of cow slaughterings in 1974 and 1975.</P>
