      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget, by removing all the major obstacles to growth which have been highlighted over and over again for the last three or four years, by reducing company and personal taxation, and by a massive injection into the various productive sectors of the economy, has thrown down a challenge to every sector of the community, private and public, to grasp the opportunities that have been created, opportunities that may not be there in one or two years. We are challenged to make a magnanimous response and to throw our efforts behind those of the Government in tackling the major twin problems of our nation, unemployment and high inflation.  This was not just a <Col N="1449" /> throw-away budget.  It was not giving away money for the sake of doing so. There was a specific reason behind every aspect of it.  The massive cuts in personal taxation were the Government's contribution to the control of inflation by trying to dampen down the demands of the people in various sectors who are seeking increases in the National Wage Agreement.  From the result so far it would appear that the efforts in that direction have been reasonably successful.  While we may not get the desired increase of 5 per cent or thereabouts in the National Wage Agreement, nevertheless we will get an increase that will regularise our pay structures considerably.  It is unfortunate that by going above the guideline set by the Government we could be throwing 4,000 jobs out of the window when if we were prepared to do with 1 per cent or 2 per cent less we could have shortened the days of unemployment for some people.</P>
      <P>The challenge has been thrown down by the Government to every sector. I will now attempt to identify what the challenge means and some of the areas in which response can be made. The challenge in the main has been thrown to the private sector and I believe this is the correct course to take. Private enterprise is always the cheapest and most efficient way to economic growth.  While we have been criticised for putting over-reliance on the private sector, the record around the world shows clearly that private enterprise economies have nearly always out-passed and out-performed the socially oriented countries.  We have only to look at Japan, West Germany and the USA for clear examples of what private enterprise can produce and has produced.  No doubt if the proper commitment is given here we can produce in the next three or four years, and indeed into the 1980s, many of the jobs so necessary for our country.  The gains of private economies are always long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not mean that the public sector, as distinct from the public service, has not a very distinctive role to play.  Most of our public sector semi-State bodies have, with one or two exceptions, been very successful and there is little doubt that they too will <Col N="1450" /> make a major contribution in the years ahead.  Their ideas and energies can be channelled through the industrial consortium and put together with the many other ideas we hope will be channelled into that area.</P>
    <P>I believe in the private enterprise system and private enterprise incentive. The Irish people can never be driven. They must always be led.  The best way we can lead them is by incentives. Deep down in every one of us is some type of an entrepreneur, or tradesman or business man.  We are always interested in making a few shillings.  That is a basic instinct of the Irish character. The young people today are no different from us.  They are waiting for an opportunity to set themselves up.  In any programmes to identify where the areas for enterprise are, young people have come forward time and again with their ideas.  This was tried in my own constituency by the Industrial Development Authority and the local Chamber of Commerce.  The idea was to get ideas within our own community. There was a very definite response and 86 ideas were put forward.  At least 20 showed very great promise and prizes were given.  This is an area which can be expanded throughout the country. There are plenty of ideas and plenty of creative ability waiting to be tapped.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised in this budget for not being socially orientated or socially committed.  Our total commitment to the social side of our economy is in the region of £610 million.  In itself, that figure bears out the social conscience of the Government.  We have always said&mdash;and we stand by our commitment&mdash;that we will keep the social side in line at least with the cost of living and as the economy expands, as we hope and know it will, we can put more and more of our resources to improving the lot of the less well off in our society.  You cannot make a poor man rich by making a rich man poor.  My idea is that, first of all you create the wealth, and then you distribute it.  Unlike our predecessors, we do not want to make the mistake of trying to distribute what we have not got.  They ran into trouble trying to do that.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his <Col N="1451" /> recognition of the small disadvantaged groups in our society and one, in particular, the mentally handicapped.  For years nobody has taken up their cause to the extent it should have been taken up.  The development stage in that area which we are at today can be attributed by and large to voluntary associations.  We must compliment them.  In my own town I have seen at first hand the marvellous work voluntary organisations have done over the years for mentally handicapped children. I am glad that at last more recognition has been given to them and I hope it will continue in future budgets.</P>
    <P>Most of the budget is concerned with jobs, job creation and job maintenance. Here is the challenge to us as a nation and as a people to see if we have the will to solve the problem and to respond as the Government expect us to respond.  We need to hold what we have and at the same time, start to create what we need.  What we have is no meaningless achievement.  Our exports are in the region of £2,500 million and, for a small nation, that is not to be sneezed at.  We need to consolidate our position.  I compliment the Government on their job subsidies to the labour intensive areas which have been under very severe pressure by the distortion in trade caused by the British employment subsidy.</P>
    <P>We must consolidate what we have and start to create what we need.  In consolidating what we have, there is one area in which each and every one of us can play our part.  By the massive injection given to the economy, spending power has been very heavily increased.  It will be all for nowt if that spending power is used to buy more and more imports and not to support our own Irish produced goods.  It is high time the Irish nation realised that, if they continue to import and to disregard Irish produced goods, more and more of our young people will stay longer and longer on the unemployment list.  If a mere 3p were diverted from every £1 worth of foreign goods we buy, it is estimated that over three years that would produce 10,000 jobs.  Whether it produces 10,000, 8,000 or 6,000 jobs, <Col N="1452" /> it is a very small sacrifice to ask from the people of Ireland if they want to play their part in solving this great national problem.</P>
    <P>When we look at the make-up of our unemployment problem, we see that 45 per cent of the unemployed are under 25 years of age.  If I were asked what our approach should be to such a huge problem and where are the areas in which we should set out to solve it, I would say we should start there.  That figure of 45 per cent does not include many people for one reason or another.  That is a waste of one of our greatest national assets.  We have educated those people and put a national and a State investment into their education, and we cannot now stand aside and allow them to remain unemployed.</P>
    <P>To tackle this problem we must use all our assets wisely and well.  By that I mean our people and our national assets.  They are there in abundance waiting to be developed.  If we as a nation with a mere three million people have not got the will to solve the problem, nobody from outside will solve it for us.  The world does not owe us a living.  We are in the hard world of today and we have to earn our own living.  We are quite capable of doing that.  We have the ability to do it, but ability is not much good without opportunity.  Now we have the opportunity presented to us in this budget.</P>
    <P>Where are these opportunities?  We have our natural resources which have been highlighted time and time again. We have the basic raw materials for all the industries we need to solve our unemployment problem.  We have them right on our doorstep and it is better for us to use them than to bring in foreigners to use them for us.  Even if we have to bring in foreigners to use a certain amount of them, nevertheless in my view Ireland is still the land of opportunity and, in the words of the Minister, 1978 is to be the year of opportunity.</P>
    <P>In looking at our unemployment strategy for the future I believe it will have to be more broadly based than it has been in the past.  When we think of jobs, naturally we think of <Col N="1453" /> manufacturing jobs, but over the years manufacturers will have the problem of trying to stay competitive in a very competitive world.  We cannot blame business people if they have to put some of their money into more modern machinery to adapt to the consumer needs of today and to stay competitive. Having made their prices competitive, they can think about opening up the factory for longer than the eight hours most of our factories are open for today.</P>
    <P>Shift work can be considered because in that way more goods can be produced more cheaply and can still be sold by using the resources lying idle for two thirds of the day in many of our factories.  Lying there is a great national investment, a waste of a national resources and of a personal resource.  I accept that the Irish make-up and character has not been orientated towards shiftwork.  We have always looked for the easy way out. We have got away with it up to now but I do not believe we will do so much longer.  We must educate our people towards these changes, changing times, change in work and change in the type of jobs available.  If we accept the challenge that change brings we can make a sensible inroad into the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Last week at the RDS, at an engineering exhibition, I noticed many and varied opportunities for small engineering companies, opportunities that have been identified from the import list, opportunities on view there for Irish entrepreneurs to replace the imports flowing into this country.  They were identified by the IDA and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, two agencies that every day point up various areas of opportunity only waiting for entrepreneurs to take them up.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt but that there will be many jobs created in the tourist industry as we hope to maintain our competitiveness and as forecasted figures show more and more tourists coming here in the ensuing year.</P>
    <P>There are many job opportunities also in the leisure industry, many that <Col N="1454" /> have remained untapped so far.  Indeed we have the finest inland waterways in Europe.  Can anybody say we make the fullest possible use of them?  There are job possibilities in every sphere. There are those in the environment, in the creation of town parks and recreation areas so badly needed around the country.  If young people undertook such jobs at least they would be better off than remaining on the unemployment register.  By so doing they would be creating a national asset, one that will be called into question in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>I believe we will have to examine the area of early retirement and plan for it.  We must plan for leisure, educate people in this respect so that when the time comes it will not be the big shock we all fear.  Anybody on the point of retiring will tell you that the greatest fear they have is what they will do with their spare time.  If we approach the situation in a broad-based fashion, if we use wisely our natural resources&mdash;those of land, sea, mines and so on&mdash;we can reap beneficial results.  We are now in a 250 million consumer market.  We need no longer rely on our neighbours in the British market as we did for years. There are many and varied opportunities there with the consumer waiting to be supplied, and if we do not supply him somebody else will.</P>
    <P>I believe such opportunities exist because I am often out in the market place and see them.  However, they need to be identified.  There is need for more research into and development of consumer tastes&mdash;what the consumer will be demanding in the future. Here we have fallen down badly because not sufficient of our resources has gone into research and development in identifying goods to be produced. In this respect I believe our academics have let us down.  We have spent millions and millions of our national resources keeping our third level institutions going.  If we examine the contribution they have made to our economy we will find it is a very small percentage. When we examine the make-up and business acumen of managers of Irish-based industries we must admit that the leaders of our business sector <Col N="1455" /> have not come from third-level education.</P>
    <P>They have failed us here because they have not taken up the role of repaying to society what it has given them.  They should be in the area of modern science to identify problems and to produce many of the answers needed today.  But are they?  Rather they prefer to drift into a soft job in the public service or elsewhere, creating problems for us businessmen trying to carry the country on our backs.  They create problems through red tape, paperwork and so on, frustrating us many times along the way.  The time has come for them to examine their situation because the load is being carried by too few.  Too few are expected to produce the national wealth to carry this country back on the road to national reconstruction.  It is time each individual in this society took up his part of the load.  It is precisely that challenge the Government have thrown down to each of us in this budget.  I hope everybody will seriously examine their position, see how they can help, what contribution they can make, make it honestly, thereby making this small nation great, because it can be made great if only we are prepared to accept that hard work is the order of the day and that there is no substitute therefor.  There is an old saying that time lost is not found and that today never comes again.  The time is opportune, the white flag is flying, the ball is in and the game is on&mdash;describe it how you will&mdash;the opportunities are there for Irish people to build this into the nation they all desire.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is an impossible dream to tackle the unemployment problem.  There are structural changes that will have to be made.  I do not accept that defeatist attitude evident in many sectors and indeed expressed in this House.  We do not have to accept this defeatist attitude.  What have we got?  We have all the tools we need to do the job; all we need is to get down and do the job.  We need to multiply our effort.  Indeed we, as public representatives, have a very special role to play in motivating our people into a greater national effort. <Col N="1456" /> We have the responsibility of ensuring that every individual interested in improving enterprise and effort in all areas is fully aware of the incentives existing, of the various schemes to help them in business, whether it produces one, ten, 100 or 1,000 jobs.  I have always believed that if we look after the small man the big man will look after himself.  It is our duty and responsibility to identify any possible areas of investment or enterprise in our own fields.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in dealing with the problem only at national level. Each area should make an effort to solve its own problems and not expect the Government to solve them.  I know that history has made us a dependent people and that we always tended to look to the Government, and now we are looking to Brussels.  If we look in our own backyards we will see many areas that can be developed.  When one or two local entrepreneurs start up in an area it is amazing the interest that builds up at local level. The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy opened four small units in Longford recently and since then people have come to me believing that they could also start up.  I have little doubt that these three people will be added to the list.  The industrial base in my area is purely small industry. We have two large units starting to build, but the small local man is much more important because he needs to keep in business in order to earn his living, he cannot blow out when the trade winds change as large foreign businessmen can.  Small industry is the backbone of the American and French economies, why not make it the backbone of the Irish economy? The time has come for a great effort to be made.  I hope that 1978 will be the year of which future historians will say: &ldquo;Ireland stopped talking and started acting.&rdquo;  We can no longer afford to slumber in the traditions of our fathers.  The world is advancing, let Ireland advance with it.  Only this way we can cherish the children of the nation.  Let future generations not condemn us for not taking up the opportunities presented in this budget. <Col N="1457" /> This is a once-off operation and we owe it to our children, to their children and to the nation to avail of the opportunity.  It is time we stood up to be counted, and took up our cross and carried our fair share of the national burden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What an appropriate ending to a speech by a member of Fianna Fáil, that the people must take up their cross and carry it.  That is exactly what this budget will do to the people.  It will place a cross on the shoulder of every man, woman and child, which will have to be carried for many generations to come.  I am glad that one of the new Deputies has recognised the situation so quickly and has been so honest as to point it out here.  The Deputy made interesting comments when talking about academics and what they had or had not done for the country.  I am quite sure that, being an honest man, the Deputy had in mind a certain economist, an academic, who played a big part in winning the last general election for Fianna Fáil and who has already been recognised by those in high places as putting them into a position which practical men like Johnny Callanan and myself would recognise will be difficult to climb out of in years to come.</P>

      <P>Sorry, Deputy Callanan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new expression has been coined in the last few days known as &ldquo;manifesto economics&rdquo;.  Manifesto economics has added 8 per cent, 2 per cent and 2 per cent and has come up with 5 per cent.  This is the new national wage agreement.  In this House, on radio and television and at every opportunity, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and for Finance stated that the maximum which would be acceptable would be 5 per cent.  Having not alone said that, they even threatened that if this was exceeded the Government would take the money back not alone from the workers, but from anybody who dared to take a bigger increase than 5 per cent.  I had visions of farmers and big businessmen being dragged <Col N="1458" /> screaming up the steps of Leinster House and the Ministers for Finance and for Economic Planning and Development emptying their pockets on the floor and saying: &ldquo;You took more than 5 per cent, now hand it back or else.&rdquo;  When it was all over, when the decision has been made, when the workers showed that they have minds of their own and they were going to do what they thought was best for themselves and for the nation, when they decided that the very least they could accept was 8 per cent plus 2 per cent, the people who had said the maximum which could be acceptable was 5 per cent said: &ldquo;That is all right, that is what we were thinking of, we thought that that should be about the maximum.&rdquo;  The manifesto said 5 per cent.  We now have 8 per cent plus 2 per cent which was negotiated by the workers' representatives.</P>
    <P>I have been a trade union official for 13 years and I know a little about these things.  I took part in national wage agreement negotiations at a time when a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach who has now gone to his reward was not afraid or ashamed or too big to meet the workers' representatives in order to try to reach a national wage agreement.  That Taoiseach did not say that it was somebody else's business.  It was national business and therefore his business, so when he was asked to meet the representatives of the trade unions he agreed, and an agreement was reached.  This is a democratic country and the constituent members of the trade unions will ultimately vote on whether it is acceptable or not.  While I am very much in favour, in the national interest, of agreement being reached, the Government should not start cheering just yet.  Will the two gentlemen referred to earlier, keep their mouths shut between now and the vote being taken so as not to spoil it?  They did everything they could to destroy it up to now.  The agreement has been negotiated in spite of the lack of assistance from them. Will they now stay quiet until the final decision is taken?</P>
    <P>The last Deputy referred to the loss of 4,000 jobs.  I am sure he was only repeating what the Ministers for <Col N="1459" /> Finance and for Economic Planning and Development have been saying during the past three days.  This suggestion is utter nonsense.  The figure has been simply taken from the air and is being used as has been done before to hit the workers because the Government fear, and rightly so, that they will not be able to create all the jobs they talked of.  Later they will use the alleged loss of 4,000 jobs as a result of the pay agreement as an excuse for some of their failure.</P>
    <P>The men in Government now, with one or two exceptions, were in office for a long time before.  They know that the main trouble regarding national agreements is not an increase of about 3 per cent in the wages of industrial workers but the cost to the State of the increase in the wages and salaries of civil servants.  Instead of admitting that this is the problem there is an attempt to keep down the wages of the lower paid workers.  It is well that that be put on record.  I do not wish anyone to take me as saying that public servants are over-paid. Having worked with some of them for more than four years I am satisfied that in some cases they are under-paid in terms of the amount of work they undertake and I am satisfied, too, that at the bottom of the scale there are many State employees who are being paid miserly rates for the work they are doing.  In every job, including our own here, it can be claimed that there are people who are over-paid for what they do but I consider that the Taoiseach, for instance, is not paid the rate to which he is entitled.  The same applied so far as all of his predecessors were concerned.  It is ludicrous that a Taoiseach should be paid less than some of the senior civil servants.  That situation should not be allowed continue.  When there is mention of an increase for us there is a fear that somebody&mdash;presumably, the gentlemen of the Press-would point to the increase.  For that reason we are inclined to keep down the salaries paid to ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt Deputy Tully but would he agree that the man being paid buttons continues <Col N="1460" /> to be paid buttons in so far as percentage increases are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to recall that during wage negotiations in which I took part many years ago with the Taoiseach of the day I insisted on a floor in so far as the lower paid workers were concerned.  At least that situation guarantees that the person at the bottom of the ladder gets more percentagewise than those who are much better paid.  That helps to some extent but since Deputy Callanan has mentioned those on lower incomes I shall go a step further and talk about those on social welfare in respect of whom the Deputy's argument is clear. Social welfare recipients, regardless of which category of payment they are in, are getting a 10 per cent increase. This increase must compensate them from October 1977 until the time of the next increase which, presumably, will be April 1979.  In other words, their increase is for a 15-month period. In the case of a person in receipt of about £12 per week the increase will be just more than £1.  Those in employment are getting a 5 per cent increase but this, according to the Minister, will represent 8 per cent or, as he said when he was a little more excited, £10 per week.  If the real amount of the increase will be about £6 per week how can the social welfare recipient be expected to survive on an increase of about £1 per week for a 15-month period?  For many years there has been an acceptance that unemployment is endemic, that the unemployed, like the poor, will be with us always.  In the swinging sixties when, apparently, there was money for everything, unemployment was not reduced and there was no money to pay a decent amount to those in receipt of social welfare claims.  It was not until the change of Government five years ago that an effort was made to give a reasonable increase to people in this category.  According to this Government they can manage on what they are getting and they seem to regard as something of a nuisance the fact that there are more people in this category now.  That sort of thinking will create a lot of trouble in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The Government decided against reducing the old age pension qualifying age to 65.  The last speaker said that we must consider the question of early retirement.  I have heard a number of Ministers talk in this vein, too, but I wonder whether they know what they are talking about. Do they think that there is a way in which somebody can be given a small pension and be put away so that a job is made for somebody else?  That seems to be what they are talking about.  To have reduced the old age pension qualifying age by a year would have benefited approximately 12,500 people and would have cost the State about £6,500,000 in a full year.  However, the Government decided against any such reduction although they decided to abolish wealth tax which, in 1970, would have netted the Exchequer £12 million.</P>
      <P>Much has been said regarding the exodus to other places of wealthy people as a result of the wealth tax. All I can say in that regard is that it is regrettable that more of them did not leave if that was their attitude on being asked to pay a relatively small amount of tax on their immense wealth.  That type of person is no good to any country.  I doubt if very many of them left but I know a few did and they are no great loss.  They gave very little employment and concentrated only on enjoying themselves.  I except that the only reason for them being here at all was that they could live cheaper here than elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A step taken in the very early days of the previous Government was the abolition of death duties.  Anybody, particularly a person in a rural area, would know the terrible hardship caused when a member of a family who owned the property died and the <Col N="1462" /> Revenue Commissioners wanted their pound of flesh which according to the law they had to get.  I saw things happening which should not happen in a civilised country as a result of death duties and I was glad to see death duties abolished and replaced by a system of tax which the present Government have decided is not the right way to do it and they are playing around with it and what they are trying to do is difficult to understand.  It is possible that academics have something in mind and in years to come we may discover what exactly they are about.</P>
    <P>As far as social welfare generally is concerned, there was a very reasonable approach adopted by the previous Government, particularly by the present Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey, who piloted the idea and had it carried by the then Government, that the mothers were the persons entitled to get the children's allowance.  Women were very glad that that was done because it meant that they had a reasonably large amount of money at a time with which they could buy clothing and shoes for their children.  While most husbands would hand up the money to their wives, there was the odd fellow who thought it was beer money.  Is it not a pity that this Government have decided not to increase children's allowances? What was the thinking behind that? Have we reached the stage where, like some other countries, we have decided that there are too many children? Have we decided that the size of families should be reduced?  Is this the beginning of a trend to abolish the allowance or to reduce it drastically? If so, it is a very bad idea and I hope it will not be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Of course, the number of persons unemployed has been trotted out in this House again and again.  I have often wondered where the mass media got their figures or their directives. There are quite a number of persons in the Press, radio and television who are specialists, who are experts and very honourable persons.  There appears to be an odd one who is prepared to publish a banner headline <Col N="1463" /> on something which could not be less true.  One thing which always got a headline was when a claim was made in this House by the then Opposition, Fianna Fáil, that there were between 160,000 and 185,000 on the live register. The Fianna Fáil Party were perfectly satisfied at that time that they knew the exact number of unemployed. When the Taoiseach was asked a couple of weeks ago to state the number on the live register he honestly said he did not know.  Of course he did not know and he did not know before this but he used a figure which was used in a banner headline and it was the accepted thing that this was the size of the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>What caused that unemployment problem?  Of course, there was a world recession, which had a great deal to do with it.  The IDA for many years had been doing a good job. Unfortunately&mdash;I do not know whether it was through Government directive or not although I have an idea it took a Government directive to make the change&mdash;they were bringing into the country capital-intensive industries which cost a tremendous amount of money to start and gave very little employment. It was not unusual to find a factory being started which it was claimed would employ many hundreds and which employed less than 100. Indeed, one industry that had employed 300 reduced its workforce to about 100 when a great deal of money had been given for the purpose of modernisation.  If that was the idea, it was terribly wrong and it is wrong that this should continue.  We asked that labour-intensive industry be brought in so that employment would be created.  We must concentrate on that type of industry.  Otherwise it is waste of time.  There is no other way in which the number of unemployed can be reduced.</P>
    <P>Figures were given in the budget which suggest 20,000 jobs this year, 5,000 extra jobs last year.  I should like to put on record that following questions asked in this House over the last couple of weeks, it can be stated categorically that Fianna Fáil did not put one penny into industry, into local <Col N="1464" /> authorities, into building, for the purpose of giving extra jobs in 1977.  They simply used up the money which had been provided by the previous Government. I should like to put on record that all of that money was not used.  That was wrong.  The money made available in the budget of the previous year for the purpose of giving employment should have been used.  It was a mistake.  Now they are talking about additional money.  It is not additional to what was provided last year.  It is additional to what was spent last year.  The money made available was not spent in the way it should have been spent.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me what has happened with regard to the housing programme, the number of houses that were completed last year.  The records are easy to get. Despite the fact that Fianna Fáil were prepared to challenge them on every occasion, we accept the records that the Department will make available to the House because the civil servants concerned are honourable men and women and will produce correct statistics and will not change them for anybody.  Fianna Fáil would not ask for the figures but we will do it. I would ask them to produce figures for the number of houses built last year and the number they will build this year.</P>
    <P>It is significant that on 16 December 1976 in this House, the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, now the Taoiseach, made a comment which he tried to correct afterwards. The comment was that we were building too many local authority houses in relation to the number of houses being built&mdash;in relation to anything&mdash; it did not matter a damn.  What he did say was &ldquo;we are building too many local authority houses&rdquo;.  There were efforts made to have that changed on a number of occasions in the House and people said that I misquoted him or misinterpreted him and that it was not what was meant and they went around in circles.  However, the White Paper issued very recently&mdash;National Development 1977-1980&mdash;contains a paragraph which with your permission I should like to read.  It is paragraph 5.8:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> As a result of the expansion of local authority housing output in recent years, there has been a lessening in the degree of relative urgency of the housing demands made on local authorities.  At present, apart from Dublin and some other areas, housing needs are being met almost as they arise and in Dublin the number of three-person families (man, wife and one child) on the housing list has grown to 70 per cent.  However, the cost of providing local authority houses has risen sharply in recent years from £4,600 in 1972-73 to £11,000 per unit in 1977.  In some central city areas, where property, land compensation and building costs are higher than normal, the all-in-cost per unit of accommodation may reach as much as £26,000.  The continuing and accruing subsidy of up to £1,500 per unit per annum for normal rented local authority dwellings now being provided is placing a very heavy burden on the Exchequer. In the face of these high costs and given the progress already made towards satisfying needs, the level of activity in the local authority housing programme and for the extent of Exchequer subsidies will have to be subjected to continuous critical review in the light of available resources.  The local authorities will be requested to examine the circumstances of housing applicants in more detail to determine priority needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I am not entering into a debate on housing.  I am reading something which relates very closely to the money made available in the budget for housing.  I would like to point out that this statement, with the approval of the Government, says that we are going back to the bad old days when a couple who got married had to live in a hovel or in very overcrowded conditions for many years.  They needed to have three or <Col N="1466" /> four children before they would be considered for rehousing.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister for the Environment, who is a very decent man, made a comment to the effect that he was providing extra money for various things.  My colleague, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, at the opening of the new bridge across the Liffey said that many new houses would be built in the City Quay area because Dublin Corporation had agreed to this.  During my period in office I had approved these houses, and I believe that city centre development must go forward. There we have churches, schools, shops and community halls.  People live in these areas and they do not have to cross the city twice a day going to and from work.  The Lord Mayor must not have read this document because it is quite clear to me that the present Government intend to cut down substantially on the erection of local authority houses and we will go back to the bad old days when it was almost impossible to get a house unless one was very lucky or had been married for a long time.</P>

      <P>While the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was correcting me I would have completed what I wanted to say <Col N="1467" /> about housing.  With due respect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am simply saying that I am satisfied that the amount of money made available in the budget and the statement in the White Paper mean that the situation in which the slums were being cleared away will change and we will be back to the stage where new houses will need repair three months after they have been finished.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of talk about the building and construction industry and the amount of immediate employment that could be given if certain things were done.  The people who made the criticism have been in office for six months.  They came into office at a very good time because they had a full six months to prepare this year's budget and to provide for the things which they wanted to have done.  When it came to the point it appears that much of the criticism and many of the points in the manifesto were simply for the purpose of making a case.  They forgot about all that and hoped that everybody else would do the same. The people do not accept that things should be done in this way.</P>
      <P>I live in a farming area and the farmers there were complaining about tax.  On the night before the election I was present at a meeting at which the whole matter was discussed.  I know what was promised by the canvassers for Fianna Fáil and I also know the provisions in the budget.  I am not crying any salt tears for the farmers because I have always believed that they should pay their fair share of tax, but people should not be codded into believing that there would be no increase in the multiplier, that they would be paying less tax and that there was no question of any change in the valuation level or of taking away agricultural grants. All these matters are included in the budget and the Government are putting in the boot, hoping that farmers will forget all about these promises during the next three of four years.  I believe that those who are in a position to pay tax should do so, but the Government have broken their word to the farmers and have been very dishonest with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> I want to mention briefly something which is barely skimmed over in the budget, namely, the question of local authority tenants.  When I came into office there had been a rent strike for two years.  I settled it in a reasonable way in association with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations, who kept their word and did everything they said they would.  There was much criticism and everybody in the Opposition, and some of my own colleagues, wanted more.  It was said that I was not doing enough.  One of the matters which received a lot of attention at that time was the question of the claw-back.  This has been done away with in the budget.  That is the Government's decision and I accept it. I believe that anyone buying a local authority house at a cheap rate should buy it for himself and not sell it.  There were people who were caught in the trap, but the local authority could decide to waive the claw-back.  There was one group who insisted that anyone who bought a house for cash, possibly with the object of selling immediately, should get the same consideration, if anything was being done, as the people who had bought before my scheme came into operation in 1973.</P>
    <P>According to a report in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> about 12 months ago the Taoiseach said that he would guarantee that those who paid cash would get the same treatment as those buying on instalments.  Two representatives one of whom has lost his seat in the Dublin South-West area thought that the Taoiseach meant what he said and that this would be done and they included this in their election manifesto. It was not done.  I made the change and I did not include those people and neither did Fianna Fáil when they came into office.  When the present Minister for the Environment was asked about this he said that the Government did not propose to do anything. When asked about the manifesto he said &ldquo;We are not responsible for that&rdquo;.  I do not know whether he meant that he was not responsible or that the Taoiseach was not responsible or whether he was referring to the two representatives from Dublin South-West.  We talk about honesty in <Col N="1469" /> public life.  I do not blame the two representatives: the Taoiseach said this and they thought that it was the truth. That is the sort of thing that is going on.  We refused point blank to enter into an auction and to tell lies.</P>
    <P>Some good things were done in the budget.  I refer to the abolition of rates on private houses.  In 1973 we started to remove the housing and health charges from the rates and this was completed in 1977.  This meant that a large proportion of the existing rates disappeared.  In 1977 we removed a quarter of the existing rates and we proposed in 1978 to remove three-quarters of the balance and abolish rates completely by the following year. There is very little difference between our proposals and what the Government have done.  They removed a small extra proportion this year.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which we must give our attention.  There are elected representatives to local authorities all over the country who do their best for the general good.  I would be very annoyed, as would most public representatives, if the removal of rates from dwelling-houses resulted in these public representatives being regarded as a lesser breed and if any efforts were made to curtail their reponsibilities and powers.  During my period in office I gave them the powers to which they were entitled.  They are carrying out a national duty at local level.  They are doing it for very little, as the expenses some of them get do not compensate for what they do.  This matter must be looked at very carefully. I warn that the Labour Party will be very vigilant to ensure that no back-door methods are used to take away the authority of elected representatives at local level.</P>
    <P>The removal of tax from cars was a good gimmick from the &ldquo;think-tank&rdquo; and I believe that more than anything else it won the election for Fianna Fáil.  But was it a good idea?  Anybody with a car under 2000 ccs will not condemn it, whether he thinks it good or bad.  Those slightly over the limit think they are being very hardly done by.  Yesterday, I spoke to an owner with a car slightly over the limit and he said that his much more wealthy neighbours pay no tax while he has to <Col N="1470" /> pay about £120.  He cannot see why this should not have been done in another way, why a certain percentage of the tax could not be taken off all cars.  This gimmick takes away the money normally used for the Road Fund for the purpose of carrying out road repairs, work on bridges and so on.</P>
    <P>When I took over at the Custom House I found, as I expected as a local authority member, a really extra-ordinary situation.  While the State were prepared to pay grants for national primary roads and national secondary roads and carry out huge works on them, they were not prepared to give anything for the upkeep of national secondary roads and in most cases would give nothing for county roads as most people describe them.  I changed that.  I made a block grant available so that a local authority would decide where the money was most needed to be spent, whether on national primary, secondary or county roads.  This resulted in a pretty good job being done.  But I had not nearly sufficient money and no Government have yet been able to raise the amount of money required, because our roads are deteriorating.  The present hard weather will do tremendous damage. For instance, County Offaly got a substantial amount this year but not nearly enough, because Offaly roads suffered very badly in previous harsh weather and they will suffer again now.</P>
    <P>Money should be available for them, but taking away the Road Fund completely means less money will be available which raises the consideration. The rates money is taken away and the richest man can have his house free of rates as well as the poor man&mdash; it may not mean very much to the poor man&mdash;and his car, if under 2000 ccs, is also free.  But the old age pensioner who gets an increase of £1.40 a week would be able to get much more were it not for the fact that he has to pay his share of tax to replace the money taken to help the people who have much more than he has.  This aspect of the budget is wrong and bad and should be reconsidered because it cannot be continued.  I do not believe that the man who has never in his life been able to aspire to a car or a <Col N="1471" /> house should have to pay for those who have both and perhaps two, three or four cars and who can now escape tax which the old age pensioner must pay, because assuredly somebody pays: the Government do not pay out of their own pockets.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money must be found somewhere for the purpose of roads, whether national primary, national secondary or county roads and other much-used roads not in those categories.  Many new bridges are needed.  Yesterday, and today I crossed the new bridge over the Liffey.  No doubt it is a tremendous improvement. I should say that; but I believe that but for the fact that I happened to be in the Custom House that bridge would never have been there, at least not in this century because no effort was being made by anybody to get it there.  Certainly my predecessors would not agree to it.</P>
    <P>At the opening luncheon&mdash;I was not present&mdash;the Minister for the Environment, according to the newspapers, mentioned that a lot of money was to be made available for the purpose of building new roads on the far side, on the City Quay side.  There was a question about whether it would interfere with housing and the answer was no, it would not.  Of course it will not; the houses will not be built.  In 1968 the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Kevin Boland, had before him a compulsory purchase order for City Quay which he refused to sign and that must have been on the instructions of the Government.  I signed one two years ago whereby provision would be made for the housing and the roads, but of course that is gone with the wind also.  That bridge is a beauty.  A bridge has also been built in Drogheda, a great bridge&mdash; I do not know if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has had an opportunity of passing over it&mdash;but it is an excellent one.  There is one in Wexford which he knows quite well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I just want to make a point on which I shall conclude in a <Col N="1472" /> minute.  I think I was responsible for initiating the erection and completion of eight bridges on main roads during my term as Minister.  If it was 92 years since a bridge was built over the Liffey it must be nearly as long since a bridge was built on a main road.  Certainly, Fianna Fáil built none in all their years.  There does not appear to be in the Estimate the money necessary to continue that programme, but it must be continued.  The Chair would not like it but I could list a number of bridges that must be built within the next two or three years but they will not be built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I should hate to have the situation arise which became the norm during the last term of Fianna Fáil when Estimates like that never came before the House but were passed on a £10 token vote on the day before the Summer Recess.  I have the idea that something like that would be likely to happen and because the finance for those items is covered in the budget I am taking the opportunity, with the permission of the Chair, of referring to them as I go along.</P>
      <P>There is another situation for which I do not blame Fianna Fáil alone because, while they are responsible for a great deal, their predecessors, Cumann na nGaedhael, and the previous inter-Party or Coalition Governments were also responsible for some of it. I am referring to water and sewerage. The money made available in the budget for those headings is inadequate. That money is needed; it must be made available and used.  We may talk ourselves sick about the environment but unless we are prepared to make the necessary money available for water sewerage schemes&mdash;not only for new ones but for renewal of outdated ones&mdash;we shall have no improvement in the environment; in fact it is bound to become worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred briefly to industry. We must take a very close look at industrial relations I think that a <Col N="1473" /> crude attempt was made during the Ferenka dispute by the present Minister for Labour to, as I would consider it &ldquo;pull a fast one&rdquo; in a suggestion he made for a settlement which was not acceptable to anybody.  Since that, he has kept very busy in the background.  I believe it is the duty of Government Ministers, if they do not come out in the open, to attempt behind the scenes to ensure that the business of the country runs smoothly. Yesterday, the Taoiseach was asked about the Post Office dispute, and I was interested to hear him say that he inherited it from his predecessor. It is true that there were disputes but there was no strike when the Government took over and there has not been a strike for the past seven months. This country's industry will collapse unless somebody succeeds in bringing the people running the Post Office out of the last century and into the present one.</P>

      <P>Let us go to the many questions which will arise from time to time about how the State is being run. We have Ministers and Ministers of State.  I am not objecting to the decision to appoint the Ministers of State, but it appears that some of them are not quite sure whether they have the right to act for the Minister to whom they are attached and to make important statements or whether they should be making only very minor statements.  One I have in mind is the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy. When a Parliamentary Secretary was appointed to that Department we understood that she would be responsible specifically for prices and all the women's organisations got up and cheered and said, &ldquo;This is great.  We now have a woman in charge of this who is going to look after prices, and therefore our point of view will be put&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from what I have been told that it is the Minister himself who is looking after the prices section of the Department, so in fairness to the Minister of State that should be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You are making my speech for me, Sir, because while the lady was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am pointing out the position. The Minister of State said that in the House only last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You are making my speech for me.  I admired the way the lady handled the big number of questions. She appeared to be extremely efficient and had done her homework. I claim to be an expert on this sort of thing and I thought she was doing it very well.  I was surprised to hear more recently that the Minister of the Department had said that he was responsible for prices.  The Taoiseach had appointed this lady and said that she was going to be responsible for prices and she was welcomed on that ground by the women's organisations.</P>
      <P>What has happened in regard to prices?  It appears that the Government in some peculiar way have succeeded in muzzling everybody.  The news media generally were prepared to publish reports on terrible rows about price increases, no matter how small.  They reported the increases when applied for, when granted and when they were put into operation. They reported them as if there were three increases.  A few months ago I listened to an early morning radio programme on which three increases were announecd.  An hour later in the post I got the report of the Prices Advisory Body and from it I learned that there were 43 items increased. Only three were announced on the radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that prices will be kept down.  There was a suggestion in the manifesto that the Prices Advisory Body were being codded and that they were not giving adequate attention to claims by manufacturers.  A special effort was to be made to ensure that in future nobody would be let away <Col N="1476" /> with increases to which they were not entitled.  What have we now?  Not alone have increases continued, as they must do because it is either lose jobs or give the increases as has always been the case, but the Government themselves by deliberate action have increased prices.  They increased the price of cheese and of town gas by removing the subsidies on them. Bottled gas is being increased by 2p or 3p today.  So it goes on.  If you go into any shop you will find that the prices there change daily.  From shop to shop there is a remarkable disparity in prices, from which it would appear that a big profit is being made by somebody.  Maybe that was the case when we were in Government and perhaps we did not watch it properly, but one of the planks of the Fianna Fáil platform before the election was that they were going to ensure that they would not make the same mistakes as we did.  Nevertheless prices seem to be going up not by the day but by the hour.</P>
    <P>There are two references in the budget to the Buy Irish campaign. What Buy Irish campaign?  You can go into most stores in this city and in any of the country towns at present and you have to ask half a dozen times before you will get Irish-made shoes or clothing.  You will be offered all sorts of foreign makes, not all from the EEC.  Some will come from countries very much outside the EEC, possibly under Third World arrangements, and cheap, shoddy articles are being passed on here at fancy prices. This is a disgrace and it is something on which the Government have fallen down completely.  We were attempting to stop this practice which was very prevalent when we took office. It is much worse now.  The Deputy who spoke here before me made reference to the question of purchasing Irish goods and to employment and so on.  The people in this country generally are not aware that continuous purchasing of foreign goods is putting our people out of employment.  Since I first started buying I have always refused to buy any material, no matter what, that is not Irish.  If I cannot get Irish material I do not buy. <Col N="1477" /> This is a matter of having courage. It sounds bad when a man wearing a crombie coat, a Peter England shirt and Italian shoes preaches about buying Irish.  There are a few such people on the Government side of the House at present.</P>
    <P>The budget had a few good things and an awful lot of bad things.  To go back again to social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there was in the election manifesto&mdash;which I confuse with the budget sometimes&mdash;a reference to the question of giving the same rights to women as to men in social welfare.  I found first of all that women seeking unemployment benefit on a seasonal basis were refused it.  There was a question about this in this House, appeals were heard and in this case the people concerned got their benefit.  I understand that there has been a considerable tightening-up on people who are sick, particularly women.  There has been a tightening-up on the married woman who stays at home to have her first baby.  Despite the question of giving equal rights to women she is unable to get a job even if she is available for work.  I thought I had reached the ultimate yesterday when I found that when people drawing unemployment benefit for the full period of 15 months seek unemployment assistance they can be left for an endless time before they get assistance. This was brought to my notice when a man with a wife and two children who got a new county council house some months ago was left for five weeks since his last unemployment benefit payment was made without getting anything.  When he protested to the Department, he was asked why he did not contact his local home assistance officer.  His local home assistance officer lives 25 miles away and the telephones are not working. Literally this family of four are hungry.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development said nearly 12 months ago that £30 million could be saved on the payment of social welfare benefit.  Is this one of the <Col N="1478" /> economies he feels can be made?  If so, he should think again.</P>
      <P>All of us want to see the Government running the country properly.  As a party, we are prepared to give the fullest co-operation we possibly can to any Government to ensure that the ordinary people have a good living and are able to exist.  If we were in office some of the things done in this budget would not have been allowed.</P>
      <P>When we were in Government I was rather annoyed at a continuous chorus about jobs for the boys as if we were picking up people and giving them jobs because they were our supporters. I have always held that people are equal and, whether or not they support me does not matter, if they are entitled to something, they must get it. It riled me over the past few days when I came across a situation in which it seemed that many jobs&mdash;I grant you they are not very well paid, but they are jobs nevertheless&mdash;have been I would almost say created and given to people for no other reason, as far as I can find out, than that they happened to belong to the Government party.  To know that is being done by people who talked about jobs for the boys is just a bit rough.  Thank you, Sir, for your forbearance.  I tried to cover a fairly wide field.  As the late Seán Dunne used to say, you can say very little in a hour.  I said what I could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is in essence the regulator of the nation's finances.  It is about the allocation of national resources as equitably as possible between the competing demands pressing on the Government. The extension of the social services, education, health, social welfare and others is primarily a matter of finance.  We would all like to move faster but national finances are not unlimited.  Progress depends above all else on the success of our efforts to promote and stimulate economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> The local authority sector makes particularly heavy demands on resources. In compensation this sector confers immense benefits on the community in terms of good housing of our people, good roads for movement of persons and goods, adequate water supplies for domestic, agricultural and industrial uses, sewage and waste disposal arrangements, and a host of other services which are indispensable to modern society.</P>
    <P>In 1978, the Department of the Environment will spend more than £550 million, and all but about £30 million of this vast sum will be disbursed through the local authorities, county councils, county boroughs and other urban authorities.  The local authorities, however, will be raising from their own resources not much more than about £150 million of the estimated £520 million they will spend this year. The Government are providing to the local authorities the balance of £370 million.  This comes by way of grants and capital from the Local Loans Fund.  What could be a clearer manifestation of the Government's commitment towards services which are so important to the life and welfare of every citizen?</P>
    <P>This year sees a major new grant to local authorities.  More than £800 million is being provided to compensate them for the income they are foregoing on rates on domestic and certain other properties.  In accordance with the Government's manifesto undertaking, rates have been abolished from 1 January this year.  Over the past 15 to 20 years much consideration has been given to ways and means of easing the burden of rates on house-holders. It is probably fair to observe, however, that until the Fianna Fáil initiative to abolish domestic rates entirely, neither the many grandiose proposals nor the limited reliefs on rates actually granted really contributed fundamentally to remedying this situation.</P>
    <P>The election manifesto pinpointed the level of unemployment as a real threat to our future.  The recent White Paper on National Development saw <Col N="1480" /> the increasing of employment as a major national aim.  The Government have done more than expressed concern about unemployment.  They have matched their words with action. Measures implemented since the Government took office have been sufficient to attain the target for 1977 of a 5,000 reduction in unemployment.  The further job boosting measures announced in the budget will bring further sustained improvement towards getting unemployment to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>Much of the increased employment which will flow from the Government's action will come in areas for which the Minister and the Department of the Environment have responsibility.  Foremost is the building and construction industry.  The well-being of this vital industry is important for the economy as a whole. It is important for the employment it gives.  In the disastrous unemployment situation we inherited from the previous Government, no sector was worse than the building and construction industry.  Average monthly unemployment in the industry had practically doubled from 12,464 in 1973 to 24,500 in 1976.  An unprecedented peak of 25,901 building and construction workers on the live register was recorded in February 1977.  In June last, unemployment in general building was running at about 25 per cent.  In other construction industries unemployment was at a level of somewhat less than 20 per cent. These figures compare with an unemployment rate of 11.6 per cent for all industrial groups.</P>
    <P>One of the platforms of our manifesto was a promise to act swiftly to remedy this situation.  I am glad to say that, in this as in most other undertaking we gave, we delivered on our promise with the minimum of delay.  In less than a month, the Government had approved proposals for extra expenditure on roads, water and sewerage supply schemes, hospital building, environmental works and local improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment also announced the introduction of <Col N="1481" /> the £1,000 new house grant scheme and the raising of the maximum loan and income limits for local authority house purchase.  Builders demonstrated how anxiously they had been awaiting such positive moves to bring some life into a declining industry.  They reacted almost immediately to the fillip given to the industry.  With the new air of confidence being shown, the desired jobs began to come on stream. I believe that confidence played a vital part in this operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has referred already to the achievements to be attained in job creation in the building and construction industry by the end of the year, some of which bear repeating.  The specific measures introduced by the Government, involving expenditure of approximately £5 million resulted in the creation of 1,670 direct, on-the-site jobs, off-site or spin-off jobs in ancillary industries, are estimated at another 500.  A further 1,000 jobs are estimated to have been created in house building as a result of the increased loan and income limits applicable to house purchase from local authorities and a scheme of grants for first-time owner/occupiers of new houses.</P>
    <P>These very satisfactory results vindicated our contention that the building and construction industry is one of the most fruitful areas for the injection of extra investment when there is an acute unemployment problem. This is why we are continuing this year our programme of massive public financial support for the industry.  This year's public capital programme shows capital expenditure of £458 million affecting the building and construction industry in 1978.  That amount represents an increase of 23 per cent on the corresponding provision for 1977.  It is estimated that as a direct result up to approximately 5,000 extra jobs could well be created this year.</P>
    <P>That is a very significant figure.  I must emphasise that these are on-site jobs.  It can be expected that there will be consequent off-site jobs in the manufacture of building materials and other service areas of nearly one third as many jobs again.  By any yardstick <Col N="1482" /> that amounts to a substantial number of new jobs and more than fulfils the undertaking given in regard to employment in building and construction in our election manifesto. We are sufficiently realistic to know that what has been done will not be anything like enough to solve the unemployment problem in the building and construction industry, but we have made a start and we have the confidence of the people, which is vital to our efforts.  Hopefully we have created conditions in which the industry will expand its workforce with renewed confidence to enable it cope with the increased demand likely to arise as a result of the general improvement in the economy.</P>
    <P>So far I have concentrated on employment in the building and construction industry.  I should like to turn now to the question of output of the industry, its various sectors and the prospects for the industry in the next few years.  At present the output of the industry amounts to 14 per cent of the gross national product.  As we are all aware the import content of materials used is relatively low.  Employment is given to approximately 100,000 people.  Output reached a peak in 1973, declined drastically in 1974 and 1975 and began to recover about a year ago.  In our White Paper on National Development, 1977-1980, we indicated that the total output of the industry is expected to increase significantly in real terms during that period.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the measures taken last July to boost employment. These measures had the effect of reversing what looked like being another disastrous year for the industry.  It is now estimated that output in 1977 increased by approximately 3½ per cent over that in 1976. The picture for 1978, in the light of the massive injections of public finance made by the Government to generate work in the industry, is even more encouraging.  As a result of the 23 per cent increase in capital allocations for the industry I have mentioned already, it is estimated that the total output of the industry in 1978 will increase substantially in real terms.  I have good reason to believe that the increase in <Col N="1483" /> output in the construction industry in 1978 as compared with 1977 will be unprecedented in the history of this State.  Although the industry as a whole is expected to show spectacular growth I am very pleased that considerable growth can be expected in 1978 in those areas of the industry for which the Department of the Environment are directly responsible, namely, housing, road works, public water supplies, sewerage schemes and miscellaneous environmental services. The allocation for these services is a massive 37 per cent up compared with the January 1977 allocation.  The number of houses completed in 1978 should show a continuation of the dramatic improvement in the rate of completions in the second half of 1977 after a bad slump in the first six months of that year.</P>
    <P>The other works mentioned are mainly of an infrastructural nature. They will facilitate industrial and agricultural expansion, so vital to our economic wellbeing.  So far as other sectors of the industry are concerned, in recent years agricultural building has shown the greatest rate of growth. Here output has risen from approximately £20 million in 1974 to an estimated £69 million in 1977.  It is expected that this rapid rate of growth will be maintained in 1978, thereby contributing directly to the agricultural expansion envisaged.  Output in educational building should also increase rapidly this year to meet the needs of the rising school-going population.</P>
    <P>Increase in output in other areas also are expected, including those of industrial building, hospitals and public buildings.  All told I am confident that, as a direct result of the measures taken by the Government to boost the industry, output in 1978 should undoubtedly reach a record level, when the industry might again enjoy a degree of prosperity which seemed unbelievable in the grim days of 1975-76 and early 1977.</P>
    <P>Before passing over from the Government's endeavours on job creation it is appropriate to refer to the involvement of the Department of the Environment <Col N="1484" /> with ventures proposed to stimulate youth employment.  The Minister has provided a special allocation of £5 million to finance youth employment schemes which have been put forward by the Employment Action Team set up by the Government to devise schemes for the employment of young people.  Two of the schemes suggested by this team and approved in principle by the Government will be operated by local authorities.  One of the schemes involves environmental improvement works and quite a few million pounds have been provided for it.  This will be a continuation of the scheme initiated by the Minister in late autumn 1977.  I am satisfied that these works will provide many lasting facilities of recreational and amenity value to the community.  It is important that they should provide lasting facilities.</P>
    <P>The second scheme will deal with the recruitment of additional apprentices by local authorities.  There is no doubt that achievement of the targets set out in the White Paper, National Development, 1977-1980, will create a demand for additional skilled workers.  This scheme will help meet that demand while giving an opportunity to school leavers to learn worthwhile trades such as plastering, plumbing, fitting and so on.  The only fear I have in relation to the expansion of the construction industry is that there may be a lack of skilled workers.  If such a situation arose it would be most unfortunate but the Government are taking all steps to encourage young people to acquire those skills and are providing the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>The priority which this Government attach to housing is obvious from the swift implementation of the many housing measures provided in the election manifesto.  In relation to private housing the allocation for housing grants for the current year has increased dramatically.  The provision for these grants in 1978 is £17 million. Compare that with the 1977 provision of only £4.95 million.  That gives an indication of what is happening.  Even that limited amount was not spent <Col N="1485" /> last year because of the restrictions placed on eligibility for new house grants and the valuation limits imposed for reconstruction grants.  The Government scheme of £1,000 new house grants will account for £10 million of the 1978 provision.  This means that 10,000 first time house owner occupiers are expected to benefit from the grants this year.  Many of those are young people who would otherwise find it impossible to buy their own homes. They would eventually have had to be rehoused by the local authorities after perhaps spending a considerable time living in undesirable conditions with adverse social consequences.</P>
    <P>The increased demand for houses has revitalised the private house building sector and the house construction industry.  The level of activity generated by the new scheme is evidenced by the fact that in the Department about 8,500 applications were received for the grant by the end of January.  In the election manifesto Fianna Fáil also promised to increase the maximum loan and income limits for local authority loans to realistic levels.  The limits had become unrelated to housing costs and income levels.  This was clear from the diminishing numbers of loan applications being received by local authorities and the decrease in the amount of money being paid out each year.  In pursuance of their promises the Government announced an increase in the maximum loan and income limits operative from the 26 May 1977 to £7,000 and £3,500 respectively.  The increase in the limits has resulted in a substantial upsurge in applications for loans.  This is a good indication of the success of the scheme. In 1978 there has been a very substantial increase in the amount of money allocated for house improvement grants.  The total sum provided is £6 million, which is almost three times the expenditure in 1977 under the old scheme of reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>The new scheme of house improvement grants was introduced last December and full details of the scheme were announced.  The maximum grants for all improvement works including the provision of water <Col N="1486" /> and sewerage services have been substantially increased right across the board.  There is no means test for applicants or valuation limits for houses to qualify for the new grants. The imposition of the valuation limit by the previous Government had disastrous effects.  In the short time since the new scheme was announced there has been a high level of interest by householders.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will have noted that the high level of allocation of capital resources to the local authority housing programme is continuing.  This is part of the special deal for the building and construction industry and for employment generally.  The allocation for 1978 is £80.77 million.  The rehousing of families who are in most urgent need remains a priority.  Output in all areas will be maintained at a level to encourage widespread investment and employment.</P>
    <P>The scheme of price controls on new houses, and the structural guarantee scheme do not frequently hit the headlines, although they are of great importance in ensuring that house purchasers get value for their money. The system to control new house prices was introduced by the previous Fianna Fáil Government in February 1973.</P>
    <P>When this Government introduced the £1,000 grant for new houses the controls on house prices were extended to all grant-type houses and flats.  Previously the controls were less wide ranging.  They applied only to houses in schemes of four or more and did not apply at all to flats.  By extending the controls the Government were ensuring that public funds were being used to aid the purchasers of reasonably-priced dwellings.  Purchasers of houses built individually and purchasers of flats are now afforded the same degree of consumer protection as applies in other cases.  The benefits of the system of price controls are not confined to first-time purchasers.  Any grant-type house or flat provided for sale and which does not otherwise qualify for exemption is deemed to be exempt from the payment of stamp duty only if there is attaching to it a valid certificate of reasonable value. <Col N="1487" /> This is a good and compelling reason for persons who are not first-time purchasers to ensure that there is such a certificate in respect of the dwelling concerned.</P>
    <P>There has been no fundamental change in the method of assessment of prices submitted by builders.  In the later months of last year and continuing into this year there has been a tendency towards an increase in the ratio of applications rejected.  This seems to be due primarily to builders settling their prices on the basis of the rate of inflation continuing in house building costs at the unprecedented high levels of 1974 to 1976.  There are no grounds for such an assumption. The index of house building costs&mdash; labour and materials&mdash;complied by the Department of the Environment shows an increase of only 3.3 per cent since July 1977.  Therefore, I would ask builders to ensure that the prices submitted by them take proper cognisance of the considerably reduced rate of inflation of house building costs and to moderate their prices accordingly.</P>
    <P>Unless they do so there will be an increase in the number of applications for certificates of reasonable value being rejected and there will be consequent inconvenience to builders and purchasers alike.  This is a situation we have no wish to see developing.</P>
    <P>The reductions achieved by the price control has not been unimpressive.  In 1977 reductions amounting to £668,000 were secured on 1,182 houses.  In 1976 the aggregate reductions for 1,391 houses was £451,000.  The number of applications or certificates received in 1977 was 1,115 covering 7,210 houses and flats.  At 31 December, 106 applications embracing 721 dwellings stood refused.</P>
    <P>I am concerned particularly that builders work within the system and, in so far as possible, built the grant-type dwelling.  My Department will cooperate with them in every way possible in issuing as speedily as we can the certificates of reasonable value.</P>
    <P>The desirability of having a form of structural guarantee for new private houses has been long recognised.  The <Col N="1488" /> purchase of a house is the greatest single investment most persons are ever likely to make and they may have to meet the cost of their investment for as long as 35 years.  The majority of purchasers are not conversant with good building practices.  Most builders are reputable and provide an after sale service for a limited period but there have been complaints and it was necessary that some steps be taken in this regard.  The result has been the introduction on 4 January last by the Construction Industry Federation of a scheme of structural guarantees.  This scheme was introduced with the co-operation of the Department of the Environment.  The Department will be involved in the scheme at technical level through the inspection service of all houses covered by the guarantee. Two departmental observers will attend meetings of the guarantee company formed to administer the scheme. There are a number of notable features to be observed in the scheme.  There is the partnership between the Department and house builders in the scheme's development and operation. There is its voluntary nature and this has enabled the scheme to become operative speedily without legislation and also to have the flexibility needed in a new venture such as this.</P>
    <P>A further welcome aspect of the scheme is that it involves the registration of house builders who have the technical and financial capacity to undertake good building and who are prepared to stand over their work.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the guarantee will be the responsibility of the guarantee company.  The Department will not be involved in any dispute that may arise between builders, the guarantee company and purchasers. There is arbitration machinery for dealing with disputes.  I trust sincerely that the scheme will receive all-round support and will be given due recognition by the lending agencies. It is very important that this be the case if the scheme is to operate successfully.</P>
    <P>The area of physical planning and development is one in which I hope to be involved deeply.  The commitment of the Government to the protection <Col N="1489" /> and improvement of the environment is evidenced in the decision to vest in the Department of the Environment an over-all function in environmental matters.  The environment impinges on practically every area of our existence. For this reason it would not be possible for any one Department to deal adequately with all matters pertaining to it.  However, it is appropriate that the Department having responsibility for the local authority sector, which provide a range of environmental services as well as operating the physical planning code, should have the major role.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976, are concerned with the physical environment and are comprehensive in this regard.  The Acts provide the framework with in which objectives for the promotion of development, the revitalisation of cities and towns, the provision, improvement and protection of amenities can be formulated. The basic planning legislation enshrined in the 1963 Act was reviewed and updated by the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the An Bord Pleanála as an independent body to decide on planning appeals followed from the 1976 Act.  My party supported fully this legislation.  Since An Bord Pleanála took over responsibility for planning appeals, the backlog of appeals which previously built up has been considerably reduced.  On 15 March 1977, when the board first began dealing with appeals, the number on hands was 2,177.  The board received 2,705 new appeals up to the end of 1977.  It disposed of 3,198 in the same period.  In the first nine-and-a-half months of its existence the board has reduced the number awaiting decision by 493 or nearly 23 per cent.  I should like to take this opportunity of commending the board on this achievement.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of planning legislation in 1964, the main activity of planning authorities has been in the area of enforcement of planning control.  Arising from this undue emphasis has been focused on the negative functions of the authorities and the negative side of legislation in the area of physical planning.  This is <Col N="1490" /> totally at variance with the role the Government see for the local authority sector in the promotion of economic activity and the provision of jobs and homes and I personally would like to see each county council and county borough corporation regarding themselves as having a role of a development corporation.  The powers vested in planning authorities are positive and wide-ranging.  They are aimed at encouraging the authorities to promote activity through their participation, either on their own or in association with individuals or commercial concerns, in developments which promote the physical, economic and social well-being of their areas.</P>
    <P>The development plan is the basis of all physical development.  If we are to meet the demands of a growing population for houses, jobs, community and recreational facilities, the need for first-quality development plans is evident. The first five years of review of the development plan has now been completed in most areas.  It is expected that review will be completed in the remaining areas in the near future. Furthermore, the majority of plans are now being reviewed for the second time.  The objective of physical planning legislation and of the development plans is to secure a satisfactory physical environment for living and working for our communities.  The review of plans, which must be carried out at least once in every five years, enables the general public and local organisations to play an active part in the planning process. I would encourage people to make their views on the planning and development of their localities known to the planning authority in good time and to avail of the opportunity to examine the draft plans during the three months they are on public display.  I would also encourage planning authorities to give local community groups every opportunity of contributing to the review. Authorities should ensure that the plans are in format and content readily intelligible to the public and to developers.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the aims, objectives and requirements of the authority should be set out in clear and unambiguous terms.  It is only by <Col N="1491" /> the involvement of the community at an early stage in the planning process that their support in the implementation of the objectives of the plan can be achieved.  In this way the plan itself becomes more relevant to the public generally.</P>
    <P>Considerable problems have arisen in recent years from the development of housing estates by private developers and the extension of suburban areas adjoining existing towns.  These problems lie in the completion of these estates to a satisfactory standard and in the provision of recreational and community facilities to serve the new communities. The Government are committed to the improvement of facilities in all new urban developments.  In relation to private sector developments, planning authorities should ensure that at the planning stage adequate security is given and clear, precise conditions are attached to the planning permission and thereafter enforced to ensure that roads, footpaths, lighting, open spaces, numerous other aspects, are provided and completed by the developer before the houses are occupied.  In purchasing their homes young families make considerable sacrifices.  It is not good enough that they should be burdened with an inadequate environment because the developer has not met his obligations for the completion of the estate.</P>
    <P>I have referred earlier to the need for first-quality development plans to provide an adequate framework within which the Government's targets for economic development can be achieved. The regional development organisations have an important role to play here.  These organisations were set up in 1969.  Their main function is to co-ordinate programmes for regional development in each region.  Their value rests on their ability to tackle problems at regional level.  They can reconcile priorities and harmonise development programmes so that local planning may be more effectively co-ordinated.  They facilitate local participation in regional development and present a regional view.</P>
    <P>The organisations are made up of elected representatives and officials <Col N="1492" /> for the local authorities in the region and representatives of Government Departments together with representatives of the various semi-State bodies operating in the region, such as the Industrial Development Authority, the ESB, CIE, Bord na Móna.  It will be clear therefore that their structure is such as to enable them to make a worthwhile contribution towards regional development and I sincerely hope that they will continue to do so. They have played, and continue to play, an important part in assisting their relevant local authorities and other bodies in co-ordinating their development plans and investment programmes. In doing this the organisations have carried out or initiated many worthwhile studies in the field of land use, transportation, population, employment trends and future needs in many fields.  I am glad to say that the EEC has recognised the value of such studies and is contributing half the cost of a study at present being carried out in the midlands region which is designed to produce a strategy for development in the 1980's for that region.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in introducing the budget referred to the termination of the Road Fund system. As a consequence of that, certain expenditures formerly payable from the fund will be met from the Votes for appropriate Departments and in particular from the Vote for the Department of the Environment.  These matters will arise for discussion on the Estimates debates.  I feel it proper, however, to refer in this debate to certain of these items which came within my responsibilities as Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The computerisation of vehicle registration is proceeding at a faster pace than had been anticipated two years ago.  This is a direct consequence of the abolition by this Government of the road tax on the majority of private cars and on all motor cycles.  By the end of next year we should have a complete national file.  This will be of great benefit in security matters, in the improvement of road traffic law and for the ready promotion and assessment of statistical data.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> We will be spending almost a quarter of a million pounds on the promotion of road safety through the National Road Safety Association. The provisional road accident figures for 1977 show that 576 people were killed and 8,099 were injured on our roads.  The figure for deaths is 51 up on the total for 1976, an increase of almost 10 per cent.  A much sharper increase&mdash;almost 50 per cent&mdash;was recorded in the Dublin Garda Metropolitan area.  While the total of 576 is lower than in any of the years 1972 to 1975, it is nevertheless a reversal of the downward trend in road deaths which had been evident since 1972.  Even more disturbing is the fact that road deaths in the second half of 1977 at 344 were the highest on record for a half-year period.  I am dismayed at these figures.  One is horrified at the sense of loss and shock suffered by the bereaved.  The pain and suffering occasioned to those injured in road accidents is appalling.</P>
    <P>Consideration must also be given to the economic consequences of accidents.  The cost of road accidents in terms of medical services, Garda costs, damage to property and loss of output can be estimated.  It has been estimated at some £40 million in 1976 by An Foras Forbartha.  With more people killed and injured during 1977, and allowing for the inevitable increases in costs, the fact is that the community will face an even more staggering bill for road accidents in 1978.  Material damage to cars involves the importation of spare parts and components with an adverse effect on our balance of payments.  Finally, there is the effect of accidents on motor insurance.  There is no need for me to explain the benefit which would ensue for motorists' insurance premiums if road accidents could be drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>I know that the responsible authorities&mdash;the Garda, An Foras Forbartha and the National Road Safety Association&mdash;are putting a tremendous amount of effort into grappling with the road safety problem. As far as I am concerned, I will support their efforts to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>In that context of road safety I want <Col N="1494" /> to refer to the operations of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  The bureau plays a most important role in the analysis of blood and urine samples, by which blood alcohol content is measured in the case of persons suspected of driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  As the House knows, it is proposed to introduce new legislation in this matter in the very near future.  At this stage, I can assure the House that the Medical Bureau are continuing their work of research to assist us in making decisions towards reducing the appalling effects of drunken driving.</P>
    <P>One of my particular areas of concern is research.  I have already referred to the size of the expenditures for which the Department of the Environment and the local authority sector are responsible.  We must obtain the best possible results for these outlays. We must take all available steps to ensure that the various programmes continue to fulfil their purpose and that they do so as effectively and efficiently as possible.  We need to keep fully abreast of the community's needs, with developing technology, with the best international practice and developments and so on.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha are the focal point of research in the areas of activity of the Department of the Environment.  An Foras are financed almost exclusively by the Exchequer. This year they will get in excess of £1¼ million.  Research is undertaken by An Foras in the fields of physical planning, construction, road traffic and safety, water resources and general environmental matters.  The results of this valuable work are generally published in reports which are then available to local authorities, Government Departments and other interested persons.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should now mentioned some of the specific projects undertaken by An Foras.  This will clearly illustrate the importance of the work being done.  In the planning area subjects include office location, impact of oil and gas development and urban design.  They operate a conservation and amenity advisory service for planning authorities.  The water resources division plays an important role in the <Col N="1495" /> collection of data on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of our waters. This data is essential for the efficient planning and utilisation of national water resources.  On the building side, work is being done on such matters as energy-use in housing, the rationalisation of conditions of building contracts and so on.  Research into the design and construction of roads, road traffic management, and road safety matters is part of the ongoing work programme.  An Foras provide assistance in planning and organising traffic censuses and in the compilation of road traffic and accident statistics. Achievement of the Government's objectives for the environment will require continuing effort by An Foras in providing research and advice on problems to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I am sure that everyone believes firmly that this budget is one which will play a major role in getting this country moving again.  That is the reason people returned Fianna Fáil to Government under our Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch&mdash;for the sole purpose of getting the country moving again and restoring confidence.  I believe that the provisions of this budget will play a major and vital role in achieving the aims and aspirations of the Irish people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> It is very difficult to be original at this stage in speaking on a budget that has been widely discussed in a debate carried on over several weeks, a budget that  has been the subject of many comments and discourses.  The annual debate on a budget gives an opportunity to the House to assess the Government's economic and social strategy because it is the mechanism through which the House and the country get an idea of the techniques and methodology of the Government in regard to economic and social development.</P>
    <P>This budget and the debate on it place special emphasis on economic development and more specifically on job creation.  It is the 17th annual budget for which I have had the privilege of being a Member of this House and I have contributed to the debate on most of them.  This budget is unique in one respect; it is the first during my membership of the Dáil where a new dimension has been added to the whole matter of national economic development.  The budget has been described by members of the Opposition and commentators outside the House and by the Minister who more than anybody else can be regarded as the architect of the economic strategy, Deputy O'Donoghue, as a gamble.</P>
    <P>This element of gambling makes this budget unique.  If the budget is a gamble then the prospects of making it pay off will depend on the ability and competence of the Government to discharge their collective responsibility and on the ability of key Ministers to discharge their responsibilities successfully.  I have grave doubts that the Government are capable of pulling off the gamble.  Many people outside and many independent commentators have also expressed reservation about the Government's ability to bring off this major gamble.  I am not convinced, and I would go so far as to say at this stage, that I see no way in which the present Government can pull off this gamble because while we are here talking about budgetary strategy, economic development and job creation, an appalling national crisis is taking place.  What is the good of forecasts for job creation, talking about environmental factors which the Minister <Col N="1497" /> of State has just dealt with, if, when we go to our offices we cannot make a telephone call a few miles outside Dublin?</P>
    <P>Whether the gamble will come off or not depends on the competence and ability of the Government and the only way we can assess the prospects is to look at the Government's performance since they took office last June.  In the field of job creation and economic development there are vital prerequisites.  If we are to have an acceleration of industrial and economic development, we must have the infrastructure that is so vitally necessary. There are vital elements in that infrastructure and they are elements on which I have the honour to be spokesman in my party, the elements of transport and communication.</P>
    <P>There is another element involved, the element of industrial relations, and the Government's record since they took office in this vital area of industrial relations is absolutely appalling. Through sheer fumbling, incompetence and a lack of appreciation and understanding of industrial relations, we had last November the worst industrial disaster to hit the country since the State was founded, the closure of the Ferenka plant.  Today we have an even greater national disaster in the complete chaos that exists in the telecommunications sector of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. We talk about creating a climate of investment; we have abolished the wealth tax to attract more investment, supposedly; a massive campaign is being mounted abroad to encourage industrialists to come here and yet, in the past week, industrialists and businessmen in vital export industries have had to charter aircraft to go to England or Northern Ireland to make telephone calls.</P>
    <P>Let us be realistic and face facts: if there is not to be a good climate of industrial relations here, how can we have the massive acceleration in job creation and economic development, particularly industrial development which is outlined in the budget? Responsibility for the disastrous events which led up to the closure of Ferenka in the final analysis rests with the Government that completely mishandled <Col N="1498" /> and bungled the situation. Responsibility for the fact that people cannot make a telephone call, that industries cannot transact their business, that exporters cannot secure vital orders&mdash;responsibility for that chaos, in the final analysis, rests with the Government.  We have had an extra-ordinary situation regarding this national crisis in the telecommunications field in that the Minister in that Government, the head of the Department that has specific responsibility for industrial relations, the Minister for Labour, has been conspicuous by his silence and obvious inactivity in relation to this telecommunications issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I never break the rules of the House, but we are discussing a budget.  This is the annual debate on economic strategy.  We are discussing a budget which in this instance lays special emphasis on job creation.  How can we have job creation if we have not proper industrial relations and adequate telecommunications?  This is the question I am posing.</P>
      <P>There is a third factor, a third blunder which this Government have made since they took office.  That was the decision, inspired by pure party political vindictiveness, to reveal a confidential agreement in respect of the Bula Company.  One vital element in industrial development here is confidentiality. It is an element on which most businessmen, Irish or foreign, place the greatest emphasis.</P>
      <P>Looking at the incompetence and bungling of this Government in relation to the Ferenka situation, to Bula and to the mishandling of the telecommunications dispute, we cannot have confidence.  At this stage I doubt if anybody in the country has confidence in the ability of this Government to pull off the gamble represented in this budget.  Again at this late stage I appeal to the Government, the Taoiseach, the Minister for posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Labour to bring to an end this chaotic situation in the communications area and get these people back to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been very much emphasis in this budget on job creation.  There has been an extra-ordinary, although welcome, change of attitude in economic thinking by Fianna Fáil of late, when there is now recognition of the importance of small industry, and of our agriculture, fisheries and other natural resources. It is a great pity that this emphasis on our natural resources, particularly agriculture and fisheries and on the importance of small industry, was not put on these areas 15 or 20 years ago. During the 1960s there was a world economic boom and industry was being established at an accelerated pace in this country as well as in others.  There was a golden opportunity then to develop the full potential of the two greatest natural resources we have, our agriculture and our fisheries.  The Fianna Fáil Party who comprise the Government of this State today must stand condemned because over the years the potential for development, for job creation and for exports that existed in our agriculture and fisheries was totally overlooked.  During the 1960s in particular when there was tremendous opportunity, instead of priority being given to the development of agriculture, fisheries and food processing industries based on these natural resources, we had the farmers marching to Dublin, picketing Leinster House and sitting in front of the Department of Agriculture.  Now we have the belated conversion of Fianna Fáil to recognising the importance of agriculture and of fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our agriculture industry is the greatest natural resource we have.  It is a resource the potential of which, particularly for job creation, has not been fully tapped as yet.  There is tremendous scope there for the development of food technology and food-processing industry based on agriculture and on fisheries.  In relation to fisheries, our second great natural resources, it is regrettable that a situation should have arisen where the fishermen have to tie up their boats and come to Dublin to-day to protest against the mishandling <Col N="1500" /> by the Minister for Fisheries of the EEC fisheries negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishing industry has been neglected scandalously down through the decades.  During the four years when I had the privilege of being Minister for the Gaeltacht I had an opportunity of looking at this major national industry, because of course a substantial proportion of muintir na Gaeltachta derive their livelihood from the fishing industry.  It was quite apparent that after 50 years of native Government the surface of the fishing industry had merely been scratched. Speaking on the Industrial Development Bill some months ago I said that for a small island surrounded by the sea and rich fisheries we had very little fish processing.  A year ago I had the privilege of seeing the first fish cannery in this country opened in the Donegal Gaeltacht.  If we are serious about the problem of job creation and creating full employment for a growing population, we must place very special emphasis on the development of these two great national resources, agriculture and fisheries.</P>
      <P>I have expressed concern already about certain aspects of the performance of this Government since they took office.  I have expressed grave concern about the industrial relations' situation, the state of telecommunications, and the revelation of the Bula deal, but another situation of very special significance has developed in relation to the whole question of job creation.  Over the past couple of months there appears to be a complete change of policy in relation to two very important aspects of national development, decentralisation and regional development.  I can talk in a non-party political way on these concepts because, in recent years, there has been a recognition by successive Governments of the need for decentralisation and regional development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particularly in recent weeks in statements from the Minister for Industry, <Col N="1501" /> Commerce and Energy and in public statements from the chief executive of the IDA, there is evidence that there is a change of emphasis and a laying aside of the policy of regional development and decentralisation which has worked very well.  The first indication of this change of policy comes from a statement by the head of the IDA that special emphasis is now to be given to Dublin and the east coast in relation to job creation.  Nobody objects to a job creation programme for Dublin or the east coast, provided it is not at the expense of the much less developed regions of the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>I am extremely perturbed and most people who are involved and interested in the whole question of regional development are extremely perturbed by recent statements and particularly the announcement here by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy some weeks ago that the functions of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, an outstanding regional development agency who made a tremendous contribution to the development of the mid-western region, are now being curtailed and confined exclusively almost to the promotion of small industries which the Minister described as small indigenous industries.  It would take a very big number of small indigenous industries to replace the 1,400 jobs lost in Ferenka.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service in a speech in some western venue referred to the decision of the Government to drop the concept of western development. There was a recent public statement from the chief executive of Gaeltarra Éireann, another very successful regional development agency, which expressed grave concern at the fact that it was becoming virtually impossible now for Gaeltarra to attract industrialists to the Gaeltacht because of the fact that the differential in grants and inducements which was available hitherto was no longer there.  In other words, the same attractions and inducements, virtually the same grants structure, is now being offered to an industrialist to locate in the capital city <Col N="1502" /> of Dublin as is offered to him to locate in Belmullet, Ballinskelligs, Carna or Dingle.  There is no way one can justify a national development policy of this kind.</P>
    <P>Like cities and regions all over the western world, the capital city of Dublin suffered adversely from the effects of the world economic recession in 1974 and 1975, but there is no way one can equate the problems of industrial development in a capital city like Dublin with the problems of locating industry in more isolated and remote areas.  Perhaps we are misinterpreting the intentions of the Government in this respect but, if there is a departure&mdash;and there appears to be from what I have said about the definite pronouncements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce <i>vis-á-vis</i> SFADCo, and a statement by the Minister of State, Deputy MacSharry&mdash;that is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The decision to curtail the activities of SFADCo is causing grave concern over the entire mid-western region. Many tributes have been paid to SFADCo as a successful regional development agency.  Now we have the ludicrous situation that SFADCo are responsible for the promotion of small industries and the IDA will be responsible for bringing large-scale industries into the Shannon region.  Surely logic and common sense would indicate that SFADCo should become not merely the industrial development agency for that region but that they should be expanded and their powers and functions broadened to make them a comprehensive regional development agency responsible for promoting all types of industries, small, medium and large. I hope when the Minister for Finance is replying to this debate he will give us some indication as to where the Government stand on the concept of decentralisation and regional development.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Ghaeltacht, mar adúirt me, tá sé soiléir anois go bhfuil deacrachtaí faoi leith ag Gaeltarra Éireann. Maidir le forbairt tionscail agus fostaíocht san Ghaeltacht, tá brón ormsa a fheiceáil ó Leabhar na Meastachán go bhfuil laghdú mór i gcuid den mheastachán sin.  Tá glan-laghdú thar <Col N="1503" /> £1/2 milliún ann agus tá laghdú níos mó ar fad ar an deontas a tugtar do Ghaeltarra Éireann chun tionscail a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.  I 1973 nuair a tháinig an Comhrialtas i mbun oifige bhí 1,843 daoine fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht i dtionscail fé scáth Ghaeltarra Éireann.  I lár 1977 bhí breis is 4,000 daoine fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá sé soiléir anois nach bhfuil an dul chun cinn céanna á dhéanamh ach ní thuigimse cén fáth, mar idir 1973 agus 1977 bhí deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta ag brú isteach orainn go mór.  Bhí sé an-deacair ar fad tionscail a fháil.  Bhí sean-tionscail ag dúnadh.  Bhí dífhos-taíocht i dtionscail eile ach mar sin féin, mar adúirt me, d'éirigh thar barr le Gaeltarra Éireann fostaíocht a mhéadú ó 1,800 go breis agus 4,000. Níl deacrachtaí eacnamíochta an domhain ag brú isteach orainne faoi láthair.  Níl aon leithscéal ann agus ní thuigimse cén fáth nach féidir le Gaeltarra Éireann an dul chun cinn céanna a dhéanamh maidir le forbairt tionscail agus fostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht a rinne siad idir 1973 agus 1977.</P>
    <P>Rud eile faoin Ghaeltacht.  Bhí brón mór ormsa agus ag daoine eile ag éisteacht anseo leis an Aire Airgeadais agus é ag léamh an ráitis fhada a thug sé lá na cáináisnéise&mdash;ráiteas an-fhada ar fad timpeall 70 nó 80 leathanach agus ní dhearna sé tagairt ar bith don Ghaeltacht, tobar agus foinse ár dteanga agus ár gcultúr.  San Pháipéar Bán níl ach cúpla líne maidir leis an teanga, an cultúr agus an Ghaeltacht. Admhaím gur labhair an tAire as Gaeilge i ndeireadh a ráitis.  Tá ceithre nó cúig líne Gaeilge ann.  'Sé mo thuairimse, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, cé go bhfuil géarghá le forbairt eacnamaíochta agus cé go bhfuil géarghá le forbairt shóisialach agus tá géarghá le fostaíocht nua a chruthú sa tír seo, mar sin féin ní ceart dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh ar an teanga, an cultúr, agus go háirithe ní ceart dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh den Ghaeilge. Deirtear san Pháipéar Bán go bhfuil sé beartaithe ag an Rialtas Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú i mbliana.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil sé sin fíor ach ba mhaith liomsa a rá ag an bpointe seo nach bhfuil aon mhaitheas ar chor <Col N="1504" /> ar bith a bheith ag bunú udaráis nua nuair nach bhfuil go leor airgid agus comhachtaí ar fáil don údarás sin chun clár forleathan forbartha a chur chun cinn.  Ní thuigimse cén fáth go bhfuil laghdú ar Mheastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta i mbliana.  Ní thuigimse cén fáth nach ndearna an tAire Airgeadais aon tagairt don Ghaeltacht san ráiteas fada a thug sé anseo.  Tá súil agam agus is féidir liom a rá go mbeidh a lán tacaíochta ar fáil ón dtaobh seo den Teach d'aon scéim nó d'aon phlean chun leas na Gaeilge agus leas na Gaeltachta a chur cun cinn.</P>
    <P>In relation to economic planning and development and to the strategy outlined in the budget, particularly in the Minister's speech, and more specifically in relation to the speech of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, I have not found any reference to a very vital factor. I refer to the element of community development, an area of tremendous potential to this country.  It is an instrument of economic development and social progress to which increasing attention is being given in many countries in recent years.  We in this country pioneered the practical application of this concept of community development to economic and social development. The great pioneer of community development here was the late Canon Hayes, ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam, the man who founded Muintir na Tíre, the National Community Development Movement, a man who saw the potential in a local community working together co-operating with one another, promoting projects of an economic, social and cultural nature.  In relation to the Gaeltacht in particular, I am glad that this concept of community development is being applied in a successful manner.  There are today over 20 community development cooperatives engaged in a wide range of economic, social and cultural activity.</P>
    <P>One of the most astonishing facets of Gaeltacht development in my four years' experience was the manner in which a local community, properly motivated and led and receiving back-up services from the State, State bodies, semi-State bodies and local <Col N="1505" /> authorities could achieve such tremendous things.  I need only point to Glencolumcille and the tremendous pioneering work of Fr. McDyer.  I could point also to Comharchumann Dhúiche Sheoigeach in West Connemara, and to Comharchumann na n-Oileán i gceantar Gorumna i litir Móir agus Leitir Mealláin.  I feel very deeply about the apparent lack of understanding by central authorities and State Departments of the potential for good and for progress inherent in this concept.  The latest figures I saw for Glencolumcille indicate now that, under the umbrella of the original co-operative, there are now 11 companies engaged in industrial development, craftwork, tourism development and the development of natural resources. If my memory serves me correctly, there must be approximately 200 people in fulltime employment in that parish.  If that could be repeated in every parish throughout the length and breadth of the country&mdash;and I see no reason why it could not be&mdash; then rapid and dramatic progress could be made in coming to grips with the very serious national problem confronting us, that of creating full employment for a growing population.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Government, and particularly the Minister for Economic Planning and Development &mdash;who is being portrayed as the chief architect of the Government's policy&mdash; that they direct attention to three areas, first, the policy of decentralisation, secondly, the need for regional development and, thirdly, the vitally important role that community development can play in the overall development of this nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds, referring to the importance of small scale industry, mentioned that the small industry of today is the big industry of tomorrow. I welcome the emphasis that has been placed on the development of small scale industries.  No proposal should ever be turned down on the basis that the industry is too small.  I am in favour of maximum support and State aid being given to one-man industries, particularly craft type industries.  If we are to achieve our national objective of generating employment on a scale and <Col N="1506" /> of a variety which will satisfy the aspirations of our young people, we should not over-emphasise one type of development and ignore the possibilities of other types of development.  We will have to have a broad development strategy with special emphasis on agriculture, fisheries and on our natural resources.  We need a comprehensive national industrial development programme.</P>
    <P>I did not see any evidence in the Minister's speech or in the White Paper which would lead one to believe that the Government are serious when they talk about creating full employment for a growing population. Targets and plans are all right in their own way and are necessary, but there is no point in fixing targets for output or employment unless one clearly charts out the road which must be travelled in order that those targets be achieved.  Such criticisms were levelled at the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion.  The targets were set but the route was not charted.</P>
    <P>Having read the Fianna Fáil Manifesto and having compared the promises and hopes that were raised by the manifesto with the Government White Paper, and relating it to the Minister's speech introducing this budget, I can definitely see a credibility gap.  One of the phrases in the Fianna Fáil Manifesto which caught the attention of many people, and which may have more than anything else brought about a major swing of votes to Fianna Fáil, was the extrordinary phrase under a chapter dealing with industry and commerce that there were tens of thousands of new jobs only waiting to be created.  There is nothing in the White Paper, in the Minister's budget speech or in the overall budgetary strategy which gives any indication of how the Government propose to generate the tens of thousands of new jobs that are only waiting to be created, according to the election manifesto.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of discussion, most of it academic, in respect of the roles of the public and the private sectors in relation to national development and job creation.  Most people talking about the role of the private <Col N="1507" /> sector <i>vis-á-vis</i> the role of the public sector tend to take a firm stand on one side or the other.  Very often the people who are proponents or advocates of the private sector are referred to as capitalists and those who advocate public enterprise are referred to as socialists.  The strategy in this budget places the major emphasis on the private sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. O'Leary mentioned some time ago that there was a substantial job creation programme for jobs in the public sector.  The jobs that are being created in the public sector as a result of this budget are once off jobs that cannot be repeated, certainly on the same scale, in the future.  We must not lose sight of the fact that it is estimated that for every job created in the public sector there is need to create at least three jobs in the private sector to support them. I do not have any ideological hangup in relation to State enterprise and private enterprise being contradictory. In a small country like this we must strike a proper balance between private enterprise and public enterprise. There are areas that the private sector are either unable or unwilling to enter, and we have quite a good history here in relation to the public sector with companies such as the Irish Sugar Company, the Electricity Supply Board, Bord na Móna and Aer Lingus.  We must not provoke a national controversy on the role of the private sector <i>vis-á-vis</i> the role of the public sector.  What is needed is a correct balance between the two. I do not like using the word &ldquo;mix&rdquo; but it is a word that has crept in recent years into economic terminology. However, it is as good a word as any to describe the proper mixture of public and private enterprise and I do not think that either the budget or the White Paper have this mix in their strategy.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this, the first budget of the new Fianna Fáil Government who were elected so decisively in June last. The budget is an imaginative and a constructive effort to set the country moving again after four years of appalling unemployment, price rises and inflation.  It is an undisputed fact that the single most important task facing the Government is the finding of employment for the huge army of people who have either lost their jobs or who, having finished school, with what is regarded as a reasonable level of education, have not succeeded in obtaining any type of employment.</P>
      <P>It is distressing and totally unacceptable to find families where not only the father has become redundant but where there are several teenagers unable to find employment.  I am hopeful that the budget will go a long way to rectifying such situations.</P>
      <P>Listening to some of the Opposition speakers one finds it difficult to understand how they can accuse us of not implementing the manifesto promises and at the same time accuse us of over-implementing those promise. They cannot have it both ways.  They have suggested that the country had been doing very well, that we should have left well-enough alone.  The electorate would hardly agree with their view.  The last budget introduced by the Coalition was supposed to be a panacea for all people but we found that in the following 60 days there were price increases in respect of 123 items.  In about October 1975 one of our evening newspapers began publishing a weekly price clock index.  During the remaining months of that year, throughout 1976 and for the first half of 1977 that clock continued to spin at an incredible rate but I am happy to say that since Fianna Fáil returned to office the clock has been slowing down and is now virtually at a standstill.  Indeed, in the past couple of months several items have been reduced in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> In March of last year I recall speaking with a housewife at a super-market where she was standing before the vegetable department endeavouring to decide on what she could afford for the evening meal.  We did not know each other but she began telling me how her husband who had a small business employing about eight people had been forced to go out of business because of inflation.  The woman was understandably very distressed and went on to tell me that her husband had been doing very well in his business in the previous couple of years.  Not only was that man's family left in distress but so also were the families of the eight men he had been employing.</P>
    <P>However, industry is rapidly regaining confidence under this Government and I am sure that employers in every category will avail of the job-creation incentives that have been introduced. In this regard I welcome particularly the increase in the employment scheme for school-leavers from £10 to £14 per week and also the inclusion of the hotels and catering industry generally in the main scheme of £20.  I trust, though, that potential employers wishing to avail of the incentive schemes will realise that the £14 or the £20 per week are only contributions towards a fair week's pay.  I note that last year only £0.8 million was used under these schemes.  The provision in the budget is £7 million.  It would appear from those figures that some publicity might encourage firms to expand and to create new jobs which, hopefully, would be permanent if and when the schemes have run their course.  I suggest that there be put into effect an advertising campaign on radio and television explaining fully all aspects of the various schemes and grants in operation.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time with the very high rate of unemployment in the Ballyfermot area. During the past three years the rate of redundancies among men in their forties has been exceptionally high and there is hardly any household in the area in which there is not an unemployed teenager.  The provision of <Col N="1510" /> financial assistance towards the cost of a community-based survey aimed at bringing to light the unemployment problems in Ballyfermot is particularly welcome.  The employment action team have met with representatives of the Ballyfermot Community Association for the purpose of discussing matters of mutual concern.  The association have established an employment action group with the objective of tackling the enormous unemployment problem in the area.  To undertake this task effectively it will be necessary in the first instance to collect detailed information of the overall current employment situation.  It is estimated that this community-based survey will provide short-term employment for more than 40 young people at an approximate cost of £9,140.  I would expect the survey to stimulate the Government and the IDA into creating more job opportunities for the people of Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>The tax free allowance for working married women remains at £230.  Many people were disappointed that the figure was not increased.  Before they marry, both men and women receive their tax forms separately but it is not unusual for a woman, after she has married, to continue to receive a tax form in her maiden name while receiving one also in her married name. This situation can continue for several years and a woman can have a difficult task in convincing the tax people that she is the same individual as the person to whom the tax form is being sent in what was her maiden name.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that it would cost the Exchequer £60 million to tax separately husbands and wives. I am hoping he will clarify this.  Does he mean there would be a loss of £60 million revenue to the Exchequer or does he mean that it would cost £60 million to implement the change in the tax system?</P>
    <P>A working wife, particularly if she has a family, can be expected to contribute almost twice as many hours per week as her husband. Generally speaking, it is she who is expected to catch up with the household chores, to do the shopping, laundry, ironing and the various other things that must be attended to while <Col N="1511" /> still maintaining her job outside the home.  If she is prepared to do this, and I realise it is a free choice, she should receive some recognition for her 80 hours plus per week.  Sometimes it is not a free choice.  Nowadays it can be quite impossible for young married couples to purchase and maintain their own home unless the wife continues with her job.  Many a young wife, particularly when a baby arrives, would dearly love to stay at home but finds it is just not possible to meet all the commitments on her husband's salary.</P>
    <P>The Minister has very generously increased the married person's allowance by £630 per annum, and this I welcome, but the working wife will still come home with a very small net pay packet and whether or not the average husband will contribute more to the household budget is debatable.</P>
    <P>When a woman marries she may retain her maiden name if she wishes. Surely, it would save the tax office a great deal of time, trouble and money if they were just to ignore the fact that that woman had adopted a second name and continued to treat her as an individual in her own right, as she was before she married.</P>
    <P>Working wives are only 3.5 per cent of the work force, which is a very small percentage indeed.  Obviously they are a section of our community with a high degree of energy and stamina and with a great deal to contribute in the careers they are pursuing, sometimes under a great deal of stress and difficulty. I hope that in the not-too-distant future the State will realise the need for properly staffed and equipped day nurseries where mothers can with safety and peace of mind leave their small children and so be enabled to give proper attention to their jobs during their working hours.  There are many people who disagree with this idea but I know from personal experience that babies actually gain and thrive from being in an environment where there are other small children. They learn faster and are in no way deprived.</P>
    <P>For every three of four working mothers an extra job could be created by the opening of a nursery.  The <Col N="1512" /> working wives are often accused of filling vacancies needed by single persons.  If these nurseries were established they would at least create other jobs and so the working wives would not be accused of taking jobs away from others.  Every individual should have the right to work, regardless of whether he or she is married or single.</P>
    <P>Of course, I welcome the news that single women and widows will now be eligible for unemployment assistance. I am particularly delighted that a Fianna Fáil Government have brought to an end the very blatant discrimination, but it is certainly not before its time.  When will we come to the realisation that when it suits certain situations men and women are treated equally?  For example, they both have to pay the same amount of money on the bus; they are both charged the same amount of money if they go into a restaurant for a cup of tea.  The woman has never been able to make the excuse that she does not get the same amount of money as the man and accordingly should have to pay less.</P>
    <P>The all round 10 per cent increase in social welfare will be reasonably practicable when the Government are so determined that inflation will be reduced and will not exceed around 7 per cent in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Widows with dependent children must be regarded as a very special category of persons.  When a wife dies it is tragic enough but at least the man still has the capacity to earn a decent living and to keep the home adequately provided for.  When the husband dies the income of that household dies with him.  One week there may be £100 per week coming into a house.  The next week it could drop to 25 per cent of that.  Where does that leave the woman with huge bills, funeral expenses, and God knows what else to pay?  She still has the same electricity bill and the same heating bill, the food bill, clothing bills and the expense of educating her family.  She has to undertake all this on perhaps one-quarter of her husband's salary and she has to do it on her own, to make matters worse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> A person who loses his job is entitled to pay-related income up to, I believe, 85 per cent for a certain length of time, to enable him to continue his commitments, such as mortgages and so on, and to give him an opportunity to reassess his situation without having to change his life style unduly.  Why cannot a widow be given a similar chance?  Perhaps at a future time the Government may consider some scheme whereby a widow suddenly finding herself with one-fourth of the income her husband was bringing home, might obtain a pay-related amount just for a few months in order to give her a chance to adjust to the change in her life and not be pushed into a panic situation where she might, under acute emotional stress make unwise decisions she might bitterly regret.  While I am pleading for a better deal for widows, I should like to include public service widows whose husbands died or retired pre-1968 and who are seeking equality of pension with those who were widowed post-1968. This Fianna Fáil Government are doing their best to do the greatest good to the greatest number of people. They are pursuing this objective with all haste and will continue to do so. In one short seven-month period we have accomplished more than the previous Government managed in four-and-a-half years.  We are all familiar now with the lengendary accomplishments, such as the abolition of rates, the abolition of car tax, the £1,000 grant towards the purchase of a new house.  I am particularly happy about the extra money for grants for house improvements, which the Minister of State, Deputy J. O'Leary, spoke about earlier.  These grants are very important and have been greatly increased in the last couple of months.  I welcome also the increased loan and income limits under the SDA scheme and the reduction of 1 per cent in interest rates.</P>
    <P>There was, I am afraid, one omission in the budget, at which I was very disappointed.  There was no increase in children's allowance.  The previous Minister for Finance was toying with the idea of doing away with the children's allowance altogether but there was such reaction that he had to drop that idea like a hot potato.  For many <Col N="1514" /> mothers this money is a life-saver.  It is the only money they receive directly into their hands and they rely on it for a variety of reasons.  Sometimes it is needed to pay doctors' bills or to pay for prescriptions for themselves and their children.</P>
    <P>Mothers are not entitled to social welfare benefits, so married women who do not go out to work outside the home are classified as &ldquo;not gainfully employed&rdquo; and are not entitled to any type of social welfare payments. Children's allowances constitute the only method whereby a wife and mother can be compensated for the fact that she is not working outside the home.  In my opinion these allowances should be increased to keep in line with inflation at least.  The payment of children's allowances is the only way the country and the Government can show their appreciation of the mothers who give so unselfishly of their time and energy in caring for their families.</P>
    <P>I do not know how true this is because I have not read it myself, but I believe the Minister might be looking into the question of changing the whole system for the payment of children's allowances.  I would agree with this.  It is quite obvious that some mothers are in more need than others, and perhaps some system could be devised whereby the wives of unemployed men and widows with school-going children would receive a bigger amount.  Both these categories, and some others as well, should be entitled to a more substantial increase than those who have a good wage coming in and who are not in so much need of children's allowances.  Perhaps the title might be changed to &ldquo;mothers' allowances&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the budget on which I should like to dwell but I realise they will be discussed by other speakers.  I wish to refer to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  I should like to make a special appeal to all women throughout the country to make a really big effort in this campaign.  I know that sometimes it is rather difficult to continue to search for an Irish-made product when a foreign one is more easily obtainable, but if we stop to consider that we are creating jobs for our own children, our friends and our relatives, <Col N="1515" /> is it not worth a little effort?  Some shop assistants are of the opinion that unless they stress that an article is made in France or in England a customer will not be interested in purchasing it.  I have encountered this attitude many times.  I have asked for an item of clothing&mdash;a jumper, perhaps&mdash;and the assistant has come along and shown me an article and told me that it was made in France or in England.  I usually say &ldquo;That is a pity.  Now I cannot buy it because I was looking for something made in Ireland.&rdquo;  The assistant usually stares at me with her mouth open and cannot understand this reaction.  I would hope that the general public will dispel this kind of idea during the coming year.  In the type of situation I have described I hope that they will insist that the shop should stock Irish-made goods.</P>
    <P>I have noted quite recently that certain types of packages imported into this country are very similar to our own Irish packaged goods.  They are very much the same in size and colour and it is quite easy to pick up one of them thinking that it is Irish made, only to find that it has been imported.  I would ask housewives to watch out for this type of situation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am looking forward to the coming year with hope and confidence in the economy and in the country.  This confidence was completely lost during the term of office of the previous Government.  We are getting the country moving again.  We did it after the last Coalition and I know we will do it after this one.</P>

I understood there was a tradition in this House in regard to the delivery of speeches but which has been breached on at least two occasions today on the Government side. While the Members on this side of the House will naturally make every possible allowance for new Members or for a crisis situation, I want to give the House notice that we will not acquiesce indefinitely in the breach of this convention in regard to the delivery <Col N="1516" /> of speeches.

      <P>I merely wished to say that if it developed into a practice this party could not be expected not to take notice of it.</P>
      <P>The present budget is the brainchild, nominally, of the Minister for Finance but it is acknowledged to be the product of a long-term economic perspective of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  While the budget has many aspects, not all of them ones with which I quarrel, I want to seize on one in particular which is the most conspicuous and the most damaging one nationally and, I believe, in the narrow sense also, the most damaging one politically for Fianna Fáil.  That is the abolition of wealth tax which the budget proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday of last week the Minister for Economic Planning and Development spoke on the budget, and once he had finished telling Deputy FitzGerald how a budget speech should be made by the Leader of the Opposition, he explained to the House that as far back as 1974 when the wealth tax was first proposed by the National Coalition he had been against it.  I accept that; he was against it for reasons which he held then and still holds, that it has not an economic value which justifies its existence. <Col N="1520" /> That is a reasonable point of view; but he did not relate the wealth tax to the circumstances of its introduction.</P>
    <P>I beg leave to remind the House of those circumstances.  If ever a Government had a clear mandate for the introduction of a wealth tax, even if not necessarily this wealth tax in its present form, the National Coalition had that mandate.  We undertook in 1973 to abolish death duties.  We did abolish them; and in our election programme we said they would be replaced, because of their erratic operation on death and the destructive effect they had on families taken short both emotionally and materially by the early loss of the father, by a slight tax on wealth during life.  That is what the wealth tax was intended to be.</P>
    <P>We abolished death duties, and little enough thanks we got, but there is no use whinging about that because that is part of the political game.  The wealth tax would never have been introduced by our Government or any other government if the death duties had not been abolished; it would be unthinkable that anybody, no matter how rich, would pay duties on his wealth during life as well as on his death.  It was part of a package. I am astonished when I hear the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or any Minister with any relevance in his post to this area, talking about the abolition of wealth tax without mentioning the form of duty which that tax replaced.</P>
    <P>Death duties were not an idea of the Costello or the de Valera or the Cosgrave Governments; they go back to 1894.  I cannot remember whether it was Gladstone's last Government or the one which succeeded it that produced them.  They go back to a time when Queen Victoria reigned in Britain.  They were introduced by the British Government of 1894 and, in abolishing death duties at that time, we were breaking an 80-year old tradition.  But now, by abolishing the wealth tax also, for the first time since 1894 wealth bears no capital imposition <Col N="1521" /> of any kind, either during life or on death.</P>
    <P>Nobody would suspect me of being a bloodshot revolutionary or a man with only one object in life, to distribute every speck of wealth in the country and spread it around evenly.  I do not believe in that ideology.  It is not practical and not even just, but I say there are purposes for which a wealth tax in life or on death is justifiable and right. These purposes are specially demanding and clear at times when people are conscious of underprivilege and of inequality of opportunity.  When I hear this Minister, in order to enthrone whose genius a special Department was created, saying it has no economic value, I must ask myself if we are living in fairyland.  Perhaps it does not produce much money for the Revenue; perhaps, although I do not believe it, it might have in its present shape some disincentive effect on the employment of private capital in industry.  That may be so, but it has a very important economic effect all the same; the existence of a wealth tax in the present form or in the old form of death duties is a signal to the people that the State operates some system of social justice, that it has some regard for the fact that it is possible to accumulate wealth to a point when it would be proper and fair to take some of it away and redistribute it.</P>
    <P>I do not say that point should be quickly reached, and I entirely admit every argument advanced in this House about the importance of not constructing a wealth tax so as to be a disincentive to industry, investment and employment; but to simply sweep it away is to brush from the scene a social signal to the people that has been here since 1894.  If that is not reactionary I do not know what is. When I hear that being said and see it done, and when I hear what I believe and concede is an absolutely sincere plea from Deputy Lemass that the pre-1968 civil service widows should get a look-in, I have to ask myself: where do the Government think they are going?  I believe that in abolishing the wealth tax they have turned the first sod of their own grave.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together and to circulate with the Official Report a statement showing the numbers of approved applications for rehousing which local authorities had on hands at 30 September 1977 and the approximate numbers of persons included in these applications at that date.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage of the year to give information about the number of dwellings which it is proposed to construct and complete in each area during 1978.  The number will depend on the level of the allocations which will be made to local authorities during the year.  The capital allocations for local authority housing in 1978 in individual areas cannot be decided until all claims from local authorities for finance in respect of work in progress and new schemes proposed for commencement have been submitted to and examined by my Department.</P>
      <P>It will however be the Government's aim to maintain activity on the local authority housing programme at a high level in 1978 so that priority can be given to meeting the most urgent housing needs, including those of the Dublin area, and to ensure that a high level of employment continues on the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>Is it not possible for the Minister to state the number of local authority dwellings it is proposed to construct?  I understand from his reply that he is not in a position yet to give the information because of the finalisation of the capitation figures in regard to each local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the commitment to accelerate the housing drive is in total conflict with the Government's policy in the White Paper?  I refer to the statement on page 42 to the effect that the rate of increase in output in 1979 would be less than that for 1977.  Does the White Paper not commit the Government to this, and I quote, &ldquo;The level of activity in the local authority housing programme and/or the extent of Exchequer subsidies will have to be subjected to continuous critical review&rdquo;? Does that not clearly imply a depression in that development rather than what the Minister has just said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first year in the Department.  I would expect the Department always to have this under critical review.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Why refer to it now unless&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is argument and we have no time for argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to elicit whether the Minister's statement is consistent with the policy in the White Paper.  It seems to be in total conflict. He said housing output&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer I gave is that it will be the Government's aim to maintain activity in the local authority housing programme at a high level in 1978 so that priority can be given to meeting the most urgent housing needs, including those in the Dublin area, and to ensure that a high level of employment will be attained in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the White Paper is in conflict with the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Put down a question about the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if it is the Government's intention to ensure the maintenance and improvement of local authority rented accommodation in terms of standard, supply and access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the standard of new local authority housing, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his Question No. 22 of 3 November last in which, <i>inter alia</i>, I informed him that the Government's aim in both the private and public housing sectors is to ensure a high quality of construction and environmental standards. With regard to the supply of new local authority rented dwellings, I would refer the Deputy to my reply today to his Question No. 2 and Deputy Quinn's No. 1 about the anticipated level of output of local authority dwellings.</P>
      <P>As regards access to local authority rented accommodation, eligibility for rehousing by local authorities is governed by the authorities' approved schemes of letting priorities.  Access to dwellings in the physical sense is determined by the construction and environmental standards to which I have already referred.</P>
      <P>On the question of existing local authority rented accommodation, this is primarily the concern of each local authority who are responsible for the maintenance, improvement and management of their housing estates.  For this purpose the authorities may retain their income from rents and miscellaneous receipts and 60 per cent of the proceeds from sales of their houses to tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister elaborate on the question of access, particularly in reference to Government policy in the White Paper in which it is stated that it is intended to examine circumstances of housing applicants in more detail to determine priority needs?  Would he explain the greater degree of scrutiny that will come about in regard to housing applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1529" />
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of access, I presume the Deputy is referring to eligibility for local authority housing.  Eligibility will continue to be governed by the criteria in each local authority scheme of letting priorities specified in section 60 of the 1966 Housing Act.  These include unfitness, overcrowding, medical reasons and so forth of applicants who are unable to rehouse themselves from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer the question I asked.  I should like to know if the omission of any reference to maintenance of local authority dwellings from the White Paper is indicative of the Government's thinking with regard to the future question of local authority housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a relevant supplementary and the Minister may not answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is relevant to the question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statement in the White Paper, will the Minister indicate the financial criteria &mdash;whether it is his intention to propose that the system of letting priorities be altered so that financial criteria would be introduced in relation to eligibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of eligibility, it is the business of the particular local authority to allocate houses under the existing Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been my understanding.  I am therefore perturbed by the Minister's reply which does not seem to square with the specific statement published by the Government the effect of which is that, in addition to the normal set of criteria of any housing authority, there is to be a new element of financial criteria.  Has he any plans to change the priorities with regard to lettings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of criteria in the Act, they can be amended from time to time depending <Col N="1530" /> on proposals which come back from local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that. What I am trying to find out, with difficulty, is whether the Minister has any proposals to implement the housing policy outlined by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>At this moment I have no proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the Coalition-dominated Dublin Corporation many of their members are against certain types of maintenance, such as painting of houses by local authority tenants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that a group of houses of this size, which is quite considerable, can be built without provision for serious recreation facilities, shopping facilities and proper maintenance as was this housing area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It was built some years ago and was copied from some such <Col N="1531" /> scheme in Great Britain, as I understand it.  There have been a number of faults with the scheme, but consultants would have been involved at the stage when it was proposed to build it with regard to the proposals, recommendations and so forth to the local authority.  The local authority accepted the type of scheme I would say, and the consultants went along with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not possible for the Minister's Department to lay down certain pre-conditions before they establish this kind of scheme, particularly in relation to shopping, recreation and maintenance?  In addition to that is there anything you can do now to expedite the improvement of conditions for these people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go into more detail about the scheme and give some of the history of the faults which have been found with it.  Prior to Christmas 1977 the corporation received complaints about the accumulation of rubble and other litter on carriageways, parking areas and pedestrian ways, and a concentrated effort was made to remove the rubble and litter and the scheme was thoroughly cleansed.  A recent inspection indicated that the scheme was reasonably clear.  The high density layout makes this scheme very prone to litter.  Many of the rainwater pipes facing public areas have been broken and vandalised, gully covers removed and the gulleys filled with rubble.  Remedial work was in progress which will take some months to complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints were received by the corporation from some of the tenants about dampness.  Investigations show that there were apparently no structural defects in the houses but that the dampness was caused by condensation arising from lack of heating and inadequate ventilation.  The problem is more prevalent in houses without fireplaces. The volume of complaints now is not as great as it was last winter.  A circular on condensation was distributed which may have helped.  The corporation are considering the question of fireplaces and flues in the houses which have central heating <Col N="1532" /> only.  If the tenants concerned wish to instal flues they may obtain the increased reconstruction or house improvement grants.  The situation has improved since the previous year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has improved, but vandalism obviously has increased, and because of lack of recreation facilities the miracle is that it is not worse than it is.  Secondly, can the Minister do anything about shopping facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>I am conscious that problems may be created by the operation of large articulated lorries on certain roads, particularly where port traffic is involved.  Powers are available under the Road Traffic Acts for the control and regulation of traffic and parking of vehicles of any class.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin City and County Manager recently forwarded to me his review of the major road proposals for the Dublin area, including those involved in the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Study.  The manager indicated that his review will be considered with the elected members of the local authorities involved. Preliminary examination is proceeding in my Department, but final examination will have to await the outcome of the consideration to be given to the review by the local bodies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the local authorities are totally dependent on some indication of the financial provisions to be made available to them, until such time as they get some indication from the Minister's Department as to what their attitude <Col N="1540" /> is likely to be, proceeding with the range of activities he indicated in his reply is a useless and time-wasting exercise.  Accordingly, can he give us any indication as to what his attitude is to the document received by him from the manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It arrived only a few weeks ago and at the moment we are examining it.  I appreciate that it is fair for the manager to expect some guidelines as to what will be available. That will be the subject of discussion with my colleagues in the very near future.  I appreciate the need for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not clear about this.  Is the study the Minister mentioned the study he mentioned in the House before Christmas when he was being asked about the Southern Cross Route Study?  In other words there are now recommendations relevant to this question of the Southern Cross Route Study which are in front of the Minister and which he is now considering.  Is that right?</P>

Does the Minister consider his reply to a question of 6 February is an answer to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said it is necessary to have some idea of the availability of finance for an under-taking such as this and, as I said in answer to Deputy Quinn, it will be discussed in the near future with my colleagues in Government.  I cannot give the Deputy a commitment before that discussion.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is as concerned as we are about getting some decisions on the whole question of road systems in the Dublin area.  In view of the fact that the Dublin transportation study was published in 1971, that the roadway proposals are at least four years old and that the documentation he has is virtually a repeat in large part of those proposals, could I not now ask the Minister to give this House some very specific commitment? Surely it is within his capability to say that his Department will be able to make a decision within three weeks or six weeks but, to be strung out along a line of divide which they review&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While I am aware, as was publicised generally, that a proposal of this nature has been under development, no submission has been made to my Department.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>Could I ask the Minister to accept that, although there may not be general dissatisfaction&mdash;particularly <Col N="1545" /> on that side of the House&mdash; with the difficulties of checking the register, there may be a case for looking at the possibility of having a look at this register in the summer when the weather may be more favourable than the present conditions?  It makes it very difficult for people genuinely interested in ensuring the maximum vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree, because the date for registration is 15 September and the date for publication of the new register is 15 April.  That is as near as one can go to the date of publication of the final register. The revision takes place in early February so that final corrections are made very near the date of final publication. If the register is reviewed in early summer it will not be as updated or as near correct as it would be if it is done near the time of publication.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that, even though&mdash;as is of course the case&mdash;these dates are specified by law, there is nothing specially sacred about any of them, that they could be changed in such a way as to permit the checking of the register to be done at a time of the year when darkness does not close in at 5 o'clock in the afternoon?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>Under existing legislation there is no procedure whereby a town such as Leixlip with no previous separate local authority status can attain urban district status directly.  A board of town commissioners must first be established in the town.

As the Deputy probably knows, Leixlip straddles two counties which would create some complications. At this stage it is being examined.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the form of consideration he has undertaken with regard to the reform of local government; and the precise staff arrangements that exist currently regarding the reform of local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a question on this subject on 2 November last, the question of what reforms may be necessary in local government structures is under consideration in my Department.  This examination involves a study of all earlier proposals for reorganisation in the light of developments which have taken place in recent years and in the context of present day conditions.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the question, consideration of local government reorganisation is one of the functions of the section of my Department which deals with the structure, procedures, election and so on of local councils.  It would not be possible therefore to indicate the precise staff deployment on local government reorganisation alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to an earlier question the Minister said that he had set up a review body to look at the whole question of local government reform, and pointed out how necessary it is.  In view of the fact that a specific body is being set up, could the Minister give us some indication of the nature of this body and what kind of resources have been made available to it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not point out that I would set up a review body.  The <Col N="1548" /> question of a review body was mentioned. At that stage Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned it and asked me about personnel.  I said that I was not in a position to talk about the personnel of the said review body, but there was no commitment to a review body.  A section in my Department are already working on this but it is part of the other duties of that section.</P>

What amount of time is being made available to review this very complex and difficult area?

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>The answer is in the negative but I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the present procedures afford an opportunity to bodies like the ESB and the Dublin Gas Company as well as the Minister with overall responsibility for energy to make their views known when plans or variations are in draft form.</P>
      <P>When a planning authority have prepared a draft of a proposed development plan or of proposed variations of a development plan they are obliged to put copies of the draft on public display for a period of at least three months and any objections or representations made to them during that period must be considered before the plan or variation is adopted.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment how he proposes to ensure that those people in receipt of a waiver of rates in previous years will not now be deprived of the relative benefit they enjoyed; and how he will ensure that these people are exempt from paying the indirect taxation or other levies used to make up the loss of revenue on rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the Government's rates policy is to abolish domestic rates for all including those who might, heretofore, have succeeded in obtaining a waiver of all or part of their rates liability.</P>
      <P>The second part of the question does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for example last year in Dublin something like 20,000 families benefited to the tune of £1 million in a waiver of rates and that eventually these people will have to bear the burden of taxation which will permeate through the whole social system?  Does the Minister see this as a loss of the relative advantages they enjoyed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of extra taxation does not arise.  That part of the question is hypothetical.  If they were getting a waiver of rates because of their circumstances this has always been the case.  Wherever people are unable to pay rates the manager was always empowered to waive the rates at the end of the year.  There is nothing new in the waiving of rates.  Those <Col N="1551" /> people benefited from that because of their circumstances.  Now they do not have to apply for a waiver of rates, they automatically get it.</P>

      <Col N="1552" /> I understand that inspections have been carried out by the corporation and that the condition of the cemetery has been the subject of correspondence between the corporation and the Dublin Cemeteries Committee, in the course of which reference has been made to financial, manpower and other problems which have complicated the problems of maintenance, particularly at this time of year.

I understand that a full report dealing with the technical aspects, including environmental implications, of the proposal has been considered by the county council and approved.  I understand that the council are proceeding in consultation with the local community interests as well.  I do not consider that intervention by me is appropriate in such circumstances.</P>

I hope to have the report next week.  These people set up a sub-committee on this question some months ago.  That sub-committee has reported.  Complaints reached me regarding some form of negotiations being in progress at local level between managers and some rate collectors but following investigations in the counties named this was found to be incorrect.  However, a circular was issued at the time to all managers concerned directing them not to engage in individual negotiations pending the outcome of the recommendations of the working party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Questions I had been drawing the attention of the House to the situation in which the wealth tax was imposed.  I had reminded the House that this tax was imposed as part of a package whereby the Government of the day removed death duties.  Now that wealth tax is being removed we are to have the situation, for the first time since 1894, in which wealth, no matter how enormous, will be subject to no direct impost either during the lifetime or after the death of the owner; and I expressed astonishment at the idea of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development that the wealth tax had no economic value.  I tried to make the point that even though, and it may be so, the trouble in collecting it was excessive and even though, and it may be true, though I doubt it, it had a disincentive effect on this or on that, the very existence of the wealth tax was a signal of social justice and to remove that is reactionary and lunatic for any Government.  I object very strongly and I want to promise the Government that when they come to repeal this tax with the Finance Bill of this year, I will give them a boring time in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We sweated in 1975 to put that Bill through.  We did it in the face of an opposition which I will not ever forget. It broke all limits of parliamentary common sense.  There was no device that Fianna Fáil did not descend to in order to wear us down physically, because at that time we had a paper thin majority.  I will not easily forget that opposition.  I will not easily forget the kind of arguments we were met with.  That wealth tax was not thought up out of the air, and was by no means a child of the Labour Party wished on the Coalition.  As a matter of fact, I first heard the matter mooted in the Fine Gael Party.  By no means was the arm of this party twisted, what-ever a couple of individuals may have felt about the wisdom of it.  That was a solemn undertaking to the people before the 1973 election, which we carried out along with the other half of the promise in regard to death duties.  I want to promise the Government personally, even if there may be the odd Deputy on these benches who <Col N="1563" /> does not think much of the wealth tax, a boring few days when the section of the Finance Bill arrives in which that tax is proposed to be repealed.</P>
    <P>It is a unique situation that we now find ourselves in that capital wealth, no matter how enormous, is subject to no impost.  This situation, unique in Europe, could have been avoided while at the same time respecting all the objectives the Ministers of the Government are interested in or say they are interested in, and I believe they are interested in, like maximising investment and trying to get the economy into a pattern of growth which cannot again be arrested.  It would have been possible, and I would not have objected to this, to review the wealth tax, to say the threshold is unreasonably low. We, in any case, were due this year, because of our commitment in 1975, to review the thresholds upwards because of the intervening inflation.  That would only have been justice.</P>
    <P>I am quite open to the idea, and would not quarrel with figures, that the threshold was too low anyway and that maybe it ought to have been doubled or trebled.  I am equally open to the idea that the percentage on which the tax was levied was too heavy. It does not seem to a man of little or no property that 1 per cent on something over £100,000 can be very punishing, but there are people whose wealth has an investment potential for the country who might find that a serious problem if they have cash flow difficulties and liquidity difficulties, and so forth.  I am perfectly open to that.  I would have been equally open to an amendment of the wealth tax on the lines the Minister for Economic Planning and Development implicitly suggested we might consider, when he said that one of the main faults he could find with the wealth tax was that it exempted things that should not have been exempted.  He said ten days ago that the idea whereby exemption existed for one's principal dwelling invited people to live in ostentatious, unnecessarily big houses and, as he put it, stuff these houses with valuables.</P>
    <P>I remember this very point being canvassed here in 1975.  It was made <Col N="1564" /> clear, and it is quite clear in the statute law, that exemption of the contents of the house is not to be taken as being a licence to turn the house into a museum.  I am quite certain that this paragon of parliamentary honesty, Deputy Professor O'Donoghue, does not believe that there are six people in the country who have turned their houses into museums in order to avoid wealth tax.  I do not believe there are and I am quite certain that he knows there are not.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, it was an ostensible or potential source of abuse and I would have been perfectly open to the suggestion that that form of exemption should have been amended in some way.  I think it is reasonable to exempt somebody's dwelling, the roof over his head.  That would be necessary; otherwise, the threshold would have to be very much higher, even for people who by no means could be considered wealthy in the ordinary understanding of the term.</P>
    <P>But, instead of making amendments, instead of pushing up the thresholds, changing the percentage at which the incidence of the tax arises, instead of changing the exemptions in regard to private dwellings and so forth, instead of doing all of these things, with many of which I might have agreed, perhaps even would have supported them in the privacy of my own party, they abolished the principle of the thing.  That is what I object to.  I would have gone a long way with any amount of re-form of the wealth tax for the purpose of removing any disincentive it may have contained, although I do not belive there was any serious disincentive, but I could not go along, and virtually all the Members of my party could not go along, nor could the Labour Party go along with the abolition in principle of the wealth tax, and I am quite certain there are queasy stomachs in Fianna Fáil about it too and they have every right to be queasy, because the people will not forgive them for it.</P>
    <P>The economy since the beginning of 1976 has been on an upturn and people are in a mood of euphoria.  I freely concede that a mood of that sort can be triggered off by a change of <Col N="1565" /> Government, not just in one direction, but may be triggered off just as easily in another.  I freely concede that any sort of change in the conditions of life, of which a change of Government is a conspicuous example, can contribute to a mood of euphoria.  I am told there is that mood and I cannot see an awful lot to contradict it.  But, that curve will reach its apex sooner or later and it will start to descend.  When it does, these chickens will come home to roost, and this will be the most important one.  Minor hooflings like the ground rents swindle are relatively unimportant. We made fun of that here yesterday and will do so again.  That kind of thing is relatively unimportant. Important is this distinction of a major signal of social justice which all sides in this State, I thought, had accepted. It is being swept from the scene.  And, while I am by no means an ideological socialist, still less a communist or a man who is fanatical about redistributing wealth, I think that is a grave and fatal mistake.  It is a national mistake. It is a mistake, the penalty for which, I console myself with this reflection, will be paid in the first instance by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I have a few questions I would like to address to the Government in regard to the consequences of this abolition. I should like to know how the effects of the abolition will be, to use a favourite word of Departments, monitored, how they will be kept track of. Suppose the abolition of wealth tax does not have any visible effect on the inflow of funds to this country, suppose it does not have any visible effect in the creation of employment, suppose even the very small number of millionaires that we have compared with the kind of wealth that exists in other countries in the EEC do not turn around and start putting their money into schemes which will be productive in the employment sense, what will be done about capital taxation then?</P>
    <P>There is something I would welcome it if it was said&mdash;it might be useful if the Minister for Finance were to say it in closing the debate; I should like it to be said&mdash;that the extreme wealth in this country is being given a chance now but if it does not take <Col N="1566" /> this chance, this whole matter will have to be looked at again.  A sensible Government would not have taken this step to begin with, but if any titter of sense is coming into their minds at this late moment, even at the last moment of this debate, even at the last moment of the Finance Bill debate, they should say that.  This relaxation is unique in western Europe.  I am not certain about Switzerland, but I believe that there is not another country in Europe in which there is no taxation in life or in death on accumulations of wealth&mdash;a unique situation in Europe.  I would like that at least at a late hour the Government might say that this is intended to be a chance for a really heavy investment and that if those millions which they are now not going to tax in life or in death are visibly put to work in this country to make Irish jobs, they will leave the situation as it is but if there is no sign of that, if they are being put to work merely on a calculation of what will produce the most profit for the people who own them, then the Government will have to look at the situation again and may go back to what the National Coalition did.  I should like to hear the Government side on that point.</P>
    <P>In regard to the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, I should like to know what he expects the Leader of the Opposition to say in a budget debate when he forms an opinion such as the one which Deputy FitzGerald expressed two weeks ago and which I am expressing now.  Deputy FitzGerald said that the abolition of the wealth tax would have a very unhelpful effect on the negotiation of a national wage agreement.  I said the same thing on radio.  I do not take part in these negotiations, nor does the Minister opposite.  I do not know what goes on in the minds of the people on the trade union side in the negotiations; but I am certain that if I were one of them I would stiffen my determination not to give in too easily.  Is not the Leader of the Opposition entitled to warn the Government that their proposed measure would do exactly that?  Is he to sit <Col N="1567" /> tight and hold his tongue about this piece of lunacy?  That is a babyish conception of Opposition.  A Minister who holds such an office and has that conception of Opposition is likely to have a very dim appreciation of what Government is all about.  I have the same respect for the Minister for Economic Planning and Development as most other Members have, and I am saying this about him only because of his speech last week.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I remember the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, boasting in regard to a couple of people on the Labour benches that Fianna Fáil &ldquo;did not take anyone in off the street and make him a major-general&rdquo;. I think this was intended to refer to Deputy Thornley; I am not quite sure.  That expression was proudly used.  That is precisely the situation in which the Minister for Economic Planning and Development now finds himself and I wish him the best of luck, covered in the decorations of the rearguard of the political army of which he is a member, getting to the front in one jump.  I would have done the same thing myself if I could, and so would the rest of us.  But when I find that the Minister has such little understanding of what an Opposition is all about, I have to ask myself if he has much grasp of the functions of a Government.  I will be watching that Minister with double attention from now on because of the idiotic speech he made 10 days ago.</P>
    <P>I make allowances for saying things in the heat of the moment which one does not really mean, but the Minister read a lecture to Deputy FitzGerald on academic probity, on presenting the full picture and not being selective.  If I had been exiled in Mars or had been in orbit for the past five years, and had returned to earth and been given no information about the economic situation in the meantime except what was contained in the Minister's speech, I would not have known that there had been an oil crisis and I would barely know that there had been a recession. The recession was mentioned quite marginally at two places.  He was very free in heaping blame on what he <Col N="1568" /> regarded as the insane policies of the Coalition in regard to foreign borrowing. This borrowing has been far outstripped by his own figure.  The speech does not contain one word of understanding of the whirlwind through which the Coalition had to pass within 12 months of taking office.</P>
    <P>Academics are flesh and blood and are as frail morally and every other way as the rest of mankind, and I can say that from first-hand experience.  I can assure the House that anyone setting out an academic argument will not enjoy the respect even of his most junior colleagues unless he takes account of what has been said on the other side.  He may mention it only in order to dismiss it, but he will take account of it.  When I read this speech I find that the oil crisis is never mentioned and the recession is referred to only marginally in what is supposed to be a devastating review of the mess into which the Minister alleged the previous Government had brought the country.  There is no mention of the orthodoxy which I understood was axiomatic, according to which one is supposed to borrow and spend oneself out of a recession and that the most dangerous thing to do is to deflate the economy.  There is no mention of the cruel burdens&mdash; quite gratuitous burdens&mdash;coming from Northern Ireland which the last Government carried, with little enough help from the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>I say this without offence.  If it were the Minister opposite who had made that speech I would not take it as a point of criticism, but when I find these things are done in a speech which is topped off by a lecture on academic probity to Deputy FitzGerald, I must call attention to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was full of indignation about how shocking it was that it should be alleged that his party should not have made promises <Col N="1569" /> or, having made promises, ought not to carry them out.  He was full of pride, like a turkey, about how they were being carried out, but there was not a word about the abolition of ground rents and the weekly dissemination of prices.  If ever a party was firmly nailed to two things, the party of which he is a member is firmly nailed to these two things.  We are waiting for the performance.  One, of course, is incapable of performance unless the Government spend a lot of money in paying compensation.  The other is capable of performance, but it has not been done because the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, has not been able to twist the arm of RTE and persuade them to disseminate prices.  There are lots of good excuses, good for everybody except a party which had given a firm and positive commitment to the dissemination of prices weekly. This is not being done.</P>
      <P>I will not take any lectures from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development about academic or any other kind of probity, while he stands as part of a Government defending what he chooses to defend and absenting himself from the dirty work, leaving it to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Fisheries, the jokers in the pack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment situation is a central part of the strategy of the Government and rightly so.  It was a central part of our strategy, even though we were facing much more difficult conditions. I have said before and I will say it briefly again that I do not believe in &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; jobs or in soft-option employment schemes.  I do not want to be facetious at the expense of PT instructors or anybody else.  A community which is thriving and which is producing a surplus of wealth can afford these luxuries in life, but there is a limit to the number of them that we here can afford.  I do not believe it is important to argue about whether 1,000 jobs have been created here or there.  Anyone who borrows money can recruit a few thousand PT instructors or clerks and there is no problem whatsoever. That is not the test of the success <Col N="1570" /> of a Government in creating productive jobs, which will create wealth rather than just consume it.  This needs to be said again&mdash;these are soft-option employment schemes.  I do not want to make a party point of this, because I know that my side would be sensitive to the very same problem.  In particular, all these forms of direct public sector employment&mdash;I except the building sector from this&mdash;are a subconscious response to the job aspirations which more and more a too generally and not sufficiently vocationally educated population are beginning to develop in frightening numbers.  This is not just a political nettle.  It is not one which Fianna Fáil are better able to grasp than we are or the other way round. It is a major national problem and is one which is just beginning to show in enormous dimensions over the horizon.</P>
    <P>We are educating a rapidly growing young population better than ever before and we are all glad about that.  We are educating them; however we are doing it, in such a way that they will all have job expectations of a kind that the country simply cannot meet because an overwhelming proportion have expectations which are directed towards the service sectors which are not wealth producing.  A Government which find themselves in charge of a population like that for a few years between elections have to make up their minds what way they will handle this situation.  Are they going to try to re-educate them to teach somebody who wants to be a doctor, a pharmacist or a civil servant?  Are the Government going to take their courage in both hands and say: &ldquo;We simply cannot afford to train and we certainly have not got jobs to employ the number of people who want to join those professions and, accordingly, whether you like it or not, people who fall below the very high level at which we will set entry standards will have to be content with technological jobs and ones which are not of a particularly high grade?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a horrible thing to have to say to parents or children.  I frankly admit that I would not like to be given that message about my children. <Col N="1571" /> I would hate it.  I instantly think, just as every other person in the House would, that my children have to be a bit different.  But we are in a worse position than most other Enropean countries, because all studies of this problem have shown that Irish people are less content to work with their hands and they aspire in much larger numbers to white-collar jobs than do people in other countries.</P>
    <P>In other countries this has been faced up to as a problem.  I was in France not long ago and I saw that there were advertisements in the Paris underground, which were part of an orchestrated campaign, carrying the message: &ldquo;Blue is Beautiful&rdquo;.  I cannot remember if that was the phrase but it was something along those lines.  They were all showing chaps with plastic helmets, blue shirts and pneumatic drills in their hands.</P>

      <P>The French Government had the idea that this was a national problem which had to be faced.  Still, it is not such a serious problem for them for two reasons.  They do not have an exploding juvenile population nor do they have an inbuilt inherent hankering after white-collar jobs in anything like the measure that Irish people have.  Any Government here have to face up to this problem.  Are we going to take this thing by the throat and more or less re-educate, by advertising campaigns or otherwise, people into lowering their expectation thresholds; or are we going to do the opposite and try to provide channels through which they can emigrate? That is an ugly option and is one I certainly would not wish to have <Col N="1572" /> applied to my children any more than the Minister would.</P>
      <P>These are very ugly options, but a Government are elected to face ugly options as well as beautiful ones.  We faced a lot in our time.  We made our choices, and sometimes perhaps made wrong choices.  The Government have run away from this one.  I can see nothing but disaster in this job creation programme if they concentrate on public sector jobs of a white-collar type and do not somehow &mdash;even if it means innovation of a kind never seen before, even if it means involvement in public enterprise in direct food production on the land or indirectly getting into some kind of manufacturing industry which private enterprise have not yet thought of, the kind of thing Deputy Bermingham spoke about three days ago&mdash;turn their minds to some innovation which will stop this rush into white-collar employment, which the Government by their job creation programme are only encouraging.  Unless they do so, they will have a disaster on their hands of a size never yet seen in the country.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the real jobs are getting away.  While all this is going on and while those &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; jobs and public sector jobs are being created the real jobs are going down the drain.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy is sitting on the other side of the House because I brought into the House part of a speech he made in Castlebar the other day.  I got on so badly the last time I mentioned in the House the authorship of speeches that I had better not raise this topic again.  The Minister, speaking at a programme for the promotion of Irish goods, with which I wish him all the best, in Castlebar, referred to the fact that the share of the Irish market taken by imported goods appeared to be growing out of hand. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When over a few years we find that textile imports have doubled, clothing imports are up 250 per cent, furniture imports have trebled and footwear imports have increased fourfold, then obviously Irish <Col N="1573" /> industry must become more marketing-conscious, more aggressive in their salesmanship, more active in seeking out and winning new business.</P>
    <P>That is an incredible speech, because he has singled out the very sectors in which the real reason why the share of foreign goods has increased in Ireland over the last few years is the British temporary employment subsidy. It is not the only reason; but it is a very major one, and there is not a word about it in this script.</P>
    <P>The British temporary employment subsidy has been met with lethargy by the Government.  I asked a question about it before Christmas and I was told by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy that he had made some approaches to the European Commission to complain about it.  I have another question down now which I had to postpone because the Minister was not here; it looks now as if it will not be taken for some weeks.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister has made any serious protest in Brussels about this illegal British temporary employment subsidy, which has, by making it £20 a week cheaper for English employers to keep people on in industries which are labour intensive &mdash;the very ones which the Minister of State mentioned here, footwear, clothing and textiles&mdash;made the English market impenetrable to Irish goods and has made the Irish market only too vulnerable to the English producers.</P>
    <P>There are only a limited number of options, which I have set out in my parliamentary Question, and when it comes to the answers I hope I will be able to show that.  There are only a limited number of options open to the Government, all of which are disagreeable. It is a hard option which has to be faced up to in order to produce a reasonable, rational employment programme rather than giving away paper jobs and &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; jobs.  We either sue the British in the European Court for breach of their Treaty obligations or we introduce a matching subsidy.  I recognise that something has been done, but it is very little and <Col N="1574" /> is simply not enough.  A payment of £5 will not match £20.  That must be done, or we must impose a tariff on the stuff which comes in which has had the advantage of this employment subsidy.</P>
    <P>These are three very disagreeable options.  Does the Minister know a fourth one?  I do not know of one, but one of those options must be taken. It is no use the Government being here for seven months while every other day the Confederation of Irish Industries, which I think have made all the running in whatever protests have been made in Brussels about this, with perfect justification, are crying about the effects on Irish industry and Irish employment of this subsidy.  Nothing is done until the budget&mdash;I recognise that it is something but it is not enough&mdash; and the £5 subsidy is announced.</P>
    <P>The other day we read the incredible piece of news that the Erin Foods potato processing plant in Tuam was to be closed.  Is it not beyond belief that in east County Galway, the one part of Europe which is associated in European folkore never mind mere Irish folkore, with the potato, a potato plant has to be closed because it cannot get a reliable supply of potatoes?  I would not wish my children to be directed into the potato industry against their inclination, and I would not wish it on anybody, but it is the Government's job to make up their minds that here is a possibility for gainful and productive employment.  I know the reasons why this Erin Foods plant has had to be closed: some of their contracts were not met; producers found that prices were higher elsewhere and they sold their potatoes in breach of their contracts; other people did not bother to grow potatoes at all.  But what is to stop the sugar company&mdash;I realise they are an independent company, but that they would be sensitive to being pushed by the Government&mdash; from growing their own potatoes and employing their own people to do it? Because it would not be private enterprise it would probably be wasteful, probably they would be &ldquo;soldiered&rdquo; on in a way that private enterprise would not tolerate, probably the thing <Col N="1575" /> would not show the same profit as private enterprise, but if they even broke even and managed to keep their workers going and give employment to the people who would be growing the potatoes for them, would that not be something?</P>
    <P>That is the kind of question the Government should be asking themselves, not where they will find £20 million to creat 5,000 jobs for clerks and PT instructors.  Take the question of energy.  We still have not got an energy policy&mdash;it is barely mentioned in the White Paper published a couple of months ago.  Serious, economically deadly decisions are likely to be made about this without the matter being properly debated.</P>
    <P>Let us just take the wastage of energy through defective house insulation and poor house building standards. It is reckoned to be twice what it is in a comparable country, Denmark. Surely there is room for increased employment in the improvement of house insulation.  There is an enormous amount of work in it for tradesmen.  I do not expect the Government to pay for that, but could there not be grants for it?  Or surely it could be made tax deductible?  Surely there are possibilities here for real job creation? That kind of work is wealth-producing, because implicitly it reduces the amount of money we have to spend abroad for oil, the fuel for the vast majority of our energy production.</P>
    <P>These are the hard questions the Government should be spending their time thinking about, not how they will borrow millions of pounds creating jobs which will not produce one blade of grass, let alone one matchstick or one pair of pyjamas which could be sold to somebody else to buy the things we need.  I accept that in a time of difficulty any kind of job is better than no job, and I would not wish any of these theories to be put into effect at the expense of my children or myself, but a Government must face up to these things and ask themselves how these things can be made workable and physically and humanly acceptable.</P>
    <P>When a Government come to office <Col N="1576" /> on such an enormous raft of utopian promises, that Government, having got 84 Deputies into those benches, could at least say: &ldquo;Let us take a month off from doing anything else, except facing up to questions like this: What are the implications for our economy, for our Constitution, of the way educational aspirations are going, and what are the implications of the way in which we are shaping our employment pattern?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Government to realise that a Government alone, let it be backed by the best civil service in the world, cannot get prosperity if the people are lulled into a condition of mental dependence.  The people are being increasingly so lulled, and I am sorry to say that the experience of the last election will have augmented that.  During the last election I met people in prosperous suburbs&mdash;I sit for a constituency in which there are many prosperous suburbs&mdash;who wanted to know why the State would not buy schoolbooks for their children.  I realise it is a burden to be buying schoolbooks or anything else for children these days, but there is some limit to what a State like this can afford.  Unfortunately, the kind of political game we play&mdash;and the party opposite play it far more ruthlessly than we would have the nerve to think of doing&mdash;forces people into that condition, sometimes against their instincts.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government can recruit the people's serious will, not a transient frivolous will, to work for themselves, to do things for themselves, we have got a dim future ahead.  We will be the reservoir in the EEC for PT instructors and clerks, while expecting the Germans and the Dutch to rise at 5.30 in the morning and go home at eight in the evening to maintain us in this comfortable situation.  No one will do that.  They may do it for a little while, a transitory period while we have a small population, but they will not do it in the early 21st century when our population will be bursting through the four million level and will go on increasingly rapidly thereafter.</P>
    <P>When the Government take the month or two months off that I have <Col N="1577" /> suggested, they should consider also how the people could be got to dedicate themselves to doing something for themselves economically.  I should like to see them creating pilot co-operatives in selected or even random areas and equipping them with pioneer teams of people drawn from the various State agencies such as An Foras Talúntais, the IIRS, the IDA, CTT, the Management Institute.  There are also special places, for example coastal areas, which would require specialist skills.  The Government should try to see people developing structures in their own districts comparable with that which they have for a whole range of other activities.</P>
    <P>Take a place out of the air, say Athlone, which has a political structure of a kind; it has got an urban council and a whole range of structures in which people run their own social, charitable and religious lives.  To a large extent they have a say in how their children are educated.  All these things can be done by people themselves, and I should like the Government to experiment in giving to the people&mdash;not throwing it to them but they would have to be guided and equipped for it&mdash;a responsibility for communities of a manageable size in which could be secured not just the professional but the economic future of their children and grandchildren.</P>
    <P>The Lord has given the people of Athlone, of Roscommon, a certain place to live.  There is a Government in Dublin to which they pay taxes but there are limits to what that Government can do.  The time has come when the Government must say: &ldquo;We have reached our limit, we have done all we can for you and, even though it is a function you have never had before as a community, you will have to get used to planning things for yourselves, such as calculating the value of the land you sit on and all the other natural resources that are there.&rdquo;  They could be asked what would be done if a battalion of Dutchmen parachuted in and found the place uninhabited&mdash; what would they do to keep alive? They should think that out and do the same themselves.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a certain number <Col N="1578" /> of communities chosen arbitrarily and equipped in order to start in this way and see whether the national problem, namely, the increasing dependence of people, could be remedied by getting them to try to provide as far as possible for their economic future instead of casting more and more of their burdens on the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely agree with the Minister.  I hope they will support them.  These things I have listed are serious national, long-term problems. They will be there perhaps after this and other Governments have gone. They are not peculiar to Ireland; in certain ways they are shared by other European countries also.  We will have to solve them for ourselves.</P>
      <P>Although I am sorry to end my speech on this kind of note, I do not think the Government have enough guts to do what is necessary.  If one were to sum up the performance of the Government so far&mdash;apart from the small-scale hookery of the ground rents swindle and that kind of thing; I do not think it is all that important&mdash; they have shown very little guts.  They have displayed very little anxiety to grasp nettles.  That was a famous phrase of the Taoiseach's in 1972.  He was all out to grasp nettles, but now it is the Opposition who are being left to grasp the nettles and when they do they are criticised for being &ldquo;unnational&rdquo;.  The era seems to have changed.</P>
      <P>Of course nettles have to be grasped, but I do not see any sign on the part of the Government of grasping nettles in regard to Northern Ireland.  I call that gutless after what this country has been through, and doubly gutless of them when they acquiesce in or even invite criticism of people on this side for recognising that we will never have peace in this country until we can live in harmony.  That means making concessions to people who, at the moment, violently differ from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are gutless also in the matter of law and social reform. For instance, on the matter of contraception <Col N="1579" /> about which we are supposed to be getting a Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Money is being raised by the budget for the Department of Health and that is the point I want to focus on.  It is gutless of the Government to pretend that this matter is a health problem.  It is not such although, of course, it has strong health dimensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I prophesy that any attempt to solve this problem on health lines will be a disaster.  It is essentially an issue of individual privacy and liberty, and only in the second place is it a health problem. Except for seven or eight Deputies in our Government whose conscience would not allow them to support our Bill, our Government faced up to the issue.  Any attempt by this Government to duck those questions will end in disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are gutless also in their pretended commitment to reform the public service.  If one thing stands out in my mind from the speech of the Taoiseach on 5 July it was his insistence on &ldquo;political will&rdquo; in regard to reform of the public service.  I am sure I will be allowed to quote a public servant by name when he uses the Government Information Services to put out a speech of his own under his own name.  I am referring to the Secretary of the Department of Economic Planning and Development, Dr. Whelan.  On 9 February he said that &ldquo;the creation of the Department of Economic Planning and Development represents a fundamental change in our structure of Government, probably <Col N="1580" /> the most important since the foundation of the State.  It is a major step in the reform of our public service&rdquo;.  My impression of that Department is that it is staffed largely by the same people who were formerly active in the planning section of the Department of Finance and who would still be there if the advice of some of our senior economists were followed.</P>
    <P>I do not even pause to make fun any longer of the retitling of the Department of Local Government.  That Department have not got what would fit on my thumb nail of extra functions since the change of title.  That, too, is gutless.  I admit I would be hard put to see how changes for the better in the public service might be made.  If changes are to be made they will not be made by that kind of cosmetic retitling and shifting around to a new Department with a new set of letter-heads of what is essentially a section of the old Department and one that was working quite well.</P>
    <P>The problems I have tried to outline have been made more difficult by the proposed abolition of wealth tax.  They will sharpen social suspicion and unrest. The enormous national problems that we face need to be met by the Government with courage.  From the examples we have seen in the last seven months,  I do not believe the Government have this courage or if they have, they have not yet summoned it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My wish to contribute to this debate is prompted primarily in that as a woman and as the youngest Member of the Oireachtas, I feel well suited to speak both on behalf of women and of youth.  It is only natural that I would have a sympathy and an understanding with the problems concerning both these sections of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his obvious regard for the need to improve the financial position of these sections of our community. My own youth gives me a natural advantage in understanding the hopes, the fears, the aspirations and the ambitions of youth and the younger <Col N="1581" /> age groups in our society.  Be that as it may, I feel it my duty no less as the youngest Deputy in the present Dáil to voice my opinions on certain aspects of the present budget proposals. I compliment the Minister for Finance and the Government on their sensitive regard for unemployment among the youth and their obvious appreciation of the present difficulties in which a large proportion of the younger age groups find themselves in this regard.  Would, however, that the Minister could do more, but with the limits which must necessarily confine a Minister for Finance to ensure justice to all our citizens he has done well.</P>
    <P>Even in the short time I have had the honour to represent the people of mid-County Dublin, I have been disturbed by the plight of unemployment especially among the young and especially in a region such as Tallaght, which is fast becoming a city in itself. It seems to me that the main spirit of this budget is conceived for the provision of more jobs and employment generally.  This indeed will be welcome and long overdue in my constituency and most especially in Tallaght and its surrounding areas.  Tallaght is an industrial area and boasts of many factories. These concerns will welcome the incentives contained in the present proposals which must lead to the creation of new jobs and support the existing industries and especially the smaller ones.</P>
    <P>These budget proposals must likewise give fresh hope and incentive to the building industry&mdash;an industry which has been so disgracefully neglected by the previous Government and which is, and remains, one of the main sinews of our industrial life. This latter industry is of such vital importance to the citizens of mid-County Dublin as an area growing and expanding. It is gratifying to see the Minister's proposals for such a vital industry.</P>
    <P>I return to the problems of the youth.  We hear much criticism today of the indiscipline and lawlessness among young people.  How could it be otherwise if they are idle and without work?  &ldquo;Idleness is the Devil's comforter&rdquo; they say.  What may we <Col N="1582" /> expect then if unemployment is widespread and rife?</P>
    <P>We can, Sir, take comfort in the sensitive and realistic appreciation which the Minister has shown in his budget proposals which show positive and constructive action towards a more stable economy and in particular job creation and fostering of industry thus providing greater opportunity especially among young people.</P>
    <P>In the last few months we have heard Deputy Horgan expressing his concern for youth.  I must look on Deputy Horgan's regards with suspicion for, as each Deputy in the House will know, the 1975 EEC Labour Force Sample Survey showed that almost 50 per cent of the total population is under 25, yet in 1975 the party of which Deputy Horgan is now a member did not bring about any proposals to alleviate youth unemployment, which at this time constituted almost 44 per cent of the total unemployment even though the labour force under 25 years of age represented only 30 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Fine Gael Party is being watched with some amusement by young people as he desperately tries to drag some of them into the ranks of his party.  But, as I said in my speech at the Fianna Fáil 4th National Youth Conference down in Cork last month, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald is finding the transition from blueshirt to tee shirt a rather painful experience.  This budget, on the other hand, proves once again Fianna Fáil's commitment to the youth of this nation, by the allocation by the Minister for Finance and the Government of £5 million to provide schemes for youth employment.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have increased the number of training opportunities with AnCO and I was particularly pleased to have been present at the opening of the new AnCO Centre, in Tallaght, County Dublin.  Fianna Fáil are once again the party to take the initiative, this time in the setting up of the Employment Action Team.  As a result of this team many young people will now be engaged in a work experience programme, in an environmental improvement <Col N="1583" /> schemes programme and 150 first year construction industry apprentices will be recruited by local authorities. In all, Sir, the Minister for Finance estimates in his budget that such special employment schemes targeted specifically at young people will generate 5,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>What has disturbed me most about this budget debate so far is the way in which the Opposition parties have rejected the budget out of hand, while it has been accepted&mdash;indeed, welcomed&mdash;by the overwhelming majority of our people.  It strikes me that both the Fine Gael and Labour parties have no conception of the true role of an Opposition whatever its ideological base.  They do not seem to understand that the role of an Opposition is not just to practise obstructionist and negative policies, but rather to be enlightened and broad-minded enough to realise when the Government of the day are bringing in measures for the obvious good of the country and to support such measures for the betterment of the people.  The present stance which is being taken by both Opposition parties can only be accounted for by one, or perhaps both of the following reasons: either they are so blinded by bigotry or prejudice that they find it beyond them to support any measure which is being implemented by Fianna Fáil even if this measure will mean better living conditions for the poorer sections of our community, or they may believe that by opposing Fianna Fáil they might score some party political point.</P>
    <P>Where now have vanished the high-flown phrases from prominent members of the Fine Gael Party concerning their &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo;?  But, Fine Gael are not alone to be blamed. What of their partner in the previous Coalition Government?  Where else in Europe could you witness a labour party refusing to support a budget, the primary aim of which is job creation? Where else in Europe would you find parties unwilling to support a budget which introduced measures to improve the plight of handicapped children?  Where else in Europe would you find parties so ready to criticise <Col N="1584" /> a budget which recognised for the first time the right of single women, including school-leavers and widows, to claim unemployment assistance on the same basis as men?  One need not be so surprised by the Fine Gael Party with their traditional sectional interests but one finds it hard to believe that any Labour Pary should react so violently against the social reforms that the Minister for Finance and the Government have proposed in the budget.</P>
    <P>I have said that my special interest is in youth, but as a woman I have an equal interest in any provision in this budget which will benefit women.  My only regret is that the Minister did not find it possible to do even more for women, especially for mothers, the widow, the deserted wife, the unmarried mother, working wives and women old age pensioners.  The proposals do however recognise the plight of such persons and have given a substantial measure of relief and further assistance, which I am confident will be appreciated by those citizens in the sectors I have mentioned as needing extra consideration.</P>
    <P>As a woman, too, I am struck by the compassion which the Minister has so clearly shown and which comes under the headings of social welfare and health.  This clearly shows, Sir, that this Minister and this Government have from the first opportunity afforded them shown in practical and substantial terms that they are ready to stand by their election promises, a welcome change from the Coalition parties whose promises never came to fruition.  I am gratified in the certain knowledge that when these advances and increases proposed in this budget are ratified they will be administered with the utmost efficiency under the driving force, expertise and deep dedication of our present Minister for Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>As a teacher I was particularly pleased to see in the budget that the Minister for Finance has approved an increased rate of equipment grant for special classes and remedial classes in ordinary national schools.  There is a great need in this sphere of education for the provision of more remedial <Col N="1585" /> last decade an enormous strain has been put on pupils from a very early age to fare well in examinations. Classes have grown in size.  Although the present Minister for Education has succeeded in lowering the pupil-teacher ratio, it is still extremely difficult if not impossible for the slow learner to keep abreast of the work without constant help from a trained remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the slower learner is found in all socio-economic groupings and that he may exist at the primary or secondary level. I am gratified that the Minister for Finance recognises in his budget that the need of the slow learner is a serious and urgent one.  I hope that this Government in the coming months and years will be in a position to improve the situation of the pupil who is in need of remedial teaching.</P>
    <P>The budget is a continuation of the economic and social policies which Fianna Fáil have followed throughout the years.  Who could have been surprised by the emphasis that was placed on the Buy Irish Campaign in the budget?  Fianna Fáil have always believed that such a campaign stimulates employment.  One looks back on the boom of the 1960's with a wistful eye, but I feel we can now look forward with confidence to a stabilising economic climate, a stability which can only be brought about by a single party Government.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the budget a couple of weeks ago much has been said and written about it by politicians business people, the media generally and the ordinary man or woman in the street.  There has been criticism.  One must expect that, particularly from the area it is most likely to come from&mdash;the Opposition benches.  Much of the Opposition criticism has not been of a very heavy nature. This is not surprising because the budget has been accepted by the vast majority of the people as a very <Col N="1586" /> satisfactory one which has done a lot to stabilise the economy for the future.</P>
      <P>The budget was designed, as our pre-election manifesto stated, to get this country moving again economically and particularly in the jobs sector. The people who elected the Government last June wanted a strong Government which would bring in a worth-while package.  That we have done in accordance with our manifesto. It is apparent now that a great deal of thought and consideration went into the manifesto.  The projects and the plans set out in the manifesto have been acted upon with all possible speed by the Government and they are clearly shown to be workable and in the interests of the nation.  They are the only measures likely to restore the economy and bring it back to something approaching the 1960s and early 1970s era of steady progress and advance.</P>
      <P>Since Fianna Fáil came back into Government there has been a very colourful display of our manifesto on the Opposition benches.  We would assume the pages are well thumbed and well digested.  The amazement expressed by the Opposition at the budget proposals is quite unwarranted because the Government's economic plan was set out in detail in the manifesto. It is very satisfactory that after only seven months in office the Government have achieved the remarkable feat of fulfilling the majority of the commitments entered into in the manifesto.</P>
      <P>The Chair will forgive me if I continue to put the emphasis on the manifesto. We must refer to it.  I should not like to think that the Opposition had a monopoly so far as our manifesto is concerned.  The budget proposals include a substantial increase in the personal allowance where income tax is concerned, the abolition of road tax, a reduction in the social welfare stamp for the lower paid worker and grants of £1,000 for first time purchasers of houses.  There are also bigger SDA loans, higher social welfare benefits and, above all, price stability&mdash;something we have not had for some years&mdash;and a new jobs creation programme well on target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> How does all this contrast with the achievements of the former Government? Prior to the 1973 election we had the famous 14-point plan.  In their years in office, however, these 14 points were quickly shelved to the detriment of the economy and employment. To be fair to the former Government, there were difficulties caused by a worldwide recession, but those difficulties were multiplied by inept and indecisive handling and by a succession of blunders that really should have proved embarrassing.  The country suffered.  Prices and unemployment rose frequently and steadily.</P>
    <P>This budget is firmly based on a set plan, a plan accepted by the vast majority of the people last June when they returned Fianna Fáil to Government with an unprecedented 84 seats. That is conclusive evidence of how the people felt about our manifesto.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, the budget represents the initial stages in implementing a strategy for economic and social progress in the immediate future.  It is positive.  It is a challenge to all, to employers, trade unions and workers, to seize the opportunity presented in order to achieve sustained growth and a fulfilment of the Government's plan to create the thousands of new jobs required for our young people.  Some commentators have described the budget as a gamble. The Minister himself labelled it a &ldquo;calculated gamble&rdquo;.  Of course it is a gamble.  Is not every worthwhile thing one does a gamble?  One must take risks.  One must take chances.  But these must be well planned.  In our circumstances we must take risks in order to create the jobs required for our people. It would be disastrous to sit on the fence and not make some investment in creating jobs in the hope that one morning one will wake up to find the problem has been solved but, as we all know, economics are not like that. The budget is a gamble, but it is well planned and well calculated to achieve the best possible results in, we would hope, the most favourable economic climate.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Industrial Development Bill some months ago, it was argued that everybody would have to <Col N="1588" /> make some sacrifice to enable the creation of jobs for the less fortunate.  In the light of the budget proposals those in full employment must be more modest in their demands and cooperate fully with the trade unions in helping to achieve the Government's plans and objectives.  As we know now, agreement has been reached, somewhat above the suggested or recommended figure, and we all hope this will not have serious consequences as far as the creation of new jobs is concerned.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago the nation was in the throes of galloping inflation which affected the lives of all of us.  Rising costs swallowed up the real value of pay increases and resulted in the worker taking home less in purchasing value.  However, it is satisfactory to know now that there has been a dramatic reduction in the rate of inflation since last year and that is being maintained.  To reduce inflation to the target set by the Government pay restraint was obviously an absolute condition. Opponents of the budget appear to have gone out of their way deliberately to antagonise trade unions and workers by stating that the Minister was dictating to the unions.  Since last June spokesmen for Fine Gael and Labour have constantly maintained that the target set by the Government was just not on.  In the circumstances, who is really dictating to the trade unions?</P>
    <P>A lot of emphasis has been put on this point and on the participation of the workers.  However the onus does not lie entirely on the worker; far from it.  Private enterprise has been given excellent encouragement in the budget proposals.  In return business and employers must accept their responsibility in a positive and decisive manner. They must pursue any scheme that seems worth while.  Above all they must be prepared to invest, to expand and to honour their commitments to the creation of further employment.  A number of important and badly needed concessions were made to industry in the budget.  Corporation profits tax has been cut.  Free depreciation has been extended to buildings, plant and equipment and there are considerable stock reliefs.  These, combined <Col N="1589" /> with the other steps taken, must give to private enterprise the encouragement and above all the capital so badly needed.  In recent years under the Coalition Government private enterprise and business were generally discouraged, very much to the detriment of employment and of the economy and with the resultant loss of many jobs.</P>
    <P>Regarding the abolition of wealth tax, I feel that very few people, irrespective of their position in life, have lost any sleep over it.  It was made an emotive issue in 1975, and, despite all the trumpet-blowing at the time of its introduction, it yielded only about £7 million in 1977.  It was a very difficult and costly tax to administer but, more important, it reacted serioously on investment in business.  The less prosperous section of the community were the real sufferers from the wealth tax as it brought about loss of jobs.  It may be very unpalatable to some people, but the fact is that wealth creates business and jobs, and jobs are one of the country's main requirements today.</P>
    <P>The Minister during his speech restated the policy of the Government to maintain and improve the social services generally as far as possible. Pensions, health allowances and unemployment benefits are all to be increased by 10 per cent from April next. Every Member, particularly Deputies representing such a constituency as I do where unemployment is at its hardest and many old people live alone, should continue to strive to raise the standard of living for those people.  In the past Fianna Fáil have never overlooked the old age pensioners or the unemployed, and the Minister will undoubtedly endeavour to improve their lot in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Many thousands of couples in Dublin cannot find proper housing accommodation.  I meet this situation in my constituency all the time.  We must all accept and agree that the housing situation in Dublin has deteriorated seriously in the past four or five years.  The previous Government repeatedly referred to their record in housing during their term in office, <Col N="1590" /> but the real answer to their claims can be found in any clinic in Dublin on any week-end morning or any evening. I invite Deputies from the opposite side to come to my constituency to see the problems that we have in housing. Nothing has been done about housing in that constituency over the years.  The figures that have been thrown about here for some time suggest that there have been 25,000 new houses each year.  I do not know where they are. They are not in my constituency.  In Dublin North Central the prospects of people unfortunate enough not to have housing are very slim at present.  I will do everything possible to stress the importance of this matter to the Minister concerned.  I am not being critical of the housing section of Dublin Corporation. They have their problems, but over the past four years there has been very heavy unemployment in the building trade.  Obviously this area was not a priority on the Coalition Government's list.  I have learned recently that some Opposition Members have been saying that the Government's White Paper on Economic Planning and Development planned to cut back on local government housing.  This is completely untrue.  I suggest to those Deputies who are anxious to spread this rumour in Dublin that they should reread the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Discrimination against women in unemployment assistance has been one of the ugliest aspects of our society, and in recent years much has been said about social equality for women.  The Minister is to be congratulated on eliminating this injustice so quickly. There is disappointment of course that much more could not be done, particularly in relation to widows and deserted wives and also to the married woman who is in employment on a very low tax allowance.  Many such women are working because they need to supplement the income coming into their homes.</P>
    <P>There has been a general welcome for the long overdue increase in personal income tax allowances.  The relief is real and meaningful.  It means that the worker earning £70 a week and with two children will save about £4 per week, which is a saving of 40 per cent of the tax deduction prior to <Col N="1591" /> this new allowance.  These increased allowances combined with all of the other savings, such as rates, road tax, increased improvements in grants for houses and so on, and all the other areas that I have mentioned are of real value.  Above all they restore to the people's minds confidence in the country, and this is important in so many ways today.</P>
    <P>No one will begrudge any measures provided for improvements for veterans of the War of Independence.  Each year the numbers are growing smaller and smaller.  I should like the Minister to give some consideration to abolishing the assessment of such pensions for general income tax purposes.  The other measures taken granting telephone rental subsidies, free travel for spouses and other increased grants are all to be welcome and indeed are overdue.</P>
    <P>Nobody&mdash;and least of all the farmers themselves&mdash;will object to paying their fair share of income tax. As we all know, farmers' incomes have improved substantially over the past few years and the Minister's proposal would seem to have struck a fair balance.  The allowance of rates as a deduction has been one of the main bones of contention so far as farmers and income tax are concerned.  This has been so since the former Government first introduced farming taxation. Unlike other professions, farmers run into many problems relating to weather, market conditions, animal and crop losses, and so on.  It is fair and proper that farmers should be allowed also a single payment rate in the year following assessment.</P>
    <P>Having listened to Opposition speakers it would appear there is total opposition to all measures introduced excepting, perhaps, the abolition of wealth tax, although Deputy Kelly does not agree with that.  Fine Gael Deputies have already spoken in this Debate and have expressed personal satisfaction that wealth tax has been abolished.  I would hope, therefore, that the opposition to the concessions granted to workers, taxpayers, the unemployed, health beneficiaries, and so on, has been noted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> It would seem likely that if Fine Gael and Labour had their way we would have had the reintroduction of home rates with all the injustices of the rating system we experienced.  Obviously these would be restored.  Perhaps there would be no real increase in tax allowances or, as we experienced last year, a concession of £60 would be given with one hand and a new rate struck to take the concession away with the other.  Many taxpayers discovered this at a later stage.  The Coalition would obviously sit still and do nothing to bring about the necessary creation of new jobs for young people. They would reimpose motor taxation and perhaps even apply a vicious increase as they did in 1975 when, one must recall, tax on private cars necessary to travel to and from work was increased in some cases by as much as 75 per cent.  We cannot forget either in the same year the additional imposition of 15p on a gallon of petrol.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Coalition would do nothing about halting price rises.  The people have experienced this over the years in regard to the price of food on the table and the other necessaries of life for families and mothers with young children.  I would suggest that neither Fine Gael nor Labour are in any position to criticise the budget on social or economic grounds.  Any benefits given to social welfare recipients over the past few years were quickly eroded by price rises.  As we know economically there was no plan, no policy.  The Coalition Government stumbled into crisis after crisis of their own making.  They had no policy and they were not able to agree on any policy for obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Fianna Fáil Government has been to restore stability to the economy and the budget will contribute by not having taken any action likely to fuel inflation.  It will give substantial incentives to industry specifically with the aim of providing more employment, which is the most important point in the budget.  To finance the budget the Minister has estimated a borrowing requirement of £821 million, which of course is a lot of money even in 1978.  This is 13 per cent of our GNP, exactly as envisaged in the election manifesto.  Opposition speakers <Col N="1593" /> have condemned the extent of borrowing required, conveniently overlooking their own large scale borrowing, which did nothing for the economy, at a rate of over 16.2 per cent.</P>
