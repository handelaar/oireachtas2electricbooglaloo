      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has arranged any bilateral meetings with other EEC Prime Ministers on the proposed European Monetary System prior to the December Council meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping the continuing developments at official, ministerial and Central Bank level under review and, when these are further advanced, I shall seek any meeting on the European Monetary System which I consider desirable, in advance of the European Council in Brussels on 4 and 5 December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that meetings have taken place between the German Chancellor, the French President, the Italian Premier and the British Prime Minister, and in view of the fact that work on concurrent studies by the group dealing with transfer resources has been tardy, would the Taoiseach not agree it is necessary for him to seek early meetings with other Prime Ministers to avert the likelihood that he may be faced with a simple declaration rather than an actual commitment <Col N="144" /> on a transfer of resources in excess of £650 million at the Council meeting in December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated to the Deputy, I am keeping the situation under review.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance has been meeting his counterparts.  There have been contacts at Central Bank and departmental level and naturally I am getting reports back.  As soon as I see the need and the likelihood of a fruitful outcome of these meetings I will certainly make arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that, in this case, in view of the particularly tight controls Chancellor Schmidt exercises in these areas of policy, it would be desirable to have a meeting at heads of Government level and that past experience in our own case and in other countries has indicated that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unreasonable to await the return of the Minister for Finance from Bonn before I seek a meeting with the Chancellor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree this is a very fast changing situation?  Only a few weeks are left before the decisive meeting in December.  There are reports in the Press that some agreement was reached between the Italians and the Germans on possible transfer resources.  Therefore opportunities may be slipping out of our grasp and an early meeting with some of the principals in these negotiations is called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say again that when these meetings seem to be desirable and likely to be fruitful I will certainly avail of any opportunity to meet heads of Government.  I can assure the Deputy no opportunity will be let slip to make sure our interests are properly looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): As I explained in my reply on 24 October 1978 to Questions Nos. 473 and 474 by Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy J. Walsh, the provision of the transmitter network for RTE 2 has had to be undertaken in phases.  Technical considerations dictated that the main transmitting stations should be provided first.  For operational reasons, provision has also been made to provide RTE 2 transposers at the outset at a number of low-powered stations.</P>
      <P>RTE say that detailed planning for the extension of RTE 2 to the remaining parts of the country will commence as soon as possible.  Priority will be given in this phase to single channel areas, like those mentioned by the Deputy, where transposers have been provided for the first television service.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): As I said in my reply, attention had to be paid to the main transmitters which will supply 90 per cent of the <Col N="146" /> viewers.  Priority had to be given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

I am addressing my remarks more to the Taoiseach than to the Minister.  Is it not completely unfair to ask applicants for the telephone service to pay seven years rent in advance?

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the vital im-portance of speeding up progress in the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis in order to guarantee the survival of our export trade in livestock, meat and dairy produce.  I am also aware that to achieve that progress it is necessary to control the movement of diseased animals so as to prevent the continuing spread of infection to disease-free herds.  The 30-day pre-movement test is, therefore, a key element in the comprehensive programme to accelerate disease eradication which I announced some time ago and which has been approved by the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> The EEC legislation makes no provision for a 60-day test.  Apart from that, however, I am satisfied that the 30-day test is fully justified on veterinary grounds and for the protection it will afford to all those farmers who purchase stock from time to time.  I do not, therefore, propose to replace it with a 60-day test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the extra 30 days wait is a great hardship to farmers?  If a man brings his cattle to the market and does not sell within 30 days he can neither test nor sell for a further 30 days.  Is the Minister aware that that is the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot test for a further 30 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the whole trouble is.  The farmer cannot move for another 30 days.  I am not against the Minister in his efforts to clear away disease.  That is vital.  But this extra 30 days during which a farmer cannot sell or test is an unnecessary hardship because the cattle have been tested and found free of disease.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do realise the implications. It is a difficulty that sellers will have to face up to because there is no answer to the question of whether one can move diseased cattle and sell them to one's neighbour or not.  They cannot be sold.  A 60-day test would be too long. Infection could easily take place in that time.  It would be totally unsatisfactory and would not work and I have no intention of even considering a 60-day test.  I do not want to be unreasonable about this but any prevarication or wishy-washy approach to this vital question of disease eradication cannot be con-templated.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that this 30-day test imposes a severe handicap on the small farmers in the west and south-west.  Many of these sell only a single animal at fairs and marts.  Will the Minister not reconsider the impact this 30-day test will have on some farmers?  Am I to assume that a farmer with a single animal for a fair in south Kerry or Galway must employ a vet, pay £8 for the vet to travel out, plus the cost of the test of the animal?  He must go to all this expense before he can take that animal to a fair or mart.  Surely the Minister's move is completely unreasonable so far as such farmers are concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of charges indicated by the Veterinary Union does seem to militate against people selling small lots of cattle.  It does not exclude either private arrangements that may be made between the veterinary surgeon and the herd-owner.  There is no doubt that a burden will be borne by herd owners but there is no avoiding that burden.  We cannot permit a situation to continue where reactors are being sold from farmer to farmer in the marts and fairs.  In the past five years the incidence of both brucellosis and TB almost doubled and we must reverse that trend quickly and stop the nonsense.  That is what I propose to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, notwithstanding the need for an accelerated programme, that as a result of this package the financial burden will fall most heavily on smaller producers of store cattle?  Does the Minister accept that proposition and, if so, what will he do about it?  Is he perfectly satisfied that the veterinary evidence is compelling that it is not possible to do another test without a further 30-day waiting period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The charge made by veterinary surgeons has been for a long time in the region of £4 per visit.  If the same herd owner of a single beast or two beasts had to send for the veterinary surgeon for some other veterinary reason he would have to pay the £4 visit fee.  That has not changed.  The scale of charges indicated by the Veterinary Union is taking care of the fact that in the case of a tuberculosis test it is necessary for the test to be read.  It must first be administered and then read some hours afterwards.  It involves a second visit. There is no way in which the difficulty of stopping reactor cattle being sold in the marts to anyone who is foolish enough to buy them can be avoided except by the application across the board to everybody selling cattle.  Only in that way will herd owners, large and small, be protected from the danger of buying a reactor at the mart.  I am trying to protect herd owners of all sizes from buying reactors as they have been doing in the past.  In that regard our performance in the past has been absolutely indefensible. I propose to change that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that question and Deputy Bruton's question together.  The question of a re-test after the first test is purely a veterinary matter. My advice is that there must be an adequate waiting period because, if there is not, the effectiveness of the second test will be negatived.  I am prepared to listen to veterinary advice alone on that subject. If the veterinary advice is otherwise and if it is sound, then I will act on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister whether all this could eventuate in the marts being made somewhat obsolete in that on-farm sales, conditional on the passing of tests, may now become the mode of operation, particularly for the small farmer on whom the burden of cost will be quite severe.  Is the Minister aware of the extreme difficulty created for many herd owners by virtue of the date, despite the early warning notice of that date, because the second inspection for headage grants had not taken place and in some cases has not yet taken place?  People were compelled to hold on to their animals, if they were to get the headage grants, until after the second test and the date on which this scheme came into operation intervened.  These are the two things which are uppermost in the minds of small farmers in my part of the country.  Is Deputy M.P. Murphy's question about cost not a very real one in so far as small farmers are concerned and will it not result in the ultimate analysis in small farmers being the losers to the extent of the additional test that will be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the possible redundancy of marts, there is absolutely no substance in this suggestion. On the day of the introduction of <Col N="157" /> the test it is true that the number of cattle shown in livestock marts was extremely small because there had been an exodus of cattle before that date in order to beat the deadline and the herd owners who bought before the deadline cattle which were untested did so at their own risk and were very ill-advised.  Since that time the cattle have returned to the marts because a great many cattle must be sold.  We are discovering that the application of the 30-day test is no more difficult than the application of the 14-day test which we had to apply long ago for export cattle.  The difficulties are be-ing manufactured by vested interests who have an interest in maintaining the present situation, but it is my intention to change the present situation for the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that what has been going on, and can still go on despite the 30-day test, will not be allowed to continue.  The accredited areas, such as the area I come from, have now a higher incidence than when they were first tested in the fifties and this was going on while the eyes of the Department were wide open.

      <P>I should be grateful to Deputy Blaney if he would let me have any relevant information which would lead to the apprehension of people involved in the criminal activity of frustrating the disease eradication scheme.  It is necessary to say in connection with Deputy Blaney's observations that for a period of two years disease eradication was virtually abandoned and as a result of that abandonment of disease eradication we find ourselves in this really serious situation.  This is not to say <Col N="158" /> that the situation which existed before was satisfactory; it was not.  We cannot go on any longer making demands on the taxpayers year after year for an eradication programme that is not working. It is my intention to make this eradication scheme work.</P>

Bringing them back means that he has got to do it again.  He does not have several opportunities and he does not have 30 days.

      <P>The facilities at my Department's laboratory at Thorndale in Dublin are designed to cater efficiently for the entire volume of brucellosis blood-testing arising in all areas in the foreseeable future. There is no undue delay in the issue of results by the laboratory.</P>

When a farmer has to send blood to Dublin for analysis, he has only 20 days or possibly less to sell his animals by the time it comes back. Surely the Minister must be aware of that?  Surely he must have read my question in which I asked if he would consider setting up some centre in Connacht where this blood can be analysed west of the Shannon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is no. Under the EEC Commission Decision addressed to the State on 19 July 1978 the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to implement our plans for the accelerated eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis had to be put into effect before 18 September 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I draw the Minister's attention to article 29 of the document I referred to earlier which says that the plans approved during 1978 must be completed not later than 31 December 1978?  Would the Minister agree, in view of the fact that he waited until after the fodder-making season, August, to announce the introduction of the 30-day test, even though he agreed to it in December 1977, that he should have postponed the introduction of this requirement until December so that farmers who had not made enough fodder, as they would have done if they had known the 30-day test was to be introduced, would have had some degree of freedom in relation to the disposal of cattle and not find themselves, as many may do in a bad winter, having to hold on to cattle but not having anything to feed them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Bruton is <Col N="172" /> arguing for a postponement of the disease eradication programme I am telling him that there will be no postponement. His suggestion that there was some connection with the announcement of the introduction of the 30-day test and the ending of the fodder-making season is, in my opinion, absolute nonsense.  No farmer makes his plans on the basis of the disease eradication programme but he bears in mind the ever present necessity for his herd being locked up, that is if he is a good stockman and a good farmer.  The possibility of having his herd locked up would in no way be affected by the introduction of the 30-day test.  The decision to introduce the 30-day test was made in order that the possibility of this man having his herd locked up would be greatly reduced.  I am confident that it will.</P>

The statement at that time may have been true enough in the existing animal disease testing scheme.  Since then the method of testing animals has been changed and improved.  There has also been a rapid decline in the health status of our cattle.  I am surprised that Deputy Bruton or anybody else should not find this a very disturbing situation.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide for the conversion of the existing flat-rate and pay-related social insurance contributions and flat-rate occupational injuries contributions into fully pay-related contributions. There will be separate Bills to deal with pay-related redundancy contributions and health contributions.  When the new social insurance contribution system comes into operation in April 1979 all of these contributions in respect of employees will be collected together as a proportion of their pay.</P>
      <P>Over the years there has been widespread criticism of the inequitable aspects of the flat-rate social insurance contribution system.  The system of fully pay-related contributions is intended to redress this situation.  It will benefit not only employee but also employer as well as improving the system of collecting contributions for my Department.  I shall discuss the effects of the proposals later but first I should like to outline for Deputies the background to the Bill and the purpose of the changes envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before doing so, however, I must mention that the present social insurance system is based on the Social Welfare Act, 1952, to which a considerable body of legislation has been added over the years making up the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1978.  Consolidation of this legislation is in hand but cannot be completed at this stage.  The present Bill takes the form mainly of providing for amendments of these Acts.  Because of this, it is somewhat technical and complex and details of the new scheme may <Col N="268" /> not be readily apparent from its terms. The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill will, I trust, be of assistance to Deputies in this regard.  I shall, of course, be happy to clarify any matters on which further explanation is required.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the present social insurance system has two funds, the social insurance fund, out of which all benefits other than those related to occupational injuries are paid, and the occupational injuries fund which I will deal with later.  The social insurance fund is financed by way of flat-rate contributions, the 3 per cent pay-related contribution introduced in 1974, and an Exchequer subvention.  This method is, in the overall, regressive in its impact on contributors.  The flat-rate contribution, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the total financing of the social insurance fund, is clearly regressive and the effectiveness of the present pay-related contribution in achieving vertical redistribution is limited by the comparatively low earnings ceiling of £2,500 on which the contribution is levied.  The maximum pay-related contribution payable annually in respect of any employee is £75, that is 3 per cent of £2,500, of which the employer would pay £50 and the employee £25.  The regressive nature of the flat-rate contribution, in which no account is taken of the ability of the employee to pay, means that, in the case of the lower paid employees, this contribution can be a considerable burden.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in order to ease this burden on lower-paid workers, the flat-rate social insurance contribution payable for workers with earnings of less than £50 a week was reduced by £1 a week last January.  This concession was increased from April last, so that at present the worker earning less than £50 a week has his contribution reduced by £1.16 a week and his employer's contribution is reduced by 34p a week.  It was recognised when these provisions were made, however, that they were only a &ldquo;stop-gap&rdquo; measure pending the introduction of fully pay-related contributions. The new system will subsume these reductions and so consolidate the benefits given by them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> The ordinary weekly rate of flat-rate contribution payable by employees, including the redundancy and health contribution, is £3.42 for men and £3.35 for women, less in each case £1.16 for those earning less than £50 a week.  Employees also pay a 1 per cent pay-related contribution on pay up to £2,500 a year. For workers earning £25 a week, therefore, insurance contributions represent about 10 per cent of their pay, for workers earning £50 a week, 7.8 per cent and for workers earning £100 a week, 3.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The flat-rate social insurance contribution is also a heavy burden on the employer in the case of labour-intensive industries.  The weekly contribution payable by the employer, including that for redundancy and occupational injuries, is £5.26 for male employees and £5.21 for female employees plus 2 per cent of pay up to £2,500 a year.  As was mentioned in the Government's Green Paper on Development for Full Employment, the introduction of the new pay-related contribution system will, by reducing wage costs in labour intensive industries, make a positive contribution to the achievement of the Government's employment objectives without involving additional public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It can also be said of the flat-rate contribution system that it is a somewhat inflexible method of financing the services. The income from contributions varies only with increases or decreases in the level of employment and there is no buoyancy of income where levels of pay rise.  Thus, increases of income needed to pay increased rates of benefit can only be assured by increasing the rates of contributions.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main features of the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The new system will commence on 6 April next though certain provisions of the Bill, such as those requiring confirmation or variation of rates of contribution before commencement of the scheme, will take effect from other dates. It is intended that the new contribution will, like the present 3 per cent pay-related contribution which it will subsume, be collected for the vast majority <Col N="270" /> of employees by the Revenue Commissioners through the PAYE system of income tax collection.  It is necessary, therefore, to start the scheme at the beginning of the income tax year.  Section 6 of the Bill will enable me as Minister for Social Welfare to assign all necessary functions relating to the collection and recovery of contributions to the Collector-General of Revenue.</P>
    <P>I might explain for Deputies the reason for the various functions that I may under the Bill assign to the Collector-General.  Though the present 3 per cent pay-related contribution provides a basis for the new fully pay-related contribution system, there is much more involved in the new system than a mere increase in the rate of that contribution.  The new system will see the end of the stamped insurance card. This removes a basic source of information at present on individual insurance records.  Though there are many problems and difficulties inherent in the stamped card system it can be said that it provides a fairly efficient system of recording weekly contributions on which the social insurance system is based. With the abolition of the card, the main source of information available to the Department for the purpose of maintaining insured persons' records will be the data which employers will be required to submit to the Revenue Commissioners. The collection of this data by the Revenue Commissioners and its availability to my Department will be vital for the efficient operation of the social insurance code.  Without it, insured persons records would be deficient and this could lead to delays in payments and hardship to claimants.</P>
    <P>The collection of the information needed for the determination of claims to benefit will be as important a task for the Revenue Commissioners under the new system as is the collection of contributions. For these reasons, the Collector-General must be equipped with all the necessary powers to enable him to pursue the collection of contributions and to secure the prompt return of information relating to contributions and the duration of insurable employment covered by them.</P>
    <P>Employers will, under regulations, be <Col N="271" /> required to keep records of their employees' earning and duration of employment and these records will be open to inspection.  Also, information obtained by the Revenue Commissioners will be made available to my Department where required for the maintenance of insured persons' records, the determination of benefit claims and to assist in any action by officers of my Department to ensure that employers are fulfilling their contribution obligations.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to discuss how contributions will be calculated I should perhaps refer to the position of those employees who do not come within the scope of the PAYE system, including employees of companies incorporated outside the State who are paid from outside the State.  These employees, relatively few in number, will pay a pay-related contribution under special collection machinery which will be operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  Such special arrangements already exist in relation to those employees for whom the existing 3 per cent pay-related contribution is due.</P>
    <P>Under the new system, a contribution will be due on every payment of reckonable earnings made to an employee up to the limit of an annual ceiling.  A definition of reckonable earnings will be contained in regulations. These will be the same earnings as are used for income tax purposes and on which the present 3 per cent pay-related contribution is collected, that is, gross earnings in cash less approved superannuation contributions.</P>
    <P>A ceiling to the amount of reckonable earnings on which contributions are charged is a feature of the present 3 per cent pay-related scheme and it is being continued in the new system.  Benefits payable are for the most part flat-rate and, in the circumstances, it would be unreasonable not to have a limit by way of a ceiling on earnings liable to contribution. Among countries which operate earnings-related schemes, including those where benefit is earnings-related, there is a widespread practice of having a ceiling which is related to average earnings and is set at a level <Col N="272" /> which ensures that the bulk of the earnings of the vast majority of workers is within it.  This practice was followed when our present pay-related scheme was introduced and workers and employers are now familiar with it.</P>
    <P>The earnings ceiling of £5,000 specified in the Bill is intended, following the international practice which I have just mentioned, to cover the bulk of the earnings of the great majority of workers.  It is, however, a provisional figure.  The level of the ceiling was determined having regard to the latest information available, at the time the Bill was published, of the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries. Power is taken in the Bill to enable the ceiling to be confirmed or recalculated on the basis of whatever later information becomes available before the scheme commences.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for variation of the ceiling from time to time as required and that, when a change is made, account would be taken of variations in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries.  For obvious administrative reasons the ceiling can only be changed with effect from the beginning of an income tax year and it would, of course, have to be determined in good time before that date to avoid inconvenience to employers who must operate the system.</P>
    <P>Before moving to other aspects of the scheme, I should like to explain to Deputies how the ceiling will operate in the case of employees who work at the same time for two or more employers. For employees, the maximum liability for contributions will always be limited by the level of the current ceiling on earnings in a contribution year.  No contribution will be payable by an employee on any part of his earnings which exceeds that ceiling, even if these earnings are aggregated from different employments. In the case of the employer who takes on a worker already engaged in other employment, however, it is not proposed that earnings from both employments should be aggregated so as to relieve the employer concerned of the social insurance contributions which he would pay if he were the only employer. Accordingly, I am proposing in the Bill <Col N="273" /> that such an employer should pay the employer's element of the contribution on all earnings paid by him up to the ceiling.  This proposal will ensure that it will be more advantageous, in respect of social insurance liability, for an employer to take on a person already in other employment rather than to engage someone on the live register.</P>
    <P>There will be a standard rate of contribution in respect of employees who are eligible for all social insurance benefits.  The effect of this will be to eliminate the present differential in the flat-rate contributions as between men and women and as between ordinary and agricultural employment.  These differentials, which have not been increased for many years and have thus become relatively small by reference to the overall contribution rates, were introduced largely to take account of the lower earnings of the workers concerned. In the case of women, account was also taken of restrictions in benefit entitlements which have now been removed except in the case of certain married women whose benefits in respect of sickness or unemployment are restricted.</P>
    <P>A fully pay-related contribution of its nature automatically embodies a differential between individuals or groups to the extent that their levels of pay differ. There is, therefore, no need for continuation of the existing differentials.</P>
    <P>The standard rate of social insurance contribution specified in the Bill is 11.2 per cent, of which 7.8 per cent is payable by the employer and 3.4 per cent by the employee.  The purpose of the Bill is, as I have indicated, to convert the present contributions to fully pay-related ones and the rates of social insurance contributions have been calculated by reference to the most recent income distribution data and the £5,000 ceiling to yield approximately the same income as would have been produced by flat-rate contributions and the 3 per cent pay-related contribution.  At this stage the rates are provisional and they will, like the earnings ceiling to which I have already referred, be reviewed and either confirmed or varied by regulations before the scheme commences.  This <Col N="274" /> review of the rates will have regard to the most up to date information regarding income distribution and the income yields required for benefit purposes. The rates of 7.8 per cent and 3.4 per cent take account of the special increase of 31p in the flat-rate contribution which was introduced in 1975 to help to meet the cost of the high level of unemployment claims and has been continued on an annual basis since then. The need for further continuation of this increase will also be considered in the context of the review to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>The new pay-related system of contributions will apply to all persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts. Employees in the public sector and other employees who are insured for a limited number of benefits of the social insurance system pay special reduced flat-rate contributions but do not pay the present 3 per cent pay-related contribution. Their flat-rate contribution will now be converted to pay-related contributions at reduced rates appropriate to the cost of the limited benefits for which they are insured.  The new rates in these cases will be provided by regulations under section 12 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>The present flat-rate contributions payable by voluntary contributors are similarly being converted into income-related contributions.  These will be collected directly by my Department as a percentage of the reckonable income of the contributor up to the ceiling of £5,000.  Reckonable income for this purpose is to be defined by regulations and will include earnings as a self-employed person.  Rates for each of the three classes of voluntary contributor are specified in the Bill.  These rates are made up of the elements of the standard rate for employees which are appropriate to the benefits covered by each category of voluntary contribution.  As with the ceiling and the standard rate, the rates of voluntary contributions specified in the Bill&mdash;4.4 per cent, 2.7 per cent and 1.7 per cent&mdash;are provisional at this stage and they will be either confirmed or varied before the commencement of the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> An outline of the situation in regard to tax relief on the new contributions would, I feel, be helpful as this is not a matter which needs to be provided for in this Bill though it is relevent to the rate of contribution.  As Deputies may be aware, at present an employee can claim income tax relief in respect of the pensions element of his flat-rate social insurance contribution.  As the contribution is flat-rate this is a fixed sum each year.  Under a pay-related contribution system, the amount of this relief could change with every payment of earnings made to an employee.  To avoid the difficulties that would arise in applying such a variable deduction, direct tax relief on the employee's social insurance contribution will be discontinued.  In compensation for the extra income tax thus charged on the employee, the overall increase in the amount of tax collected has been taken into account in calculating the employee's contribution and the appropriate reduction made in the rate of contribution.  If tax relief had not been taken into account in this way, the overall contribution would, like the existing pay-related contribution, be shared on a 2 to 1 basis between employer and employee with the employee's rate being 3.9 per cent instead of as it will be 3.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the rates of contribution are designed to replace the income which would have been raised by the existing contribution system, had this continued. In the calculation of the rates, it was accepted that the cost of the concession afforded in the employee's rate to compensate for the loss of the income tax relief will be met by an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Flat-rate contributions of 19p and 16p are at present payable for male and female employees respectively in respect of occupational injuries insurance.  These will also be converted under section 16 of the Bill to a pay-related contribution at the standard rate of 0.45 per cent of an employee's reckonable earnings up to the ceiling of £5,000 to which I have referred earlier.  As in the case of the new social insurance contribution, the existing <Col N="276" /> difference in contribution for men and women will, therefore, cease to apply. This contribution is payable only by the employer and is paid into a separate occupational injuries fund.  In recent years expenditure on benefits, which is growing each year, and on the administration of the occupational injuries insurance scheme has exceeded income from contributions and the rate of 0.45 per cent is intended to ensure that the fund remains solvent.  So far as the occupational injuries insurance scheme is concerned, therefore, the proposals are more than a straightforward conversion of the flat-rate contribution since they are designed also to rectify the deficit situation.  The rate of 0.45 per cent will also be subject to confirmation or variation in the light of any new information on income distribution and benefit changes before April next.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the rates I have quoted include decimal fractions and the calculation of contributions by employers who do not have computerised payroll systems could pose difficulties.  To facilitate such employers with their calculations, tables of contributions or ready reckoners will be provided.</P>
    <P>The change-over from a weekly stamped card system to one under which contributions are payable only on payment of earnings necessitates some additional legislative changes, the most important of which relates to the contribution conditions for benefit under the social insurance system.  These conditions require a specified number of contributions to have been paid.  At present, a contribution is payable for a person in respect of every contribution week in which he is insurably employed.  The number of contributions paid or, if you wish, stamps on his record, thus represents the number of contribution weeks during which he was insurably employed.</P>
    <P>Under the new pay-related system, contributions will be payable only when payments of reckonable earnings up to the ceiling are made.  When the ceiling is reached no further contributions will be due in that contribution year.  Also, in the case of a person who is fully employed throughout the year and is <Col N="277" /> paid monthly, for instance, only 12 contributions at most would be due in the year but these contributions would represent 52 weeks of insurable employment. Thus, the number of contributions will not necessarily be the same as the number of weeks of insurable employment in respect of which they are paid.  It is consequently necessary in the various contribution conditions to substitute for the number of contributions paid, the number of weeks of insurable employment for which contributions have been paid or would have been paid but for the operation of the ceiling.  This is provided for in section 13 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The new pay-related contribution system in terms of legislative provisions and administrative arrangements represents a major departure from the existing system.  To ensure continuity between the two, section 20 of the Bill enables transitional arrangements to be made by regulations.  This provision will be availed of to ensure that the change-over is effected without any disruption in benefit entitlements.  It will, for example, be necessary to provide for special contribution and benefit year arrangements for disability benefit and unemployment benefit purposes to cover the period up to the year 1981 when the preceding income tax year will for the first time be the governing contribution year for benefit purposes for both men and women.</P>
    <P>These then are the main provisions being made in the Bill.  Before finishing I should like to talk about some effects which these proposals will have.</P>
    <P>To take first a specific case, female domestics in private employment are insured for all benefits of the social insurance system but are excluded from the pay-related benefit scheme because it was not possible to arrange for the collection of the 3 per cent pay-related contribution for them.  Because of a more comprehensive system of collection now possible, they will be included in the new pay-related contribution system and will then be covered for pay-related benefit for the first time.  The standard rate of contribution will apply to them.</P>
    <P>For employees generally the new contribution system will eliminate the <Col N="278" /> regressive aspects of the present flat-rate contribution system which bears heavily on the lower paid worker and will relate the level of contribution to ability to pay. It will also remove an anomalous situation arising in relation to the present £1.16 reduction in the contribution of employees earning less than £50 a week. A man earning say, £49.50 a week, is at present liable for a total social insurance contribution of £2.11 leaving his pay £47.39 net of that deduction.  If his pay were increased to £50, his contribution would go up to £3.27, leaving him £46.73 after deduction, which is 66 pence less than he had before his pay was increased.  The new system, by scaling up the contribution directly and proportionately as pay increases, will prevent this happening.</P>
    <P>Employees on the higher pay levels will pay more under the new contribution system than by way of their present flat-rate and 1 per cent pay-related contribution. However, the new pay-related contribution will not be charged on earnings in excess of the ceiling and they will gain in another way.  I propose by regulation to raise the ceiling applying to the pay-related benefit scheme from the commencement of the new contribution system from the present level of £2,500 to whatever ceiling is finally determined for contribution purposes and to maintain parity in future.  Higher paid workers would benefit from this proposal which will give them higher overall payments of benefits when they are sick or unemployed.</P>
    <P>With the ceiling and rates proposed, employees earning less than about £80 per week will pay less by way of social insurance contributions under the new system than under the flat-rate system. This will mean that, of the employees who will be paying contributions at the standard rate, about 500,000 will pay less by way of contribution under the new scheme while about 200,000 will pay more.  For employers, the new system will provide a simpler way of collecting the various &ldquo;social&rdquo; contributions payable and will relieve them of the work connected with the handling and safe custody of insurance cards and stamps.  The existence, since 1974, of a <Col N="279" /> dual system of collection of insurance contributions, with flat-rate contributions being collected largely by means of the sale of insurance stamps at post offices and pay-related contributions being collected in conjunction with the PAYE income tax system, has added to the expenses of employers as well as imposing an undue administrative burden on the insurance funds.  The new system will thus eliminate duplication of work and reduce costs.  It will also remove the complication and responsibility for employers of ensuring that the appropriate reduced rate of stamp is used only for those earning less than £50 a week.</P>
    <P>In respect of an employee earning less than about £73 per week the employer's social insurance and occupational injuries insurance contribution will be reduced.  How individual employers will be affected will depend on the numbers of employees they have whose earnings are above and below that figure.</P>
    <P>For my Department, the new system will, in addition to the reduction in administrative costs to which I have referred, eliminate certain problems and difficulties associated with the existing card-stamping system, including the question of security and fraud arising from the theft, counterfeiting or re-use of stamps.  It will also facilitate computerised methods being employed in the processing of information, leading to a more efficient records system.</P>
    <P>I should refer at this point to the effect which abolishing the present scheme will have for postmasters who are paid on the basis of the work which they do. About 60 per cent of income from flat-rate contributions is collected by way of insurance stamps sold at all post offices. Payment to postmasters at sub-post offices for this work now amounts to about £1.2 million a year and this is met from the insurance funds.  The proportion of any individual postmaster's income deriving from work connected with the sale of insurance stamps depends on the extent of such sales.  This work will of course cease and its cessation would affect the remuneration of postmasters at sub-post offices.  The <Col N="280" /> Irish Postmasters' Union has raised this matter with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and I understand that discussions are at present proceeding at the postmasters' concilliation council which is the agreed body for dealing with the remuneration of postmasters.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper &ldquo;Development for Full Employment&rdquo; points out that the need for a tighter system of control of expenditure implies that social welfare schemes are designed in the most effective way to cover the contingencies for which they are primarily intended.  In this regard, as stated in the paper, a review of the existing provisions relating to exclusion from social insurance of subsidiary employment and employments of inconsiderable extent is being undertaken.  This issue is of particular relevance in the context of the new pay-related system.  The inclusion within the scope of the insurance system of employments of a minor nature on which the employees are not mainly dependent for their livelihood could result in a situation in which employees could work minimal hours and pay minimal contributions which would entitle them to flat-rate benefits on a par with full-time workers.  The review will be completed and any necessary amendments to the existing regulations made before the new contribution scheme commences.</P>
    <P>The outline which I have given of the proposed new system has of necessity been rather general.  This is because many of the detailed arrangements of the scheme will be made by regulations.  The working out of the finer points of a scheme such as this involves consultation between my Department, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and other Departments concerned.  Intensive examination of possible procedures and the requirements of my Department in operating the social insurance code is necessary to ensure that there will be no major teething troubles after 6 April next.  The consultations have been in progress for some months now and whilst some work still remains to be done, the arrangements will be finalised in good time to enable the preparatory work of instructing employers in the working of the new contributions to be <Col N="281" /> completed and the scheme successfully implemented from 6 April next.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in this Bill represent a major development in the modernisation and improvement of our welfare system and it is with great pleasure that I recommend the Bill to Dail Eireann for its early and favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>The minimum cost of lunch in Leinster House today is £2.50. The maximum rate payable by this State to a contributory old age pensioner is £2.29 per day.  Therefore, when the Minister commends this Bill and asks for a favourable response from the House he is asking us, apparently, to continue to endorse a situation where the maximum amount which this State and this House pay to an old age pensioner is less than the cost of one meal in the restaurant of this House of Parliament. Of course, if the pensioner is over 80 years of age he gets an extra 14p a day, giving him a grand total of £2.43.  If he is unfortunate enought to be a non-contributory old age pensioner with no means whatsoever he will get the maximum return of the non-contributory old age pension; that will mean he will get £1.94 per day, or if he is over 80 he will get an extra 15p to give him a grand total of £2.09p, to provide for all his bodily needs.  All of those rates per day are far less than the cost of one meal in this House or indeed in virtually any restaurant in this country.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to make it administratively more easy to produce more revenue from the social insurance contributors in a faster method in return for what are virtually unchanged benefits.  With the exception of making the category known as &ldquo;female domestics&rdquo; eligible for pay-related benefit, in return of course for pay-related contributions, there is no attempt whatsoever in this Bill to improve the lot of social welfare recipients of any sort. Indeed, in many ways the relative position of groups of people appears to have worsened.  However, we can have a look at that as we go through the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard at the weekend the suggestion of the Minister for Economic Planning <Col N="282" /> and Development that the middle-income group, having benefited from the abolition of domestic house rates and of motor car taxation, ought now be asked to pay more for the privilege of having returned his party to power.  This Bill is part of that philosophy.  As the Minister has explained, not perhaps as starkly as I might say it, the middle-income earner is the man who is hit here.  Most people examine legislation, rules and government increasingly today on how it affects their pockets.  This Bill is designed to hit the pocket of the middle-income earner, of the very man who, as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said, had benefited by some of the electoral promises of his Government and who is going to be asked to pay more in social insurance and pay-related contributions than he pays at present.  I do not see contained in this Bill any reciprocation in additional payments of benefits which he or his dependants might be entitled to.  Surely if you want to adopt the very worth-while principle of making social insurance contributions pay-related you should also adopt the worth-while and extremely laudable aim of making social insurance benefits pay-related.  There has been no attempt to make any additional benefits pay-related with the exception of benefits for female domestics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The ceiling has been increased in return for increased contributions. I do not object to that at all as it is the main principle of any insurance scheme.  The essence of any insurance scheme is that the benefit is in proportion to the amount paid.  Not many people would be prepared to pay more for an insurance policy without getting increased benefits, but that is what the social insurance contributor is being asked to do.  There is no attempt to make old age pensions, widows' pensions, deserted wives' allowances, death grants and so on pay-related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asks us to welcome the concept of pay-related contributions.  I welcome them and any extension of insurance in exchange for benefits.  If insurance <Col N="283" /> contributions are to be pay-related then benefits should also be pay-related. The Bill is a success only in so far as it makes contributions pay-related. I am afraid that the middle-income group, the soft touches who were attacked again recently by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, are becoming the favourite target of the Government.  They are the easiest group for the Government to turn to to help finance changes in the administrative structure.  This group is least organised and least likely to strike back. The most important effect of this Bill will be to make the middle-income earner pay more for benefits to which he is presently entitled.</P>
    <P>The Bill presented the Minister with an ideal opportunity to reform the social insurance code, which we have all spoken about from time to time.  The Minister has agreed that there are inequities in that code.  He has expressed his desire to eliminate the inequities but has failed to do so.  He introduces what he describes as a major Bill to change the Social Welfare Acts but makes no effort to look at the areas of inequity.  The only way in which he has attempted to deal with discrimination is to say that the contributions made by females will be at the same percentage rate of income as the rates paid by males.  He has not made an attempt to eliminate areas of discrimination such as the shorter periods of payment of benefit and the amount of benefit paid to women who are insured under the scheme and who become eligible for benefit.</P>
    <P>I agree that men and women should pay the same rate of contribution but I would have thought that women were entitled to the same benefit.  The only element of largesse in the Minister's speech is that he may dole out some sort of ready reckoner to employers in order to help them cope with the complicated new system.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the rates.  The maximum rate for a contributory old age pensioner under 80 is £16.5 or £2.29 per day.  The maximum rate for a non-contributory old age pensioner with an income of less than £6 per week is <Col N="284" /> £13.60, or £1.94 per day.  The maximum rate for a widow's contributory pension, under 80, is £14.60 or £2.8 per day; for those over 80, the rate is £15.75 or £2.75 per day.  Are we satisfied that we are introducing a major change in the social welfare code when we are prepared to continue that level of benefit without making it relate to the income of recipients and to the pay-related contribution?</P>
    <P>There should have been an expression of intent to relate benefits to contributions. People who could reasonably be described as having similar outgoings are all paid at varying and inexplicably different rates under the social welfare code.  The maximum rate for a widow's contributory pension is £14.60 and there is a payment of £4.90 per week in respect of each child.  If a widow dies, an orphan's allowance of £10.60 will be paid in respect of each child, yet if that widow, or an equivalent widow, in receipt of an occupational injuries widow's pension were to die her orphan child would have an orphan's pension of £11.30 per week.  The maximum contributory pension is £14.60 per week, yet for some inexplicable reason the widow in receipt of occupational injuries benefit receives £18.85 per week.</P>
    <P>These differences in the code do not seem to have any degree of equity.  Are they not the sort of things that could have been examined and revised by this House in what was apparently to be a major review of the social welfare code? A married man with two children who is receiving unemployment assistance as opposed to benefit receives £27.60 as a maximum amount per week.  That means he receives less than £4 per day for each day of the week out of which he is expected to feed and clothe his wife and two children, to house them and to look after them generally.  In any kind of review of the social welfare code is that not the sort of thing we should be examining?</P>
    <P>On all sides of the House we have spoken often about the fact that there still remains within the social welfare code clear-cut areas of discrimination against women in employment or seeking employment, against women who had been in insurable employment and <Col N="285" /> who seek benefit in return for their insurance contributions.  We have been told by all sides of the House that this is unfair and that at the first available opportunity those areas of inequity would be eliminated, and when we asked the Minister from time to time why he had not done anything about it, he has explained in his persuasive and seductive way, to use his own expression in relation to another measure before the House, that these things must be handled in an orderly manner and dealt with as opportunities arise.  I would never presume that my manner might be persuasive or seductive, but I suggest this is an ideal opportunity in legislation designed to amend the social welfare code to eliminate these obvious areas of discrimination.</P>
    <P>For instance, a woman who has been in insurable employment and who has paid her insurance contributions and who becomes unemployed is only eligible for 156 days unemployment benefit as opposed to a man who is paid for 390 days.  In other words, a married woman receives payment for marginally less than half the length of time during which her male counterpart receives payment. Up to today the only justification that could be given for such discrimination was that there were marginally different rates of social welfare contributions in respect of a man and a woman.  That rate of contribution is being eliminated and they will both pay 4.4 per cent of their incomes and the employer will pay 8.25 per cent.  If the same percentage of their incomes is to be paid into the social welfare fund, should they not both be entitled to the same period of benefit?  Is that not an anomaly that should have been eliminated from the code?</P>
    <P>If a married woman who is supported by her husband, whether she is living with or apart from him, has in her own right been in insurable employment and has paid the same percentage contributions of her income as any other male or female contributor of the fund why should she not receive the same benefit? Should she not be equally entitled to the same benefits for the same period of time as any other contributor?  Should she not <Col N="286" /> get the same level of benefit when she is unemployed?  At the moment the maximum unemployment benefit in respect of a man is £14.35 per week whereas a woman receives £12.50, which is the rate that applies to a person under the age of 18 years.  That is in relation to a woman who is dependent on her husband. If a married woman in employment who is contributing to the fund becomes unemployed she will not be paid benefit in respect of her husband if he is out of employment, yet when a married man is unemployed, if he is insured he can claim in respect of himself and an additional allowance in respect of his wife.  If a married woman becomes unemployed having been in insurable employment she can only claim in respect of herself, and if she endeavours to claim in respect of her husband, although he is unemployed, she will be refused payment of additional benefit in respect of the husband who is dependent on her unless he happens to be an invalid, and because of some strange quirk of the rules she must prove that her dependent husband is an invalid.  In respect of occupational injuries benefit, the maximum a female is entitled to is £15.70 per week as opposed to the male entitlement to £20.10 and the same conditions apply in respect of the woman whose husband is invalided.</P>
    <P>These are a few of the discriminatory areas which still exist in the code.  In fairness to him, the Minister has accepted in the House more than once that these are areas which need the attention of the House at the earliest possible date. We are now being given an opportunity to ask women to pay at the same percentage rate out of their incomes as men and surely such an opportunity should be availed of to provide that the same period of benefit, the same level of benefit and the same general conditions should apply to female single or married contributors and to male contributors. In that area nothing has been done except in relation to the female domestic employee who is now being included in the pay-related scheme for unemployment and disability benefit.  I welcome that, but it is small and the only area where there has been any attempt to improve <Col N="287" /> the condition of women in insurable employment.</P>
    <P>Should we not have had a look at the situation in respect of the rates paid by way of child allowances to contributory widows, non-contributory widows, occupational injuries, contributory widows and people in receipt of unemployment or disability benefits, old age or retirement benefits?  In respect of these there are different levels of payments in respect of child allowances.  I have suggested there should be pay-related benefits for pay-related contributions. On several occasions the Minister has agreed that the invidious means test about which we have complained so much about is in need of revision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

From that point of view I should have thought I was entitled to look at the operation of social assistance as well as social insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment a very harsh provision operates in the social insurance code whereby benefits such as occupational injuries benefit and disability <Col N="288" /> benefit are not taxable, but when the recipient of such benefit comes to retirement age he finds that, while he can switch from benefit to pension with little change in the amount paid by the State, his pension is taxable while the benefit is not taxable.  A person who may be in receipt of a small amount of money, usually from his employer, will discover that, while he was not taxed when in receipt of disability or occupational injuries benefit, when he switches to an old age pension he is then brought into the tax net and his real income falls.  There should have been an attempt in this legislation to ensure that this does not happen but no such attempt was made.</P>
      <P>The suggestion I am making is not revolutionary.  When a deserted wife reaches the qualifying age for an old age pension she may opt to continue to receive the deserted wife's benefit if it appears that she will be better off materially to receive that benefit rather than the old age pension.  Of course, a woman who has an income other than the deserted wife's benefit will discover that she should continue to receive that benefit rather than risk having the old age pension taxed.  I am suggesting that that kind of provision should have been built into the code generally.  The opportunity should have been taken in this measure to introduce a similar provision in relation to all beneficiaries who come to pension age and who have been in receipt of benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the following suggestion will be received by the Minister, but in a major review of the social welfare code the question of providing benefit to an insured male whose wife has deserted him and who has a family should have been considered.  We all understand and appreciate the very real difficulties, financial and social, experienced by a deserted wife, but often society is not as conscious of the difficulties experienced by a widower or by a deserted husband.  He finds himself obliged to continue in employment to provide financial security for his family, especially if they are young, and he also discovers that he must employ somebody&mdash;often a number of persons&mdash;to look after his children.  We should have considered the possibility of <Col N="289" /> providing a realistic allowance to which insured people could contribute in order to help a husband who becomes a widower or whose wife deserts him and who must employ a housekeeper.</P>
    <P>I discovered that there is a provision of this kind in one set of circumstances, namely, where a retirement pensioner is a married female.  If she can prove the ridiculous requirement to which I referred earlier, namely, that her husband not only is dependent on her, but is also an invalid, she gets an allowance in respect of her husband and if she dies her surviving invalided spouse is entitled to benefit at the same rate as the maximum contributory widow's pension.  In this one aspect there is provision whereby the surviving spouse of a pensioner is entitled to benefit but, of course, he must be invalided.  That kind of concept should be extended to a husband who is dependent on his spouse and I am disappointed that consideration has not been given to it.</P>
    <P>Although I can understand the complexities of the matter, I am disappointed that there has been no attempt to include the self-employed.  So far as social insurance by the State is concerned, the self-employed are left in a limbo.  I appreciate that there are difficulties and that the levels of contribution without the employer element might involve rather daunting claims on the incomes of the self-employed if they were brought into the social insurance code.  I appreciate also that a discussion paper was issued on this matter some time ago but a comprehensive social welfare code will not be comprehensive until we have tackled this admittedly difficult, thorny but nonetheless important question of compulsory insuring the self-employed.  I am thinking of this not only to make sure that they are entitled to benefit in the event of illness or unemployment but also that their dependants are covered in a State scheme.  It is apparent to all that very often people do not go to the trouble of covering themselves by way of a voluntary or private scheme in the event of illness or disability.  Consequently, real hardship can devolve on their families and dependants in the event of <Col N="290" /> their death or their becoming incapacitated. The State must grasp the neetle and introduce an equitable system of compulsory insurance for the self-employed. The Minister should give full consideration to the self-employed.  I am sure that the introduction of any such measure would have the widespread approval of all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is considering the position of the self-employed who are not eligible to contribute to the State compulsory insurance fund, he might exercise his mind regarding the anomalous position in which full-time Members of the Oireachtas find themselves in relation to payments to this State insurance fund.</P>
    <P>There is a range of other areas which is not included in the Bill but which is deserving of some comment from the Minister.  Concern has been expressed in the House on a number of occasions regarding the dependants of people who are insured socially in so far as these dependants are not covered for dental, optical and certain aural benefits.  There is developing now a rather grey area as to whether these people will be included in the extension of the health insurance scheme or whether they will remain without cover as a result of the provisions of this Bill not being extended to include them.  I trust the Minister will clarify the position in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister might like also to avail of this opportunity to explain to the House the reason for the delays being experienced by people who are insured currently in respect of dental, optical and aural benefits.  Sometimes the delays are considerable and in some cases there is failure in regard to having the benefits provided.  I refer in particular to the withdrawal recently of a number of professional people from these services in parts of the west.  If the Minister is introducing what he described as a more comprehensive method of pay-related contributions, he should at least ensure that the existing benefits for which people are insured under the flat-rate contribution system are made available to people who qualify for them.  It appears as if the existing level of services is not being maintained.</P>
    <P>I am rather confused regarding the <Col N="291" /> position of voluntary contributors.  I appreciate that some people in this category may not be in employment now or may have become self-employed but that because of their previous entitlement they continue to be voluntary contributors. However, in respect of other voluntary contributors I would have thought that the administrative changes introduced in this Bill would have meant that those contributors would be paying in some other way.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us as to how the voluntary contributory categories fit in in terms of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a category of persons in receipt of certain benefits through the Department of Social Welfare or in receipt of widows' pensions that are derived by reason of their spouses having been insured by way of social legislation in other EEC countries, Such recipients are not liable for deductions from their earnings in respect of flat-rate contributions.  The present position is that their employers pay the flat-rate contribution and also a 2 per cent pay-related contribution.  I should like to hear how that category will be dealt with in terms of the changes envisaged in the service.  The Minister will appreciate that there is confusion also in respect of the limited eligibility category as to the distinction between the various elements of this category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that limited eligibility refers usually to the health schemes but there is a category of persons, including public servants, outworkers, weavers and fishermen in respect of whom there are a number of fine distinctions which help to create that <Col N="292" /> maze which is the social insurance code and which all of us in public life must endeavour to find our way through, appearing only very rarely to come through successfully.</P>
      <P>In relation to the revision of the social welfare code might there not have been some attempt made to make more simple the code in relation to these various categories?  In this Bill which of its nature is complicated technically I cannot find any indication of an effort to standardise the situation in respect of some of these categories.  As an example of what I have in mind, one is expected to understand for instance, that outworkers with the exception of male weavers, are part-time share fishermen under the contract of service.  So far as I understand the Bill those same people not under contract of service will continue not to be eligible so far as pay-related benefit or occupational injury benefits are concerned whereas it appears that out-worker male weavers not under contract of service or soldiers who are no longer in service will be entitled to pay-related benefit but will not be entitled to occupational injuries benefit.  I trust I am correct in my reading of the Bill in that regard.  All of the categories I have mentioned fall, with others, into this limited cover category but it appears as if they are to continue to be insured and covered for different levels of benefit.  This situation makes matters extremely difficult not only for the unfortunate person who is insured but for his employer and, no doubt, for the Department and for anybody else who happens to be involved in the morass of rules and legislation in terms of sorting out the position.  I am suggesting that every effort should be made to simplify the code for that category of limited cover and to make as uniform as possible the amount of cover and benefit to which the people concerned are entitled.  This would make for the efficient operation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding efficient operation, I regret to have to advert again to the method of payment of the various benefits.  There is a great unevenness in the payment of unemployment, disability and occupational injuries benefits and so on.  Those of us in public life much more so than the man in the street, can appreciate the difficulties <Col N="293" /> involved and the enormous bureaucratic machine that must be kept oiled and in operation fully in order to process, decide on and have entitlements paid to recipients.  However, very often the claimant gets the picture of his being confronted by an enormous, mindless and uncaring bureaucracy.  I would not agree with that impression because there are a great number of people in the Department who make every effort to be as helpful as possible and to ensure that claimants receive all benefits to which they are entitled.  Having said that, there is an increasing obligation on whoever happens to be the Minister of the day to improve on the method of the processing of claims and the payment of benefit.  In that regard I was interested to hear the Minister refer to the computerisation programme which was introduced in the Department some years ago.</P>
    <P>I am not making my next remark in a political way, but I am afraid we will have to accept that our postal service is becoming less efficient.  The old idea that a letter posted in Dublin today will be delivered in Dublin tomorrow is a thing of the past.  The old theory that a letter posted in Dublin today will be delivered in two days time in any part of the country has gone with the flood, or at least in the last 12 months.  The Department of Social Welfare are still sending cheques to eligible people through the post and this is putting an additional strain on the postal system.</P>
    <P>Very often an inquiring claimant will be told by the Department that they issued a cheque last Friday.  On Monday afternoon the claimant still has not received it.  While this may be an annoyance to those administering the scheme, we should look at it from the point of view of the claimant.  He is out of work and does not have any other income. He sends in a certificate on Monday or Tuesday confidently expecting to be paid on Friday.  The cheque issues on Friday and he gets it the following Monday. He uses that money, assuming he will receive the benefit in respect of the following week the following Monday. Again the Department issue the cheque on Friday but it does not arrive on Monday. The claimant inquires from the <Col N="294" /> Department and is told that the cheque has been issued.  It may turn up a few days later or the Department may have to issue a replacement cheque, but they will expect him to wait a few days to see if the cheque arrives.  In the meantime that unfortunate man could be destitute.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the concept of relying on the postal service for the issuing of cheques will have to cease because, I regret to say, the postal service cannot be relied upon.  As I said, I am not, making a political point; I am stating the facts of life.</P>
    <P>I referred to the computerisation programme in the Department.  I believe the Minister will have to examine the possibility of having computer terminals in employment exchanges throughout the country.  The information as to whether a person is entitled to benefit and the amount of benefit to which he is entitled should be fed into the computer links and the money should be issued by the exchange.  Another possibility that will have to be examined is the use of telex to provide information to local offices which can pay benefits locally rather than having the money issuing from Dublin by way of the inefficient and unsatisfactory postal system.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that those changes will not bring about any improvement in rural areas because every village and townland does not have an employment exchange.  I want the Minister and the Department to realise that people are experiencing a great deal of difficulty getting their regular weekly payments and very often the fault seems to be in the uneven and patchy operation of the postal service.  That unsatisfactory service is not to the credit of the Department of Social Welfare who are blamed by the claimants if cheques do not appear in time.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that during the general election his party promised to reduce by £1 a week the social insurance contribution payable by all those earning less than £50 a week. To my surprise he seemed to be taking peculiar pleasure out of the suggestion that that degree of discrimination in favour of the lower paid worker was still going to apply.  I do not accept that.  He also suggested that for some months <Col N="295" /> there has been a difference of £1.16 in favour of the people earning less than £50 a week.  Under the terms of this Bill, will it not be the case that the man earning £40 a week and at present paying £2.66 will pay £1.76, whereas the man earning £50 a week will pay £2.20?  In each case the redundancy contribution is excluded because we do not know what it is.  The fact that this information has not been supplied is not very helpful for this discussion.  In other words, the difference between the person earning £40 a week and the person earning £50 a week will now be only 50p a week, instead of over £1.  That is clearly an indication that there is not a clear differential of £1 a week as promised in the manifesto.  The Minister will probably say that if one goes high enough one will eventually come to a point where 4.4 per cent of a man's income is £1 more than 4.4 per cent of £40 per week.  The fact is that there is no longer a clear-cut reduction of £1 per week in respect of those earning less than £50 a week.</P>
    <P>The Government kept their election promise for a year but through the changes in this system there is no longer a sharp discrimination in favour of people earning under £50 a week as opposed to those earning over £50 a week. That difference does not become very sharp until one reaches the £70 or £80 a week category.  I am sure the Minister will be anxious to explain that point in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this Bill represents a modernisation and improvement of our welfare system and that it was with great pleasure that he recommended it to the House for early and favourable consideration.  What exactly is this modernisation and improvement of the welfare system mentioned in the Bill?  It is certainly a modernisation and improvement of the system of collecting money.  It will allow the Government in certain cases to collect money in a period shorter than 12 months in respect of a person working for 12 months.  It will allow the Government to collect more money from certain female contributors than is collected at present.  In return and for the first time, it makes the female domestic category eligible for <Col N="296" /> pay-related benefit.  It makes all contributions pay-related and it makes male and female percentage of income contributions the same as at present.  What else does it do in return for those few improvements?</P>
    <P>Although it is not made clear in the Bill because it is to be by way of regulation, so far as I can see, this Bill could be described as a rip-off of the female public servant.  She is in the limited cover category and appears to be covered at present for a small range of benefits.  In respect of those benefits, she does not make any contribution directly.  The State makes the contribution on her behalf.  If she is covered for health benefit the only contribution she may make is 50p a week.  After the passing of this Bill, the female public servant&mdash;as best as can be established, because the Bill does not make it clear, and the Department did not take the trouble to issue any clarification&mdash;will have to pay a contribution.  If not, a discrimination will remain in the code between the percentage contributions from male public servants and female public servants. That appears to be contradictory to all the Minister's other intentions in the Bill.  We can only assume that everybody in the limited eligibility category will be asked to pay the same percentage contribution from their income.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, the female public servant will now be paying some percentage of her income, presumably in respect of the benefits for which male public servants are covered, widows' pension, deserted wives' benefit and in some cases death grants.  The male public servant is covered for those benefits which he will not enjoy, but which must give him some security of mind in the knowledge that his family are covered for contributory widows' and orphans' pension.  In some cases at least, it must give security of mind to the family of a male public servant who may be contemplating deserting his family because the family are covered for deserted wives' benefit.</P>
    <P>Since the change in legislation which allows married women to continue in the public service, presumably the female <Col N="297" /> public servant is insured for the same benefits.  At present the State pays the contribution, and she is not asked to pay anything.  The Minister said he intends to standardise the rate of percentage contribution between male and female.  It is very important that the Minister should clarify the regulations to be made under section 12 for the limited cover category which includes public servants.  Does he intend to take from the female public servant a percentage of her income, and, if so, in return for what benefits?  The only benefits she will be covered for, it would appear, are widows' and orphans' pensions and deserted wives' benefit.</P>
    <P>While it has increased somewhat, the percentage of married women in the public service is still very small. Therefore, it would appear that the female civil servant, the female local authority employee, in general single women, will be asked to pay a percentage of their income in return for being covered for widows' and orphans' pensions, which she could only enjoy if after marrying she continued in employment and continued her contribution&mdash; otherwise her contribution would not be sufficient to enable her to benefit&mdash; or deserted wives' benefit.  The same proviso will apply there.  If that is the case, it appears quite likely that a large number of women in the public service will be asked to pay a percentage of their salary in return for benefits which they are unlikely to enjoy.  This is most important and needs urgent clarification because it has been exercising the minds of many people in this category, and it has not received any clarification from the Minister or his Department.  That category of person may be asked to pay more.</P>
    <P>This Bill removes the element of tax relief on insurance contributions for pensions. At present, the pension element of a person's social insurance contribution is claimable against income tax.  That tax relief will now be no longer available. Therefore, would it not appear fair that the pension at the other end ought not to be taxable?  There is no suggestion whatsoever that the pension received on foot of paying into the pensions fund for a lifetime will not be taxable.  An insured person will be asked to pay for the rest <Col N="298" /> of his working life into a pension fund and, he will not be entitled to tax relief on those payments into the pension fund and when he gets his pension, he will discover that it is taxable as well.  That person could well describe this change in the legislation as being a rip-off.</P>
    <P>I say this sincerely.  I do not think it was a good idea to remove the tax relief on the pension contribution unless tax was removed from the pension payable on foot of those contributions.  That was not done.  Now both contribution and pension will be taxable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is compensation for it in the rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated that there is compensation for it in the rate.  I presume the Minister will accept that the percentage rates and the figures are so complex, and the information available to the public so sparse, that it is impossible to compute whether or not there is compensation.  I understand the suggestion in the Minister's speech is that the rate is .5 per cent lower than it otherwise would be, because the contribution element is not taxed.  I have to accept that, because I cannot assess whether that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the question of the acceptance of advice from experts.  The Minister dealt with that with another Member of the House recently and neither was satisfied as a result of that exchange.  We will leave it at that.  I do not think the principle of eliminating from tax relief the contribution or the pension is a good one and it should be looked at again.  In that area everybody contributing can feel he is suffering if he is not getting tax relief. The female public servant can feel she is suffering in that area because she will be asked to pay a contribution for benefits she is most unlikely to avail of, unless <Col N="299" /> she marries and continues in employment for a considerable period.</P>
      <P>No effort has been made in the Bill to have any relationship between the level of pensions paid and the level of contributions to be made for pay-related benefit for the remainder of a man's working life.  The middle income category will be asked to pay more as a percentage of their income than they are paying at present.  I accept that the standardisation of the male and female contribution and benefit year is good and will help to sort out some of the difficulties in understanding the code.  I object strongly to the fact that no effort has been made to remove or improve the anomalies or inequities which exist in the code.  In the code there is a suggestion that the upper limit for pay-related benefit is to be £5,000 a year.  The Minister told us that next April he may up that ceiling.  If he does, the middle income category will be made to pay even more.  Surely at this stage the Minister should be able to tell the House whether the upper ceiling will be £5,000 or, as originally suggested when the Bill was first mooted, £8,000.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill any person earning more than £5,000 a year&mdash;not an extraordinary amount of money at present&mdash;who is paid by the month will have his 4.4 per cent and his employer's 8.2 per cent deducted in instalments.  If a person is earning £10,000 a year in equal monthly instalments, his 12 months contributions up to the ceiling of £5,000 will be deducted over a six months period presumably.  The Minister should appreciate that the individual earning over £5,000 a year will have his entire 12 months contributions stopped out of the first £5,000 of his income. Consequently the State will receive that individual's 12 months contributions in less than 12 months, in some cases in four months, five months or six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a hardship to some small degree on that relatively higher income earner, but it is a considerable hardship on the cash flow of a number of firms who have a high number of highly paid executives in their employment.  They will have to pay 8.25 per cent of their <Col N="300" /> employees' income which should be spread over a 12 months period in respect of whatever period it takes those employees to earn £5,000 or whatever the upper income ceiling is.  This would have an effect on the cash flow of the relatively small number of employers of high income earners.  I do not accept the reply which the Minister is already formulating in his mind to give on Second Stage that from the eve of administration this is the only way in which the scheme could be operated because I am sure that he knows, as the rest of us know, that in Britain provision was made for the employer's contribution in respect of the highly paid earner to be paid over 12 months in 12 monthly instalments.  I see no reason why the same provision could not be made here.</P>
    <P>I do not accept either the Minister's passing reference to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill of 1966 in which he says that the consolidation of this legislation is at hand but cannot be completed at this stage.  Why can it not be completed? I suggest that one of the reasons why it cannot be completed is that since this Dáil first met, since the general election of 1977, the committee which was dealing with the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill has never been reestablished and has never again met.  The committee which was set up in 1976 to bring about a single piece of workable, understandable social welfare legislation has never been reconvened and I have never got an opportunity until now to point this out because when I endeavoured to inquire by way of parliamentary question from the Minister why he had done nothing to bring about this updating of the legislation I was told that I could not ask the Minister that because it was up to the House to decide.  But we all know very well that no attempt whatsoever was made to advance the stage to which that Special Committee dealing with the consolidation of social welfare legislation had got since July 1977.  I do not see why the Minister says it cannot be completed. It certainly is in a less advanced stage of completion now than it would have been if the committee had been sitting for the last 15 months.</P>
    <P>I accept the idea of pay-related contributions. <Col N="301" /> It would be less than fair of me if I did not make that clear to the House.  Indeed, the entire concept of pay-related contributions was introduced by the last Government in 1974 because it was quite clear that the flat-rate contribution applying from the lowest to the highest paid was quite unfair. It is obviously unfair to ask the man earning £40 per week to pay exactly the same sum out of this income as the man earning £100 a week.  But I feel that the introduction of this change once again hits at the soft element in society, the middle income earner, the fellow the Minister for Economic Planning and Development wants to get at, the fellow the Minister for Social Welfare wants to get at, the fellow the Minister for Health wants to get at, the man who cannot readily strike back.  He is the middle income earner and he is the man who is being hit by the progressive taxation proposals and changes such as this being introduced by the Government.  I accept that as the Minister says the pay-related benefit will now extend on income between £40 and £100 a week instead of between £40 and £50 a week.  I believe that that is a good thing.  But would the Minister clarify if it is his intention to raise the £5,000 ceiling to which he has referred and which he says he may raise before next April?  If it is his intention to raise that ceiling would it also mean then that the £100 ceiling for the pay-related benefit would also be raised in line with the raising of the £5,000 ceiling in relation to contributions?  That is not clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy is ignoring the fact that 500,000 lower paid workers are paying less under this scheme.  That is the important thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that 200,000 middle income earners, on the Minister's own figures, are going to pay more.  I believe that figure is much higher than 200,000 but on the Minister's own admission he is going to ask 200,000 people to pay more than they are paying at present.  They are the middle income earners and they are the people I am talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole principle of pay-related benefit is also that the benefit one gets is commensurate with the amount one pays.  There has been no attempt made whatsoever to change the level of pensions.  There has been no attempt made in any one way to make pay-related or income-related the pensions and the entitlements under the code.  There has merely been an attempt to take more money from people in the middle income category in order to lessen the Exchequer's share of the social insurance fund without any attempt being made to improve the benefits to be derived from the fund.  That is what I am objecting to.</P>

      <P>Minister and Deputy, this Bill really deals with pay-related contributions and nothing else but the Chair has allowed the Deputy, and rightly so, to deal with how the income from such would be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a point of a technical nature that I wish to draw to the attention of the Minister and his advisers. That is in relation to the week for insurance purposes being made the same as the PAYE week.  Apprehension has been expressed by a number of large employers who have a complex amount of deductions to make in respect of their employees that the PAYE week may start on whatever day of the week an employee comes into employment whereas the ordinary wages week is from the point of view of a number of large employers a much easier deduction week for them to operate rather than to operate in line with the PAYE week.  I am not fully satisfied as to the degree of difficulty that would be involved in that case but I would like the Minister to explore that degree of difficulty and explain to the House whether he feels that is an area that might get some attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great difficulties in trying to assess exactly how much any insured person or, indeed, any employer of an <Col N="303" /> insured person is going to pay is that at present an element of the weekly payments of employees is their payment into the redundancy fund and it is now proposed, in line with changing the social insurance fund to pay-related contributions, to change the redundancy contributions to a pay-related element.  It is impossible to assess the weekly outgoings of either employer or employee into the fund until one knows at what level or percentage the redundancy contribution is going to be.  I appreciate that a different Minister would be responsible for the legislation involved but I would have thought it would have been helpful if the Minister had been able to say what percentage will now be payable in respect of the redundancy contribution so that an overall picture of the contribution from the employee could have been given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should rephrase what I said.  The Minister appreciates that the point I am making is that it is impossible to know exactly what an employer or employee will be paying in respect of any person insured in the insurance fund at the moment because in respect of that person there is also a redundancy payment to be made into the redundancy fund.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty here in that one comes in to speak about legislation and is asked to agree, apparently without comment, to a scheme to change the social insurance stamp into a pay-related contribution, but one does not know, because regulations are to be made, whether male or female limited cover public servants are to be made to pay the same percentage.</P>

We do not know what people insured in the social insurance fund will have stopped from their salaries because of other deductions which may be made. We do not know how much an employer will have to pay because the employer will have to pay an element of other deductions to a fund operated by another Minister.  We cannot compare the weekly amount stopped through the stamp system and through the system operating in the redundancy fund and the proposed new system until the Department of Labour announce what they will take, until the Minister introduces regulations under section 12 saying what he will take from people with limited eligibility cover and until the Minister makes up his mind as to whether £5,000 is to be the ceiling for pay-related contributions or whether that will be increased between now and April next.  We have to put together with this the passage of the Bill dealing with the extension of the health insurance scheme which has not yet been published.  It is extremely difficult to assess the amount of the stoppages to be made from April next on foot of these various changes.</P>

Unfortunately there is a lot of confusion because the sections of this Bill are amending different sections of the 1952 Act.  It is stated that regulations are to be made under section 12 of the 1952 Social Welfare Act which will provide for appropriate reduced rates for those who are covered for a limited range of benefits only.  Those regulations have not been made.  That is the complaint I am making.  Until they are made, no one can know, unless the Minister tells us in advance, what percentage he envisages including in the regulations to be made under section 12 in respect of the limited cover category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the conclusion that the percentage the Minister has in mind is so unpalatable that he does not want to give it to the House at present.  That is why I have been making the point that there is a percentage to be taken from the limited cover people, including all public servants, which I believe will be unpalatable to them when it is announced.  If the Minister is to continue his principle of making the percentage from male and female equivalent in the limited cover category as he has been endeavouring to make in the ordinary and voluntary contributor category, then the female public servant will, for the first time, be made to pay in respect of benefits from which she is most unlikely to benefit.  I am suggesting that is why the translation of the Minister's intention into a specific percentage has not been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal fully with that in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  The nearest I can come to ascertaining what that percentage might be is the information that in relation to certain voluntary contributors <Col N="307" /> there is proposed a rate of 1.7 per cent which would cover such contributors in respect of widows and orphans and deserted wife's benefit.  I presume the voluntary contributor pays the entire contribution himself because the employer does not pay a contribution in respect of him.  If 1.7 per cent of the voluntary contributor's income is to cover him for those benefits, then presumably the Minister, in enlightening the House, will be able to tell us in his reply that the amount to be deducted from the limited cover category will be less than 1.7 per cent in order to allow for the State's share as well as the employee's share.  If the figure is anywhere near 1.7 per cent, then it would appear that the public servant category, especially the female public servant category, is to be introduced into this scheme in large measure to finance outgoings from the scheme.  That is why I said some time ago&mdash;the Minister appeared to be aggrieved to hear it&mdash;that in many ways the implementation of this Bill could be described as a &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo; of female public servants.  For the first time they will have money stopped from their income in respect of cover to which they are already entitled but of which they are unlikely to avail and which at present is fully paid for by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of small points with which the Minister might deal in his reply.  Presumably the elimination of the social insurance stamp will mean that a number of employees in the Department and in the employment exchanges and regional offices throughout the country will now be released for other duties and perhaps the Minister will explain to the House the duties which he intends for such employees.  It appears as if under the new scheme contributions might still be deducted in a case where an employee is sick but is being paid his wages or salary by his employer, who is possibly more enlightened than some employers. It would appear that it could be argued by the Department under this scheme that the employer must still pay the full pay-related contribution into the fund because of the fact that he is paying his employee the full equivalent of his wage <Col N="308" /> or salary during the period of his illness. Obviously it would be very harsh on an employer if he were to pay full wages or salary and still be expected to pay the full percentage contribution into the social insurance fund.  That same point would equally apply where a person would be on disability benefit and the employer would be expected to pay into the fund for some time.</P>
    <P>I am also somewhat surprised to see continued a provision of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1975, which asked people stamping cards to pay 10p per week more in respect of the exceptional unemployment which then obtained. It now appears the Minister intends to continue this provision.  I would like him to explain why he intends to do that.  The levy was 10p per week.  Under this Bill it will be changed to .2 per cent of 1 per cent of income.  Those earning more than £2,600 a year will pay more than they are paying at present to meet exceptional circumstances.  On the basis of .2 per cent of income they will pay more than 10p per week or £5.20 per year.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the position of the bun mhaistin poist, to the position in which he will find himself as a result of the elimination of social welfare stamps from his turnover.  Whilst we appreciate this is not a matter specifically for the Minister for Social Welfare the fact is the Minister found it worth his while to refer to it.  These stamps form a varying proportion of the turnover of BMPs especially in towns in which there is a large volume of industrial employment. The turnover can be as high as 40 per cent.  I understand the average is around 25 or 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister might find in a small sub-post office near him an insignificant sale of social welfare stamps whilst his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service, who is sitting beside him, might discover that a very high proportion of the turnover in sub-post offices in his constituency would be devoted to the sale of social welfare stamps because of a large volume of industrial employment.  This removal will affect some offices more than others, and here I want to sound a note of warning.  The BMPs are seriously <Col N="309" /> aggrieved, and with justification, at their treatment and, if the issue is not resolved to their satisfaction, yet another industrial dispute will be on our hands before this calendar year is out.  The BMPs must be compensated for the removal of the sale of these stamps from their income.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which I have referred on every occasion on which we have had social welfare legislation before us.  There is an obvious method available to the Government of encouraging the employment of young people.  I refer to the removal of those under 21 years of age from liability for contribution to social insurance.  This would encourage young people to find employment and it would also encourage employers to provide employment.  These young people would have the advantage of being trained and, having been trained, the likelihood is employers would keep them on in employment and pay social insurance contributions.  On the last occasion I made this suggestion the Minister said it was essentially a matter for Finance and economic Ministers and it would be no concern of his to implement such a proposal.  I find it hard to accept the Minister is so far removed from his finance and economic colleagues in the Cabinet that he could not discuss with them the possibility of providing relief from social welfare contribution in the case of young people under 21 years of age.  I invite him once again to comment on this suggestion in his reply.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have been a major review of the social welfare code.  Instead of that it is confined to making it administratively easier for the Government to collect contributions.  In the case of limited eligibility contributions will be collected in less than 12 months.  Those on limited eligibility and female public servants will be brought in and the contribution requirement will be radically altered without any increase in benefits. This is regressive legislation.  Pensions will no longer be eligible for tax relief.  I am disappointed that a very real opportunity for correcting glaring discrimination against women in the social welfare code has not been taken by the Minister, the Minister who professed his anxiety earlier here on the need to do this in an <Col N="310" /> orderly fashion when the opportunity arose.  The opportunity has arisen and the Minister has failed to grasp it.  The reduction of £1 per week in contributions in the case of those earning less than £50 a week has been eroded and it is not until one is closer to £70 a week or £80 a week that the person earning £40 a week will be any better off to the extent of the £1 or £1.16 that the Minister mentioned earlier.  I accept this legislation will make the collection of funds easier. There will be no additional benefits and from that point of view the Bill displays a continuing cynicism on the part of the Government towards social welfare recipients.  It was my fond belief that the Minister earnestly wanted to amend the whole social welfare code.</P>

      <P>The exchange between Deputy Boland and the Minister as to whether it should be 3.4 or 3.5 in regard to the employee's contribution reminded me of a statement attributed to Sir George Godber, erstwhile Secretary of the Department of Health and Social Security in Britain.  He said a Minister's sole function was to present the Department's view to the Cabinet, to the Parliament and to the country at large.  The Minister's acceptance of his figure without seeking an absolute breakdown to find out for himself if the Department's figures were accurate confirms my view that Ministers are there solely for the purpose of presenting the Department's view to the Cabinet, to the Parliament and to the country at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Boland's suggestion about removing young people under 21 years of age from the necessity of paying social welfare contributions.  I presented this to the former administration with all the enthusiasm I could muster and it was rejected at a time when I thought we might make a gallant effort to get young people back to work. That was in 1974 and it was rejected by the former Taoiseach.  I mention that in passing&mdash;I wonder who runs Departments. I accept that this Bill, in making arrangements for pay-related contributions, is good.  From the employee's point of view it will bear less heavily on the lower paid and from the employer's point of view it will benefit labour intensive <Col N="311" /> industries, as far as I can ascertain. But the major point of the Bill is to alter the method of financing social insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>If we are to confront and solve the anomaly of the flat rate contribution, we should also confront the other anomalies in the system.  The Minister had a unique opportunity to bring in the necessary reforms of social welfare legislation which are long overdue.  It is accepted, I think, that the question of pay related contributions has been in the Department for a few years.  To my knowledge it emanated from the officials in the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister was presented with this and came here with this Bill.</P>
    <P>The only thing wrong with it is that it is progressively diminishing the State's contribution to the social welfare fund. The Exchequer contribution has been dropping annually and declining dramatically in the last few years.  In 1973-74 it was 30 per cent of the total fund.  In 1977 it dropped to 19 per cent. Meanwhile the cost of the stamp has been escalating.  It has jumped by almost 150 per cent in the past four years.  So, I see this contribution as a social insurance tax, a hidden form of taxation, again on the PAYE worker.  This is the greatest discrimination against that class of worker.  The PAYE workers pay 87 per cent of the total income tax and now we are burdening them further by asking them to pay more in social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>According to NESC Report No. 7 on &ldquo;Integrated Approaches to Personal Income Taxes and Transfers&rdquo;, social insurance taxes represent one-third of total personal income taxes.  This Bill helps to some extent by spreading that burden on a more equitable basis, but the social insurance tax is likely to continue to grow, as I see it.  The move has been more away from the State and to the employer and employee and so I cannot accept it as other than a social insurance tax, a tax on wages.</P>
    <P>The State are now going to further reduce their contribution under the new scheme.  I do not accept for a moment the statement in the explanatory <Col N="312" /> memorandum that the income from this scheme will be approximately the same as that resulting from the flat rate contribution. I believe we will have extra revenue from it and I do not think that should be used to curtail the Exchequer contribution or to funnel off funds to cover, say, budgetary increases in social welfare benefits necessary to meet inflation. I have every reason to believe that the revenue from the pay related contributions will be considerably in excess of the £250 million collected last year. We should ensure that the extra revenue arising from this scheme would go directly into more benefits; otherwise it will be a sort of budgetary legerdemain whereby a substantial amount of the benefit will be used to reduce the State contribution and to throw a greater burden on the employer and employee.</P>
    <P>Pay-related contributions will rise automatically with wages since they are based on percentages but the benefits are not tied in this way: the benefits must be increased at budget time or not at all.  I think the discrepancy is glaring and should not be used opportunistically by any Minister or Government to reduce its obligations to the insured population and cover expenditure in other ways.  We should keep a very close eye on the State contribution of 20 per cent to the insurance fund to see if it drops as it is likely to do, because I remember a Minister saying in this House that it was intended to reduce the State contribution to the social insurance fund.  This would be a regressive move indeed.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum says that the Bill is designed to yield &ldquo;broadly the same income as flat rate contributions&rdquo; but the Minister must be aware that Exchequer Estimates are notorious for massive shortfalls and massive windfalls, particularly in the tax area.  It is crucial that there should be full accounting of this system to see what surplus is coming in.  To take just pay-related benefits, last year the contributions exceeded expenditure by £9 million. We do not know what happened that sum, which should have gone for the benefit of those who are paying the contributions.  We should bear this in mind.  I can see the windfalls creamed off to cover expenditure in other areas.  The <Col N="313" /> pay-related benefit scheme is the only pay-related scheme at present operating and an increase of £9 million over what was paid out gives, I think, a good indication of what will happen under the universal pay-related contribution scheme.</P>
    <P>It would be very dangerous if the Department were to use this measure as a screen to cover it in reducing its commitment to the social insurance fund. Something very strong must be said about the whole social insurance fund. We must dispel the myth in the public mind that the State is playing an important role in paying social welfare benefit, disability benefit and so on.  Last year, of £250 million paid into the social insurance fund, £200 million was contributed by employers and employees and the State paid only £50 million.  But the State acts as if it is giving a handout to the people.  It has perpetuated this myth in its harassment of beneficiaries, those seeking benefits.  It has employed Gestapo-like tactics and techniques in interrogating people who seek benefits.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to advise a person a few weeks ago to appeal against a refusal to grant her unemployment benefit.  She said that when she went before the appeals officer they had employed Gestapo methods against her, asked her why she had consulted me, if I had advised her.  They wanted to know why she came to me when she was not in my constituency, what kind of advice I gave her.  They asked why she did not go to her own Deputy.  An appeals officer in the Department of Social Welfare wanted to know all this.  When the identity of that person is made known to the Department, can I have an assurance from the Minister that no measures will be taken against that person for disclosing that information?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to investigate this because I find that there is increasing evidence of harassment of those people who have paid into this social welfare fund.  Those people and the employers are the major contributors to this fund.  The State is merely acting as an administrator of the fund.  The State's contribution is only the <Col N="314" /> very paltry contribution of £50 million out of a total contribution of £250 million. The State's role is a minor one in this social insurance fund.  The ideal thing would be to have a council, composed of employers and employees, to administer this scheme.  This would ensure that the scheme is used to the best advantage of the people concerned.  The public are not aware that the State plays a minor role in the financing of this scheme.</P>
      <P>During the budget debate I asked the Minister for Social Welfare to explain the discrepancy between a statement made by him and one made by the Minister for Finance.  He told me that the difference was the amount of the social insurance fund financed by the employer and the employee.  It seemed to me then that the Government were trying to take credit for this contribution in their announcement of the social welfare increases last April.  This kind of public relations con job has to stop.  The Government are only acting as a clearing house and are returning the peoples contributions in the form of benefits. People should realise that when the unemployed receive benefit they are receiving money which they have paid into the fund.  It is no more a State hand-out than private insurance is a handout.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer contribution should at least be maintained if not increased if this Bill is to have any genuine redistributive effect.  As far as I can see the Exchequer contribution will be reduced.  A great proportion of personal income lies outside the domain of the social insurance contribution.  If the State does not make an attempt to take something out of this income in the form of tax and spread it through the social insurance system the base will be too narrow and there will be no redistribution of the fund.  The whole concept of social insurance is to insure individuals against risk by spreading the burden across the population at large.  It cannot, like any insurance scheme, work well if the base of coverage is stunted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country approximately one-third of personal income is outside the social insurance contribution net.  This means that one-third of personal income is free of social insurance taxes.  According to the 1977 estimates published <Col N="315" /> in the NESC Report No. 37 farming income totalled £740 million and other self-employed incomes totalled £850 million. This means that £1.6 billion of personal income in the country pays no social insurance taxes.  That is a very large sum of money.  If those people paid social welfare contributions there would be a greater input into the social welfare fund, greater opportunity to extend the benefits, less social welfare contributions from all concerned and greater benefits in the individual areas, which is not happening at present.  Unless we spread that net the insurance principle cannot be expected to work effectively and at less cost to the individual contributors than at present.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that if more people are covered there will be more income for the fund, reduced rates for the contributors and increased benefits.  We are not attempting to come to grips with social insurance contributions in that regard.  It is confined to a narrow few, the same people paying the PAYE contributions, who are over-burdened contributing £87 million in income tax. Those people are also expected to pay the social welfare contributions and there is no way of spreading that net.</P>
    <P>A social welfare contributor who has paid his contributions all his life gets £1 more in a contributory old age pension than a non-contributory old age pensioner does.  He has paid for 80 per cent of the money he receives.  The contributory old age pensioner is discriminated against.  The farm labourer is actually subsidising his boss.  He pays social welfare contributions but his boss does not.  When it comes to retirement age the farmer gets a non-contributory old age pension and the labourer gets a contributory one.  He is in fact paying his boss's pension.  He is also paying the tax by PAYE for his boss's pension, which is not provided either by tax or social welfare contributions.  It is an appalling thing that that should be allowed to happen. The NESC Report No. 38 states:</P>
    <P>Contributors to social insurance and PAYE taxpayers are by and large the same people.  Those who benefit <Col N="316" /> from social assistance tend to be drawn from the farming population who, being self-employed, have no social insurance cover.</P>
    <P>Later on in the report they state:</P>
    <P>The financing of social insurance cannot be divorced from the position of social assistance which is wholly financed by the State.</P>
    <P>The last point they make is:</P>
    <P>In many cases the recepient of a contributory benefit could equally qualify on means grounds for the corresponding non-contributory benefit. This is demonstrated by the high number of wives of contributory old age pensioners who qualify for non-contributory pensions in their own right, yet the insurance benefit for which a person may have contributed over a long number of years may only be fractionally larger than the corresponding non-contributory benefit, for example, for widows.</P>
    <P>In October 1977 the widow's contributory pension was £13.25 and the widow's non-contributory pension was £12.35, a difference of less than £1.  This is gross discrimination against the people who pay social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>We had an opportunity in the House for the Minister to bring in a pay-related pension scheme, a system of pay-related contributions that would result in pay-related pensions for everybody at the end of their lives.  I believe there is a Green Paper on this in the Department of Social Welfare.  This would have been a major reform by the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister, who is so anxious to make an impact in this particular field.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not grasp the nettle in this particular area.</P>
    <P>Various other aspects of the Bill are more appropriate to Committee Stage, but there are points which must be borne in mind.  I would like some clarification on a number of points raised by the Minister.  I am opposed to so many aspects of the Bill being covered by regulations which need not be discussed in the House.  The Minister said that the <Col N="317" /> £5,000 limit is provisional and that the limit can be decided by regulation before the operation of this Act.  This is bypassing the Dáil and we do not get a chance to discuss it on its merits.  The Minister also said that he will decide the upper limit by regulation.</P>
    <P>A point I would dwell on is that the increased rates of 7.8 per cent and 3.4 per cent take into account the special increase of 31p in the flat rate contribution which was introduced in 1975.  In 1975 the economic climate was very difficult and dangerous and, although the public may not be aware of it, a special levy was imposed on them to finance social welfare benefits.  This levy, 31p in the flat rate contribution, was imposed as a temporary measure to help cope with the cost of increasing unemployment.  There are claims that the numbers out of work now have been drastically reduced and there are boasts that we are on the road to economic recovery.  If that is so the levy should be withdrawn, and the Minister should give us some indication to that effect.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of my contribution I wondered if the Minister was fully satisfied with the figures given to him by the Department about employee contributions, taking into account tax relief in relation to pension contributions.  The Minister should give us a greater assurance that that he has been informed of the fact and has accepted the figures on their face value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is important, otherwise it would seem that the Department were trying to deprive the worker of a tax concession.</P>
      <P>I accept that the stamping of cards must end.  This system caused enormous problems for both employers and employees, because the system is too haphazard and gave rise to abuse.  Many employers took contributions from their employees without stamping their cards. There was laxity on the part of the Department in relation to strict surveillance of the stamping of cards by the employers.  The slipshod method of returning cards to the Department, plus the possibility of cards being lost in the post all added to the confusion.  I know of a case where a card was returned but was lost in the Department for nearly eight months.  The possibility of losing a card in the post also created a tremendous risk for both the employer and the employee because when a card was lost there was no evidence that a card had ever been stamped.  An employer and an employee could be above board, but if the card was lost there was no other proof within the Department.</P>
      <P>Another abuse was that cards were stolen and resold for criminal purposes.  I am glad to see the end of that system.  As we know, many thousands of people suffered due to the inadequacies, before any effective legislation was brought in to remedy the situation.  Even at present, while there is a guarantee to the employee that if his card is not stamped he will receive benefit, the delay while the Department are investigating the case can be interminable.  It is all right to say &ldquo;Don't worry&rdquo; to a person who is seeking unemployment or disability benefit, but the hardship can be great while they are waiting for the Department to complete their investigations.  It is a relief that we have at last come to grisps with the problem and that the Government will introduce a more streamlined efficient system.  The new system will reduce the burden on the Department so they should in future be more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> The person seeking social welfare benefit is a person in need, and the majority of these people do not possess a private phone but must use the public phones.  I am sure the Minister knows what a frustrating experience it can be trying to get on to a section in the Department of Social Welfare.  One can be hanging on for as long as half an hour for a reply.  By the time a person using a public phone gets a reply and waits to be put through to the appropriate section his time is up, he is cut off and he must start again.  It is frustrating and agonising for the public using public phones trying to get information from the Department of Social Welfare about their entitlements.</P>
    <P>This new scheme has streamlined the whole system within the Department, taking from the Minister the enormous burden of processing the issuing of stamps and so on, and I should like to know if he would make sure that the information section of his Department is brought up to date so that information can be given readily to people.  Some months ago, acting on a suggestion from an official of the Department, I contacted that section for information.  I was informed that they would have to contact the section concerned in Phibsboro. I would have thought that an information section would have replies to queries at their fingertips.  I have found that section sadly lacking.</P>

      <P>It does.  I do not take issue with the Chair on many things but I will on this occasion.  We are talking about benefits, entitlements and contributions by social welfare contributors. The Bill seeks to streamline the system and take away from the Department of Social Welfare the onus of collecting contributions.  It is my contention that the massive labour force that will be available in the Department following the introduction of this Bill and the streamlining of the system should be deployed to provide proper information to social welfare recipients as to their entitlements. That is not an unreasonable <Col N="320" /> request and it is one that is relevant to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know why the Minister, in eliminating the differentials in respect of women in particular, did not seek to rid the system of this terrible discrimination against certain beneficiaries of social welfare.  He should reconsider this matter.  The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>...except in the case of certain married women whose benefits in respect of sickness or unemployment are restricted.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister wants to rid the social welfare system of discrimination in various areas, and this is a glaring area where he could take the initiative.  I admire him for what he did in the case of unemployment assistance for females and this is another opportunity for him to rid the system of the discrimination against females.  The Minister should avail of this opportunity to bring in amending legislation.  He will then be in a position to say that he had done his best to eliminate discrimination against women in the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my hope that in the operation of the scheme people will not experience unnecessary form-filling, something which can be very frustrating for those who do not have any great knowledge of the dreadful bureaucracy that is within the Department of Social Welfare.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that the form-filling required for benefits is simplified, particularly in view of the fact that the Department are able to streamline everything else.  It should be possible to do this.  Many people are deterred from seeking social welfare benefit because of the complicated process of form-filling involved.  Other people, by virtue of their illiteracy, do not seek benefit either.  I suggest that the Minister follow the example of the Department of Agriculture, who carry out a good promotional campaign on television about the rights of farmers to grants, subsidies and so on.  The same enthusiasm and aggression should be adopted by the Department of Social Welfare to make rights and entitlements <Col N="321" /> known to social welfare contributors. That campaign should be carried out on television.  It would help to dispel the myth that entitlements are charitable handouts.  I know the Minister would not wish to deprive people of their rights.  I am not in favour of the books issued because they are complicated and difficult to understand, but the Minister should make more leaflets available and, for the illiterate, carry out an information campaign on television and radio. It can be very difficult to obtain entitlements from the Department.  A Dutch citizen who is married to an Irishman sought entitlement to dental benefit under EEC regulations recently. She had contributed for seven years in Holland and one year in Ireland but when she went to the Department seeking benefit she was informed that it would take up to 12 months to process the application.  She was told that it would involve complicated checks.  That lady was told by an official at the Dutch Embassy that the Department should be able to get her her entitlement within one week.  An official at the Embassy suggested that the Department telex the Dutch Department of Social Welfare. Our Department must be able to act with speed to give people their entitlements. If people contribute a lot of money to this new scheme&mdash;in my view the revenue will be far in excess of the Minister's estimate&mdash;there should be the minimum of delay in processing applications.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of retired social welfare contributors. This is a serious problem. Such contributors are being informed that they must make health contributions. This information is being conveyed to them by the Revenue Commissioners. When a public representative argues this matter with the Revenue Commissioners the matter is closed, but only temporarily.  A short time later it is re-opened.  It is a form of harassment. They are being harassed into paying health contributions.  The Minister should make this position clear so as to put an end to a lot of needless worry by these people.</P>

I wrote back and explained that, as recipients of contributory old age pensions, they should not have to pay.  It was then agreed by the Department that they should not.  It happens at regular intervals. I can understand isolated incidents; they can occur in the best organised Department.  But this is happening to people regularly and I think a statement from the Minister might clarify the position.</P>

      <P>The resolution of the problems of social welfare would entail more than half a day.  I shall not go into the finer points of the Bill.  The Minister has presented the House with this simplified method of collecting social welfare contributions.  The Bill does not give any promise of increased social welfare benefits in line with contributions. Certainly it is of great benefit to the lower income bracket.  But the £5,000 ceiling at present is a relative figure.  The way we are going I can see that this is a movable figure that will be adjusted in line with industrial earnings. It may constitute a great source of revenue for the Department of Social Welfare.  It aims at being self-financing&mdash;that the State's contribution will become zero in the foreseeable future.  If and when that happens we shall have reached a very regressive stage in our social services.  The State has purported to be the guardian of the under-privileged, the people who rely on social welfare benefits.  If what I predict <Col N="323" /> happens the State will no longer be fulfilling that role.  That is a serious matter&mdash;a drop from 30 per cent to 20 per cent within a few years represents a very serious decline in State contributions to the social insurance fund.  It will constitute a regressive step and one which will not promote our good name.  Certainly we are very much out of line with the rest of Europe in the matter of social welfare benefits.  Indeed in the EEC league we are the lowest in terms of the social welfare benefits we make available to our people.  Our social welfare recipients are the worst off in Europe in relation to the cost of living, industrial earnings, to our people's contributions to the scheme and in relation also to child welfare benefits.  In relation to the benefits they receive they are the section of the community most discriminated against.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not aim at introducing in this House enlightened social welfare legislation; in that respect it has failed with ignominy.  Other than lowering the contribution for the lower income group&mdash;which is a relative factor having regard to the present rate of inflation&mdash;I cannot see in it any great reform for the future.  I accept that it is very good at present.  Administratively it is a very enlightened Bill and it will eliminate abuses of the scheme, but it does not aim at introducing enlightened legislation in the field of social welfare. In that respect I cannot in conscience accept it with any degree of enthusiasm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell concluded on what is the most important principle of this Bill, that is, the changing attitude of the State to its responsibilities. The present Minister is a very lucky man in so far as he happens to be Minister in two extremely important Departments from the point of view of showing concern or a humanitarian attitude in relation to his responsibilities. As everybody has made clear essentially this Bill is not one of a humanitarian politician; rather it is one of a competent chartered accountant.  As the Minister said, it will make things easy for the calculators, the administrators, and will <Col N="324" /> tidy up a number of anomalies, but they are superficial.  The basic tidying up is not superficial, it is a very fundamental one in an administrative sense.  But the points claimed for the Bill changing from flat-rate to pay-related social welfare are justified because an injustice did exist there in so far as the higher income contributor obviously did better than the flat-rate lower income contributor.  That is an anomaly but I am afraid it is a relatively minor one in the overall pattern of who pays what in our society.</P>
      <P>The abolition of insurance cards has many of the advantages other speakers mentioned&mdash;the broad failure to stamp cards, loss of cards, certain administrative difficulties.  The use of the PAYE system for collection will be of benefit from the point of view again of the actuary, of the accountant.  Clearly that will be an improvement.  There is a defect in the provision of the limit of £5,000 on the pay-related side.  The question about who is paying and that it raises no more money than would have been raised by the present combined system of the insurance stamp plus the 3 per cent redundancy fund&mdash;3 per cent from the wages and 2 per cent from the employer, plus 1 per cent from the employee&mdash;is not as simple as it appears. There are certain cosmetic improvements and some relatively important administrative ones, improvements from the point of view of collecting the money and, in that way, easing things for the Minister's Department.  But surely the Minister's primary responsibility is to the community.  It is in his attitude to his job in relation to the community that he has failed in a particularly disappointing way because most of us had been given to understand that the Minister had radical attitudes and intended to endeavour to effect those while in office.  Clearly that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is carrying on&mdash;he is not initiating anything&mdash;a trend which, since 1973, has become more noticeable since the term of office of the Coalition Government when, with Deputy Cluskey in control, there was registered a new approach to the whole idea of the re-distributive function of fiscal policy in society.  Certainly that was in line with the traditional Cumann na nGaedheal, <Col N="325" /> Fine Gael policies over the years, very conservative ones.  The Minister carrying on these policies is quite clearly moving away from the radicalism of the early Fianna Fáil Governments in their social attitudes, their feeling that it was important that the wealthy be made responsible for helping to care for the under priviledged in society.  The Minister has totally deserted that position, or is in the process of doing so.  In his social attitudes he is now becoming quite indistinguishable from his opponents on the other side of the House.  There is now no real difference between the two major parties and, indeed, and I regret to say it about the Labour Party, the three major parties in the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill is all part of the continuing war of attrition between the employer and employee in society, in western capitalism, an attempt to deal with the fact that the old <i>laissez faire</i> idea of everybody looking after himself is no longer acceptable and has not been probably since the beginning of the century. Contributions were considered to be inevitable from the Central Fund, from taxation and from the Exchequer. The idea that there should be effectively a redistribution of wealth from the wealthier minority sections down the line to the less wealthy and poorer sections of society permeated most of the social welfare and health code, education, housing, indeed the whole of this aspect of life.  That trend was slowly reversed down the years through the introduction of the insurance principle rather than &ldquo;the free of direct charge at point of use&rdquo; principle.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the 1947 Health Act the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Health had the principle that there would not be any contribution at all.  This was the famous one that ran into trouble later on in my own period of office.  There was a basic philosophy of concern for the priviledged members of society, and this is the complete obverse, the other side of the coin, in so far as the Minister is now moving away completely from the idea that the wealthy have the responsibility to concern themselves with the less wealthy and the poor, who must now <Col N="326" /> pay everything themselves.  It is a development of benevolent capitalism of the good employers such as Guinness who looked after their employees' insurance, health, old age, disability and so on, but in fact the employee paid most of the contribution and really the employer paid very little.</P>
    <P>It was a clever device.  Now it is being used by Governments, and this Government in particular are following the lead given to them by the Coalition Government and we now have, as Deputy O'Connell said, a frightening and worrying change.  In 1971 the percentage contributed from the State was 34.4 and in 1978 it is 20 per cent; that is a 14 per cent drop in seven years.  Quite clearly the State is attempting to opt out of its responsibility in so far as Exchequer payments should be used to fund social welfare benefits of one kind or another. The other self-funding schemes like the redundancy payments and the Minister's proposed 1 per cent health insurance scheme are variants of this attitude where the people in control are rounding on the various components of society and saying &ldquo;As far as we are concerned we are keeping what we have and if any services are coming to you in the communal sense you will fund them yourselves&rdquo;.  Indeed, the Minister pointed that out in his statement.  The total funds of the health scheme would be in the region of £22 million and the scheme he is bringing in costs about £7 million to £10 million and he has the rest for funding various health schemes.  This is the new principle which is a departure from the old idea of the strong helping the weak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is a far cry from the principle of children's allowances where there is no contribution and no insurance scheme.  This was one of the fundamental issues in conflict in the 1951 Health Bill.  I did not want the insurance principle at all; I wanted the redistributive effect of fiscal policy to be effective.  Instead of that the insurance principle was insisted upon later by subsequent Ministers and has now taken the <Col N="327" /> dominant position.  This is the important, reactionary, extremely conservative development to which the Minister is a party.  He has not initiated this; it was initiated by Deputy Cluskey in collaboration with Deputy R. Ryan.  We have no undertaking from the Minister about the policy decision laid down by Deputy Ryan, then Minister for Finance, when, speaking in the 1975 budget debate, he said, that not alone did the Government intend reducing the State's contribution to the social insurance fund but it intended over the next five years to eliminate the State's contribution altogether.  The worker and employer would then pay for all the benefits.</P>

      <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister that at least he will stand on the position of the 20 per cent.  Of course he cannot give an assurance for his successors.  When the Minister for Economic Planning and Development starts to look for money quite obviously these are remarkably valuable sources of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy's argument, but in this legislation put forward by me now we are retaining the 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that.  It would be very unwise politically for the Minister to make any serious reduction. Obviously he is setting up the position whereby a progression can take place. Since 1971 it has taken place, from 34 per cent right down to 20 per cent.  That is a speedy reduction in the State's contribution, especially as in this question of fiscal policy the wealthy minority have been so carefully protected in other ways.  By the modification of capital gains tax, the abolition of wealth tax and various other methods their already wealthy position is certainly stabilised and under no serious threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening now is a consequence of the old and unending conflict of capitalistic society; of profits and dividends gone astray to the employer; to the employee, of wages and salaries gone astray. There is an eternal conflict there <Col N="328" /> which is insoluble and this continual battle is going on between the employer and employee, between trade unions and employers.  What is happening now is that the insistence on keeping the mass of the people at a low subsistence level or slightly above it has become more sophisticated as it has to be because one has a very powerful trade union movement now which one did not have in 1913 and because there is a higher level of political literacy among workers. Therefore, all this kind of thing has to be carefully dressed up.  It cannot be done as it was in the days of Mr. Blythe when he cut the old age pensions and so on.  If one goes about it carefully, an effective reduction in living standards can be achieved by changing the components of the tax structure and the contributions of the State and the individuals to all the different health and social welfare services.</P>
    <P>One of the odd things about it&mdash;and Deputy O'Connell touched on it&mdash;is the discriminatory nature of this kind of legislation.  A relatively small percentage of people are workers.  It is the workers who are going to fund this scheme with the employers.  I can never accept that the employer really pays his contribution because all he does, if he is producing Guinness, is add an eighth of a farthing to the pint and that pays his contribution without much trouble.  He is at a loss but he still makes the profits he always made and the workers pays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The employer's contribution is just another form of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Give it to the worker but do not pretend it is an employer's contribution. It is hypocrisy to create the impression that the employer is paying something which he is not paying.  He is getting it from the worker in a different way, then standing before the world and saying: &ldquo;I am a generous employer.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My main interest is the discriminatory nature of this new development in our taxation system.  In the old days if one got the advantage from any scheme one could say that the money was contributed by the whole community according to their means. That seemed to be a fair basic principle. We have moved away from that principle. What surprises me about the Minister is that he is a party to this development.  As a man who has said that he would like to make radical stands on different issues, it surprises me that he is taking this position and is not making a serious effort to see that the contributions are not restricted to a minority in our society.  In the old days everybody was vulnerable.  Everybody paid either in direct taxes or in indirect taxes.  This new system is reduced to two people, the employer and the employee, and the diminishing contribution from the State. Is that not discriminatory?  The farmers, 22 per cent of the population, pay £1.6 million out of a taxation budget of £360 million.  In deference to Deputy Blaney, I am talking about the wealthy farmers.  I know quite well that anybody who reads the figures of the profits made by Munster and Leinster farmers will see that they are different from the Ulster and the Connacht farmers.  That seems to be discriminatory in the most obvious sense.  There are other points that I mentioned about the easing of the burden on the extremely wealthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving that aside, there are people on various forms of social benefit, the unemployed in particular.  These people are to be looked after; the fund is to be fed by contributions from the unfortunate employees and indirectly from the employers.  That is difficult position to sustain on any point of equity.  All through the years gone by the general trend was the idea of cherishing equally all the children of the nation.  In this development we are quite obviously discriminating against the various children of the nation.  We are imposing great <Col N="330" /> hardships on some and making life easy for others.</P>
    <P>In these proposals the Minister is introducing various superficial differences and administrative improvements.  At the same time he seems to be more concerned with the mechanical side of the social welfare problems in his Department than he is with the result that will follow from the ordinary consumer of the social welfare benefits.  I am also astonished at the insufferable complacency of the Government, and of the Minister on behalf of the Government, on the position of our society in relation to social welfare.  Of the nine EEC countries, Holland is at the top of the table in comparable terms and Ireland is at the bottom in the percentage of GNP spent on social security, health and other things such as pensions for disabled persons, family allowances and sickness benefits as a percentage of earnings.  We are at the bottom of the table in all these important categories.  The Minister showed an extraordinary sense of indifference to these realities.  He brings this Bill in here and tries to put it forward as if it were going to be of some benefit to the consumer.  What he is doing is pushing away the burden from the people who are able to carry it and asking the ordinary worker to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister does not see fit to attempt to defend or even to explain the <i>rationale</i> behind this approach. Surely there must be a level beyond which we would not go, being the meanest when paying the lowest and continuing our indifference to the conditions in which the majority in our society live.  It is interesting to recall the propaganda at the time we were attempting to get into the EEC, the spiritual renewal, when quite obviously we were the meanest and the most pauperised of all the nine countries.</P>
    <P>On the question of the upper limit of £5,000 a year, there is an enormous anomally.  Is it not a fact that the person who has an income of up to £5,000 will pay the same tax for the same benefits as somebody who has an income of £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000, and is this not another element of discrimination in favour of a person with a higher income? As one goes up the scale the tax <Col N="331" /> benefits, the mortgages, become more discriminatory against the lower taxpayer. I would therefore be in favour of abolishing the upper limit of £5,000 and making taxes more punitive on people who have the highest disposable income levels, the people with £6,000 or £8,000 or more per year.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims to be radical and progressive in outlook.  I do not see any signs of it in this legislation.  How can he justify this continuing discrimination in favour of the wealthy sector of our society?  What will happen in relation to the public service employees?  How will they come out under this scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is restricted to 36 per cent of the population who will be responsible by their contributions for looking after the disabled social welfare sector.  It is a basic departure from earlier social welfare policy which recognised that, properly used, the social welfare code could win some kind of significant redistribution of wealth in the total society.  To sum up, the Bill makes it easier for the State's contribution to be eliminated, and I think that is its main aim.  It has a few components which will promote a reduction of Exchequer expenditure on social welfare and make the workers pay, a burden which will fall on a minority.  Therefore I must conclude that the Bill is far removed from any serious enlightened effort on the part of the Minister.  It is retrograde.  It takes over the policies of the Minister's predecessors in office, and it is therefore a depressing commentary on the state of the society in which we live.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the decision of the Government to authorise RTE to increase licence fees.</P>
      <P>I move this motion as my party's spokesman on consumer affairs.  Deputy O'Donnell and I had two reasons for putting down the motion and I shall outline them.  First, because of the sheer size of the increases we considered that they necessitated a public debate.  Secondly, we put down the motion because the National Prices Commission were ignored in this case.</P>
      <P>The increases granted in this instance are very strange in the light of what was clearly stated in the Fianna Fáil manifesto of June, 1977.  On page 7 of that manifesto in the section headed &ldquo;Prices&rdquo; it is stated in paragraph 2:</P>
      <P>Government policy must be directed towards discouraging increased costs and prices in all areas where it has control or influence.  This policy has been absent in the last four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a statement, a declaration of intent by Fianna Fáil at the time.  Now that they are in government we expected that they would underpin that commitment through action.  I shall quote again the words of the manifesto &ldquo;...in all areas where it has control or influence&rdquo;. Surely this must be regarded as an area <Col N="335" /> in which the Government have absolute control and influence but the massive increases have been given with what I would call a pathetic justification because the argument made for allowing them, in the form of comparative levels of fees elsewhere, is both weak and misleading, to put it mildly.  We are not comparing like with like, a matter with which I shall deal later.</P>
    <P>The increases involve a 24 per cent hike in the case of monochrome television sets, from £18.50 to £23 and in the case of colour television sets, an increase of 22 per cent, from £31 to £38.  A minor point but one that should not be missed is that it is rather strange that the higher increase has been allowed in the case of monochrome television sets, a 24 per cent increase.  Despite the massive increase in colour television sets there is still a large number of monochrome sets and it can be said without fear of contradiction that these sets are in the possession of the less well-off section of our community, people who cannot afford colour television sets.  Yet, for some strange reason the larger increase is given in the case of this section.  I do not know the reason but it is indicative of the philosophy that underlies the policies of the Government.  On the one hand they have abolished wealth tax but on the other hand they are sending out smoke signals that the PAYE taxpayers will be mulcted in the next few months in the budget.  Having regard to that kind of philosophy there is nothing new in the attitude of the Government.</P>
    <P>We are the fourth dearest country in the EEC with regard to television licence fees.  I shall revert now to what I said before concerning the statement that was issued accompanying the announcement of the increased licence fees.  Comparisons were made and it was pointed out that Denmark had a licence fee of £64, Belgium £51 and Holland £47.50. The Minister must know that a statement of that kind tabulating licence fees in countries that are not comparable to ours makes no impression on the ordinary licence holder, on Members of this House, and I would hazard a guess that it makes little impression on some of <Col N="336" /> the Minister's colleagues sitting behind him because we are talking of countries that have a cost of living and a standard of living far in excess of what we experience. No doubt the Minister, from both his travels as Minister and from his experience as a public representative, is well aware of that fact.  We cannot compare our standards with those of Belgium, Denmark or Holland.  Any attempt to make a comparison would be an effort to mislead the public into thinking that we are not doing too badly now that we are in fourth place.</P>
    <P>In the UK the licence fee is £9 for black-and-white television and £21 for colour television.  These figures represent little more than half the level of our licence fees.  Also, in the UK set-up there is a total dependence on licence fees. There is not the facility of having a second source of income, namely, commercial advertising.  The other major channel in the UK, ITV, have similar licence fees but as they do not derive anything by way of licensing sources they depend totally on advertising.</P>
    <P>The reason for our interest in this matter to the extent of tabling a motion for public discussion is that a great number of people are involved.  As was stated recently by an executive of RTE, we have reached saturation point so far as the possession of television sets is concerned.  I am informed that the number of licences held is in the region of 700,000 but from what I have been hearing this figure would not seem to be an indication of the number of television sets in use.  The degree to which the payment of licence fees is being evaded is a matter which caused concern to the Minister's predecessors and I am sure it causes the Minister concern, too.  The problem is to find a way of ensuring that those people who are not paying licence fees are brought to justice and made to pay.  It is very unfair that those lawabiding people who pay their licence fees should be asked to carry the can for those who, for reasons best known to themselves, find a way out of the legitimate demands made on them in this respect.</P>
    <P>The other reason for seeking public discussion of this important matter is the amazing lack of information regarding <Col N="337" /> the whole question of the case made by RTE.  We all know that the provision of a television or a radio broadcasting service is an expensive operation both from the point of view of capital investment and of current running costs.  In this type of media we are dealing in what is known as high technology and in an area of high performance which in turn means high fees being demanded by performers. Hopefully, the Minister will give us some indication as to the amount sought by RTE and the purpose for which it was sought.  The Minister may correct me if he considers that necessary but my information is that there is a grey area in the case of the granting of a £7 increase specifically for RTE 2 and in order to provide an income of £2.3 million. In other words, there is specific reference to the area in which the increased revenue is to be spent whereas my information is that while there was a demand for an increase in the licence fees, the figure mentioned was in respect of a package of developments which RTE had in mind and one of which was RTE 2 and that other factors entered into the area of extra expenditure such as the expansion of both radio and television services, the provision of hardware in the form of the replacement of materials and also the purchasing of new technical material to improve the service.</P>
    <P>I have been told that all that was expected towards the operation costs of RTE 2 was a £5 increase and that the RTE Authority were happily surprised when they found that a £7 increase had been granted for a specific purpose.  Certainly, the reaction from RTE on the day following the announcement of the sanction of the increase would seem to indicate a certain degree of pleasant surprise in relation to the amount allowed when their spokesman said they were happy with the increase sanctioned.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with another area that I mentioned at the outset, that is, the ignoring by the Government of the National Prices Commission.  In this instance the very Government who set up the commission, and rightly so, to monitor on behalf of the public demands for price increases in respect of all commodities and services, decided to ignore <Col N="338" /> that commission.  It was something sought for a long time and the Government of the day in their wisdom decided to set up this body.</P>
    <P>The activities of this body serve two purposes.  First, they monitor and scrutinise in detail and, if they think necessary, seek consultants to advise them on demands made for price increases in various commodities.  On the basis of the information available to them they then make recommendations and present them to the Minister, who in turn, accepts or rejects them as is his right.  Second, and this is very important, the commission publish a monthly report outlining in detail the demands made for price increases.  They give indepth information with regard to different commodities and they give the reasons why they make certain recommendations.</P>
    <P>This report is available for the public to read and comment on and they can use it as a guideline to consider the price increases sanctioned by the Minister of the day.  Because in this case the National Prices Commission were ignored there is a profound lack of knowledge so far as the public are concerned. I have no doubt that RTE made a very good case to the Minister backing their arguments by giving various figures of expenditure and so on.  The fact is the Minister knows the case they made and on that basis may take recommendations, but we are not aware of the case made, except as synopsised through newspaper reports of the current demand on RTE, the provision of RTE 2, the expansion of the radio service and so on.</P>
    <P>This body were set up by the Minister's own Government and have served the country well.  Last week the Minister's colleague made the excuse in this House that the National Prices Commission did not have the capacity to comment on a demand of this nature because they were a new service and therefore would not be in a position to use comparative data to make recommendations. There are two arguments against that kind of statement.  First, I question the validity of the statement that this is a new service.  To me and to many other people, RTE 2 is an extension <Col N="339" /> of the present service.  It is an expansion of the old RTE.  We now have RTE 1 which is a new animal and RTE 2 which is also a new animal.  They both came into being together because we did not hear mention of RTE 1 until RTE 2 came on the scene.  We had plain RTE. To me RTE have been split into two, into RTE 1 and RTE 2.  We end up with an expansion, we are told, of some 60 per cent in television production time through RTE 2.  The excuse that this is a new service is rather lame.</P>
    <P>The second allegation, that the National Prices Commission were not capable of making informed comment on the demands made for the increase in the licence fees has much more serious significance so far as we are concerned. If that is so I would like to know with whom did the Minister consult in scrutinising the application made by RTE?  If the NPC as a body&mdash;and I have absolute confidence in them in carrying out their functions within their terms of reference&mdash;are able and capable and have a capacity to look in depth at a multiplicity of applications made month after month, week after week and day after day, and make recommendations to the Minister, on what basis does he now feel that they are incapable of making any informed comment or recommendation on RTE's application? This shows a complete lack of confidence by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I agree it was not the Minister who is at present sitting in the House but his colleague the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who made that statement.  On the principle of collective responsibility, I assume that the Minister present would have to accept responsibility for what his colleague said.  He definitely must accept responsibility in the light of an undertaking, a serious commitment, given by his Government before assuming office.</P>
    <P>First, they said they would re-vamp the National Prices Commission to make them more effective in ensuring that applicants did not get more than they were entitled to or than they sought. The last sentence on page 7 of the Fianna Fáil manifesto said that frequently <Col N="340" /> the application made was for far more than the firm really needed and that the increase granted was often far more than the firm ever expected.  In this case the National Prices Commission were not responsible for giving far more than the firm expected.  It was the Minister who saw fit to do so, without any consultation so far as we know.  If consultations took place and if advice was sought, I should like to know from whom that advice was sought, by whom it was given and whether the Minister accepted the advice given to him.  These are facts which would be stated plainly in the report of the National Prices Commission had the Minister resorted to that source of information and advice when this application was made last May.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 5 on the same page of the Fianna Fáil manifesto it is stated:</P>
    <P>Control by legislation, in the interest of the consumer, of monopolies in particular, and of take-overs and mergers were relevant.</P>
    <P>No later than last week, the Minister put beyond yea or nay any illusion about offshoots of private companies entering into the area of broadcasting.  RTE are to hold the control and therefore logically they will have a monopoly.  This is the kind of philosophy emanating from the Minister.  I will not go into the rights or wrongs of it at the moment because it does not concern the motion.  The Minister must agree that, in their present form, and as he sees their function, RTE are a monopoly.  In their manifesto the Fianna Fáil Party gave an assurance that they would pay particular attention to areas of monopoly.  Surely this is an area where the Government have absolute control and influence, and where they are dealing with a monopoly.</P>
    <P>The by-passing of the National Prices Commission has led to a great vacuum in informative comment and information to the public.  In this House last week, it was thrown at us in Fine Gael that we did likewise in 1974, so far as I remember.  In 1977, when an application was made for an increase in the licence fee, it was referred to the National Prices Commission.  The increase sought was £3 for monochrome and £5 for colour. Having consulted with the National <Col N="341" /> Prices Commission, the Government of the day approved an increase of £2.50 and £4 respectively.  To me the by-passing of this important body undermines their importance and their standing.  That is very serious.  The lack of information arising from the way this matter was handled is nothing short of criminal in the sense that it is open to any interpretation.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a public body.  RTE are a State body.  The funds they use come from three sources: repayable advances from the Exchequer, licence fees and advertising revenue. Because they are a public company, surely the principle of public accountability is involved.  That accountability was lacking because of the way the application was handled.  I heard this dictum quoted recently by an RTE executive: commercial broadcasting is a licence to print money.  The strange thing is that that would seem to be true.  The Minister is well aware that at this moment there is an ungodly rush to get into commercial broadcasting, not by people who are concerned with academics or culture or aesthetics.  They are hardheaded businessmen investing money and seeking what they regard as a fair return for it.  They are tripping over one another to get into commercial broadcasting.  RTE have it all to themselves.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is wrong when a monopoly of this kind cannot show what could be regarded as a return from the opportunity they have at their fingertips.  In 1977 the RTE Authority showed a welcome surplus of £1.5 million.  If that trend is to continue, surely we must expect that surplus to increase over the years.  Surely we must also expect that if that is so, RTE's dependence on the licence holder to pay the piper would also diminish.  In fact, that dependence seems to be increasing to an extent that it will possibly affect the consumer price index in the first quarter or the first half of 1979.</P>
    <P>This rush by very shrewd hardheaded businessmen into commercial broadcasting leaves RTE with many questions to answer and, in the light of the increase sanctioned and granted by him, leaves the Minister with some questions <Col N="342" /> to answer.  The fact is that licence holders are being asked to pay for something for which many of them did not ask.  No equality of service is being given as between the east and the west&mdash;for example, in the multi-channel versus the single channel or double channel areas.  We are now talking about demanding a licence fee from people in some areas whose reception is so bad that they cannot get RTE 1 as my colleague tells me.  Putting it in a nutshell, licence holders are being asked to pay the same fee but are not getting the same return.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;takes note of the decision of the Government to allow an increase in licence fees to provide for the second television service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To say that I am surprised that the Fine Gael Party should put down a motion here deploring the recent increases in television licence fees is to put it very mildly particularly when one notes the dismal record of that party in respect of increases in television licence fees when in government from 1973 to 1977.  I can only conclude that the rapidly improving economic scene since this Government took office leaves them little scope for real criticism and forces them to grab at any straw.  I certainly find the attitude of the Opposition hard to reconcile with the performance of the Coalition when in government.  It would appear to me that Deputy O'Toole found it difficult&mdash;and I do not blame him&mdash;to defend his motion. Quite obviously his heart was not in it.  He began by expressing horror at the size of the increases.  When one remembers that in 1976 the Coalition Government increased licence fees by £4 for mono television sets and £7 for colour television sets as against £4.50 for mono and £7 for colour in 1978, which is very much lower in real terms, I am amazed at the fact that he should express horror at the present increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> It is worth while to look back at the history of licence fee increases since the introduction of RTE because it clearly shows that the actions of the Coalition when in Government differs dramatically from their stance in Opposition. Indeed, Deputy O'Toole in his speech, coupled with the wording of the Fine Gael motion, would appear to suggest that RTE should be able to provide a second national television service without the need for any increase in television licence fees.  It might be helpful if we looked at the record.  Television licence fees were first introduced in January 1962 on the inauguration of the television service here.  The annual fee at that time was set at £4.  Between January 1962 and 1 September 1971 there were three increases authorised.  In almost ten years under a Fianna Fáil Government the fee had risen from £4 to £7.50 in respect of any kind of television set, black and white or colour.  From September 1971 until the Change of Government in 1973 there was no further increase in the television licence fee.  It is no harm to mention that the separate licence fee in respect of radio receivers was abolished during this period with effect from September 1972. We might contrast that situation with the performance of the Opposition when they were in office.  Under the Coalition Government the television licence fees were increased on no less than four occasions, 1 October 1973, 1 October 1974, 1 February 1976 and 1 April 1977.  That is to say, in four years the number of increases authorised was in excess of the number authorised in the previous 12 years under the Fianna Fáil Government.  When the Coalition took office in 1973 the television licence fee was £7.50 in respect of either a mono or a colour set.  When they left office four years later television licence fees had been increased to £18.50 for a mono set and £31 for a colour set, representing increases of 146 per cent in the level for mono television licences and 313 per cent in the level for colour television licences.  We must remember that for these increases in licence fees the viewers did not get any additional services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> When the decision was taken in November 1975 that RTE should be entrusted with the running of the second television service it was obvious that this would involve significant increases in television licence fees when the second service was established.  The need for the recently announced increases in television licence fees flows directly from the decisions which were made.  It might be useful at this stage to recall the background to these decisions.  In October 1973 the provision of a transmitter and microwave link network which would serve for either a second RTE channel or for rebroadcasting one Northern Ireland television channel was authorised.  To date almost £4 million has been provided by way of Exchequer advance to finance the construction of this network.  At that time a vigorous debate took place on the use to be made of the second transmitter network when completed and during this debate Fianna Fáil supported the people in the single channel areas in their claim to entitlement to a choice of television viewing. However, we did object to handing over what was in effect control of a national asset, that is our television broadcasting frequencies, to another country.  We argued our case strenuously and at the end of the day the voice of the people was heard loudly and clearly and was reflected in the result of the survey which was conducted in October 1975 and which indicated in both single and multi-channel areas that there was a strong preference, about 62 per cent, for a second RTE channel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Following consideration of the survey, which showed a clear preference for a second RTE channel, it was decided in November 1975 that the second television network when completed would be used for this purpose.  In arriving at this decision the best information available to the Coalition Government about its effect on the level of television licence fees was contained in the RTE booklet, <i>The Second Channel</i>, published by the RTE Authority the previous June.  We must assume that <Col N="345" /> RTE made the best case they could for holding that the second television network should be used for a second RTE service instead of for rebroadcasting BBC 1.  Presumably they would also be anxious to show that their proposal would not involve a big increase in the television licence fee. Therefore we can assume that, having examined the whole question of the fees, they came up with the lowest fee that they felt was compatible with operating the new service.  In section 7 of that document RTE set out what was, at the time, its best estimate at 1975 prices of the running costs of a second RTE channel. They estimated that from 1979 onwards some £3,914,000 would be needed over and above advertising income to pay for the second service and this would represent a general increase of £7.10 per licence.  Let me emphasise again that this estimate was one based on 1975 prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licence fees had already been increased twice since the Coalition Government took office and the mono licence was £12, while the colour licence was £20.  There was no question about the fact that the previous Government knew perfectly well it would be absolutely necessary to have extra money made available for the provision of RTE 2.  At the very time when they recognised that this extra money was necessary, a further significant increase in licence fees to finance the existing broadcasting service was also under consideration.  It is amazing to look at the record of the party opposite, taking into account the motion before the House.  The only concern expressed by the Coalition when in office in regard to the level of television licence fee increases necessary to finance RTE 2 was the announcement in December 1976 that it had been decided to postpone the introduction of even a limited second television service by the end of 1977, first, because of its implication for the public capital programme for 1977 and future years and also because of its effect on television licence fee levels.  They decided that because of this they would wait for some time before coming to a final decision as to what they would do and this is a recognition of the fact that licence fees <Col N="346" /> would have to be increased.</P>
    <P>Some months later authority was given to RTE to go ahead with the second channel and there could be no doubt in anybody's mind that the new service would cost a sizeable amount of money with a consequent effect on licence fees.  The decision, which was announced on 26 October this year, to increase the licence fees to finance the running costs of RTE 2 is a result of the various decisions to which I have already referred, but I am very pleased that the increases announced are not only less than what had been estimated by RTE in 1975, without allowing for the effects of inflation since then, but represent a smaller percentage of the licence fee required for the existing RTE services than seemed likely in 1975.</P>
    <P>The estimate in 1975 for advertising income was £750,000; this year the estimate is £2 million.  This clearly underlines the buoyancy of the economy. The present increase in licence fees is attributable in total to the increased costs arising from the operation of RTE 2 during RTE's current financial year.  RTE estimate that the running costs will amount to £4.3 million in this period. The new service will give rise to an increase in the permanent staff of RTE of approximately 200.  There will be over 1,000 hours of additional bought-in material necessary for the second service but there will be an increase of some 300 hours of home-originated material, including Irish language programmes, over current levels.  I do not have to tell the House that the cost of home-produced material is significantly higher than the bought-in material and 300 hours additional home production represents an increase of over 20 per cent on current levels.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole queried whether the amount of money required was as high as the amount to be raised by increased licence fees.  The position is that RTE proposed increases in fees which would produce an extra £2.3 million in the financial year ending 30 September, 1979.  This was the amount estimated to be necessary to bridge the gap between the extra advertising income, which I have mentioned as being approximately £2 million, and the running costs of RTE <Col N="347" /> 2 in the period.  The increases which will come into force on 1 December were designed to yield this amount and there was no question of providing for anything else.  There will also be volume increases in a number of other areas of expenditure, for example, power, maintenance, stocks of spare parts, telephone, telex and postal expenses arising from the operation of the new service. Interest payments alone on Exchequer funds advanced to finance capital expenditure for the new service will amount to £445,000 for the financial year ending 30 September next.</P>
    <P>The running costs of RTE 2 will amount to £4.3 million in RTE's current financial year.  This will be made up of £2 million from advertising revenue and £2.3 million which will be raised from the increased licence fees which have been allowed recently.  To put the cost of the new national television service into perspective, perhaps it is worth while reminding Deputies that RTE's operating expenditure in their financial year just ended in respect of their existing services amounted to over £24 million.  RTE estimate than in a two-channel situation increased advertising income of £2 million will be realised.  I cannot repeat often enough that the difference between the running cost of £4.3 million and the estimated increased advertising income of £2 million must be raised by way of increased licence fees.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputies on the opposite side can be serious in putting forward the suggestion that there should not be any increase at all in licence fees. Deputy O'Toole made some comparisons between BBC and RTE and more or less wept for BBC on the basis that that body had to depend solely on licence fees and had no advertising income. Mark you, I understand the BBC are looking for quite a considerable increase in their licence fee at the moment. When one takes into account that television licence holders in Britain are in excess of 18,000,000 as compared with about 600,000 here and that the licence fees income of the BBC in the year ended 31 March 1977 was about £227 <Col N="348" /> million as against £10.3 million for RTE plus £9.47 million from advertising I do not think there is any particular reason why we should shed any tears for the BBC.  In fact, when one compares the total incomes and recognises that RTE has to produce and present programmes on the very limited amount they have as compared with the income enjoyed by the BBC there is no particular reason, I think, to decry the efforts they are making.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole spent quite some time referring to the National Prices Commission and to the fact that we had not brought these increases before that body.  As he was told by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development the other day, in reply to a supplementary question, there is no precedent for the National Prices Commission being asked to recommend prices for the introduction of a new product or service and, of course, RTE 2 is a new service. There was, therefore, no reason why the National Prices Commission should have been approached in relation to these increases.</P>
    <P>There is something more I have to say in relation to the National Prices Commission and the actions of the previous Government in regard to it and in regard to increases in licence fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal now with the question of whether the National Prices Commission should, in fact, have been consulted before the Government decided on the amount of the increase.  The increases relate solely to a new service, RTE 2, and because they do it would have been inappropriate for the National Prices Commission to recommend a charge.  As I said, there is no precedent for the National Prices Commission being asked to recommend a charge for a new product or service. Deputies are aware that the Government recently authorised RTE 2 to proceed with a second national radio channel.  I can assure the House that they are satisfied that this channel will finance itself from increased advertising revenue. No provision was made in the recently <Col N="349" /> announced increased licence fees to finance this radio service.  In any event, even if provision were made, the argument with regard to the functions of the National Prices Commission in relation to the determination of the charges for new services would apply to the new radio service as it applies to the new television service.  I emphasise the increases authorised relate only to the second television service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat puzzled at the apparent concern of the Opposition in regard to the matter.  It is worth putting on record that the National Prices Commission was established, as Deputy O'Toole said, by a Fianna Fáil Government in October 1971.  There was no increase in licence fees from October 1971 until the change of Government in 1973. However, as I have already pointed out, there were four licence fee increases during the period of the Coalition Government.  Two of these increases&mdash;those effective from 1 October 1973 and from 1 October 1974&mdash;were not, and I repeat not, referred to the National Prices Commission.  The increases authorised by the previous Government with effect from 1 October 1973 also introduced a new colour television fee which represented a 100 per cent increase in the licence fee in force up to then.  Remember, first of all, that in the first two licence fee increases the Coalition Government did not approach the National Prices Commission but on the third one, when an increase in licence fees was brought into operation and effective from 1 February 1976, the previous Government did seek the observations of the National Prices Commission, and that body recommended increases of £2.50 mono and £4.50 colour. Now the previous Government not only did not accept the recommendation of the National Prices Commission but they authorised increases of £4 and £7 respectively, increases more than 55 per cent greater than the increases recommended by the Commission.  Looking at the record I am absolutely amazed at the stress put on this by Deputy O'Toole.  In explanation of the decision not to adopt the recommendation of the Commission the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs stated that the matter had <Col N="350" /> been considered by the Government, who were satisfied that the increases recommended by the National Prices Commission would not have provided sufficient additional revenue in RTE's financial year ending 30 September 1976 having regard to the Authority's statutory obligation to be self-supporting. It was in only one case out of four, the last increase effective from 1 April 1977, that the previous Government accepted the recommendation of the National Prices Commission. Against that background the cries of concern from the Opposition benches ring somewhat hollow.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that RTE has a statutory obligation to be self-supporting. This duty is laid on it by section 24 of the 1960 Broadcasting Authority Act.  The Authority's two main sources of revenue or income are advertising and a grant-in-aid equivalent to the net receipts from broadcasting licence fees.  RTE are satisfied that in the present buoyant economic situation increased advertising income in a two-channel situation will amount to £2 million. Operating costs of RTE 2 are £4.3 million.  Therefore, if they are to discharge their statutory obligation, the balance of the £2.3 million must be found from somewhere, and that is what is being provided in the increased licence fees.</P>
    <P>RTE will provide a choice of television viewing for those viewers who, because of an accident of geography, have been restricted to one television service. The new service will help to provide a complete and comprehensive television broadcasting service for the whole country.  It will have a strong non-metropolitan bias in RTE 2 home programmes and, as the service develops and resources permit, RTE intends that no place in the country will be more than 40 miles from an injection point to the RTE 2 network.  A Programme Council strongly representative of the people of the single channel areas is being established to advise RTE on the selection of the best programmes available from BBC 1, BBC 2, ITV and some other sources for transmission.  The Government are satisfied that the increases in television licence fees which will come <Col N="351" /> into force on 1 December 1978 are the minimum necessary to cover the difference between the running costs of RTE 2 and the extra advertising income expected in the new two-channel situation. They are essential if RTE are to sustain their statutory obligation to be financially self-supporting.  Remember, too, that in our term of government previously we also made available another new service in Radio na Gaeltachta in 1972.  Let me emphasise again that during the Coalition period in office there were four increases in licence fees in four years as compared with three increases in 12 years under a Fianna Fáil administration.  I emphasise that the increases sanctioned recently were for a new service while the increases sanctioned by the Coalition were to finance the continuing operation of services already there.  The Coalition increases in 1976, which were not in accordance with the National Prices Commission's recommendation, were approximately at the same level as the increases allowed by the present Government without taking the inflationary situation into account in between times. The Coalition gave nothing extra for the money taken in licence fees but the present Government are making available a whole new service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised by way of Parliamentary Question last week and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development gave no information to those who tabled the question as to the reason for the present increase which we are discussing.  The Minister has given some details of expenditure under various headings related to RTE 2 which he described as a new station or new channel but which I would regard as an extension of RTE. Despite what he says I am still not convinced that this is the only way of raising money&mdash;we are talking about television and radio licences but money is what we are discussing in the context of this resolution and the Minister's amendment. Last week we were told that the increase was to pay for RTE 2.  The question was posed by Deputy O'Toole <Col N="352" /> and has not been answered by the Minister as far as I can recall: what amount did RTE request when consideration was given to an increase in the licence fee?  It is very difficult even with the information the Minister has given now to relate all this to the £7 per year increase in the licence.  There was no notification beforehand, in the last five or six months when it was known that RTE 2 was to open in Cork, that there would be an increase in radio and television licences.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that on other occasions when an increase in television licences was proposed the matter was not referred to the National Prices Commission. He cannot be contradicted; that was indeed the case.  But it was referred to the National Prices Commission in 1977 and it was assumed at that time that where an increase was proposed an application would go to the Prices Commission. If the Prices Commission had all the information the Minister has given tonight regarding costings they would be in a very good position to determine what the increase should be or whether the amount sought by RTE was too much or too little.  We are still in the dark as to how the £7 per year increase is made up.  The Prices Commission, I believe, would be able to determine whether the increase was necessary because radio and television is a consumer product and they are especially fitted to examine such applications.</P>
      <P>It seems the licence holders are to bear the brunt of the establishment of RTE 2 or the extension of RTE to RTE 2.  I did not hear the Minister say very much about increases in advertising rates and I should like to know what recent increases there have been in advertising fees.  I believe these rates should have been increased and that the whole burden should not have fallen on the ordinary viewers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures for the running of RTE up to 30 September last year are interesting. We see that licence fees amounted to £10.3 million; radio advertising, £2.3 million; television advertising, £7.8 million and other receipts, £2.1 million, a total of £22.5 million.  The extraordinary thing about television and radio advertising is that the time provided is only <Col N="353" /> taken up to the extent of 77 per cent. Could the Minister, or the Minister of State if he intervenes in the debate, tell us why only 77 per cent of advertising is sold.  Is it too expensive?  Is it because we have not sought extra advertising?  If the additional 23 per cent should be taken up, while I cannot say what amount of money it would bring in, it certainly could provide some reduction in the £7 per year increase now suggested.</P>
    <P>Licence fees accounted for 47 per cent of the total income of over £22 million for the year 30 September 1977.  Advertising amounted to 43 per cent.  I should like to know what RTE considers the balance should be as between income from licence fees and income from advertising.  I believe that unless RTE receives financial assistance directly from the Exchequer, which in my view would be undesirable since it would inevitably lead to a diminution of RTE's independence, additional income can only come from increased licence fees or advertising.  Would the Minister or some Member of the Government give us some information as to what efforts have been made to get 100 per cent of advertising time taken up and what increases were granted in recent times and whether it is contemplated that advertising rates should be increased at present.</P>
    <P>The various Departments of State could contribute to advertising income on radio and television.  Some Departments engage in advertising, the Department of the Environment in respect of road safety, litter and so on; the Department of Health also make a contribution&mdash;I do not say this is a gratuitous contribution for the sake of giving it to RTE; their advertising has been quite good but there has not been sufficient of it.  While the Department of Social Welfare does a certain amount of advertising it might engage a little more time to tell the public through RTE what they are entitled to in respect of many social welfare benefits and forms of assistance.</P>
    <P>I raised a matter previously with the Minister which is directly related to advertising, it is the establishment of community or local radio.  It appears <Col N="354" /> from replies I received to a question in the House that the Minister is either not in favour of the establishment of community or local radio or that he is not too particular about giving a decision in the near future.  As far as I am aware, RTE have applied for a local radio in Dublin and in Shannonside but the Minister is reluctant to take a decision on that particular application.  Those two places would be an additional source of revenue as well as the advertising that could be got from the establishment of local and community radio in various parts of the country.  We have had, on an experimental basis for a very brief time, when there was some local event, local radio.  As far as I know it was good quality and was well received by the people. It was certainly appreciated by the people in the locality where the radio was temporarily established.</P>
    <P>The Minister should deal as expeditiously as possible with the application of RTE and decide to establish local radios in Dublin and Shannonside.  He should think especially of the establishment of local radio in various parts of the country.  There is great scope for the establishment of extra broadcasting transmissions, and they are technically possible.  As far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are concerned there does not seem to be any urgency.  I believe that RTE are very much concerned with this matter.  I believe that the following range of broadcasting transmissions are technically possible&mdash;I referred to this some time ago but I believe I should repeat it now during this debate&mdash;two national medium wave channels, two national VHF channels, a range of regional channels including one in each of the large urban centres, the continuation of Radio na Gaeltachta and a range of local transmitters including mobile transmitters for smaller geographical areas.  Possibly those things should be mentioned in the debate on the Minister's Department, but I am talking about those in the context of extra revenue.  It appears to me that the only people who are to bear the brunt of the increase in expenditure by RTE 1 and 2 are the licence holders.  Those are other methods by which extra revenue could be got.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> I do not think I should quote the Fianna Fáil manifesto, but in it they are committed to the establishment of local and community radio establishments although there does not seem to be any move so far.  The Minister should have another look at the election manifesto.  I appreciate that they are only a year in office but the Minister has not given any indication as to whether or not in the lifetime of this Dáil such undertakings will be carried out.</P>
    <P>The increase in the television licence fee will be a hardship on many poor people. There are many categories we regard as being poor, for whom free television and radio licences are being provided.  A lot of those in the social welfare group, those over 66, those on old-age pensions, windows and orphans pensions, invalidity pensions and so forth get a free licence under certain conditions. I would like to point out that the free licence they get is in respect of the black and white television set.  We should not condemn those people for the rest of their lives to black and white television sets.  Some people might say that if they are so poor they surely could not afford a coloured TV.  In many cases their families make them presents of coloured television sets.  The Minister should consider issuing a free colour television licence to the people I have mentioned.  There are also many others in the impoverished bracket who should be given a free television licence.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that all of the increased fee goes to the establishment of RTE 2.  I want to refer to a matter that was raised by another Deputy last week when questions were asked about this increase, that is, what is to be done in those areas where it is impossible to get RTE 1 and 2?  If those people are required to pay for television licences RTE should ensure that they will receive the channels for which they are paying the licence money.  As far as RTE 2 is concerned there were fears in many parts of the country that this new channel would block out reception of BBC 1 and 2, HTV and UTV.  The former director general, Mr. Vincent Moloney gave certain assurances that there would be no <Col N="356" /> interference in south-east Leinster and various other parts of the midlands.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne received permission to raise on the adjournment the subject matter of a question of his, No. 16 of 9 May 1978 asking the Minister for the Environment if he will conduct a public inquiry into the state of houses constructed by the National Building Agency in the South Finglas area of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition of about 2,000 houses in South Finglas at first glance appears to have many of the components of quite a serious scandal, because many families are living in houses which are clearly defective to varying degrees.  The main defects in those houses are structural faults, cracks in the exterior and interior walls.  In 18 of the houses there are major defects in the roofs as they have almost slid off.  The possibility of this happening one's house is dreadful to think of, but this is apparently what very nearly happened in some of the houses.  The movement of the roof has been so significant that people have been afraid that this could happen. They have no reason to think that it might not happen.  There has also been widespread dampness in the houses, flooding, lack of fireplaces for instance, and there are electrical faults.  The extraordinary thing about these houses is that they were built by three leading builders who would be called in Ibsen's terms &ldquo;pillars of society&rdquo;, the McInerneys, the Sisk's and the Crampton's who are well known for the amount of building they have done over the years.  They are not small builders but are well established, extremely wealthy people with an enormous hinterland of expertise and building capacity behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strange thing is that the position in regard to these unfortunate people living in these houses is that this has gone on over a number of years.  Deputy <Col N="357" /> Keating, Deputy Quinn and Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself asked the Minister as far back as last May what he proposed to do about this and in Volume 306, Column 519, of the Official Report dated 9 May 1978 the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>I expect to receive a full report within the next few weeks from the agency on the finding of the technical experts and on their detailed evaluation of the probable causes of the movement of the roof trusses and barges, following their inspection of all the houses in this section of the Finglas estate.</P>
    <P>When the detailed findings of the technical experts have been submitted to me, I will have them evaluated by my own technical advisers.  In the meantime I do not intend to conduct a public inquiry into the matter.</P>
    <P>Most of us felt at that time that a public inquiry was merited by the seriousness of their obviously gerry-built houses which had been provided for Dublin Corporation tenants.  The houses belong to the corporation but the National Building Agency was commissioned to build them.  The National Building Agency simply contracted out to these three companies.  The corporation's position now is, as we Deputies know, that we can go to the corporation and get defects such as dampness and so on in houses remedied.  On this occasion the corporation says that they are not liable and that the responsibility rests with the NBA.  Would the Minister of State let us know what is the position about responsibility in this matter?  One wonders whether the corporation can completely wash their hands of responsibility in this sort of situation.  The corporation have enormous experience of house building and the standards expected.  How can they take what appears to be a Pontius Pilate approach to the thing and say that it is all the responsibility of the NBA.  Is it the responsibility of the NBA?  Before they accepted delivery of the houses should the corporation not have made sure that they measured up to the standards which they expect from anybody supplying them with houses in this sort of <Col N="358" /> situation?  The NBA took up the same position as the Minister when they said that they were waiting for a report from the IIRS.  What is the truth of that situation?  Did the NBA get a report? Did they submit it to the Minister and what are the contents of the report? Who will take responsibility?</P>
    <P>There are many strange features in this case, the fact that a national building agency can take up such a cavalier approach to this whole thing, that they can provide this service of building houses, put them out to tender and then accept the finished houses, presumably having inspected them.  Do they not inspect them and if not why not?  Do they simply take the word of the McInerneys, the Sisks and the Cramptons, these three gerry builders &mdash;a charge that they must accept&mdash;that the houses are solid substantial and worth the money?  What will the NBA do about these companies in this sort of situation?  In some countries these people would be jailed, they would be treated as criminals for taking public money under false pretences.  Will they go on building houses for people, for the various local authorities as they have done through the years?  Are these major powers in society above the law?  Can they do this sort of thing and get away with it?  Why have the National Building Agency done nothing?  Why have the corporation done nothing and why have these three major companies with enormous profits from house building stood aside since last May or before it and taken no remedial action?  Do they feel they have no responsibility?  Have they no responsibility?  Are we completely helpless in this sort of situation, and can they do the same again?  Have they done it again in other types of low cost building?  Is Finglas South a current contemporary feature and will we get this type of thing throughout the various local authority building enterprises? What kind of supervision if any has there been arising out of this incident? Has the Minister taken any action to see whether the National Building Agency are a crowd of imcompetents who should not be there and who should be sacked?  Has the Minister done anything <Col N="359" /> to see that the names of McInerney, Sisk and Crampton are blacked?</P>

      <P>This is a matter of extreme urgency.  Something must be done because winter is approaching and these people who live in the 2,000 houses involved must put up with the varying degrees of defects in them.  What is going to happen?  Obviously, the people concerned cannot take McInerney, Crampton or Sisk to law.  They cannot afford to go to the courts because of the way our courts are organised in our society.  Only the wealthy can go to court.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the only person with real power and I should like to know if it is his intention to exercise his responsibility by coming between the people and these very powerful and wealthy organisations in our society. <Col N="360" /> Does he intend to take a stand on behalf of the people to see to it that the defects in the houses are put right?  How can this be done?  The corporation have said&mdash;I do not know if they have a right to say it&mdash;that they are not going to pay out the money.  I understand that a considerable sum of money is involved, something in the region of £1 million or £2 million.  Some people hold that these houses cannot be put right, that there is no way in which the basic defects in the more seriously defective houses can be remedied with the result that the only thing that can be done is to pull them down.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister propose to do in those circumstances?  It has been suggested that the builders be paid to repair the houses and that we, the taxpayers, either through rates or through taxes, should be made liable for any cost of such repair.  It would be wrong if taxpayers were asked to provide the money to put these houses in good repair, if that is possible.  The Minister should pay the corporation to carry out this work by direct labour and then take the responsibility of suing the companies, McInerney, Crampton and Sisk, to get the money back from them so that the taxpayer would not have to pay for their scandalously defective work in this sort of situation.</P>
      <P>I understand that an attempt has been made to repair the houses by means of steel girders.  That is something which the tenants, obviously, do not want. They are afraid of such work for reasons best known to themselves.  Naturally, they are extremely frightened living in such houses.  We saw the appalling tragedy in Skerries the other night where defects in the electrical wiring caused the death of young children.  The people in these houses no longer have any faith in the three companies concerned.  It would be better if the Minister took it upon himself to facilitate the corporation by providing them with the capital to see that the work is done by direct labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult for anybody to take seriously the likelihood that the work would be done competently if, in the first instance, so little of this kind of work was done with the result that the houses are as defective as they are at present.  It <Col N="361" /> is difficult to understand why they should be allowed to make more money available at the taxpayers' expense and still not give us a guarantee that the houses which are damp, have electrical defects and which, in certain cases, have roofs which are tending to slide off will be properly repaired.  Will we get a guarantee that this will not happen again?  The Minister has a responsibility to do something about this.</P>
    <P>In May last the Minister told us that he would do something about this matter within a few weeks.  What has the Minister done since?  Is he not showing the same indifference to this tragedy? This is a tragedy because many of these people are mortgaged to the hilt, have hire-purchase commitments of one kind or another and not only can they not take McInerney, Crampton or sisk to court but they cannot afford to get these repairs done themselves.  They want somebody else to do something for them.  The NBA refused to do anything and Dublin Corporation have also refused.  It appears that the builders are not doing anything.  What has the only person with real power, the Minister, done?  Why has he allowed the period since last May to pass without taking remedial action?  It is fair to accuse the Minister of being indifferent, of being complacent and of showing contempt for the unfortunate people who live in these houses.</P>
    <P>Because these people have such a standing in our community, have such authority and financial resources, surely it is a situation where a public inquiry should be held into what happened in the erection of these houses.  Obviously, the findings of such an inquiry should be made available as should the findings of the inquiry of the IIRS be made available to Members.  If such an inquiry was held we would be in a position to know what went wrong and what was defective.  Was it bad design or bad workmanship?  Was it simply the fact that the supervision was wrong and that these people were housed without any serious concern for their welfare?  There is no community hall, health centre, post office, playgrounds or facilities such as <Col N="362" /> shops in this estate.  It is a small Irish town with only dwellinghouses and no concern for the community or social needs of the people.  Is it not time that we gave more consideration to the serious dangers inherent in this kind of carelessness, about the way people are housed, the way people live, the way children grow up?  Will the Minister hold a public inquiry into the situation in this estate?</P>

      <P>In replies to Parliamentary Questions on this subject tabled by Deputy Browne, Deputy Keating and Deputy Quinn, and in relation to supplementaries raised by Deputies on this matter, I made it clear that the question of defects in the Finglas South Houses was one for settlement between the National Building Agency, which provided the houses, and Dublin Corporation, the principal who ordered the houses and let them to the tenants.  In this context the matter of obtaining the best expert advice available to guide us in dealing with the rectification of the defects was decided between the agency and the corporation.  My responsibility in the matter will arise when the report commissioned by the agency, on behalf of the corporation, becomes available.  I will decide on the basis of their reports and on the advice of my technical advisers whether or not a public or other inquiry into the houses is warranted or necessary.  I understand that the expert report commissioned by the agency is being typed and will be made available within the next few days, and in turn will be made available by the agency to the corporation.  It will be a matter then for the city manager to decide how the report should be publicised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the question of responsibility for roof movements or other defects in the houses may well be the subject of arbitration or litigation between the contractor concerned and the agency it would be out of place for me to express any views on this aspect of the matter. However, I can say I have received categoric assurance from the agency that any remedial works found necessary to these houses will be carried out at no cost to Dublin Corporation, and <Col N="363" /> that if compensation becomes payable to a tenant as a consequence of his furniture or other property being damaged as a result of remedial works, responsibility for the compensation will not fall on the corporation.</P>

      <P>While the state of repair and structural stability of the houses was not raised in the Deputy's question and is not the responsibility of the Minister I should like to make it clear, especially for the peace of mind of the tenants concerned, that there is absolutely no danger to life or limb arising from the houses.  Temporary measures to eliminate any such danger were taken immediately the roof defects were discovered following an inspection by maintenance personnel of the corporation. The best possible professional advice has been obtained in regard to the long-term remedial measures which should be taken.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that these measures will be implemented.</P>
      <P>I would particularly request the tenants concerned, in their own interests, to co-operate with and facilitate the contractors who will move in to carry out the necessary works.  I am certain that, for their part, the contractors will keep the disturbance to tenants to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record I should stress that the trouble regarding roofs in Finglas South is confined to section two of that scheme.  I did not like the suggestion of Deputy Browne that other sections of the development are affected also, or his naming contractors whose work gave rise to no such problems.  It is unfair that <Col N="364" /> such fear should be instilled in the tenants of those houses.</P>
    <P>The report, which will be available within a few days, has been prepared following a study carried out by the IIRS and other leading experts, probably the best experts available to us in the country.  This report will be examined first by the corporation and the city manager then will be making recommendations on the matter to the corporation.</P>
    <P>On a point of information in regard to an irrelevant matter mentioned by Deputy Browne I must state that there is no evidence whatsoever that the recent fire in houses in Skerries was due to defective electrical wiring.  I am quite satisfied that the report, when submitted, will be carefully examined by the corporation, the necessary recommendations implemented and, with cooperation all round, there will be no undue hardship on anybody.  I am particularly interested in this matter at Finglas South.  I shall study this report very carefully also.  As was stated in reply to the Parliamentary Questions tabled originally, the reports will be made available to everyone concerned.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 345, 522 and 523 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Borough of Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee at their meeting of 26 October 1978 made certain proposals in relation to the matters raised in the Questions. These proposals were received in my Department this morning and will be considered urgently.</P>
      <P>As regards clerical and administrative assistance, I have recently sanctioned the following additional staffing for Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee: one Senior Clerk, one Clerical Officer, three Clerk typists.  It is a matter for the committee to deploy its staffing resources to best advantage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the permanent status of the Art Department, I would refer Deputies to the reply which I made to a Parliamentary Question, No. 173, on this issue on 20 June 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> I may add that on 11 May last, I received a deputation of parents and students of the Dún Laoghaire School of Art for a discussion of certain problems affecting the operation of the school.  I desire to state that since the date of that meeting, the following action has been taken: (a) the NCEA have agreed to the continuance of <i>ad hoc</i> validation facilities for the courses for a further three years; (b) a sum of £60,739, which is, in fact, more than that originally sought by the committee, has been sanctioned for expenditure on art materials in 1978; (c) a supernumerary grade A post of responsibility has been allocated to the art department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1970, as amended, and the Appropriation Act, 1965, as amended, are the statutory basis for contracting and paying interest on the 9 per cent Algemene Bank Nederland Loan, which was negotiated in 1974.  Section 54 of the Finance Act, 1970, as amended by section 6 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1970 and section 49 of the Finance Act, 1978 empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow money for the Exchequer on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit.  Under section 4 of the Appropriation Act, 1965 as amended by section 2 of the Appropriation Act, 1969 the Minister for Finance may, for the purpose of any borrowing authorised by any Act passed either before or after the 1965 Act, borrow in a currency other than the currency of the State.</P>
      <P>As the 1970 Act cited above confers general borrowing powers on the Minister for Finance, Dáil approval is not required for any specific loan.</P>

      <P>In our speeches in the Dáil on the motion on the proposed European Monetary System, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and I explained&mdash;volume 308, columns 425-426 and 1045-1047&mdash;that the paper on resource transfers submitted by the Irish members of the Economic Policy Committee concluded that, in order to support our participation in the system, Ireland would need substantial additional transfers from the Community, by way of grants.  For this purpose, the paper proposed a figure of £650 million spread over a five-year period.  I emphasised that this figure is confined to the additional transfers in the immediate and narrow context of entry to the system&mdash;it would be over and above the transfers which we receive through the existing Community grant and loan instruments.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 472 and 473 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission of the European Communities has to date submitted to the Council proposals for two regulations <Col N="217" /> related to the proposed system. The first, entitled a proposal for a regulation establishing a European Monetary System, would empower the European Monetary Co-operation Fund to receive monetary reserves from the member states and to issue European Currency Units against such reserves. The second regulation is a proposal to change the value of the unit of account used by the fund.</P>
    <P>Both proposals have been sent to the European Parliament and to the Economic and Social Committee.  They will shortly be published in the <i>Journal Officiel.</i>  Further Community legislation may be necessary.  This will be clarified when details of the system have been settled.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, the outline scheme for the new system as put forward at the Bremen European Council has already been laid before the House as part of the conclusions of that Council.  No other formal proposals have been received.  Extensive discussions have, of course, been taking place in the expert committees and the Council of Ministers.  I made a comprehensive progress report on these in my statement to the House on 17 October.</P>

      <P>In my speech in the Dáil on 17 October on <Col N="218" /> the motion on the proposed European Monetary System, I outlined&mdash;in volume 308 column 425&mdash;the position concerning the papers submitted by the Irish members of the Community's Economic Policy Committee which is undertaking the &ldquo;concurrent studies&rdquo; of the action needed to be taken to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous member countries in the context of the proposed system.  As the proceedings of the Committee are confidential, it would not be appropriate for me to give the text of papers submitted to it.  However, I would draw the Deputies' attention to the fact that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development outlined the general thinking behind our paper on resource transfers in his speech on the same motion on 24 October&mdash;in volume 308, columns 1045-1047.</P>

      <P>The amount of Exchequer expenditure provided in the 1978 budget for the removal of the special conditions which applied to single women and widows for entitlement to unemployment assistance was £1.6 million in 1978.  This was in relation to an expected increase of 14,000 in the number of recipients. The number applying so far has been less than expected and it is now estimated that expenditure this year will not exceed £310,000.  Data is not available on the amount expended to date.</P>

      <P>A State grant of 75 per cent of cost has been sanctioned towards the cost of a major port development scheme at Greencastle.  The Donegal County Council have agreed to contribute the balance of 25 per cent of the cost.  The scheme includes the extension of the existing pier and construction of a new pier to provide additional berthage accommodation, deepening of the existing berthage area, reclamation of an area of 8,250 square yards and the provision of an auction hall and other ancillary facilities.</P>
      <P>Site investigations are under way. When these are completed the plans and specifications will be drawn up and tenders sought.  I am advised that, in view of the probable time it will take to complete the preliminaries including the seeking and placing of tenders, it is unlikely that actual work on the development scheme will commence before 1980.</P>

      <P>Proposals relating to agricultural education centres are included in the programme of additional structural measures for the development of agriculture in the West of Ireland which I have submitted to the EEC Commission. This programme was presented in the context of proposals which the Commission are to make for the improvement of farming conditions in the west.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Bruton</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture the implications of the proposed European Monetary System for the common <Col N="237" /> agricultural policy, with particular references to, (a) the calculation of monetary compensation amounts; (b) the Green Pound system; (c) Irish exports of commodities not covered by MCAs; and (d) the size of the Community budget for agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my statement in the House on 19 October in which I dealt at some length with the implications of EMS for the common agricultural policy in general and Irish agriculture in particular.  In brief my conclusion was that, apart from the possibility of greater MCA stability and certain technical changes in the way in which MCAs are calculated, the new system would not involve any major changes for the common agricultural policy.  I cannot be more specific at this stage about the possible changes in MCA calculations as the technicalities of the new monetary system have not yet been worked out in detail.  If, however, we participate in a &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; type arrangement, the Irish MCA should <Col N="238" /> be calculated on a basis similar to that used for the present snake currencies. The new system should not involve changes in the arrangements under which common prices are converted into national currencies by the use of green rates.  Likewise, the level of Community expenditure on agriculture should not be affected except to the extent that greater monetary stability might in the longer term reduce total Community expenditure on MCAs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 516 and 517 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received representations on the matters mentioned.  It appears that some members of the Garda Síochána were under the impression that, because the <Col N="253" /> law does not give a power of arrest without warrant where a breach of a barring order is suspected, the Garda Síochána could not involve themselves unless there were aggravating circumstances such as a breach of the peace. This is not so and accordingly an instruction was issued by the Commissioner on 23 August last drawing the attention of all members of the force to the fact that breach of a barring order is a criminal offence for which a fine of up to £200 or imprisonment for up to six months, or both, may be imposed. Although an aggrieved spouse is of course entitled to institute proceedings in respect of this offence, the instruction makes it clear that the Garda also can do so and that any complaint of a breach of a barring order should be attended to accordingly.</P>
    <P>The instruction also draws attention to the fact that, if a breach of a barring order is accompanied by a breach of the peace, there may be grounds for arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>This instruction is expected to lead to a significant improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>As regards the three-month limit on the duration of a barring order, this is closely linked to the fact that the District Court is a court of local and limited jurisdiction with summary procedures. The jurisdiction to exclude a spouse from the family home even for three months would be regarded by some people as a substantial jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the matter is being further reviewed and it so happens that a wider question of the jurisdiction of the various courts will be under consideration very shortly.  Accordingly if, on further examination, an increase in the District Court's jurisdiction in relation to barring orders seems justified, I expect that an opportunity to make the change will present itself in the fairly near future though, for the reason I have stated, care will be needed in dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department sanctioned a grant in October 1978 for the provision of a fabricast classroom at Cushenstown, County Meath, instead of a standard wooden type of prefab classroom.  A grant was sanctioned in May 1978 towards the cost of providing a used prefab at Clonalvey national school, County Meath.</P>
      <P>Prefabricated classrooms are in use at the following 25 schools: Skryne, Trim Boys', Maio, Nobber, St. Ultan's Special School, Clonalvey, Carnisle, Cannistown, Carnaross, Kentstown, Athboy, Kilcloon, Rathbeggan, Kiltale, Duleek, Batterstown, Rathfeigh, Boyerstown, Slane, Stamullen, Lismullen, Donacarney, Clonmahon Drangan, Gortloney, Whitecross.</P>
      <P>There are proposals to replace the prefabs in the case of 23 of the above schools by new schools or extension schemes.  There are no proposals to replace the prefabs at the remaining two schools, Stamullen and Lismullen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to records in my Department the following 23 schools in County Meath with accommodation in three classrooms and over have no general purposes rooms: Baconstown, Killyon, Kilbeg, Gortloney, Cannistown, Rathkenny, Longwood, Carnaross, Moynalty, Meath Hill, Culmullen, Robinstown, Yellow Furze, Dunshaughlin, Batterstown, Heronstown, Stamullen, Garadice, Lismullen, <Col N="257" /> Carlanstown, Moynalvey, Bellewstown, Mulhussey.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 511 of 17 October 1978. The question of the provision of a sports hall for Cabinteely community school may be considered only in the general context of the provision of sports halls in second level schools.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if, in view of the rapid rise in population in the Ballygunner/Blenheim/Williamstown area of County Waterford, he is aware of the need to provide extensive new educational facilities, both at the primary and post-primary level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department are aware that the Ballygunner/Blenheim/Williamstown area of County Waterford is developing and that additional national school facilities will be required there in the future.  The form this accommodation will eventually take, that is to say whether the existing school at Ballygunner can be satisfactorily extended or whether a completely new school should be provided, will depend, however, on the size of the housing development which will be undertaken.  It would be premature to make any forecast at this stage.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the existing post-primary schools in Waterford will be able to cater for the needs of the area during the next few years.  Further accommodation will be provided as required.</P>

    <P>My Department participate in the work of the EEC bodies dealing with environmental research and, in particular, of the EEC Environmental Research Management Committee which decides on the allocation of contracts under this programme on the basis of projects submitted to it by the member states.  My Department are assisted in this work by the National Board for Science and Technology which in turn is advised by a broad spectrum of interests in this country.  The monitoring of the execution of the Irish research work is carried out by the NBST.</P>
    <P>The EEC Environmental Research Programme is complementary to the EEC Environment Action Programme which is serviced by the Minister for the Environment.  It follows that there is close consultation between my Department and his Department in relation to the EEC Environmental Research Programme.</P>
