      <P>I move: That the Dáil be adjourned on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the telecommunications dispute.</P>
      <P>I would draw your attention to the fact that the very first precedent for the granting of permission for such an adjournment was on 11 September 1922 in relation to a Post Office strike, which seems highly relevant to what we are now proposing to discuss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that there has not been discussion; there has been a statement on which you curtailed discussion on the grounds that there should not be discussion on a statement in reply to a Private Notice Question.  We have not had any opportunity to discuss it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In those circumstances I would ask that Standing Orders be suspended upon motion made without notice as this is a case of urgent necessity.  It cannot be contended that Standing Orders should not be suspended because the matter has been discussed.  I presume that argument will not be attempted, otherwise the whole purpose of suspending Standing Orders would be vitiated.</P>

      <P>Standing Order No. 139 (2) states:</P>
      <P>Provided that in cases of urgent necessity, of which the Ceann Comhairle shall be the judge, any Standing Order or Orders may be suspended upon motion made without notice.  If such motion be opposed the Ceann Comhairle shall permit an explanatory statement from the member who moves it and a statement from a member who opposes it before he puts the question thereon.</P>
      <P>It is under Standing Order No. 139 (2) that I am moving this.</P>

      <P>Standing Order No. 139 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended or modified in effect for the day's sitting, and for a particular purpose, upon motion made after notice.</P>
      <P>That means four days.  Standing Order No. 139 (2) would be subject to the same ruling that I have already made.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges have discussed this and defined what &ldquo;urgent necessity&rdquo; is.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would resume his seat, I was about to discuss a matter which came before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the definition as laid down in their report on the reform of Dáil procedure.  It is defined as a matter likely to develop significantly before the Dáil will in practice have the opportunity of discussing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I wish to make a submission on a point of order.  My submission is that the whole question relates to whether this is a matter of urgent public necessity.  I cannot think of anything more urgent than the fact that the entire business of the country is being brought to a halt and this process is accelerating.  If the Chair seriously considered the matter he could not possibly rule as he has ruled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the first case where this procedure was employed in 1922, it was the Minister for Home Affairs, Kevin O'Higgins, who felt that the matter should be discussed and who, in fact, supported the proposal to suspend Standing Orders and seconded the motion repudiating the statement issued by himself in order to secure discussion.  In those days Governments believed that matters should be discussed in the Dáil.  I would ask the Taoiseach whether he would be willing to follow the example given by the Minister for Home Affairs in relation to the Post Office strike of that day and to second my proposal so that we can move on to discuss this matter of urgent necessity because if the House agrees I presume it can be discussed.</P>

      <P>I want to say in relation to the standing order which <Col N="509" /> Deputy FitzGerald has quoted, which is the only one in relation to hundreds of other cases supporting my ruling now which may be quoted, that the ruling which he quoted is one where the Minister agreed and acquiesced with the Opposition.

      <P>In view of the fact that since this matter was last discussed the situation has deteriorated very considerably and of the consequences to business and commerce in the country and also because several hundred men are now involved, being either locked out or on strike, would the Taoiseach, in the interests of all concerned, give favourable consideration to giving Government time to allow the House to discuss this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been established practice that discussing strikes of this nature or of any other <Col N="510" /> nature in the House tends to confuse the issue and in fact never leads to a solution.

    <P>This amendment is consequential on an amendment made in the Seanad. Deputies will see that in section 29 a later amendment deletes subsection (3).

It is to remove the need for a linguistic ability test in the case of people seeking temporary registration.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the amendment, I want to take the opportunity of referring to something to <Col N="515" /> which I did not have a full opportunity of referring for a particular reason when the Bill was going through the House originally on Report Stage. The House will recall that an entire new chapter was introduced at a very late stage and in a very hasty way and that the main function of it was to set up this board.  It was introduced on Report Stage and consequently the chapter and the amendments were all discussed and adopted in less than three minutes from the commencement of Report Stage.  As a result we were not given an opportunity of discussing it.  I said at the time that I felt it was not fair at that late stage to introduce as important a new chapter as this without adequate consultation with the bodies concerned and without allowing Members of the House who in the normal way would have studied the contents of the Bill to give consideration to it.  The fact that this subsection has to be deleted now&mdash;basically I believe we are in agreement now; the entire subsection is wrong in concept&mdash; is proof that it is a dangerous thing to introduce a chapter or as far-reaching an amendment as this on the Report Stage of a Bill at such short notice.  I hope the House will not endeavour to do this in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Contributions Act, 1971, established the principle that persons with entitlement to health services should contribute towards the cost of providing them.  It was then, and still remains, the intention that, without imposing undue hardship, reasonable contributions should be made towards the cost of the health services by those eligible for them.  All medical card holders are exempted from paying the contributions.  It was made clear when the 1971 legislation was being introduced that the rates of contribution <Col N="518" /> then proposed, 15p per week or £7 per year, would have to be increased and that at some future date the flat-rate scheme of contributions should be replaced by an income-related scheme.  As Deputies are aware, the flat rates have in fact been increased at intervals since 1971.</P>
    <P>The sole purpose of the present Bill is to provide for an increase in the present rates of health contributions. As I announced recently, it is the Government's intention to replace the present flat-rate social welfare and health contributions by a fully pay-related scheme.</P>
    <P>I would hope to be in a position to formulate proposals based on a report from an inter-departmental working group set up to work out the details of the scheme for Government consideration at an early date.  However, I can say to the Deputies, at this stage, that the working group considered that the earliest possible date for the introduction of a pay-related scheme would be April 1979, and accordingly it will be necessary to continue the existing scheme of flat-rate health contributions for a further year.</P>
    <P>Contributions are at present payable at the rate of 39p weekly by employees and £18 annually by others.  The Bill now before the House provides for an increase in these rates to 50p weekly and £24 annually&mdash;these increases to take effect from 1 April 1978.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies indicates the object of the Bill, defines in some detail the categories of persons who are liable to pay health contributions and outlines the services to which they and their dependants are entitled.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; services has risen considerably in recent years.  Specific &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; services are hospital in-patient and specialist out-patient services, maternity and infant care services and the drugs and medicines subsidy scheme.  The extent of increases in the cost of hospital and <Col N="519" /> specialist services must be a matter for serious concern and it is a problem to which I will be devoting close attention.  There are many factors which influence costs however, such as the inflationary effects of pay and prices.  Other factors tend to be forgotten and I think it appropriate that I should mention some of them.  They include: the extra demands which have been arising due to increases in population; the need to improve the standard of institutional care for the aged, chronic sick and the handicapped and the provision of homes for the ambulant aged to replace substandard accommodation in county homes; the extra cost arising from advances in medical technology involving more sophisticated techniques and equipment, more specialised staff and greater use of intensive care units; the additional costs arising from increases in the number of accidents; the provision of improved care facilities for infants at risk; the cost of providing services for persons suffering from illnesses caused to some extent by excessive drinking and smoking; increases in the levels of hospital personnel so as to ensure that good standards of service will be available.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of limited eligibility services for 1978 is £265 million, all of which will be borne by the Exchequer.  The total yield expected from health contributions in 1978, based on the increased rates provided for in the Bill, is £16.624 million, which is about 6 per cent of the overall cost of providing &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; services.</P>
    <P>While dealing with the question of health contributions I would like to take this opportunity to clear up some misunderstanding which appears to exist in relation to eligibility for hospital services for non-manual employees. The position is that the present income limit of £3,000 was introduced with effect from 1 July 1976. Any insured person in non-manual employment whose remuneration was within that limit on that date and who was therefore eligible for hospital services, retains his eligibility at least until the beginning of 1979, irrespective <Col N="520" /> of any changes in his income in the meantime.  The fact that the £3,000 limit has not been increased does not, therefore, affect his entitlement to services at present and I want to make that clear.</P>
    <P>The present system for determining &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; is very complex and, indeed, contains many anomalies. However, the introduction of the new pay-related scheme which I referred to earlier should simplify the system considerably and make it far easier for everybody to understand.</P>
    <P>I trust that I have explained to the House some of the reasons for the increased rates of contributions proposed and I commend the Bill for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised the Minister for Health is introducing this measure.  This legislation has nothing to do with health; it is purely and simply a taxation measure.  It would have been more appropriate to have been introduced by the Minister for Finance and it would have been more honest had it been announced in the course of the budget debate.  Unfortunately there was no reference to this proposed increase during the budget speech made by the Minister for Finance when all the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; were being given out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you ask people what they thought of a budget they are inclined to say: &ldquo;I do not know how they are going to do it, but they will get the money out of us some way.&rdquo;  This is one of the ways they are going to get it and we might have anticipated when the budget was announced that, as sure as night follows day, this Bill would be introduced.  What we might not have anticipated was the size of the increase, the single largest annual percentage increase ever introduced since health contributions began in 1971. This is being introduced by a Government at a time when they are urging people to show moderation, to take steps to control inflation and urging workers, the type of people who will be asked to make this contribution, to accept a moderate wage increase while asking them to pay an increase of 28 per cent in their health <Col N="521" /> contributions, if they pay it by weekly instalments, or an increase of a whopping 33 per cent if they pay annually. Yet these people are being asked to take a wage increase of 8 per cent and to bring inflation down to single figures.  The Minister asked this House to acquiesce quietly to a proposed increase of 28 per cent in the health contribution stamp and 33 per cent for self-employed people and farmers who have eligibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be back there yet, do not worry about that.  I want to remind the Minister of those heady irresponsible days when he was in Opposition when he said whatever came into his mind and whatever he thought would benefit him in the headlines.</P>
      <P>On 24 March 1976 speaking on the Health Contributions Bill at columns 265-266 of the Official Report he said:</P>
      <P>It is, however, important in dealing with this legislation that we, on this side of the House, direct the attention of the public clearly to precisely what is involved and to explain the nature of these increased charges and the real purpose for which they are intended.</P>
      <P>The House and the general public should clearly understand that this increase in charges which the Minister now puts before the House will not go towards improving our health services in any way.</P>
      <P>Congratulations; neither will this Bill.</P>
      <P>The money which will be raised by this legislation and by these increases will not be used to provide any new services, to improve standards, to provide any extra facilities or to make improvements of any kind in our health services.</P>
      <P>Neither will this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither those people who will have to pay these contributions nor anybody else will benefit in the slightest degree in regard to the health services provided for them by this increase in contributions. This is not a health Bill; it is a <Col N="522" /> taxation measure.  As such, it should have been included in the budget package of taxes last January.  The extra amount these increases will bring in, £1.7 million, has already been taken fully into account in the budget arithmetic.  It is important that the House understand that.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that the House understands this and it is more important that the House understands that the fellow who said this almost two years ago now has the gall to come here with a similar measure, the only difference being that in this legislation the percentage increases are bigger than they were in the 1976 Bill which he so vehemently opposed.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The amount involved here has been taken credit for as part of the budget revenue.  It has already been fully absorbed in meeting the budgetary situation.  These moneys will not be available to improve in any way the health services for those who will be called upon to pay them.  In fact, this money will be handed over completely to the Exchequer as a budgetary measure.  As I said, this is a taxation measure.</P>
    <P>Even though the credit for this £1.7 million was taken in the budget, the Minister for Finance in introducing the budget did not mention this increase at all.</P>
    <P>At that time Deputy Haughey was apparently shocked by that.  He does not appear to be equally shocked at the failure of his colleague to mention this proposed increase in last month's budget.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It was not until the Book of Estimates came out and we saw there the figure for Appropriations-in-Aid of the Health Estimate, £10.2 million, that it was clear that this money which is now being sought by the Minister by way of this legislation, had already been fully credited in the budget arithmetic. That is the way this Government conduct their financial business. They resort to petty deceits.</P>
    <P>At least we published the Book of Estimates.  If that was not referred to in the budget, when the Book of <Col N="523" /> Estimates was published the Dáil and the public had an opportunity of ascertaining for themselves that an increase was imminent.  The present Minister did not even bother to publish the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>When I rose today I ought to have done no more than say that I would commend the House to columns X to Y of the debate on the Health Contributions Bill, 1976, because if the Minister genuinely believed what he said then, he would not be introducing this Bill today.  If the Minister had genuine concern for non-manual workers earning more than £3,000 a year and not covered in any way, and for whom the Minister shed so many bitter tears in 1976, he would have incorporated in this Bill the two amendments which he tabled to a similar measure in 1976.  Those amendments were ruled out of order because they would have involved a possible charge on public funds.  If the Minister had genuinely believed in those amendments and had wanted them included in that Bill in 1976, why did he not file away those amendments and say: &ldquo;When I become Minister for Health if I have to introduce another Bill of this kind, I will incorporate these amendments in that Bill?&rdquo;  There is no sign of them today.  Of course the situation has changed and Deputy Haughey is no longer spokesman for the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The increases here are quite considerable. In the case of those who pay weekly, the contributions are being increased from 39p to 50p, an increase of 28 per cent, the single largest annual increase since the Health Contributions Act was introduced in 1971.  The Minister should not be shaking his head.  He may come back with his vast economic experience and begin quoting at me, but I can work out simple percentages.  This is the single largest percentage increase since the first Bill was introduced in 1971.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The contributions were increased from 26p to 33p in 1975, an increase of less than 27 per cent. <Col N="524" /> There was an increase last year from 33p to 39p, which is 18 per cent, and that was bitterly opposed by the Minister at the time.  Incidentally, each of those increases was in years of high world inflation, when this country was bedevilled by inflationary trends which were outside our control.  Yet, when inflation has come down to 13 per cent and when the aspiration of the Government is to bring it down to single figures, when the Minister for Finance, the Minister for economic promises, has been exhorting the people to exercise moderation in their pay, the Minister for Health blandly turns around and tells the people they should bear an increase of more than 28 per cent.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy not agree that the increase in 1975 was from £7 to £12?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am talking about the increase in the rate of the weekly stamp.  That increase was 73 per cent, from 15p to 26p, but that was in a period of four years, from 1971 to 1975.  The increase was from £7 in 1971 to £12 in 1975.  The increase was from £12 in 1975 to £15 in 1976, an increase of 25 per cent; and from £15 to £18 in 1977, an increase of 20 per cent.  It is now proposed to bring it from £18 to £24, an increase of 33 per cent.  Congratulations to the Minister, who has broken the record once again.  This is the single largest percentage increase ever and it comes at a time when inflation is going down. The Minister's contribution will help inflation to go up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that point of view, all I can say is that whatever chance there was of having the wage agreement accepted and ratified, this sort of action does not help especially at a time when not only have this party been calling consistently for the inclusion of the non-manual worker earning more than £3,000 a year in the eligibility services&mdash;hospital in-patient treatment, specialist out-patient treatment and certain other services&mdash;but the ICTU have been calling vehemently and loudly for it, and the ITGWU, the single largest component in the congress, the union <Col N="525" /> who if the agreement is not ratified will be one of the main contributory factors to that, have been calling consistently on the Minister to include the non-manual workers earning in excess of £3,000 a year.  Does the Minister think that either body will be pleased with this information at a time when they are being asked to urge their members to agree to a wage increase of 8 per cent?  It will not be taken lightly by the social partners.  It is a retrograde thing, particularly in view of the Minister's commitments and his statements in Opposition.  After the promises made by the Minister and his aspirations to be remembered as an outstanding Minister for Health, all of us assumed there would be major changes this year in the range of people covered, in their income limits, and that there would not have been increases out of line with the projected rate of inflation and the terms of the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>This is especially upsetting when one realises that not one extra service will be provided for this money, not one extra person will be given hospital treatment or specialist out-patient treatment or maternity or infant care or assistance towards the drugs scheme. All that will happen is that those already in benefit will be asked to pay more than their fair share in view of the projected wage increases and the projected figures for inflation.</P>
    <P>In a vague sort of way the Minister referred to the difficulties of defining who is and is not a manual worker.  I do not accept the suggestions being made that legislation to achieve this is so complex that it would be impossible to prepare a Bill to define who is and who is not a manual worker.  For that reason you get all those anomalies which define a bus driver as a manual worker but the conductor as non-manual, or the other way around.  That sort of anomaly could be resolved very quickly.  It is not fair and it is not acceptable that the Minister should say that the people who have been studying it found it baffling, that we had called in experts from England and that it baffled them too.  All the Minister has to do is to draw up a simple piece of legislation defining <Col N="526" /> afresh who is a manual worker and who is a non-manual worker and saying that that supercedes all existing definitions.  That would solve the problem straight away.</P>
    <P>For a short time the Minister was a member of a local authority and he knows that the simplest way to clear up difficulties about title to land is to make a CPO-that clears the board and gives a fresh title to the land, clearing up all the troubles and the controversies of the years.  The same thing can apply in the case of manual and non-manual workers.  Then, the troubles being faced by non-manual workers who have been earning more than £3,000 per annum and who have had to pay for all the health services will be abated.</P>
    <P>In 1976 when the Minister was in Opposition he suggested that it was unconstitutional to distinguish between a manual and a non-manual worker and he said that the amendments he was entering at that time would have the effect of preventing the Minister of the day from distinguishing between a manual and a non-manual worker, thus forcing him to extend the health cover to all persons irrespective of their occupation up to whatever income limit obtained at the time.  The amendments were ruled out of order on the grounds that they might constitute a charge on the Exchequer and, consequently, could be introduced only by the Minister.  The person who introduced the amendments is now the Minister.</P>
    <P>Today he told us something slightly different from what he has been telling us up to now.  He said the working group considered that the earliest possible date for the introduction of a pay-related scheme would be April 1979.  Up to this we were promised categorically that the scheme would be introduced in April 1979.  When the Minister was urged to remove the anomaly in relation to the non-manual worker he said it would go in April 1979 in any event and that very few people were affected.  He told us it was not worth changing until April 1979.  I believe it is worth changing and there is now serious doubt as a result of the Minister's speech today as to whether <Col N="527" /> the scheme will come into operation on the date mentioned.</P>
    <P>He should state clearly whether he will give the House and the public an assurance that the scheme will come into operation at the beginning of April next year.  Otherwise people will not know where they stand.  It is only fair that they should be given a date towards which they can work.  The situation is particularly unfair on the group who are outside insurance cover, the non-manual workers earning more than £3,000 per year.  In reply to questions I raised sometime ago the Minister refused point-blank to consider including them for the interim because he said they would be entitled to make contributions from April 1979.  Now he tells us that perhaps they will be able to make contributions from that time.  It is only fair that the people and this House should have a clear indication as to whether eligibility will extend from that date.</P>
    <P>When reading debates of previous years I noticed that some of the Minister's colleagues took the opportunity when discussing this matter of turning it virtually into an Estimates debate on the Department.  I do not propose to do that but I assume the Minister will indicate that we will have an opportunity in the near future of discussing the Estimates for the Department of Health.  On that assumption I do not think it right to delay the House in extending the debate on this Bill into a general Estimates debate.  This is not really a health Bill but is a taxation measure.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will deal with the following points.  First, why was this increase not announced in the budget?  Secondly, why is this the single largest annual increase imposed since the Health Contributions Act was introduced in 1971?  Thirdly, even at this late stage why has the Minister not considered including the non-manual worker who earns in excess of £3,000 a year and who is now deprived of eligibility for any of these services?  Finally, and perhaps most tellingly of all, why has the Minister not included the two amendments he <Col N="528" /> introduced in 1976?  They would have debarred the Minister of the day from distinguishing between manual and non-manual workers.  Why has he not reintroduced those amendments which he was precluded from discussing as an Opposition spokesman but which he would be entitled to enter as Minister? Why did he not do this if he genuinely believed in them?  Why does he not introduce a simple measure defining what is and what is not a manual worker, thus clearing up the grey area that exists?  This would bring much relief to many people who are bedevilled at the moment as to whether they qualify.  It would also take considerable worry from the officials of the Department of Health and officials in the health services. They have a dreadful task in trying to define whether a person is eligible.</P>
    <P>This is simply a taxation measure and in view of the fact that it was not introduced or referred to in the course of the budget speech it cannot be accepted by us in Opposition.  I conclude by repeating the words of the Minister on 24 March 1976 when he said: &ldquo;That is the way this Government conduct their financial business. They resort to petty deceit.&rdquo;  By their own words you shall know them.</P>

      <P>The Minister is following in the footsteps of his predecessors in bringing in this legislation as a separate measure since the original Bill was introduced in October 1971. If I remember rightly it was introduced as a separate measure on each occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister's predecessor brought it in as a separate item because I remember speaking on the matter.  It may have happened in 1975-I am not quite sure.  However, I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for the considerable increase of 30 per cent&mdash;20 per cent in the case of those who pay weekly and 30 per cent for those who pay yearly.  There are two aspects that must be mentioned.  Yes, <Col N="529" /> it gives entitlements but the entitlements are on paper.  At the moment there are enormously long waiting lists for out-patient services.  Those who are entitled to receive such services in the hospitals are not able to avail of them.  I wonder if we are taking money from them under false pretences?  I can say without fear of contradiction that there are waiting lists of six months for some essential services.  If we are talking about providing good health services for our people we should not tolerate a situation where people have to wait for six months even for normal diagnostic out-patient services.  It is a terrible indictment of our health services that such a situation exists.</P>
    <P>Appointments for such simple procedures as X-rays can take months to arrange and when there is a question of malignancy there could be a rampant spread of cancer before the patient even has the X-ray.  This situation cannot be glossed over lightly.  In the Eye and Ear Hospital there are waiting lists of more than six months for people who need glasses and for old people who have had cataracts and for whom glasses have been prescribed. They have to wait for a year in many cases.  This is an inhuman approach towards people who deserve the minimum for which they are paying, namely, an appointment to have glasses.  I tried unsuccessfully to get an appointment last October for a man.  It could only be arranged for next May, some eight months after making the appointment.  I would ask the Minister to see if his Department could investigate the situation.  Perhaps they could monitor the cases to see how the consultants could be assisted by registrars.  If back-up services were available to consultants the backlog could be cleared.  It is causing considerable hardship and jeopardising the health of our community.  In theory they are getting a service but not in practice.  The same applies to hospital beds.  This entitles people to free hospitalisation, but the number of people not able to get beds who should be getting them demands immediate investigation.  There is not enough co-operation from the voluntary hospitals with the Medico-Social <Col N="530" /> Research Board in the in-patient inquiry scheme.  These voluntary hospitals are paid out of public funds and they should be prepared to co-operate to provide this service and enable the Medico-Social Research Board to give information to the Minister as to the average length of stay for a patient in hospital.  This is the kind of information which the Minister and his Department need so that they can evaluate the situation, and this demands immediate attention.</P>
    <P>We will have to examine seriously the question of X-ray departments and laboratories in our hospitals working on a shift basis so that we can eliminate the backlog in different diagnostic services.  If a patient is admitted on a Friday there is terrible expense, and it is an indictment of our system that investigation into his case cannot commence until the following Monday or Tuesday.  I have been hammering at this for many years but all my pleas have been in vain and ignored.  We pay a lot of money for our X-ray equipment and from the way it is being used at the moment it becomes obsolete long before its true use expires. It is wrong that equipment costing so much should be available only from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m.  We must talk seriously with those involved in this work with a view to introducing shift work to make this service available on a 24-hour basis.  This would eliminate waiting lists for these services and make life much easier for the Minister and his Department.  He could then say that he is getting proper value for the money, and those who pay health contributions would be getting the service to which they are entitled.  I am not blaming the Minister for the situation which he has inherited, but I ask him to look at this aspect of it.  A lot could be achieved because there is a limit to what you can put into health and better use of the services would help enormously.</P>
    <P>I would like to consider who is entitled to the services.  We have got to define who is a manual worker. This is the biggest problem that has arisen since the question of eligibility for hospitalisation arose.  There is a serious number of anomalies in our <Col N="531" /> present free hospitalisation scheme and eligibility for it, and we are not going to solve the problem simply by remedying one anomaly after the other.  There are people who are barely outside the £3,000 limit and therefore are denied free hospitalisation, and this is causing severe hardship.  If the Minister were to endeavour merely to rectify the amomalies that exist at the moment he would be bogged down in the work of this Department and he would never be able to formulate policy.  As he remedied or rectified one anomaly another would be created.  Therefore, the answer is not in the correction of anomalies but to have a proper health service along the lines of a pay-related health contribution scheme which the Minister has mentioned, but we can have it only in the context of bringing the extra 15 per cent into free hospitalisation. I have considered this from every angle and I find that is the only answer.  If the Minister approaches it in any other way he is going to create problems for himself.  He will have to look at this aspect, however reluctantly and make such a scheme available.  A lot of people are suffering hardship in the existing situation, and voluntary health insurance is not the answer.</P>
    <P>I once said that the 15 per centthe wealthy-could provide for themselves. In theory that is so but in practice there are many people who are not manual workers within the limited definition of that term.  Is a foreman a manual worker?  Is a technician a manual worker?  I met a group of technicians with the Eastern Health Board who had come in as manual workers and paid social welfare contributions, and it was decided recently that they were not manual workers within the meaning of this term.  I have a question down to the Minister asking him to define manual workers.  Bus drivers are manual workers.  Are bus conductors?  Are shop assistants manual workers?  Some say they are not.  Butchers are manual workers. Railway station ticket checkers are manual workers, but those doing a similar job in a cinema may not be. The confusion and the problems <Col N="532" /> created here are enormous and we may spend our time in the next few years defining what a manual worker is.  If a technician gets promotion to senior technician does he become a manual worker?  This problem has arisen over and over again.  We could end up not helping our health services or furthering the cause of the medical services because we would be bogged down in trying to define this term.  The Minister would have to make a swift and definite decision on this and say that this Department would be wasting time, effort and money in trying to define who is not a manual worker.</P>
    <P>The answer is to provide free hospitalisation for all.  If the Minister were to make a decision on this and have consultations with the medical profession on the basis of working out a method of payment to the consultants in such a free hospitalisation scheme that would be satisfactory to them, I believe he would get full co-operation. The medical profession are not there to thwart the Minister, and one of his headaches would be over.  He has inherited something that is going to cause him a lot of headaches and I do not envy him his problems at the moment.  I would like to see him make a decision fast, because many people are suffering severe hardship and getting mounting bills from hospitals which are causing a lot of problems for them.  People who were eligible a couple of years ago for free hospitalisation find now that they have to pay bills amounting to £300, £400 or £500. I heard the other day of a £320 bill for maternity.  That is a lot of money to pay for hospitalisation and for the obstetrician's attendance.  Many people in the civil service at a certain level are not able to pay their hospitalisation costs.  This happens in the public service and in the various trades where people are not classified as manual workers.  I ask the Minister earnestly to make a decision on this class and to introduce a pay-related scheme.  I believe everyone will be willing to co-operate in this and we would get a proper service.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at the turning of the sod at Beaumont.  I did not like his quotation from Thomas More of the <Col N="533" /> 16th century as it was not quite apt. Our aim is to keep people out of hospitals.  Thomas More said that the hospital is a place to be when you are ill.  I would not quite agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>The Minister did not convey that in his speech.  I remember a consultant saying to me that he wanted to take a patient of mine in for a rest in hospital until he checked his blood pressure.  It is an expensive rest at £200 a week.  It is a lot to pay for a bed in a hospital.  We could easily give him a rest in a hotel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I saw that, but I thought the quotation was not apt.  It was apt in Thomas More's time but at today's high cost I think not.  It was a good quotation to keep.  I was pleased with it.  I would say that there will not be over-utilisation of beds.  We have this Health Education Bureau, and with a real effort we will get people educated in the proper use of the health service.  We have to educate doctors too.  If we can get out-patient services streamlined so that there is a proper use made of X-ray equipment and laboratories then there will be no need to keep people in hospital or, if they have to be detained, no need to keep them too long.  People should be able to attend at five o'clock in the evening for investigation and it should be possible to discharge them the following day at noon.  I have known that to be done.</P>
      <P>Now, I do not want to make any distinction between town and country, but farmers are not paying their contributions. The last time I asked a question about this I was astonished at the reply.  Has the Minister up-to-date figures now?  The urban worker pays weekly because the contribution is deducted at source.  The amount owed by the farming community was quite considerable two years ago.  Has there been an improvement in its collection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that requires examination is the drug subsidy.  The idea is excellent in theory but the practice is <Col N="534" /> not always satisfactory because there can be quite a lapse of time between the time a claim is made and the health board makes a refund.  I do not think officials are operating the scheme in the way we intended it should be operated.  Over a certain amount a refund will be made.  That is not quite correct.  If a person gets a prescription on the 18th or 20th of a month he will not get a full refund because the health board argue that that must carry into the following month.  It is a small point but it causes considerable hardship.  Rigid decisions like this are unfair.  Would the Minister have a look at this?  Hardship can be caused where people have actually to borrow money to pay for drugs.  The health board should be a little more flexible.</P>
    <P>Will the working party go into the anomalies and make a decision on them?  Will there be a common contract for doctors to replace the pool system?  Will it be a common contract under the present scheme of 85 per cent eligibility or will it be a common contract negotiated with the doctors for a free hospitalisation scheme?  Will we have this pay-related scheme in the context of 85 per cent or 100 per cent eligibility?  I would appreciate it if the Minister would give us some information about this.</P>
    <P>If we ask questions about the disbursement of public funds in regard to, say, a site-we vote the moneysare we entitled to get answers?  I asked a question about the Beaumont site&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill. The health contribution scheme was introduced in 1971.  I believe those who subscribe to limited eligibility get very good value.  There are problems certainly in relation to delays, waiting lists and so on but, by and large, very good value is given in our hospitals. Patients get very good value through both the in-patient and out-patient services.  It is a comprehensive service. They get free maternity and infant care service outside the hospital and they get a subsidy for drugs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland mentioned that the subscription is larger now.  On 1 October 1974 it was £7.  In 1975 it was £12, which is over a 70 per cent increase, and in that year there was an increase from 1 January 1975 of £3.75.</P>
      <P>One of the problems that arise is in relation to collection.  Not all farmers have subscribed to the limited eligibility fund.  In my own area on 30 September 1977 only 35 per cent had subscribed and there was over £90,000 outstanding.  In many cases these people wait until they have to go into hospital and then, as every public representative knows, they make representations to get into the limited eligibility scheme.  Sometimes they do not get in and then they are faced with a very large bill.  More encouragement should be given to induce people to join the scheme.  It is a scheme which gives very good value.</P>
      <P>Another delay occurs in relation to money collected by the Revenue Commissioners. Sometimes patients have to go into hospital while they are actually awaiting a reply from the Revenue Commissioners and they feel they are not getting good value.  Those who are in the VHI and also entitled to limited eligibility feel they should not have to subscribe to limited eligibility because they are not getting good value.  They are wrong in this because they actually get very good value.  They have a lower rate of premium to pay to the VHI.  They also have the advantage of the maternity scheme outside of hospital and the advantage of out-patient services and they have the benefit of the drug subsidy scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem arises in relation <Col N="536" /> to the contribution year.  It is different from the date of payment and this can cause a problem.  For instance, those who paid in October last will be eligible for a further payment from 1 April.  Perhaps it might be possible to bring the date of the payment of the subscription and the commencement of the subscription year into line.</P>
    <P>With regard to the manual and non-manual worker this is something the Minister inherited from his predecessor who was unable to find a solution.  I have no doubt the present Minister will find a solution.  In the case of those with over £3,000 a year CEOs have discretion and, if there is hardship, these people can be brought into limited eligibility.  I do not think anybody is suffering on that account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>What concerns me most on this Bill is the very steep increase in the charge on people least able to afford it.  They are now being asked to pay £26 a year.  When it is a question of health it is disgraceful to impose this very severe charge on the less well-off in our society.  We hear a lot of pious talk about concern for health.  Surely if our concern for health is so great this charge could have been foregone and sought elsewhere, or is this the first move towards having budgetary adjustments every other week going through this House? That might appear to be the way moneys will be raised in order to pay for the abolition of charges on other services.  I believe the health of this nation is more important.  To come into this House seeking additional moneys on that account when car tax has been withdrawn&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, please do not get on to budgetary matters.  This is a very limited Bill and car tax certainly does not arise on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a comparison.  It is a question of raising an additional £3 million.  Why was it not raised in other ways?  That is what I am questioning.  This additional charge should not have been imposed. It illustrates the attitude of the Government towards the less well off in our <Col N="537" /> society.  There is nothing in this Bill for them except that they must pay for the people who have received benefits under the budget.  That is the point I am making.</P>
      <P>Another important point is that people who thought they were covered under the Health Acts are being penalised when they go to hospital because of this anomalous categorisation of manual and non-manual workers.  I would ask the Minister to investigate this serious anomaly.  People who genuinely thought they were covered when they go into hospital and find out that they are not could, with hospital charges at their present levels, be beggared in a short period of time.  The question arises of who determines whether a man is to be categorised as a manual or non-manual worker.  I know of an instance in which an employer-not prompted by the fact that an employee was being levied with a charge-had him categorised as a manual worker but the relevant health board said: no, he is a non-manual worker and consequently must pay.</P>
      <P>This situation must be examined immediately.  People cannot wait until April 1979 for some new scheme to bear the burden.  It must be introduced without delay even if it entails introducing a Supplementary Estimate to meet any additional charge that may be incurred.  It behoves the Minister to introduce this because genuine hardship is being inflicted, nobody can deny that.  I know of cases, as does every other Deputy in this House. There is the example of people who invested their money at a very high interest rate in a particular bank, and when it fell by the wayside the tab was picked up for them by the Government. There is no comparison between the two situations; a person's health is far more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must examine this situation. If he does not, he will not be living up to the image he projects of being concerned about the health of the nation.  I have no doubt but that he is so concerned.  However, if he is, he must accept responsibility in this matter.  It is ridiculous to categorise people as manual and non-manual workers.  It is wrong and is dividing <Col N="538" /> people.  Deputy O'Connell posed the question: is a barman a manual or non-manual worker?  Take another example.  Is the man who was promoted last week from the shop floor to be a foreman to be regarded as a manual or non-manual worker?  I think he remains manual, but how will he be regarded by the relevant authorities? As far as I can ascertain it is done on a cheese-paring basis, and a matter such as health should not be handled in that way.  Rather it should be done with full consideration for the people in question, ensuring that they have the best services available to them and will not be denied them because they are not covered, not through any fault of their own but because they were under the impression they were covered.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the overall increases involved in hospitalisation.  I suppose this accounts for individual charges constantly increasing.  I question whether we are getting value.  We hear a lot of talk about major hospital development.  As far as I can foresee, henceforth the bigger the hospital the bigger will be the bill per week per patient.  Therefore one is tempted to ask: why should we rationalise?  It does not make economic sense.  Perhaps it makes medical sense, but I doubt it.  This will place a large burden on the State, on health charges generally.  Existing structures will be closed down.  In my constituency, unfortunately, it will mean the closure of a number of hospitals which at present serve a deprived community.  The bill is ever increasing.  When it rises it is felt we can impose an extra 10p or 20p on the unfortunate people to be burdened with this payment.  That is the easy way out.</P>
    <P>We must examine the whole question of health expenditure.  What is the grand total taking into account VHI, a person's contributions and those of the State and ask ourselves are we getting value for money.  I do not think we are. I could not quantify it but I believe that what we are paying for health is astronomical and is not giving a fair return.  During this year we should ensure that we are getting the best value for the money being spent.  We <Col N="539" /> owe it to the taxpayers to ensure that their money is being spent to give the best possible services.  I doubt very much that the Government are concerned with that.  It is so much easier to come in here with a Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill and levy people. That will not solve the problem.  We should be looking at our costings, not with a view to downgrading services, but a view to ensuring that money spent is well spent.  This is a very important aspect and I would ask the Minister to look at it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of medical cards, there may be abuses and we may be losing money, I do not know.  We should look at the thresholds and at people with long-term illnesses.  Families in which there are chronic illnesses, such as children with asthma, should be covered under the medical card.  In the long-term this might save hospitalisation and consequently might save the additional expenditure we are looking for under the Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill.  We should examine all aspects of health expenditure, how the money is to be raised and how it is to be spent.</P>
    <P>I strongly oppose this measure brought here today because it introduces a further levy on the people who can least afford it.  The present trend of the Government seems to be that for some reason or other they penalise the people who cannot pay.  Maybe they have not as many votes as the people who can afford to pay.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this measure and to consult with the Minister for Finance in whose budget there was no hint that there would be an increase in this health contribution. Why did the Minister for Finance not take responsibility for it in his budget speech?  Why did he not make this announcement?  Was that not the popular thing to do in the window-dressing effort the Minister was trying to put over?  The Minister for Health is doing the dirty work for the Minister for Finance in coming in here looking for money.  That is the subtlety of this package that the Government are trying to put over.  They put forward a <Col N="540" /> glossy package and now we are paying in other ways.  The subsidies are coming off this, that and the other and this is another hidden charge that people will have to pay.  The people were not informed in the manifesto that they would have to pay additional money for health services.  They were only told about the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; they would get.  Let us be honest, and let us stop the political gimmickry; let us tell the people exactly where the money must be raised to pay for the removal of the car tax and to make life easier for the people who have it easy already.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in this Bill.  I have voiced my criticism against this savage increase on the less well off in our society.  I am surprised that the Minister for Health should come in here to try to sell this to us.  It has to be rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the surprise of the previous speakers at the introduction of this measure.  It was evident that the Government would have to introduce a number of measures to bring in additional funds, taking into account that in the current year we have borrowed £821 million, more than half of which is for current expenditure.  Having succeeded in becoming the Government by the gimmickry of the election manifesto and in throwing away money that had been coming into the Exchequer over the years, the Government must seek additional funds.  The sum of £3 million to be raised by this measure is very modest as a percentage of the total health expenditure.  I will not quibble at the increases.  Everybody knows that services must be paid for, and having regard to the inflationary trend at present and having regard to health and hospital charges, 11p per week is not an exorbitant demand, neither is £24 an exorbitant demand for cover for those farmers and others who qualify under the health contribution scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of what value we get for the money was posed by Deputy O'Brien in the course of his speech.  I know that a Minister for Health has an exceptionally difficult job no matter <Col N="541" /> who he is or what his qualifications may be.  All along the line the Minister is confronted with organised groups capable of exerting a great deal of pressure to get what they think is their entitlement without taking into account other groups of citizens.  This seems to be the pattern at present. There are such groups within the health services.</P>
    <P>Parliament gave authority to the chief executive officers of the health boards which I thought should have been retained by the Minister of the day.  Health executive officers have too much authority.  When people vote in an election, the primary objective is to elect a Government.  The person selected as Minister for Health should have a great deal of power so far as the health services are concerned.  That power was very much eroded when the health boards were established.  It rests with the executives when it should rest with the man answerable to Parliament and to the nation.  It is futile to question the Minister on many aspects of the health services because he has to say they are functions of the health boards and he is powerless.</P>
    <P>Small as this sum may be relative to the total health bill, we are entitled to ask what will happen to this £3 million of the £16.624 million which will be raised through health contributions. I was interested in a statement made by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement in the House on 1 February.  He stated positively that 2,400 additional jobs will be provided to enable the health services to function more smoothly and more efficiently.  What kind of jobs has the Minister in mind?  I am sure the Minister for Health reported to the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As an ordinary layman I am reasonably conversant with the health services.

      <P>We could do with more staff in the orthopaedic hospitals, orthopaedic surgeons, and so on.  Of course, 100 of such people employed around the country would be a great many.  Possibly there are not more than 100 available.  What about the other 2,300?  I know the Minister will be as helpful as any other Minister.  I want him to consider the people who will pay these contributions and see that they get value for their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> Deputy O'Connell mentioned a waiting period of six months before some patients can get treatment.  People needing treatment in the orthopaedic hospital in Cork could have to wait as long as three years.  Some people have had to wait more than three years.  Because of lack of accommodation they were unable to get admission.  The numbers on the waiting list from Counties Cork and Kerry are exceptionally large.  If I thought some of this money would provide additional staffing or additional accommodation for such patients, I would be very pleased.</P>
    <P>Old people who need ophthalmic treatment, whether they pay this contribution or whether they are in the medical card group, find it very difficult to get such treatment.  There are waiting periods of long duration.  I do not want to labour this point, but it seems terribly peculiar to me that we should be providing jobs which are unnecessary to my mind.  I should like to see everybody in Ireland employed. We would all like to see employment provided, but if that employment is non-productive, and if this money could be better utilised in some other direction, it should be expended in that other direction and utilised to provide better services.</P>
    <P>The cost of maintaining patients in hospitals is astronomical.  It has gone up and up even in district hospitals where the average cost per patient is more than £70 per week.  All the small hospitals are finding it difficult to deal with applications for beds.  Our district and cottage hospitals accommodate mainly old people waiting for their end but should this be the case?  I have a lot of experience of hospitals and have contact with many elderly people who are confined there.  In my opinion, most of those patients would prefer, in spite of any incapacities and in spite of their old age, to be at home. In most cases the reason they cannot be catered for at home is that the allowances paid for caring for them at home are completely inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people should be cared for at home so that the cost to the State would be reduced and the hospitals available for people in need of other types of treatment. The money we are voting in this Bill is going into the general Health Estimate and for that reason we are entitled to inquire how it will be expended.  I am anxious to know what the Minister intends to do about people who are considered borderline cases as far as a means test is concerned.  I accept that because health services are so costly at present it is financially impossible to extend them very much but those borderline cases must be catered for.  The situation here is peculiar.  If we compare the income of a general practitioner with that of the Head of our Government, the Taoiseach, we find that in most cases the income from public funds of a practitioner living in a small town or village is greater than that of the Taoiseach. The records prove that.  When we have that type of system operating health services are bound to be costly. I expect that most of the £3 million being voted today will go towards paying doctors' fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something peculiar about <Col N="545" /> the fee per service.  In theory the scheme may be a good one.  It looks well but I wonder if it is efficient in practice.  Are our hospital waiting rooms cluttered with people who are not necessarily in need of medical attention but are there by virtue of the fact that they must be paid for by the State?  I accept that to a large extent the Minister is powerless in this regard but it is surprising that in a country where conditions are reasonably good so many people have to avail of periodic visits to medical practitioners. When I was young it was unusual for people to go to a doctor.  In fact, if one heard of a person visiting a doctor one came to the conclusion that that person was thinking of moving out. Certainly, there was no question of going to a doctor if one had a running nose or a cough, but that is the position now.  In my view that is encouraged by some of our general practitioners. It is costing the State a lot of money.  When we come to debate the general Estimate I hope the Minister will tell the House the number of visits made to general practitioners by medical card holders.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to know the situation in relation to borderline cases.  I refer to those who must go to the VHI or must make a case to the local CEO.  I am particularly interested in those people suffering from long-term illnesses.  Some people are handicapped from birth and they find it difficult to get cover.  In the case of children under 16 years suffering <Col N="546" /> from long-term illnesses they cannot get cover from the VHI with the result that they are nobody's baby. More attention should be given to our handicapped people and those suffering from long-term illnesses, irrespective of family income.  Those people should be given free medical services. Most of us have had to make representations on behalf of such people.  The scope of the measure covering the provision of drugs for certain illnesses should be extended.  For instance, those suffering from asthmatic ailments are not included.  That is wrong.  We should help that small group of people who need such attention.</P>
      <P>We must have measures like this to bring in money to the Exchequer. After all, Fianna Fáil bought their way into power.  They were so generous before the election in what they were promising.  I recall, too, what the Minister present had to say about fisheries then but I shall not talk about that now.</P>

      <P>The increases proposed are fair and reasonable.  A sum of £24 per year is not an excessive contribution in terms of the type of services that are provided and having regard to the cost of these services and to the people providing the services. They are loud enough where charges are involved.  Perhaps this increase of 11p per week should have been included in the budget proposals but I expect that the Minister for Finance had no wish to spoil his nice budget by announcing increases and, consequently, left this increase to his close friend, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, to announce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The financing of our national health services is likely to become a major political issue in the next three or four years.  Regardless of how adept the Minister for Health may be in terms of public relations and even allowing for his having virtually an unpaid public relations officer at the moment in the person of the health affairs correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, he will need to be much <Col N="547" /> more adept when the real political crunch comes in a matter of a year or two.</P>
      <P>This is the first instalment in regard to the critical situation that the country is about to face in relation to the financing of the health services.  No amount of public relations work or of liaison with special correspondents can cloak the fact that the Cabinet have not provided and obviously do not intend providing the kind of money that will be needed if we are to have a universal and comprehensive national health service.  Regardless of whether sex or something else is given up at the Ard-Fheis next year in lieu of smoking this year, these side contortions cannot get us away from the fact that as of today some tens of thousands of insured workers both in the public and the private sectors are sliding out of limited eligibility benefit.</P>
      <P>We are serving notice on the Minister of our intention to oppose the Bill. The situation is serious.  There is enough trouble in respect of the postal services but one of the causes of the considerable and growing dissatisfaction within the Post Office is the huge number of employees there who are no longer eligible for limited eligibility. In this area the Minister has failed totally but his predecessor was not successful in this regard either.  There has been failure to extend general eligibility throughout the country.  The achieving of a universal extension in this regard would mean the abolition of the outdated £3,000 income limit. It was a simple matter for the Minister to have included in the explanatory memorandum a note to the effect that an eligible person who exceeds the remuneration limit retains eligibility for the balance of the contribution year in relation to persons involved in the national pay agreement, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to that agreement the only increases that are conceded as retaining eligibility are basic increases. Thousands of civil servants have in the meantime got incremental increases which have put them beyond the £3,000 limit while thousands of Post Office employees and of workers in <Col N="548" /> private industry have also gone way beyond the eligibility limit and, consequently, lose entitlement to the health services.  This serious situation has been brought to the Minister's attention recently by a number of organisations. In December last representatives of the ICTU met the Minister and told him that they were totally dissatisfied with the situation regarding eligibility. In January they made a submission to the Minister but so far they have not heard from him as to what action he intends taking to rectify the situation. It is an issue on which the previous Government were defeated.</P>
    <P>While allowing for the exceptionally competent Minister that we have in the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and having regard to his capacity to bring about great change, he is scared stiff of the political confrontation that he will have to face with the medical profession, particularly with some consultants, if we are to have a general extension of eligibility. During his eight months in office the Minister has appreciated the implications of what is involved but has said nothing.  Apparently he has no intention of doing anything on this question apart from the setting up of another glorious Department of Health working party.  But we have had many working parties in relation to the health services.  Indeed, I remember as a young trade union official appearing before a former Minister for Health, Mr. MacEntee, who threw us out and told us there was no question of a general extension of eligibility.  That was 15 or 20 years ago.  Let us take a simple example of the situation and consider the case, say, of a barman in the Minister's pub&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of a barman.  He is classified as a non-manual worker and, consequently, does not qualify for eligibility to health services.  Another example is that of a working foreman with Bord na Móna who undertakes hard manual work but who is regarded also as being in the non-manual category for the purposes of eligibility.  Is it not a crazy system that a man driving a train from Dublin to Cork is regarded as a non-manual worker while a porter on the train is in the manual category?  The Minister knows that the system is mad but it is mad because the medical profession, notably the IMA and many consultants, say &ldquo;You will not extend eligibility.  We want our segment from which we shall cream the surfaces of our incomes.&rdquo;  Deputy Corish as Minister tried to do something about this but failed.  He should not have failed but that was the situation.  In his efforts he got very little assistance from Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I am appalled that there is so little general debate on this Bill.  During the past 12 months there has been a dramatic decline in the number of persons retaining eligibility for health services. Obviously there will be another Health Contributions Bill at the beginning of next year but that will be long before there will be any question of pay-related health contributions.  These contributions would have the most horrific implications for many people because the health services are funded from Central Exchequer funds.  Now we are to have a situation in which, for instance, I will be expected to pay 2 or 3 per cent of my salary towards the health services and Fianna Fáil in the next budget will undertake to wipe out £60 million or £70 million from Exchequer expenditure.  The Minister is proposing to introduce pay-related contributions for social welfare and health services and I challenge him to deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not very worried about the 50p a week or the £24 a year.  As the Minister knows, half the farmers and self-employed people do not pay this £24 anyway.  They wait until the health boards go berserk and until they are half dead from illness before they pay <Col N="550" /> the £24.  It is the ordinary insured worker who has to pay 50p.  It is not a fantastic imposition but it constitutes a contribution of £16 million from employees. I know what is in the minds of the Minister and the Department.  They will introduce a percentage of salary contribution for the health services and hundreds of millions of pounds will be lopped off the Exchequer contribution of the budget and dumped on the backs of PAYE contributors.  With due respect to the Minister, I do not think he has the political clout to take on the farmers and self-employed and make them contribute a pay-related sum.  He could hardly collect it from them; it is difficult enough to collect income tax from the self-employed without imposing a health contribution on a percentage basis.</P>
    <P>The financing of the health services will become a major political issue. Giving up smoking at the Ard-Fheis or giving up black and white television licences in the next election will not cloak the overall issue.</P>

      <P>The Minister received some months ago a comprehensive submission from the ICTU on this issue.  He has not replied to the ICTU.  This is an important issue. Many people who work in the post office tell me that they are no longer eligible for health services and they want to know what the Minister will <Col N="551" /> do about it.  There is enough frustration in the post office at the moment without adding to it.  It will not be good enough for the Minister to say that he intends to replace the present flat-rate social welfare and health contribution by a fully related scheme. That is not good enough.  It is not a question of methods of contribution; it is a question of eligibility.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Minister to one of the most spurious arguments which has ever emanated from this country.  It is the argument that if there is extended eligibility people earning over £3,000 a year will flood into the hospitals and avail of all types of health services. One would imagine that there would be a rapid increase in the birth rate; that is implied by those who are opposed to the extension of general eligibility.  One would imagine that the expenditure on drugs and medicine subsidies would automatically rocket.  I submit that the Minister should examine carefully the excellent report of the NESC which blew that myth sky high.  It is a myth which is perpetrated by people with a vested interest who do not want any extension of eligibility. The Minister should accept this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of comments made by the NESC in relation to the extension of the health services and the Minister knows that this report refutes the proposition that a general extension of the health services will automatically give rise to a massive increase in State expenditure. Nobody wants to go into hospital unless he must do so.  Nobody will breed families of 16 children overnight if there is a general extension of the maternity services.  We will not swallow millions of pounds worth of extra drugs.  This is the implication.  It is implied that such an extension would cost too much and that people would go berserk.  The NESC report has exploded that myth and the Minister knows that, notwithstanding the increase in costs which is a matter of serious concern, the problem is capable of being tackled and dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> I have felt strongly over the years about the blatant antediluvian class discriminatory structure built into the eligibility question within the health services.  How can any Minister for Health come into this House, as all his predecessors have done, and say that one has to be a manual worker in order to be eligible?  The definition of a manual worker is so bad that the chief executive of a health board is almost driven out of his mind trying to decide whether a worker belongs in the category of manual or non-manual worker.  They cannot possibly work on a coherent basis in the provision of health services.  Secondly, there is the category of non-manual employees whose rate of remuneration is £3,000 or less.  I remember having a &ldquo;barney&rdquo; with the Minister in relation to those earning less than £50 a week.  On reflection I possibly over-estimated in regard to some of my strictures.  I would point out to the Minister that since that discussion new figures have been produced in relation to average male adult earnings in the transportable goods industry and these earnings have again risen.  The average male adult industrial worker earns about £75 a week.  Another 8 per cent has been added in the construction industry from 1 January and this is to be provided from 1 March on the private side. We are then talking about average earnings of about £85 a week by the end of the year.  Another £100 may be added to that to cover the 2 per cent productivity provision in the national pay agreement and the limit of £3,000 will be derisory.</P>
    <P>My twin brother is a post office technician and his earnings are well above £3,000, with the result that he is &ldquo;clobbered&rdquo; as regards eligibility.  I happen to be a voluntary contributor and have kept up my contributions through the years since I went over the limit.  I am now in this unique category of non-manual employees whose rate of remuneration is over £3,000 and who are voluntary contributors under the Social Welfare Act of 1974.</P>
    <P>I am now in this group of unique people who are voluntary contributors and have eligibility.  If I did not have <Col N="553" /> that eligibility I would have been crucified in the last few years with continuing illness in my family, particularly of one of my children.  I appreciate the benefits of this.  I know many public servants, members of the Garda Síochána, members of the security forces who are no longer eligible for the health services.  It is not enough to talk about the famous carry over the Minister has spoken about.  If a member of the Garda Síochána, for instance, got a straight increase under the national pay agreement that is included in the carry over. If a fortnight later he gets an incremental increase that is not included. You can get your basic increase, add on your incremental, you are over the maximum and you are out.</P>
    <P>There was the 10 per cent relativity increase in salaries given in addition to the national pay agreement.  That 10 per cent relativity increase in the public service puts several thousand public servants out of eligibility under the health services.  The situation will become much more serious.  The Labour Party are, therefore, opposing this Bill.  It is totally inadequate.  I have been a member of the Social and Health Questions Committee of the Council of Europe for the past five years.  I have visited almost all the west European countries.  I had the opportunity afforded to me by being a member of this House and being an Irish delegate of visiting the health departments of approximately ten different countries. When I show them what we have as a so-called enlightened democratic country with a reasonable standard of living they regard our health services as being based on class discrimination, income discrimination and on professional discrimination of the worst kind.  When I say that I am not being anti-IMA or anti-consultant.  I am simply saying that there are people in the country who are earning a very good living from their work in the health services.  I do not see why an ordinary public servant, a clerical officer with an income of £3,100, should, after a few years, go out of eligibility under the health services. When the Minister goes around the country he will find that this will be a <Col N="554" /> major political issue in the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about what I call the social expenditure priorities of a number of members of the Cabinet. I regard the Fianna Fáil Party as moving sharply to the right at Cabinet level.</P>

      <P>One has only to read the implications in the Government's White Paper on Social and National Development, whereby the Minister for Health is now saying that we can have all the services we like but we will pay for them as employees and they will slap on a pay-related contribution for the health services.  I am afraid he will have a big political battle on his hands.  He will need far more than the health affairs correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> to rescue him from some unfavourable publicity in that regard.  The Minister has to look sharply at his policy.  He has got to tell the Department of Finance that he will not wear the strictures which were put around his neck like a halter by the Minister in his budget and he will not be able to run out after the next budget and say: &ldquo;A great coup for Deputy Haughey, 10 per cent increase in social welfare, he really did well at the Cabinet table.&rdquo;  There would be a halo around Deputy Cluskey's head at that stage because he could get that at the drop of a hat in an October review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have a second look at this Bill.  I am gravely concerned about its contents.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are horrified at the lack of action by the Minister. Every trade union in the country, whether it is the Garda Representative Body, the Post Office Workers Union, the Civil Service and Higher Executive Officers' Association, the Civil Service Clerical Officers' Association or any other public service union in the country, are at the moment <Col N="555" /> arming themselves to let go at the Minister on the question of general eligibility.  He has dodged the issue and there is no way in which he can ride out the storm gathering this year. Thousands of workers in the public and private sectors are going out of eligibility for the health services.</P>

I ask all workers in the country: &ldquo;Have a look at your PAYE certificate, ring up your health board, check with your local health authority, ring the Department of Health and you will be told that you are no longer eligible, you have run out of your two years or 18 months.&rdquo;  The Minister knows well what I am talking about.</P>

      <P>That is not true and the Minister knows that.  If he rings up Mr. Peter Cassells, the health expert of the ICTU, the assistant general secretary of the ICTU or talks to the secretary of his Department he will realise that what he is saying is not true.  As of last week, as of this week, people who had exhausted their 18 months or two years are now gone out of eligibility.  The people the Minister is talking about are a small group of people who got certain increases of a basic nature under the last pay agreement. There are massive changes coming this year.  I ask the Minister to have a look at the situation because I am most concerned about it.  The country deserves much better.  The Minister is capable of much better and he knows perfectly well that all he has got to do is say to the medical profession: &ldquo;There will be a general health service in this country and we will have to work out the finances of it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is one point made by Deputy Fergus O'Brien which I would like to deal with first.  He said that this was a savage increase inflicted on the less well off sector of the community.  Even allowing for the hyperbole which we all indulge in from time to time in the course of debating in the House that is an unacceptable statement of the position. In fact, on one aspect of it Deputy Michael Pat Murphy put the thing in perspective when he said that those increases are reasonable having regard to the changing situation.  Of course, they are not inflicted on the less well off section of the community.  I am not saying that those who will have to pay these increases are well off but they certainly are not the least well off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was endeavouring to make is that these increases are not paid by the poorer section of the community, those who have medical cards.  As most Deputies know, anybody with a medical card is entitled to full eligibility free of charge. Deputy Boland sought to make a point that this is the largest single percentage increase ever made.  As I said by interjection, it is not.  In 1975 the <Col N="557" /> Coalition introduced a 71 per cent increase, raising the annual rate of contribution from £7 to £12.  Deputy Boland asked about an Estimate debate. I hope we shall have a debate on the Estimate early in the year.  It is impossible to have it now before the Easter Recess but I should like to ensure that we will have a debate on the main Estimate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland and others spoke about the introduction of the pay-related scheme.  There is no reason to query my intention to bring in the pay-related scheme on 1 April 1979; what I said was that the working party has indicated that there is no way, administratively, in which it can be brought in before that.  On the basis of their report, which I shall have any day now, I will be formulating proposals to the Government which I hope will ensure that a fully pay-related scheme is introduced on 1 April 1979.  That will do away with much of the criticism levelled today against this system operating at present.  None of us regards it as satisfactory; I still think about it as I did in Opposition, that there are anomalies in it, that some of the classifications between manual and non-manual are ridiculous, but Deputies opposite have no right to criticise me about these things because they prevailed when the Coalition were in office during the full period of that Government and they did nothing about them.  It is hypocritical on their part suddenly to find these things so obnoxious and unacceptable when they tolerated them for their whole period of office.  I intend to do something about them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell, as usual, made some valid and constructive points.  He said that one of the real criticisms that can be made of this measure is that people are paying for limited eligibility services but because of delays, blockages and snarlups in the system people are not getting these services to which they are entitled.  I recognise that, and in an attempt to deal with one aspect of it, the out-patients' department side of it, I have set up a group to go into that matter and see what improvements can be made.  I invite Deputy Dr. O'Connell, because I think he knows more about this than most of us, to give evidence to that group, submit his views to them on the difficulties he sees and on how improvements could be made.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Connell also asked about the situation in regard to farmers paying contributions.  Approximately 82,000 farmers are registered with the health boards as being liable to pay health contributions.  In 1977 the collection rate for those farmers was about 70 per cent overall.  Certainly, there is an unsatisfactory situation there.  I think everybody recognises that the health boards have difficulty in administering that aspect of the scheme effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell also asked about the cost of the Beaumont site.  I recognise that there is a difficulty there.  I think traditional practice in this House is that where a private interest is concerned the details of a transaction are not disclosed.  That is a broader matter than could be dealt with in the context of this legislation.  I think it is absolutely legitimate for the Deputy to raise the matter but all I can say is that the site we got at Beaumont is first-class value.  It is a splendid site, <Col N="559" /> ideal for building, very suitably located and, in my view, we got it at very reasonable cost.  I have already expressed my thanks to the sisters of the order concerned for their co-operation in making it available to us.</P>
    <P>On the general question of hospitalisation, we shall have to concentrate increasingly on trying to keep people out of hospitals.  I said this on the occasion of the Beaumont ceremony, that modern hospitals are so expensive, so complex and so full of sophisticated equipment that they must be reserved for those who really need them.  By building up geriatric homes, welfare homes, outpatients' departments and local community services we must try to ensure that more and more of our medical services are administered outside these very expensive modern hospitals and that hospital beds will be reserved for those who really need them.  If we can do that, a great deal of the complaint voiced here today will be dealt with and we can ensure that people who really need sophisticated, intensive hospital care will be able to get it as it is needed without the annoying delays which cause the suffering and hardship to which many Deputies referred.</P>
    <P>What I said last year in Opposition is true.  This is not really a health measure; it is only such in so far as it helps to pay the cost of the health services.  This is something arising out of the budget, part of the general financing of the whole of the public services for 1978.  It is included in the budgetary arithmetic.  It is not really a taxation measure; it is more specifically related to the provision of service than is normal taxation, but to an extent it may legitimately be called a taxation measure.  I do not deny that it is part of the budget, part of the arithmetic whereby the Government and the Minister for Finance in particular make arrangements to discharge the debt for the year.  I should like to make one or two points about it.  In the context of the cost of the health services it is minimal.  The cost of the limited eligibility services this year, as I pointed out elsewhere, will be £265 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> The total cost of providing the limited eligibility portion of our health services this year will be £265 million. That works out at approximately £380 per person.  In other words, if all those who get limited eligibility services were to pay for them in full they would pay £380 a year.  All we are asking here is that people pay 50p per week or £24 a year.  It is important to mention those figures in order to put the health contributions in their proper perspective.  These people are making a very minimal contribution to the cost of the limited eligibility services we are providing.  As Deputy M.P. Murphy pointed out it could not be regarded as anything but reasonable and fair and in line with increasing costs generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy asked about jobs.  The Chair sought to restrain him from widening the debate but perhaps I might say that as far as the 2,400 extra jobs we are providing in the health services in 1978 are concerned, an overwhelmingly high proportion of them will go to improving services&mdash; they will be consultants, doctors, nurses, public health nurses or people of that sort.  Some of those jobs will undoubtedly go to things which cannot be immediately and directly related to an improvement in the services, such as repairs and renewals of premises and so on.  As I said, the majority of these extra jobs will go towards improving the services for the people who will be asked to pay these increased amounts stipulated in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not think there were any other points of significance raised in this debate.  Again I want to put the broad proposition to the House in favour of the legislation that these increases are reasonable.  If you are to look at them strictly in economic terms the amount which people pay for these limited eligibility services is small and the contributions represent good value in present-day terms.  As I said, the total cost of the limited eligibility service is £265 million and overall the contributions which these health contributions make to that figure is £16 million or 6.27 per cent.  In that context they cannot be regarded as unfair or unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that it is the intention <Col N="561" /> to bring in a pay related social welfare and health contribution.  I am astonished at Deputy B. Desmond's apparent opposition to a pay-related scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the estimated total cost of the course he has arranged to qualify suitably the special trainee teachers for primary schools; if any of the cost is being recouped from the trainee teachers concerned by reduced salary or otherwise; and the consequent net cost of the course to the State.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.  As I have already indicated in reply to Question No. 143 on 15 December 1977, none of the applicants requested <Col N="565" /> assignment to the Church of Ireland Training College, Rathmines.  My Department did not ask applicants for any details of their religious affiliation. Premises and staff of the Rathmines college are being utilised by all the trainee teachers in colleges associated with the University of Dublin.  The estimated total cost of the State by way of financial aid to the training college in respect of the course is £135,000; each trainee is also paying the college fee of £225.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the students concerned were not requested to indicate which college they wanted to attend, why were none of these student teachers assigned to the Church of Ireland College?  Could I further ask the Minister whether discussions took place on the allocation of students between officials of his Department and representatives of the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, and whether such discussions were initiated by his Department or by representatives of the Archbishop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation to colleges was made on various bases.  The first was accommodation.  Secondly, there was a question of certain strengths and weaknesses in regard to accommodation and otherwise in the colleges and certain strengths and weaknesses also in regard to the intake where we had to provide special courses to strengthen up certain subjects. All these factors were taken into consideration in the allocation of places to the colleges.</P>
      <P>In reply to the second part of the supplementary as to whether discussions took place between officials of my Department and the Archbishop of Dublin with regard to this matter, and whether those discussions took place at the initiative of the Archbishop or of my Department, as far as I am aware no such discussions were asked for by the Archbishop or by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that no discussions on the allocation of students were initiated either by the Archbishop or by his Department. In that case no discussion must have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="566" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not asked by the Archbishop to discuss the matter, nor did I ask him to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked the Minister was whether any approach was made either by the Archbishop's staff or by the staff of his Department. He told me that he had no knowledge of this.  If none of these applicant students was asked to state religious affiliation, why were all the allocations made to colleges run by one religious denomination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question.  I could not tell the Deputy why.  The training colleges are denominational. I have not been asked by the Church of Ireland college to drop the denominational aspect, nor have I been asked by any other colleges up to this moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister, as the person who assigns the various students to the various colleges, must know why all of them were assigned to colleges of one denomination and why none was assigned to the Church of Ireland Training College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not know that.  I do know that the religious affiliation of any student was not asked in my Department.  That is genuine.  I have checked this out to the utmost.  Nor did anybody make any application for the college in Rathmines. Of those two things I am absolutely sure and I assure the Deputy on my word of honour.  Apart from that I had no further part to play.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>A final supplementary. Could I ask the Minister whether, if he becomes aware that he is mistaken about the existence or non-existence of discussions between officials of his Department and representatives of the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin with regard to the allocation of students to colleges, he would inform the House of the correct position in due course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The correct position, as I know it&mdash;based on three facts&mdash;<Col N="567" /> is that we did not ask what the religious affiliation of any student was; secondly, no student asked for a place in the Church of Ireland College at Rathmines; thirdly, neither at the instance of my Department nor at the instance of the Archbishop were discussions initiated in this matter.  I want to say to the House also that the College of Commerce is playing a very useful role in the training of the trainee graduates, and for this we are very grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of the trainee teachers are married and have no other income while pursuing this course?  In those circumstances, why is the Minister charging such a high fee as £250 to these trainee teachers?  It is rather harsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to correct the Deputy.  If he listened to me carefully, he would know the fee is £225.  Secondly, I want to point out that these people were unemployed and would have had no prospects at all were it not for the fact that I initiated this scheme.  The position of other graduates selected in the normal way for the graduate trainee course was that they had to pay the fee of £225 and did not have any salary.  I was providing them with a substantial salary from which £225 had to be paid in fees and food.  I think the bargain is what somebody called a damn good bargain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that they were unemployed, why charge them a fee of £225 which they can surely ill-afford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that, in terms of students, the salary is a substantial salary and I am not admitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a substantial salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  The deduction of £225 for very substantial benefits is not in any way exorbitant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware it is not a substantial salary.  It <Col N="568" /> is far below what they would get if they were employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not permitted to make a statement. If he insists on doing that, it will be contrary to the Chair's ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, there is a misprint in this question. The word &ldquo;examiners&rdquo; should be &ldquo;examinees&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry about that, but I examined the question very carefully and if Deputy Collins cannot distinguish between &ldquo;examiners&rdquo; and &ldquo;examinees&rdquo;, it is not my fault.  My answer is based on the exact wording as spelled out in the question.  If he wants to put down a question about examinees, I will be only too willing to answer it.</P>

      <P>As I said, the Higher Education Authority are working on the study and collecting the information from the universities.  I am interested in this aspect of higher education. I cannot give any details at the moment but I know some studies have been made over the years in many countries.  In particular, a very substantial <Col N="570" /> one was made some years ago, called the Poignant Report, for the European countries and a second edition covered the EEC countries, Sweden, Russia and the United States. It gave the breakdown of the various avocations of the parents of people who go on to third level education. Except for the United States the story did not seem to be a very good one for the lower income groups and they were ahead of the USSR.  I hope the study will be available soon and I am sure the information will be revealing.</P>

He will recall that on 27 May 1977 a general election was announced in that paper and, on the same date, it was announced that the eligibility limits would be increased.  I had been pushing for that increase even by way of motion which I failed to get Labour Deputies to support in this House.

      <P>I should like to inform the Deputy that from a base of £300 I increased the grants to £500.  A mangy £50 was mentioned in the budget but never paid for by the previous administration. The eligibility limit announcement was made under pressure from me and under pressure of the approach of that fateful day when the present Opposition had to meet people.  This is being paid for by me for the first time and I am having a look at the eligibility limit situation. I hope, with the agreement of the Government and the wealth we hope to create, to improve the situation in the near future.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I should declare my interests in this regard.  I had to do it myself for nothing.  The more H.Dip students who get some teaching for which they are paid the better. There are arrangements between schools to pay them.  The requirements are from about three to five hours per week and some students get some money for that.  I did not but I changed to another school where I got 2/6 per hour for a while.</P>

      <P>Secondary schools, as such, are private institutions and any arrangements made with H.Dip students is a matter between the schools and those students. I had a theory that it is not good for a student who is doing the H.Dip to have too much work to do because it is very difficult for him to follow his professional studies, particularly the philosophy and theory of education.  If it is all practice and no theory it is not good and if it is all theory and no practice it is not good.  The third category covered here is that of vocational teachers who are following the H.Dip course.  Some of these as temporary, whole-time or part-time teachers get paid in accordance with the rates laid down by vocational education committees.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern and his gratitude to me regarding the post-primary school in the area.  It has been agreed that a 24-room school will be built.  It is proposed to provide 16 classrooms initially and an extension containing eight further classrooms when it is required. The final sketchplans submitted to the Office of Public Works by the architects for the management have been found satisfactory from the architectural point of view, subject to certain amendments.  The report of the Office of Public Works is dated 16 January. The suitability from an educational point of view is being examined within the Department.  If the Deputy reflects on this fact he will know that a considerable degree of urgency is being exercised in the matter within my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of a report (details supplied) that hundreds of <Col N="590" /> pupils had left primary schools with a reading age of eight; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the existence of this report although no copy of it has been submitted to the Department.  I understand that it dealt with the results of a remedial education programme for students at lowest ability levels in a number of Dublin city vocational schools.  Since the sample was not representative of the entire intake into second level schools, one doubts if it would be possible to draw any general conclusions from it. It must be recognised however, that even under the most favourable educational conditions, some children, because of limited ability, can achieve only low standards in the basic school subjects.  Furthermore, there are many environmental influences in city areas which delay and distort a child's development and impede his education.</P>
      <P>The current primary school curriculum is designed to enable all children to achieve that degree of facility in reading which is within their capacity and to attain an all-round development of their natural powers.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the results of the 1974 survey&mdash;that is well worth reading&mdash;carried out by the Teachers' Study Group, an independent body, which showed that a significant improvement in reading comprehension occurred in Dublin city primary schools between 1969 and 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would in no way admit that there is anything wrong in the primary school system either in Dublin or outside it.  I can assure the House that there are many countries that are regarded as being on a more sophisticated and wealthier level than we are who would be very proud to have the body of qualified teachers we have.  I want to add to that that this is not a sign of any complacency on my part.  We will try to <Col N="591" /> remedy defects wherever they are.  I want to put that on the record of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Ceann Comhairle was controlling that end of it but now Deputy Collins is not merely interested in education but the order of the House.  This particular study referred to was based on a limited study of 129 first-year pupils in seven Dublin city vocational schools.  There is an old proverb which says that you can make out Hercules from the nail of his finger.  I do not believe that so far as educational statistics are concerned. The main burden of the report was to show how those children were dealt with and the significant progress those children made under tuition. There are, as I said in my reply, various factors, variables so far as teaching children are concerned, variables which concern the home, variables that concern the school, variables that concern the teacher.  We are equipping our teachers to teach and to deal with this situation as best we can.  The pupil-teacher ratio, despite, again, educational research findings to the contrary, is, I believe, the cause of some of the trouble.  We are trying to remedy that as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the establishment of a Women's Service Corps is creating widespread interest throughout the country and within the services.  It is not an innovation in military history but something that has been successfully implemented in other armies.  I believe the response to the idea will be very satisfying because to date only young men of good character have been accepted for the Army.  I believe the women would now like to make an active contribution to the Defence Forces and the opportunity will be given to them.  I hope the interview boards set up to recruit the officer cadre will maintain the standards established by the interview <Col N="600" /> boards for cadets to date.  I do not hold the view that there has been any favour bestowed on sons of officers. I have no knowledge of any unsuitable candidate being selected for the officer corps.  In fact suitability and fitness are the criteria on which judgment is based.  I believe that in the formation of the new force a very high standard will be expected of the officer corps.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why women should not contribute largely in every area within the Army.  Some suggest that they should be confined to clerical and catering areas and some other areas, but I think that with initial training the women could compete in all Army weapons operations and can be trained to as high a standard as young men.  There is no reason why with the rifle, the Gustav and lighter weapons, we should not have excellent female soldiers.  Some Deputies have suggested that we should get information from other countries.  Some suggested the example of the Israeli Women's Corps.  I think we should establish our own standards. Conditions in Israel are much different.  I hope we never have to endure the heat they have to endure in Israel nor would I like to find that the problems of that terrain had to be overcome here.  I did see the forces in Israel, although I did not visit any barracks.  The high standard of both men and women in the forces was very noticeable when they retired from active service.  The discipline and training they got and brought with them into civilian life gave them alertness, courtesy and smartness which were very obvious in every walk of civilian life where both these men and women work.</P>
      <P>I should like to see our women's corps established within their own barracks and in time it could be seen where they could be best deployed. Initially, I think they would make much greater progress in training within their own area.  We would look forward to seeing competition within the Army in gymnastics and other sports areas, basketball, swimming or in the many areas for which the Army is famous, where this corps could get an opportunity to show their talents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> The second line reserve, An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil is another vital area in the Defence Forces.  For many years now Army brigades are composed of regular units combined with battalions of FCA for the one purpose of defence.  Generally speaking, there is not adequate understanding or appreciation of the continuing service given by the FCA volunteers.  They are always available.  They have guarded our vital installations down the years.  Their service has gone unnoticed. The Minister referred briefly to them and acknowledged their service but generally the public seem to ignore and not be aware of this continuing contribution.  Have Ministers, the present Minister and past Ministers, and Deputies really got down to studying how we can improve conditions for people who give voluntary service?</P>
    <P>For the past 30 or 40 years, since the old LDF days, a very unattractive uniform has been worn by serving members.  Thought has never been given to a replacement of that uniform. In inclement weather when members are on active service, doing strategic or tactical exercises or just on the firing ranges, they get wet.  Nobody ever thought of providing these men with protective clothing, except a great-coat, and at one time ground sheets were issued.  It is vital that thought be given to the provision of additional clothing.  If we had a smartening up of the uniform it would be an attraction and an encouragement for new members.</P>
    <P>Some people might be frustrated or dissatisfied with the FCA.  But active members, people who are in touch and who go on regular parades, know exactly what is going on.  If members do not attend they cannot be expected to know what their duties are.  Of course, there is a remedy for that&mdash; one can be made non-effective if one does not attend regularly.</P>
    <P>Some consideration should be given to the provision of ranges.  I know of battalions which have to travel 100 miles each way to a firing range.  Does this not seen unreasonable at this time of expensive travel costs?  A range could be erected in a suitable area <Col N="602" /> which would make such journeys unnecessary. Thought should be given to the establishment of suitable ranges at reasonable distances from FCA battalions.</P>
    <P>I remember 25 or 30 years ago when it was normal practice for Ministers to hold conferences in the Curragh at which battalion commanders would be present.  It was normal for them to express their views on how best they considered the FCA force in their area could be improved.  I do not know if the Minister attended some of those conferences.  I know I did.  We raised many points which down the years have never been attended to adequately.  It is a waste of time attending conferences if some action is not taken.</P>
    <P>I want to refer specifically to the necessity of establishing a range in County Clare.  This matter has been raised for the last 25 years.  Such a range would obviate the journey to Kilworth Camp in County Cork which is more than 120 miles from that area. Voluntary labour by members of the FCA could be given for the erection of the necessary buildings.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, there is no lessening of enthusiasm or desire to serve the country by our young men.  We hear of many problems with our youth, of the difficulties of overcoming the boredom they suffer from and of the question of controlling violence among our young people, who have nothing better to do than go around in gangs.  Parents should consider the FCA.  Their sons would get very good training in discipline and physical culture, and there is even provision for advancing educationally.</P>
    <P>When the Women's Service Corps is established, I see no reason why some thought should not be given to establishing a women's corps in the FCA. This would give the young women in their own locality an opportunity to get good physical training.  They could have their own NCO and officer corps with whom they could train.  I can visualise a time when our FCA headquarters at battalion and company level would have both NCO and officer ranks to give the training I referred to.  This is only a thought, but it is <Col N="603" /> something on which some firm decisions should be made.</P>
    <P>I am surprised there is no allocation for expenditure on improvements on the 12th Battalion Headquarters, Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, Deputies have described some of the Army billets as the worst in Europe.  I have not seen the barracks in Europe.  It is true however that many of the buildings are old&mdash;they were there in the British time&mdash;particularly in the Curragh, but there have been vast improvements in the catering services, installations and field kitchens.  We have had a wonderful standard of training given by the catering service in the Army.  Diningrooms are excellent and the standard of service there is equal to any given in an hotel. However, some of the billets are very old and need replacement and the pace seems to be rather slow.  One wonders who is responsible when it comes to allocating money for Defence.  Is it the civil servants in the Department of Finance?  It seems unreasonable that the Army should be the last people to get the comforts, yet they are the first group we have to rely on when we are in danger.  I would like to see a change of heart on this.</P>
    <P>Even if we have to borrow money or to raise it from taxes, we must provide normal comforts for our PDF whom I regard as first citizens of the State.  I think it is unreasonable that married soldiers should have to compete with others for houses.  Some married men are transferred frequently and I think there should be some priority given to them in the local authority housing lists.  It has been suggested that some agency should be established within the Army to make provision for Army personnel living adjacent to barracks and for staff attached to FCA units.  I should like to know if any progress is being made in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that Civil Defence is being looked after properly.  It is an important service to which men and women devote their spare time voluntarily.  The local authorities pay a contribution towards the outlay.  I should also like to pay a tribute to the Red Cross, the Knights of Malta <Col N="604" /> and the St. John Ambulance Brigade for the excellent work they do and the high standards they maintain.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with the Army Equitation School and with all those associated with it, including those who purchase the horses.  In this connection I submit that there will be unanimity that we should be prepared to pay the right price for the right type of horse. This is an area in which Army officers have given outstanding service to the State and have helped to give the Irish horse the highest place in the world.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the introduction of a contributory pension scheme for widows and orphans of non-commissioned officers and privates in our PDF.  The contributions will be by way of deduction from pay while the members are serving.  There is also a provision to have deductions made from gratuities.  In some cases these deductions could amount to £900 or £1,000.  I do not regard such deductions as being fair because many NCOs and men look forward to these gratuities, to which they do not contribute, when they retire.  If a serving NCO predeceases his wife while he is serving she or the family will not be eligible for <i>ex-gratia</i> payments.  I do not know if this scheme has been implemented. If not, I urge on the Minister to have it improved.</P>
    <P>Membership of the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen is open to all the forces and I should like the Minister, by way of recognition of the service ONE men have given to the State, to establish a closer liaison with that organisation. They hold functions annually and I suggest that the Army, possibly through the attendance of Army bands and so forth, would try to make these annual events more enjoyable. The relationship between the Army and ONE is quite good at the moment and we would like to maintain and improve it as far as possible. Their members are very proud of their service and they deserve some recognition.</P>
    <P>We can anticipate a vast improvement in fisheries protection by the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> Naval Service when they have the necessary boats commissioned, and we hope we will be able to patrol successfully and protect our fisheries in the limits within which we will have full jurisdiction.  Our fisheries will develop and our youth will see a future; if those who have been encroaching on our territory over the years are restricted and if our conservation methods succeed there will be a good living for our young fishermen.</P>
    <P>We have land, sea and air services, and in all our people are familiar with the work of our Air Corps.  Again this is vital, and I am satisfied that everything possible is done to have the right type of plane and equipment made available to our pilots, whether they are pilots of helicopters or of planes. Their mercy missions from time to time bring home to people what a really valuable service they are providing and we should all express our gratitude to those brave men who in very difficult conditions undergo and overcome many hazards.</P>
    <P>In the field of sport the Army have always excelled and we have some fine cadets in our Army who distinguished themselves in the sporting arena.  The women's corps when fully trained will make a contribution; there is no reason why they should not be given the opportunity to develop their talents in our Army bands in the future.</P>
    <P>Gymnastics is an area in which our Army personnel have developed a very high standard of physique.  Our gymnastic teams some years ago were outstanding and as we approach more normal times we look forward to seeing this applying equally in every battalion.  It is important that the instructors maintain the standards; it would be a pity to see them going rusty.  We have developed a very high standard of adventure training and at the moment every command in the State have an adventure training club who engage in a variety of activities. This is a major factor in developing the physique of our young soldiers, who are as capable, fit and well-trained as any soldiers in any army in the world.  From time to time our soldiers have gone on courses abroad <Col N="606" /> and have shown a real gift for distinguishing themselves in this area.</P>
    <P>Services which are very rarely appreciated are the Medical Corps and the Nursing Corps of the Army. They are responsible in a big way for the health and physique of our soldiers, and whether a person is hospitalised or not within the Army, one must appreciate the real care that our Medical Corps and our Army nurses give.  I see a useful contribution being made by the women's corps, when established, within that Medical Corps in first aid and in many similar ways.</P>
    <P>I should not conclude without referring to the wonderful contribution by our FCA in cross-country and other areas.  In international events we have had many distinguished young men over the years who were given that opportunity because they decided to serve in the FCA and in the regular Army.  They certainly held the flag high when they went abroad and represented our country.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that the Minister has the co-operation of all Members of the House, and indeed of the public, in doing a job which is vital, which must continue and which must maintain the high standards established over the years.  Those who lead within the Army have established a very high standard of morale amongst themselves and have given to those they lead the same high ideals. This in a small State is important.  I would like to see the public giving much greater recognition to all members of the forces at every level and rank.  Our media can project their image favourably.  I hope that in the years ahead we will have peace, when those who do not recognise established Governments and who make it difficult for the security forces to maintain standards of peace come round to the belief that there is only one way to peace, and that is to recognise ordered Government, to observe the rules of that Government and to recognise that an established Army and Garda force under the direction of the Government are the only source through which the public can be given a normal way of life.  Nobody other than the established Army and Garda force has the right <Col N="607" /> to unsurp the authority given to the elected Government by the people of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Somewhat belatedly I want to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  The Estimates for the Department of Defence and Army Pensions give me an opportunity to do so.  I want to pay tribute to the Minister on being the first Minister in the history of the State to introduce an Estimate for the Deparment of Defence running into nine figures.  I join with the Minister in congratulating members of the Permanent Defence Forces and those aligned with the Army, on their high standard of discipline and their high code.  It is essential that discipline be maintained at a high standard.  This high standard is noted and recognised universally.  The 15,063 members of the Permanent Defences Force have onerous and most responsible duties, some of which the Minister listed. They carry out these duties very well, and most unobtrusively in many cases. We can use the opportunity provided by the debate on this Estimate to say to our forces: &ldquo;Well done.&rdquo;  These are difficult and trying times for many of them, but they carry them out very cheerfully, and I congratulate them on that.</P>
      <P>It is also essential that our forces should have the best equipment available within the resources of the State. It is most gratifying to see that five Army personnel carriers will be made available.  It is wonderful that they are produced at home.  They will provide employment and help to maintain morale within the force.  The Minister referred to a down payment on four tanks.  It is vital that our forces should have all the equipment necessary, and that they do not feel neglected in any way.  I hope the resources of the State will continue to be made available to the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the educational opportunities available to members of the force.  Concessions are available for members to take courses of tuition and study.  This, combined with general physical culture, will lead to fitter, more able and more alert <Col N="608" /> men.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us a little more information on some of the other schemes he is examining with a view to providing additional educational opportunities for non-commissioned officers and privates.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to see that under subhead G there is a 25 per cent increase in the amount of money made available for Civil Defence.  In my constituency we have every reason to be grateful to Civil Defence and voluntary groups in the area, especially in inclement weather.  They work most diligently and I am pleased to see recognition given to them in an increase in this year's Vote to £504,000 from £401,000 last year.  Every Member of the House must be very pleased about this.  Local authorities are very much involved and they can do a great deal to develop proper attitudes towards Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the FCA, a voluntary group who offer a wonderful back-up to the Army, and also to the Red Cross, the Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade on their contribution to making a better society.  A great thing in the Estimate for a person who has the pleasure of representing a constituency like Wicklow is <i>Asgard II.</i>  I am proud that this boat has been designed by an Arklow firm and will be built by them.  I know the decision to go ahead with it was taken by the previous Administration, and I am delighted the Minister has been able to come up with the necessary finances in this his first Estimate.  I know the State will be proud of <i>Asgard II.</i>  When she takes part in races and events, she will do well due to the high standard of workmanship in Arklow.  It is wonderful that work opportunities will be maintained there, and that the name of John Tyrrell &amp; Sons will continue to be recognised.  This is a proud moment for everybody from Wicklow.  As I said, the design is local and she will be built locally.</P>

Tá súil agam go néireoidh go geal leis an Chéad Chathlán agus go spreagfar úsáid na Gaeilge ar fud an Airm go hiomlán.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the morale of the Army be kept at a very high level. There is much in this Estimate to show it will, the five personnel carriers, the down payment on the tanks, and <i>Asgard II</i>, plus other aspects the Minister mentioned such as the programme to improve aerodrome facilities. These are all very necessary to assure members of the Permanent Defence Forces that they have the gratitude of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had of speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Defence.  I congratulate the Minister belatedly on his appointment and I wish him well in his onerous task in the coming years.  The Minister paid tribute to the Defence Forces.  It is true to say that the community in general join with him in that tribute. The Defence Forces include all the different organisations but we are concerned mostly with the Army.</P>
      <P>In the past few years the Army's task has become more and more onerous.  I am glad the Minister, like his predecessor, is endeavouring to improve all aspects of Army life.  My experience of Army life is very limited compared with some Members of the House.  I was connected with the LDF for a short period before it became the FCA.  It is no harm for somebody outside to have a look at the inside of such an establishment as the armed forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said allowances are paid to all personnel for Border duty and special security duties outside the Border area.  Morale is high in the Army but there is bound to be a certain amount of cribbing and griping. One of the things they gripe about is the special allowance.  It is rather small. It should be looked at on its own merits.  It must be realised that the special Border duty areas demand the presence of the Army with the Garda on occasion.  One of the cribs of Army personnel is that there is a great difference between what they get for <Col N="610" /> the job and what gardaí are paid.  This calls for readjustment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of providing for a new Curragh Command but there are fears that the establishment of this command will mean the transferring of personnel from other commands.  I am concerned about the transfer of personnel from Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick.  I do not think it is the intention of the Minister to carry out those transfers but I raise the matter because people have expressed concern to me.  The Minister mentioned the prospect of establishing a women's service corps and I should like to put a number of questions in regard to that corps.  Will those who join this corps have the right of promotion to the highest level within the Defence Forces?  I note that it is intended that members of this corps be billeted in the new barracks at the Curragh but I should like to know if it is the intention of the Minister to have such personnel based in other centres.  Will it be open to married women to join this corps?</P>
    <P>It is good to see so many cadets. officers and, indeed, serving soldiers improving their lot within the Army by attending universities and apprenticeship courses.  The Minister should look at the question of promotion within the Army.  I am aware that serving soldiers have been promoted but with so many well-educated young boys entering the Army they should be given an opportunity of reaching officer grade.  It is necessary to show our serving soldiers that their capabilities are recognised. They must be given the same opportunity of going right to the top as cadets are given.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a look at Army regulations.  I am aware that they are there for disciplinary purposes but one can get lost in the different regulations.  Disciplinary measures, if administered strictly, can be very harsh.  It depends on who is carrying out the discipline.  For example, some of those in detention are allotted a certain number of cigarettes every day and two extra on Sunday.  I do not believe that such disciplinary regulations should apply in this day and age.  In my view those regulations should be revised preferably with the aid of a person from outside the Army.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> I welcome the Minister's statement with regard to the provision of a new vessel for the Naval Service.  His announcement concerning the development of the Naval Service is a major step forward.  The service was neglected for many years.  We all know that the corvettes which were in very poor condition spent more time in port undergoing repairs than at sea.  It is only right that we should pay tribute to the people who served in those times under great handicaps.  The Minister has told us that it necessary today to patrol a much enlarged maritime area resulting from the extension of the exclusive&mdash;or elusive&mdash;fishery limits.  At this stage we do not know what we will have to patrol but it is good to know that our Naval Service will be capable of patrolling any area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £40,000 for the purchase of sports equipment for the Army.  For many years the Army played a big part in the sporting life of this country.  Their football and hurling teams and boxers were always to the fore.  I would like to see Army personnel participating more in sport.  We are all aware of the part played by Army personnel in local activities and that many retired and serving personnel play a big part in organising sporting events.  They have proved a very valuable asset to society. I also welcome the provision of £175,000 for the equitation school.  It is only right that we should pay tribute to that school and the showjumpers who have competed at home and at international shows on Army horses. We should also pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor who had the foresight to allocate money for the purcase of good jumping horses.</P>
    <P>The helicopter service is vital not alone for fishery protection but also for mercy missions.  This is a fine service and we hope it will be built up to the stage where it can play its part with the Naval Service in fishery protection work.</P>
    <P>Reading through the Minister's statement it is amazing to find the various activities in which the Army were involved in 1977 when they dealt, for example, with requests on about 300 occasions for bomb disposal <Col N="612" /> services, most of which presumably were false alarms but which are an indication of the times we live in.</P>
    <P>Down through the years many people have spoken of the lack of housing for Army personnel.  So far as my knowledge of the situation in some of the barracks in the south is concerned, the married quarters are obsolete and should be replaced by new accommodation.  As the Minister has pointed out, there is much need for liaison between the Army and local authorities on the many aspects of housing in order to help Army personnel with problems in this regard and to make them aware of the various facets of grants that go towards the cost of houses.</P>
    <P>There has not been a recruiting drive now for three years and in view of the numbers leaving the Army after those three years it is time to make an effort to recruit replacements for these people.  In the Cork area soldiers are leaving the Army in increasing numbers.  It takes at least six months after recruitment before men can undertake the duties of regular soldiers so we should make the effort now to recruit more young men.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, too, that we have a look at the situation regarding the FCA whose numbers are also decreasing.  Perhaps not enough attention has been paid to this force. Therefore, I join with Deputy Taylor in requesting the Minister to give immediate consideration to the FCA with a view to increasing the membership. The FCA can provide a very valuable service as has been proved in the past couple of years when they have helped out in so many areas, possibly saving the State a lot of money.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to the Civil Defence organisation.  In this regard I agree, too, that they in co-operation with the Red Cross and other voluntary bodies are a valuable asset to the Defence Forces as a whole.  We must support as far as possible such bodies as Civil Defence and the FCA.  The Minister has a part to play in trying to bring about a greater morale within the FCA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> The Minister referred to the observers to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East and enumerated the different areas in which our troops have served abroad.  In all these instances the Army have acquitted themselves well.  They have a wonderful reputation abroad from the time previously when they served the UN.  Perhaps that was the greatest morale booster ever for the Army. This is an aspect that we could consider again if the need arises so that we might play our part in this special way.</P>
    <P>Subhead H concerns the special allowances payable to veterans.  Again, I would ask the Minister to consider the question of the means test for these allowances.  At the outset the allowances were much too small.  Although the situation has improved there are many veterans who because of the means test do not qualify for these special allowances.  In order to be eligible for them one would need to have merely a pittance of an income.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of free travel to the spouses of veterans and I welcome also the various other measures in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>When talking of the Defence Forces there are one or two points that must be considered.  It has been stated recently that NATO is out so far as we are concerned.  Our Defence Forces have gained a reputation from our stance of neutrality and have been respected on that count.  I had been hoping to find in the Minister's statement some reference to the role of the Defence Forces in the future, but I have been disappointed on that count. I had expected to hear, for example, whether their role would be changed in so far as the EEC are concerned. There have been several suggestions&mdash; and seminars, too, that are not always in the open&mdash;about a common defence policy.  We should ensure that any suggestion that may emerge in this field is discussed in this House. Alliances of whatever kind should not be entered into lightly.  In the event of any movement in that direction the Minister or one of his colleagues should keep the House informed of the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> Finally, I wish to add my voice to the tributes that have been paid here to the Defence Forces and to wish them every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister on his appointment and on the manner in which he is handling the affairs of his Department.  I was impressed by his statement introducing the Estimate and by the Estimate itself, which represents a vote of confidence in the future of the Army.  In addition the Estimate is an encouragement not only to those already in the Army but to any young man thinking of joining the Defence Forces.  The opportunities are there for anybody who wishes to continue his education even to degree level.  Members are given an excellent training for life.</P>
      <P>The amount of money being provided in the Estimate will go towards ensuring that the highest standards are maintained in the Defence Forces.  In this context it is no harm to highlight the current rates of pay on the 1977 Wage Agreement.  For a recruit the weekly wage is from £51.71 per week, while a sergeant-major's pay starts at £88.43 per week.</P>
      <P>Those joining the Defence Forces have the opportunity to participate in sport.  This is a very healthy activity and I am sure the Minister for Health and anyone interested in the welfare of our people would advocate such participation.  The members of the Defence Forces give a very good example to our people and encourage them to participate in games and physical training.  Ireland is highlighted before the world through their participation in events ranging from international orienteering and cross-country running to show jumping.  This has a spin-off effect in the form of tourism and trade contacts.</P>
      <P>The helicopter service is becoming very sophisticated and is used for rescue operations and for transporting people to hospital on mercy missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the FCA, An Slua Muirí and Civil Defence on their role as back-up services for the Army.  I recommend that a recruiting drive should be undertaken in every parish.  It is as important in <Col N="615" /> the city as in the country to have such units.  They give an example of neatness and discipline and I would encourage any young boy to become involved. He would be given training for the future and it would keep him from harm.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the provision of new equipment that can be obtained in Ireland.  I refer to the armoured carriers which are built in County Meath.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps provide training opportunities for many people who later take up posts with Aer Lingus. There are many opportunities for those who wish to take up appointments in the Air Corps.  Last year ten new aircraft were purchased and more money is being expended this year, particularly with a view to fishery protection. This is now an air and sea operation.  Heretofore fishery protection was part of the function of the Naval Service but it now involves an air operation as well.  It is heartening that we can build ships of a very high standard in our shipyards.  I refer to the ships being built at Verholme.  A new ship was launched recently and another is being built.  This is a necessary vote of confidence in our industry.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister to the engineering personnel situation regarding the servicing of our ships.  About ten years ago we had approximately ten engineers of a first-class standard at a time when we had only one ship.  Today we have only one extra engineer and they are now servicing seven ships.  The Minister should look closely at the structure of naval personnel with particular reference to the engineering service and he should ensure that the highest standard is maintained.  Ships are now highly sophisticated and depend for their efficient operation on a sufficient number of highly trained personnel. Engineers in the Naval Service should receive the same rate of pay as their counterparts in the Army.  The Defence Forces are under one command but I understand that there is a differential.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give the green light to a campaign to recruit <Col N="616" /> cadets into the engineering section of the Naval Service.  There are 83 Army cadets attending University College, Galway, and cadets should be encouraged to join the Naval Service.  Perhaps they could attend University College, Cork, which is adjacent to the naval base.  Haulbowline is the heart of activity and that is where the ships are based.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of having the executive situated there also.</P>
    <P>Regarding the engineering and navigational sections of the Naval Service, it is now international practice that they should be represented on an equal basis on board ship.  Our Naval Service have ten engineering officers and there is none in training.  There are seven marine engineers, three electrical engineers and 40 executive officers, while 20 cadets are in training.  Executive cadets have been trained with the Royal Navy on a regular basis for the past 25 years.  This involves three years' attachment to the Royal Navy.</P>
    <P>Despite having expanded from one operational ship, there has been an increase of only one in the engineering branch.  As a result of almost total failure to attract direct entry marine engineers, the Department have lowered the qualifications and will accept second-class certificates of competency in lieu of first-class certificates.  The second-class certificate is the half-way stage.  This results in the pay and conditions of those already appointed with first-class certificates being held at the minimum level, and one engineer with a first-class certificate resigned recently.  There has been no improvement as a result of the efforts to attract second-class engineers despite numerous advertising campaigns.  In the area around the naval base personnel are being offered much more attractive posts in industry.  Many chemical industries are looking for personnel with that type of training.  We will have to look closely at this matter if we want to buld up our Naval Service, in which we should take great pride.</P>
    <P>It is important to keep our ships fully manned.  Up to 70 per cent of the cost of a modern ship is involved in the engineering function of it.  We are dealing in ships costing £4,500,000 <Col N="617" /> and £5 million.  The danger is that our ships will have to go to sea understaffed or with staff who have not the highest qualifications.  If the number of engineers goes down the danger is that engineering technicians will be eroded in a similar fashion.  Extra responsibilities are placed on engineers because of the shortage of staff and they are not given any increase in pay or an improvement in conditions.  The Minister in his speech said that the minesweepers will be replaced in the near future.  They have been at sea without being fully manned with engineering personnel.</P>
    <P>It will take four years, regardless of what qualifications future cadets have, before they are of any use to the service.  We slipped up in the previous four years by not having cadets in training.  If there are not positive improvements in the future the few remaining engineers will have left the service and there will be nobody left to train the cadets.  The Naval Service have to attract at least six new marine engineers.  Marine engineers with first-class certificates are registered as chartered engineers internationally and fully recognised throughout the industry and State bodies with the exception of the Naval Service where their specialisation is best utilised.  The director and assistant director of the Naval Service are executive officers based in Dublin with a staff of five other officers but there is no engineer.  The Minister should recognise the existing marine qualifications in the service and improve the image in order to attract more engineers. Future cadets should obtain special qualifications to enable them to keep up with the demands of the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the provision of two new squash courts at Haulbowline.  I also compliment him on going ahead with providing new houses for Army personnel.  Some of the Army personnel are not living in very good conditions.  They should get as high a standard of house as anybody else.  Some of the houses in the Crosshaven area need to be renewed. Somebody mentioned that it is difficult for Army personnel sometimes <Col N="618" /> to qualify for local authority houses when they are moved around the country from time to time.</P>
    <P>There are not many overholders in that particular area but I ask the Minister to look at them sympathetically. We have recommended that the local authority provide them with houses but they say it is a matter for the Army.  The Army say it is a matter for the local authority.  Those people have served the State very well but now, when they are pensioned after rearing their families well, they are caught between two stools.  If they cannot build their own houses and do not qualify for local authority houses their pensions are being withheld.  I ask the Minister to give them favourable consideration.  I look forward to innovations and further progress made under this Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Defence Estimate. I will deal specifically in my remarks with the Naval Service.  It is a point of conjecture whether or not that service should be known as the Naval Service or the Fishery Protection Service because it is in the latter role that they fulfil their greatest obligation. I would like to have had a breakdown of the number involved in the Permanent Defence Force.  We were given a blanket figure of 15,000. I believe there are approximately 650 in the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious with the increased role the Naval Service will have to play in fishery protection in the future that this figure will have to be vastly increased. What proposals has the Minister in relation to increasing the complement of the Naval Service?  I suggest that the number of naval stations around the coast should be expanded. That would be a stimulus to recruitment.  At the moment the Naval Service are based in Haulbowline.  If there were two stations on the west coast, another on the south coast, and at least one on the east coast it would give local incentive to young people to join up.  We are told that, with the injection of money from the EEC for additional protection against poaching at sea, the number of ships which will be allocated to the Naval Service will <Col N="619" /> be greatly increased.  I believe five or six extra ships were mentioned.</P>
    <P>It will mean, if we assume that the number of personnel on each boat is approximately 70-80, that our Naval Service complement will not be sufficient to man those boats, never mind the number required on shore in order to have a back-up service.  There will obviously have to be a considerable increase in recruitment in the future.</P>
    <P>We should have been given more information in regard to An Slua Muirí with regard to the part-time section of the Naval Service.  There is no figure mentioned in the Minister's speech regarding the number of people at present serving in An Slua Muirí or the number of centres around the coast.  What centres have we at present?  Has the Minister any plans to extend those centres?  What type of equipment is at the disposal of An Slua Muirí?  If we expand at the rate that is necessary this is an obvious starting point.</P>
    <P>It has been stated rather cynically by the fishing industry and by the fishermen in particular that the £30 million which has been mentioned in regard to the expansion of our Naval Service would be compared with the 30 pieces of silver.  There is some substance to that because we have seen our fisheries crificed in recent weeks at the whim the continentals.  This £30 million poor consolation for the amount of territorial waters we have lost to the continentals.</P>
    <P>What arrangements have been made subsidise the running costs of the vessels it is proposed to obtain or build?  We are told there will probably be eight vessels in the Naval Service as result of this injection from the EEC. Obviously, the running costs will be substantial if we have a vastly increased number in the Naval Service. Could the Minister give us an estimate what it will cost and say if any promise has been obtained from the EEC regarding these costs?</P>
    <P>It must make the job of the Naval Service very thankless in these days when no matter what size of boat <Col N="620" /> they find poaching within our waters the maximum fine is £100.  As long ago as 1 December the Minister for Fisheries promised to bring in new legislation to increase the existing fine of £100.  He said he intended to introduce this legislation in January 1978. We are still awaiting it and meanwhile the foreigners are making hay while the sun shines.  It is entirely out of proportion that the maximum fine should be £100 when the damage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it must be admitted that their task is almost hopeless if they go to considerable trouble to apprehend foreign boats when the maximum penalty is £100 while the price of herring on the Dutch retail market is £4,500 per ton.  That means that if one of the Dutch trawlers catches 100 tons of herring the value is almost £.5 million.  That catch can be made within our territorial waters and the fine is totally out of proportion to the crime committed.  I am told it would involve very little trouble to bring in amending legislation and the sooner this is done the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot advocate legislation on an Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no allowance made in this Estimate for building further boats other than the one at present under construction and which will be ready for service, we are told, in mid-1979.  Can the Minister give any further details of the proposals or suggestions from Brussels that we are to get this £30 million for extra ships and planes?  There is no suggestion in the Estimate about the provision of even one extra plane.  I understand the one plane we have at present is on charter.  No provision is made for the purchase of even one aeroplane but we are told we are getting five or six purely for fishery protection.  Is this promise definite or it is contingent on <Col N="621" /> our agreement the common fishery policy?  It is all very much up in the air.</P>
      <P>There is no provision on existing fishery protection vessels for a helicopter pad and none on the ship that is at present being built.  Surely this is very shortsighted.  A helicopter can cover an enormous amount of land or sea and it would greatly lessen the amount of travel involved for ships of the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>I should like to advocate that the Naval Service become more enterprising and as well as improving conditions for personnel, make their life more attractive.  I suggest that they go abroad more often.  I think that practice did obtain in the past when we had merely a few corvettes but in recent times our boats seem to stay at home.  It is a great boost for naval personnel if they have a trip to the West Indies or the Mediterranean and I suggest that training trips or courtesy trips of this kind should be encouraged on a large scale.  Other naval services come here quite often. We should reciprocate and in doing so make the life of our personnel more enjoyable and entertaining within the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries, in the debate on his Estimate, said he would use naval vessels and personnel to stop the wholesale poaching of salmon at sea which is going on at present.  The salmon industry is one of our main sources of fishery revenue, running into many millions of pounds each year.  Its existence is now in danger as a result of abuses.  The main abuse is illegal drift netting at sea which is primarily occuring on the west coast.  I have not yet seen any instance of the Naval Service being brought into action in this regard but that will have to be done because the existing system whereby boards of conservators are in control of salmon fishing is not adequate to stop this type of poaching.  These people operate in trawlers off the west coast and, so far as I know, no concrete attempt has been made to apprehend them. The Minister for Fisheries said he intended to get the Naval Service to stop this practice.  I should like the Minister for Defence to say how soon <Col N="622" /> he intends to take action because the salmon season has already opened and if we do not curb this type of illegal fishing there will be no salmon industry in a few years.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with other Members on both sides of the House in congratulating the Minister for Defence and the Defence Forces.  This is a non-controversial Estimate.  Possibly I should be happier to be involved in a more controversial theme.  I believe that our forces are carrying out their duties despite the limited funds available. They are discharging all their functions under the Constitution in the best interests of the State.  It is interesting to note that it is costing £100 million.  I wonder if it would be costing that amount if a certain chain of events had not occured here seven or eight years ago.  We have a saying that it is an ill wind which does not blow somebody some good.  This ill wind has blown some good for our Defence Forces.  Now we can talk about a realistic Estimate for the Department of Defence.  Approximately £7,000 per man is the total commitment to our Defence Forces. When you contrast that with the average cost of creating a job in industrial employment, it works out reasonably well considering the type of sophisticated equipment, arrangements, housing and so on.</P>
      <P>What makes a happy soldier?  It could be summed up in a few short words: he has to be well paid, well dressed, well fed and well equipped. How do our soldiers fare under those headings?  There is another aspect which is usually glossed over on occasion and that is the question of public acceptance of soldiers and recognition of their efforts.  Enough attention is not paid to those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that the members of the Defence Forces are reasonably well paid.  Apart from a few anomalies <Col N="623" /> between their remuneration and that of the gardaí on special duties and overtime, it would be fair to say that they get reasonable remuneration for the work done.  The soldiers would be the first to let us know if they were not well dressed and well fed.  One does not hear too many complaints about that.</P>
    <P>I was a guest of the Defence Forces at manoeuvres in the west during the summer.  I was surprised to find how well equipped they are as far as field canteens and field equipment of all kinds are concerned.  Those of us who are happily situated in snug surroundings are all too apt to forget what it is like to be living under canvas.  For a few years some of us had the opportunity of being actively involved in the Defence Forces.  Despite the fact that it was a young man's fancy, I can remember that conditions were very draughty and drab in those days. I understand there have been tremendous improvements over the years.</P>
    <P>To be well equipped is more important than anything else for a happy soldier.  He feels a real soldier only when he has equipment which is as good and as effective as any other army in Europe can offer.  It used to be said that when you had the right to carry your rifle you were a full-time operative in the Defence Forces.  It is pleasing to note that over the last few years the type of equipment&mdash; rifles, side arms or heavy equipment&mdash; has improved out of all recognition to what it was in those days.  Money spent in that area is money well spent.</P>
    <P>Public acceptance is another area, perhaps a grey area so far as the Army are concerned.  Of course, there has been a vast improvement there. It should be the determined wish of all the public relations experts in the Department to make sure that public acceptance is kept at a very high level. It would be fair to say that there was a tradition of antagonism to the wearers of uniforms.  That had an historical background.  We would all like to think that that has diminished and that we can look forward to the day when it will be totally absent so far as the recognition of the efforts of our uniformed <Col N="624" /> personnel in the Defence Forces is concerned.</P>
    <P>The success of the Defence Forces can be gauged by the spontaneous recruitment of personnel.  Not enough young men make themselves available for our Defence Forces.  We do not have enough men to man the Naval Service.  I presume that is one of the reasons the Minister will be involved in a recruitment campaign before long. In a republic like this, with a great tradition of nationhood, recruitment should be on a voluntary basis.  There should be no need for a television campaign which often depicts the Army in a way which is not true.  The Army or the Department should not be involved in exercises in the public media which are not a fair and honest assessment of the situation in the Army, or entice young people to join for other reasons with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>In my opinion we do get enough men in the Naval Service because we are preoccupied with exercises which, in essence, are not really related to naval operations.  We all know they have a fisheries protection function to carry out but how wonderful it would be if they had more exercises appropriate to a naval service.  Exercises could be held in the Irish Sea or the near Atlantic.  I hope there is no suggestion that our boats are not capable or well enough equipped to take part in that kind of exercise.  That may have been the case in the days of the old corvettes, because of performance difficulties.  Modern boats are however capable of taking part in such exercises. I am sure it would not interfere with our neutrality if we allowed one of our boats to take part in a NATO exercise or an exercise with another foreign power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was leaving that aspect of the affair.  You can be very hard on occasion.  We must make the Army more attractive.  We must involve them more in pageantry, in displays.  They should be seen by the taxpayers who provide the money to keep them there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> They could be used for local festive occasions.  Then there would not be much trouble with recruitment.  The majority of our people would like to see the Army on display at least once a year, not only in Dublin but in towns throughout the country.  We should have them giving a display of strength and firepower, a display of the armour that we are paying our money for.  For instance, it has been pleasing to see a large Army contingent in the streets of Castlebar year by year taking part in the four-day walk.  It was a wonderful thing to see our Army involving themselves in a community festive occasion, showing that they are capable of austerity and that they have the stamina to participate in walks throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the Army are on a semi-war footing, and in peace time we can enhance the image and improve the morale of our troops if we involve them more in community work.  There are in the Army qualified engineers, sappers and other technicians and they should be seen performing their duties throughout the country.  I doubt if it is beyond their capacity to act on a consultative basis outside the Army.  We could avail of their expertise if we involve them in providing the manpower, technical and otherwise, to build roads and bridges. They were involved in that work before.  How otherwise can they be given the opportunity to display their skills?</P>
    <P>The FCA have a big role to play as far as defence is concerned.  Up to 20 years ago young people were more anxious to participate in FCA training. At that time one could see them in every village throughout the west of Ireland.  Although that is not evident now, I am convinced that many of our young people would be ready to serve in the FCA if it were explained to them that they were serving their country.  One hears about what goes on in other countries and I suggest that the Swiss have a lot to offer us in this respect.  They have a form of conscription.  I appreciate that that word has overtones of past imperialism but there could be some sort of voluntary conscription to the FCA.  I do not <Col N="626" /> think it is too much to ask any young man of 18 years to give a few months of his time to the service of his country. If it could be encouraged on a large scale it would be a wonderful morale-booster from the point of view of the defence forces.  Indeed I suggest it would be a good thing if everyone in the country did some military service on a voluntary basis.  I am suggesting to the Minister that a scheme should be formulated to get more men into the FCA.</P>
    <P>FCA men took it hard when it was decided they could no longer have their rifles at home.  When you take the firearm, the firepower, out of the hands of a soldier you doom him to ineffectiveness.  The gun does not have to be loaded.  Anyway, an FCA man would not use it indiscriminately.  It is a tradition that a soldier would prefer to lose his life before he would give up his firepower.  The FCA had no choice in the matter.  At the moment when they go on exercises the guns have to be brought from a central depot under full military escort and taken away again in the evening.  In years gone by we saw members of the FCA going home with their rifles on their shoulders.  There was no looseness as far as looking after and cleaning the rifle was concerned.  It was your personal possession.  In other small nation armies the day that a man gets his rifle is regarded very highly and if for any misdemeanour or abuse he is asked to surrender it this is regarded as a great disgrace.  That is the case in this country as well.  If it can be found possible to restore to the FCA that little extra dignity of allowing them their firearms, having due regard to security, it would be a great step forward.</P>
    <P>We will all welcome the reorganisation of the Defence Forces and the introduction of the women's corps.  It can be said fairly that there was a certain lack in not having a women's service corps.  I hope that the ladies do not think it is because we were all male chauvinistic something or other that we did not allow them in up to this.  It is a welcome step and the Minister is much to be congratulated on taking it in the Irish interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> We have a cadet corps and I understand that 48 members were recruited into it in 1977.  I do not want to sound parochial on this point, but I would like to know where they came from. That is probably classified information, but it is important as far as morale is concerned that people in the Army are of good standing and that there be a nice, even spread in the recruitment of cadets.  Sadly not many of em come from the west of Ireland.  I do not know the reason. Maybe enough of them are not offering themselves, but I think a number from that area would like to join.  We must never allow a situation to develop where traditionally certain areas supply the cadet corps.  Without wishing to discriminate against any section or area, it should be the policy of the Army that a certain number of the cadets recruited would come from each province.  In that situation the Army would have a cadet corps and an officer corps recruited evenly throughout the country.  This would be healthy for a small nation like this and it would serve as a great incentive to recruitment in certain areas when people would see their officers returning home for holidays and other occasions.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that education and training facilities are available right through the ranks in third level education in all the different disciplines. The Minister should instil into cadets going into third level that there should be an even spread in all the disciplines, in engineering, in medicine and so on, so that the Army would be as self-sufficient as possible.  It does not matter how large the total number of the Army is as long as they are effective to do their job, but they should be self-sufficient as far as all the disciplines and trades are concerned.</P>
    <P>The facilities available to non-commissioned officers and privates for training, off-the-job training and day-release courses, and the help given in the provision of books, fees and so on, would make one believe that the Army is not just another job but a really worthwhile career for any man. <Col N="628" /> Foreign courses are available, as they should be, for commissioned and non-commissioned officers.  Nothing improves a man's outlook on his job so much as seeing how the other half lives, especially when he discovers that in service equipment, standards, dress and pay here we fare well compared with other defence forces.  The Minister is right in proceeding with the policy of making these courses available to our officers.</P>
    <P>He is right also in improving the grant-aid towards sporting facilities for our Defence Forces.  We have only to view any athletic meeting abroad to realise that quite a number of the participants come from the defence forces of other nations.  That should be the pattern with our Defence Forces too. The cream of our sportsmen&mdash;and I presume from now on of our sports-women&mdash;are attracted into the army, and every effort should be made to ensure that, once there, they are given every facility and opportunity to go to the very zenith of their powers as athletes, be they male or female.  I am delighted that more facilities are being made available in that regard.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the helicopter service. We in the west of Ireland, feel somewhat isolated from the east and we require the helicopter service on quite a number of occasions during the year for rescue and medical purposes Perhaps the refuelling station at Castlebar could be turned into an overnight stopping place for our helicopters.  As a step further, perhaps we could provide facilities there for training mechanics and carrying out all necessary repairs to helicopters.  Inevitably the helicopter will become part of the life of this country, with offshore installations, offshore drilling operations and new boats with helicopter platforms in increased activity in protection of our fishing stocks.  We are going to need helicopters in the west of Ireland.  Despite what anybody might think about any other location, Castlebar is ideally situated geographically and physically as the location for the advancement of this service.  I ask the Minister to bear it in mind if he is contemplating setting up any such stations around the coasts.</P>

The location is perfect in Castlebar and we have a military barracks there, which is the old cavalry barracks, in first-class condition.

It would be a considerable boost for the town if the remaining services could be made available there for helicopters.</P>
      <P>County Mayo has, if not the longest certainly the largest exposed coastline in the country, and no life boat service, despite that extensive coast.  There is no lifeboat service at Clew Bay, Blacksod or Broadhill.  There is nothing between Arranmore and Kilronan. No matter how you look at it, it can be substantiated that there are about three and a half hours steaming time in either direction from those two stations to get to the County Mayo coast.</P>
      <P>It will have to be agreed by everybody that there is a developing fleet in the fishing industry in Donegal, in Achill, and in County Mayo in general.  I did not offer when other well-known politicians, men of stature, were offering on the fisheries question.

      <P>If we have prime fishery stocks in the Irish Sea we should have prime protection for them. At present we have not.  That is straight and honest, and I do not care who it embarrasses.  Some of our fishery protection vessels steam up along the west coast on occasion.  They pass by the coastline of Mayo on occasion, but not often enough.  The fishing grounds off the Mayo coast are the most pirated grounds in Europe.  I will prove that by giving statistics. Recently in a storm 24 large fishing vessels belonging to foreign countries sheltered in Blacksod Bay.  They did not happen to converge on Blacksod Bay and Clew Bay.  We know those trawlers were not out taking the sunshine or on a fishing trip for the good of their health but for the good of their pockets.  If 24 trawlers of that type found it necessary to shelter in Blacksod Bay in a storm, it is absolutely essential that more fisheries protection should be provided for the Mayo coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I have heard about fisheries and fishery protection since I came into this House, it appears we are married to them for a long time.  Recently in a non-storm situation I visited the Belmullet Peninsula, or as some of my friends would say &ldquo;down in the other republic&rdquo;.  Virtually any night during the season if you look across Blacksod Bay, Broadhaven, or anywhere off Ballyglass, you see a string of lights like the lights of London.  The people who talk about fishery protection need not tell me they are outside a limit of ten, 12 or 14 miles.  They are not.  They are clearly visible to the naked eye from the shore and they can be counted.  If our prime fishing grounds off the Mayo coast do not deserve the prime protection I am talking about, I cannot imagine what fishery protection is all about.</P>
      <P>I am making a case for a lifeboat service and I am asking the Minister to make the strongest possible representations to whatever authorities are responsible for the provision of a life-boat service for the people of County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to make the strongest possible representations to the lifeboat authorities to provide such a service for the fishing industry in County Mayo.  Unless an improved fishery protection service <Col N="632" /> is made available off the Mayo coast, foreign trawlers will fish out the sea. When they congregate in Belmullet it is obvious that the catch is fairly substantial. It is also substantial for our own fishermen.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the remarks made about Donegal fishermen.  They have a fondness for that area too and they need to be protected.  They will be pleased to know that a lifeboat and better fishery protection vessels are available just as they are pleased to know that the Ballyglass pier will be an effective pier for shelter and for fishing drop-offs in the near future. We look forward to the new Minister for the Gaeltacht making further funds available for the improvement of piers.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht has made substantial funds available for the improvement of our landing facilities in that area, which will help Irish fishermen as distinct from foreign fishermen.  Our half-deckers are increasing their lobster and salmon fishing off the Mayo coast and they have no protection at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am using the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo; to back up my statement. One of the premier functions of the Department of Defence is to provide protection for Irish fishermen.  I am sure the Minister knows a campaign is being mounted by Mayo people to have a better service made available to them by the Department of Defence. I am voicing the feelings and the legitimate aims and desires of those fishermen and the people in general on the west coast.  There is no protection for our half-deckers.  A lifeboat service would provide that.  A better service by our fishery protection vessels would <Col N="633" /> keep others from taking an undue share of the catch.</P>
      <P>Another Department is involved.  I want to refer to tourism.  This is not an aside and it is not a tangent. Pleasure craft are on the increase in the western area, and sea angling and tourist activities involving the sea, and there is no protection whatsoever for them from the Department of Defence or the lifeboat service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but I am sure that the Minister who has considerable experience in these matters will take note of the remarks I have made. It is of interest to note that Eagle Light is used by all intercontinental flights and, indeed, by all large vessels plying the Atlantic.  What more logical place for an improved rescue service? I understand that some spotter planes will help in the fishery protection service.  In this connection I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that there are airstrips in Galway and Castlebar and it is proposed to construct one in Belmullet.  That Belmullet project could be upgraded to provide first-class landing facilities for those spotter planes which will be involved in fishery protection along the west coast.  It would be in the interest of the Department to provide hanger and refuelling facilities at Castlebar and Belmullet so that the spotter planes would not have to return to Baldonnel using up fuel, logging up more engine hours than necessary and short-cutting their trips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to be serious about the development of spotter aircraft we should adopt the natural course and provide the refuelling and hanger services adjacent to our premier fishing <Col N="634" /> grounds.  That will require a brave decision by the Minister but then he is a brave man.  A considerable amount of public money has been allocated for the carrying out of a major port development at Ballyglass and it is hoped to have a fish processing plant in operation there before long.  We know that the Northern fishermen who take what is their natural right, some Irish fish, from the waters of the Mayo coast &mdash;I suppose we are not taking enough fish&mdash;will use Ballyglass.  I want to know why Ballyglass is not developed to cater for one of our fishery protection vessels.  Would it be possible to provide bunkering facilities to allow for the refuelling of at least one of our protection vessels?</P>
    <P>It would not cost that much money to locate one of our new protection vessels in Belmullet.  That would improve the whole image of the north-western coastline off County Mayo, apart from creating many jobs.  The presence of a fishery protection vessel in Belmullet, backed up by improved landing facilities for spotter planes, would be a deterrent to those anxious to rape the wealth of this country as far as fishing is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is strange that we continually choose a large vessel for fishery protection purposes.  That is not the scene in other more developed countries.  As far as the Mayo coastline is concerned a smaller boat located in one of the county ports would be better.  It would be more effective in that it would be cheap to run and would be faster.  It would only require 20 men to man such a vessel.  Fast moving torpedo boats or some such vessels with a proper arsenal, equipment and fire power would do the job admirably. They would be able to move quicker to the poaching scene and be big enough to carry a landing party. Would we get better value for money if we went for smaller boats and had them located in different ports around our coast?  It is possible that I do not understand the situation sufficiently well but I feel the protection situation could be enhanced by having such boats located in Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  The larger boats would, at the same time, be steaming around our coast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> If we get money from the EEC to provide such protection all avenues should be explored.  It is possible that because of the inclement weather experienced off the west coast such boats are unsuitable but the larger vessels could deal with situations that arise in inclement weather.  I am concerned about the wholesale poaching that goes on up to our coastline in Mayo and that could easily be handled by smaller boats when visibility is good.  There is a need for an expanded protection presence off the west coast.  If we had that presence we would be able to protect our fish stocks.  The people in the west are not satisfied that sufficient protection is being given to our fish or that sufficient rescue facilities are available for operations off the west coast.  It is possible that this is because we were not as vocal in the past as some of our Northern neighbours but the House can rest assured that the people of Mayo are now conscious of the wealth that is on their doorstep and of the need for rescue facilities and fishery protection.  They will have that voiced at every opportunity from now on.  I intend to be in the forefront of that campaign.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the Minister's statement with which one could deal, including the aspect of Civil Defence, something in which I am particularly interested.  We must be honest when talking about Civil Defence. There are people who are under the impression that this body were founded primarily for the purpose of dealing with a holocaust or with atomic fallout or some such occurrence, but the whole operation of Civil Defence expands beyond that sphere and the question of atomic fallout, for instance, is the least of their worries. But if the Civil Defence organisation is to be effective and if value is to be got from every pound spent on it, there is need for reorganisation of the force.  We hear about lists of equipment but I only wish that some Deputies could see some of the stores where the equipment is located and see also the condition of that equipment much of which is almost useless. <Col N="636" /> If it is to be effective and if we have an obligation to provide a Civil Defence service, let us be honest and provide the equipment necessary to improve that service.  Let us provide the parking facilities for their trucks, their ambulances and so on.  Let us not be referring continually to paper lists, because that is the situation in the Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Deputy from Donegal is smiling.  Obviously, he approves. There is a need for Civil Defence.  We all hope that they will never be called into serious action but the organisation provides training for young people and provides them with an opportunity of becoming involved in another area of the security of the nation.  It was not my intention to detain the House for so long on this occasion but sometimes one is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope that before too long the new Minister will see his way to provide the boats and the facilities to have them harboured, refuelled and manned by people from the west. If one of those boats was located in the Belmullet area to serve the Mayo coast, there would be a tremendous influx to Slua Muirí.  The people down there have a great tradition of seafaring and would be very happy to engage in this activity close to home.</P>
      <P>This Estimate is non-controversial. We all wish the Minister well.  We realise that the work he must do is in the interest of the nation.  It is fair to say that no democracy, and certainly not this one, could have maintained the peace we have had in this part of the country were it not for the efficiency and the loyalty of our Defence Forces.  We can be justly proud of them.  I wish them well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I assure the Chair that there is no necessity to note the time at which I am commencing because I have no intention of speaking for any length of time.  I rise to deal with one matter in my own constituency.  However, <Col N="637" /> before coming to that, I should like to add my voice to the many tributes that no doubt have been paid to the officers and men of the Defence Forces for the fine job they are doing on behalf of the country.</P>
      <P>It is good that the lot of the Defence Forces has improved considerably in recent years and that soldiers do not serve now with the sort of sense of grievance that obtained in years gone by when they were paid badly and generally not treated very well.  However, all that is behind us and generally now the men are happy and contented and reasonably well paid.</P>
      <P>On the question of pay might I mention one matter which concerns also my constituency.  I refer to the overnight allowance paid to soldiers on Border duty.  It amounts to about £1.50 per night and when compared with other allowances paid&mdash;perhaps for the same duty&mdash;can show a very unfavourable comparison.  I suggest that the Minister give serious thought to increasing that allowance and making a more realistic payment to these men so that the unsociable hours during which they have to work are compensated for to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing I should like to pay tribute to the Army Equitation School and to the Army Jumping Team who down through the years have been a source of pride to the nation when the team and the school were doing well.  Indeed for some years and up to comparatively recently we were down-hearted because the Equitation School and the Army Jumping team seemed to have fallen on lean times.  I am glad to know that that has changed and that the Army Jumping Team won the Aga Khan Cup last year.  They are living up to the best standards of Ireland in respect of horses and horsemanship. Any money spent on the Equitation School for the purpose of buying horses, in training riders, in equipping the school and the team in the best way possible is money well spent and is really a national investment, because our bloodstock is one of our best money spinners.  Anything we do to advertise the quality of our horses and the quality of our riders is very much in the national interest.  I cannot think <Col N="638" /> of any better way of advertising our horses and bloodstock around the world than by providing the best possible horses for the Army and doing everything possible to provide the best riders.  We have the horses and the horsemen and all we have to do is finance the undertaking properly.  We will then achieve results as good as those which have been achieved recently.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Army should be well trained, well paid and well housed.  Soldiers are stationed in Cavan town in quite unsuitable accommodation. I do not know when the barracks there was built but it must be at least 100 years ago.  It is quite unsuitable and is recognised as such by the Army authorities.  I appeal to the Minister to remedy that state of affairs.  I am sorry that, while there was mention in the Minister's speech of provision for expenditure on barracks in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere, the Cavan barracks was not mentioned.  When the National Coalition came into office in 1973 they set about building a barracks in Monaghan town.  It was built very quickly and it is a great credit to them. The difficulty about building a barracks in Cavan at that time was that a site was not available.  This was not the fault of the former Government; it was the fault of previous Governments who did not provide sufficient land or the money to buy it for industry, housing and projects such as a barracks.  The town was starving for land for public purposes.  Serious efforts were made in 1973, 1974 and subsequent years to secure a site for a military barracks. I think I am right in saying that even since the change in Government the hunt has gone on for this site.  The position has now changed with regard to the availability of land.  Within the past few years the local authority have purchased about 100 acres of land in the neighbourhood of Cavan town. There should not be any real difficulty now in securing a site for a barracks.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use extravagant language in talking about sewage and vermin but the barracks in Cavan is unsuitable due to age, location, accommodation and amenities.  The fact that <Col N="639" /> Army officers from the building unit have visited the town several times in the past few years proves more eloquently than anything I could say that what I am saying is correct.  I do not need to use extravagant language or to make extravagant claims.  I am appealing to the Minister now to go ahead with the building of this barracks.  It would have been built during the term of the former Government if a site had been available.</P>
    <P>I compliment the officers and men of the Army on the job they are doing. The strength of the Army is now between 15,000 and 16,000 officers and men and this is a record during peace-time. It is evidence that men and boys are prepared to join the Army and that they are being fairly well looked after and treated.</P>
    <P>Without having given much study to it, I want to make one further point. Every effort should be made to give young boys joining the Army a trade or profession that will stand to them in later life.  We have apprenticeship courses, but it is my opinion that we should err on the side of what might appear to be extravagance or generosity in making these courses readily available to those who can participate in them.  We should make these courses attractive and encourage young men to avail of them.  This is not only in the interests of young men who join the Army; it is a national investment. Some of these men leave the Army after a few years and they have many years of work ahead of them.  Army personnel who take up civilian jobs render a very good service to the nation and acquit themselves with credit.  Any money spent on the provision of these courses to give young men a trade is a national investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Estimate it is my great pleasure to be associated with the good wishes to the various sections of the Defence Forces. There is one quite substantial item in the Estimate which has not received very much attention, that is, the provision for sail training.  This is a new responsibility for the Department of Defence.  As a small nation with a very <Col N="640" /> long coastline it is appropriate that we should be associated with sail training and it is entirely appropriate that it should fall under the aegis of the Department of Defence.  Sail training in other countries, including some of the land-locked European countries, is regarded as a very important aspect of national development.  Coming late to this activity, we have not as long a history as other maritime nations in this regard.  Nevertheless, the present Minister must take much credit for the fact that he has appreciated this deficiency and given a lot of time, effort and energy to rectifying the situation and making sure that this small maritime nation is rightly represented in this sphere.  Sail training is an outlet for very many of our youth of all backgrounds. It is not necessarily confined to people from maritime towns or people from fishing towns or villages. It is of very great assistance in character formation in almost any walk of life.  It brings together people from all walks of life and gives them an outlook they would not have otherwise.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of it from our point of view is the preservation of that grand old lady the <i>Asgard.</i> The <i>Asgard</i> served the country very well over a long period, very often without the knowledge of anybody in the country.  She was designed and built in northern Europe by a very famous international designer to very high standards.  She was a wedding present given by the grandfather of the late President Childers to his father, a Boston doctor.  She served the Childers family as a holiday home many years before being used for her immortal journey from the North Sea down through the fleet at Spithead for her rendezvous at Howth.  She was also very important from another aspect about that time.  She enabled Mr. Childers to form the basis for his very famous book <i>The Riddle of the Sands.</i> This book has a very deep influence on our history, whether we like it or not.  It is the arch founder of the modern detective novel.  It was also the basis for alerting the British people to the possibilities of German invasion before the First World War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gave Mr. Childers an access to <Col N="641" /> sources in England which were used to a limited extent by us in certain events which followed at that time.  Those doors are still open.  There are certain avenues which could still be explored for friendship between our two countries through the <i>Asgard.</i>  It is an obscure point but is one which is at total variance with certain points made by the Opposition during the last few months with regard to the name Asgard.  There was opposition to the use of this name for the second sail training vessel, which is currently being built at Arklow.  I am very glad that the Minister has retained the name because in doing so he has retained that nebulous thread which in my view is very important.  Deputies on the far side of the House have attempted to hammer this into the ground.  This would not be to the benefit of anybody in the country.</P>
    <P>The name of the boat is a nebulous thing in many ways but it is an emotive thing also.  It is one we should regard with pride.  In regard to <i>Asgard I</i> and her place in the Estimate before us, I congratulate the Minister on his sympathetic handling of that old lady, in seeing that she is preserved with dignity for anybody to have a look at and for future generations.  The thread, nebulous as it is, going back to Boston, also has a link with the Kennedy family.  A Defence Estimate, through various devious channels, has links over a very wide field.  <i>Asgard II</i>, built in Arklow, designed by an Irish-man, built by Irishmen and sailed by Irishmen, is a thread of commercial development which that little port has for a long time, which was lost if it were not for the imaginative act of the Minister in having this boat built.</P>
    <P>It is marvellous to see Cork being used for building our protection vessels. We have in one location ships being built for protection and ships being built for education.  They are totally different types of boats.  One is in wood in traditional style and the other in steel and modern technology, very often of a new type of technology embodying the very latest available both electronically and physically.  The Estimate is providing not alone for tradition but also the outlet for a new <Col N="642" /> electronics industry, which is being attracted here, to advance and help our fishery protection.  It is tradition hand in hand with modern technology.  It is wonderful to see it happening.  I welcome the Estimate and thank the Minister for his energy in allying tradition with modern technology in the service of the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the point Deputy Fox was making was the link between the name of the old craft and the new one.  It was intended to name it something else.  I would, first of all, like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate and, in particular, to express my thanks and appreciation for the expressions of goodwill which were made to me in my role as Minister for Defence, particularly from the spokesmen of the two Opposition parties.  I would like to assure the spokesmen for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, those who have been charged by their Leaders with responsibility in the field of Defence as front bench spokesmen, that I will at all times seek to provide them with information and to be as co-operative as I can in ensuring a very full understanding by them of the role of our Defence Forces at any particular time and any plans which are afoot which can be disclosed. I have already made the facility available to them whereby they may visit any of the military establishments provided advance notice is given of their request for such a visit.  I will be happy to continue that arrangement as long as I am Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly gratified at the large number of Deputies who contributed to the debate and the wide range of subjects which were discussed under the heading of Defence and Military Pensions and also the deep understanding which is so evident among the Deputies of the tasks which face the Permanent Defence Force, the Army, the Navy, the Air Corps, An <Col N="643" /> Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil, An Slua Muirí and the Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned matters appertaining to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, some mentioned matters relating to Fisheries and some referred to EEC matters.  I should like to make it clear at the outset that these are not matters on which I should reply, not matters for decision by me as Minister for Defence.  They are matters which are rightly the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I shall not refer to them in my reply.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked what was the role of the Army in present circumstances. The primary role of the Defence Forces is to provide a deterrent against and resistance to external aggression.  That will always be the primary role of the Defence Forces. They have a secondary role: to provide assistance to the civil power, assistance to the community and assistance to international organisations when requested and when so decided by the Government.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies raised the question of the organisation of the Defence Forces.  Bearing in mind the primary role I mentioned, I should like to add that the role and functions and numerical establishment will be kept under constant review.  A major study of the land forces has been under way in my Department for some time past and up to now decisions have been taken on the question of the territorial organisation of these forces.  Up to last year the forces were organised in three commands and the Curragh Training Camp.  As a result of the organisational review the Command boundaries were redrawn in 1977 to establish four Commands including the new Curragh Command to which I referred in my introductory remarks and which comprises the former Curragh Training Camp and the southern area of the former Eastern Command.</P>
    <P>Deputy White referred to the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and references in it to matters appertaining to the Department of Defence.  I think he said he was disappointed that more progress had not been made in implementing <Col N="644" /> the proposals for Defence which it contained.  It was never stated that the items contained in the manifesto in relation to Defence or any other Department would all be implemented in our first year in office.  Having said that, I should state exactly what has been happening in regard to these matters under the Defence heading.  As regards the question of a new code for the administration of military law, a board of military officers set up by the Adjutant General is examining this matter and they have already furnished an interim report on their deliberations and this is being examined.  It was only recently it was made available to me. Amending legislation may be necessary when decisions are reached on the board's final recommendations or on matters which may otherwise need attention.</P>
    <P>In my introductory remarks I referred to the establishment of the Women's Service Corps.  The departmental committee set up to examine that proposal furnished its first report a short while ago.  It contains a number of recommendations covering the most important aspects of the proposal and these are being considered.  The committee is continuing its work and what I have is just an interim report at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy White and Deputy Bermingham sought an assurance that personnel of the new Women's Service Corps would not displace existing civilian employees.  Deputy Tower had earlier made representations to me on the same subject.  Perhaps it was a rumour but I do not know where this notion came from; Deputies of all parties seem to have had representations about it.  I want to make it quite clear that it is not intended that any civilian employee will lose her job as a result of the establishment of the new corps. Any fears or doubts in the matter can be set at rest.</P>
    <P>The manifesto referred to the introduction of a new and fairer system of promotion.  Promotion procedures are under investigation.  Inquiries as to procedures in other countries have been instituted and the military authorities are considering the importance that should attach to seniority <Col N="645" /> in the context of promotions.  Since the change of Government the existing system is being applied fairly and with due regard to the recommendations of the Chief of Staff.  Whatever system is finally accepted the Minister's statutory function as the promoting authority in respect of officers of the Defence Forces will remain of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to promotions and allegations that had been made in that regard.  I do not wish to go back and rake over cold embers in regard to allegations made or events that may have happened before I became Minister.  I should prefer to let all that settle and take up the task I have been given from the day of my appointment.  I do not wish to go back and make comparisons about what was or was not done by the Coalition, whether they were right or wrong in what they did.  That is the atmosphere in which I should like to work in my Department.  Sufficient, I believe, has been said about that and I do not wish to refer in my reply to what was said that could be deemed to be of that nature.</P>
    <P>Our manifesto also referred to reduction of the age limits.  The arrangement whereby captains, commandants and lieutenant-colonels may be retained to 60 years of age, which is the normal retiring age for a colonel, without interfering with the normal flow of promotion has been well established. If normal retiring ages are to be reduced, the question of the practicability of maintaining this arrangement would arise.  When the current security situation eases it is likely that it will prove necessary to discontinue or substantially modify the current arrangement. At this point of time I merely want to say that I shall keep the matter under review.  I have no immediate plans to bring about a drastic reduction in age limits as such.</P>
    <P>The manifesto also mentioned the question of access to Army hospitals for retired servicemen who may require treatment.  Under current legislation members of the Defence Forces on full-time service and persons in receipt of temporary disability pensions under the Army Pensions Acts in <Col N="646" /> respect of their disabilities due to service are provided with medical and hospital treatment in military hospitals. An outpatient clinic for Old IRA pensioners is also provided at St. Bricin's Hospital.  The question of giving access to Army hospitals to retired servicemen requiring treatment is a complex one.  One must have regard to military requirements, particularly when the Permanent Defence Forces are at high strength, as they are now, to the limitations imposed by the structure of the hospital facilities available and the services available for ex-servicemen under the Health Acts.  Examination of the subject is continuing in order to determine the financial and other implications of the proposal and the feasibility and practicability of extending treatment to ex-servicemen.</P>
    <P>Another matter was the training scheme to prepare men due for discharge for outside employment and the question of further assistance by educational grants if required after discharge. Military service of itself involves the acquisition of a skill which would be useful in helping men on discharge to obtain civilian employment. Some examples of the type of skills which are acquired while serving in the forces are: driver, cook, clerk, fireman, switchboard operator, photographer, barber.  There is a long list of other trades.</P>
    <P>NCOs and privates over 40 years of age may be released for AnCO industrial training courses.  This scheme was introduced in 1970 and is available to the men.  The Department are at present in correspondence with the Department of Labour with a view to waiving the fee which AnCo are now seeking in respect of an NCO who is anxious to undergo an industrial training course with them.  A scheme exists whereby personnel are registered with AnCo as apprentices in various trades, such as fitter, motor mechanic, sheet metal worker, bricklayer, plasterer, painter and decorator.  These personnel attend either full-time off-the-job courses or day release courses.  These are separate from the usual Army and Air Corps apprenticeship competitions.</P>
    <P>There are a number of schemes and special facilities available to men of <Col N="647" /> the Permanent Defence Force which would help to enhance their prospects of obtaining employment when they are discharged.  Following our commitment in the manifesto, I am having the matter examined to see what further measures can be taken in this area.  This examination will seek to determine the extent of the resettlement problem and will consider the possibility of having greater regard in military training generally to the question of civilian employment when they come to leave the Permanent Defence Force.  Under each of the headings mentioned in the manifesto I have initiated action.  Some of them will require very deep study before any steps are taken.</P>
    <P>The one I have advanced most rapidly is the question of establishing the new Women's Service Corps.  This has put a great strain on certain members of the Department staff and military personnel and I am pleased with the outcome of their deliberations so far in implementing this commitment on behalf of the Government.  I expect we will be in a position to introduce the first ladies to the women's corps of the Army some time around the autumn.  I hope full and adequate arrangements will have been made by us in the interim period to ensure the smooth transition and introduction of the ladies to the Army.  I feel they have an important role to play.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the response from the community, and women in particular, that there is a great interest on the part of women to play a role in our Defence Forces.  We do not envisage that women will be involved in any combat duties.  I expect I will have the full support of the House in that.  Front line work should be a man's job. There are a wide range of tasks which can be very competently performed by female members of the Army.  I would like to thank Deputies from the Opposition Parties for their support for the steps taken by the Government in this direction.  It augurs well for the women's corps if there is complete unanimity for its establishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I was asked by a number of Deputies whether the Defence Forces establishments were to be increased.  There are no proposals at present to increase the establishment in regard to the Army.  The House will accept that in regard to the Navy and the Air Corps it will be necessary to increase the establishment because of the expanding role we are being asked to play in the enforcement of fishery regulations.</P>
      <P>On 31 December the establishment figure for the Navy was 636.  That has since been increased to 729&mdash;a major increase since Christmas.  It is my intention to press ahead with further substantial increases in the establishment figure for the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult.  At this moment in time I see a need for an increase of approximately 200 in that establishment figure.  With the vastly increased area to be patrolled following the extension of the fishery limits to 200 miles, one will readily agree that there will be need for more than a doubling of the establishment figure in the Navy.  I can see it grow to a figure of possibly 1,500 in the next few years but no decision has been made on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is under consideration at present.  It will be necessary for us to increase the air surveillance back-up for the Naval Service enforcing the fishery regulations.  We are already using one King Airplane which is on lease to the Government and active consideration is being given to the acquisition of a further aeroplane for surveillance purposes.  This places an extra duty on the Air Corps which will require an increase.  It is already accepted that there is a need for a substantial increase in the number of pilots.</P>
      <P>There has been a big drain on the number of qualified pilots, particularly the more experienced men, in recent times arising from vacancies in Aer Lingus.  This is a national need the Air Corps helped to meet.  Young men who have become cadets in the Air Corps and received training in flying have gone on to successful professional careers in the national commercial airline. This places a great strain on the personnel in the Air Corps to ensure an adequate number of instructors and with the increased demands now being made.  This is an area I am giving some thought to and I intend to take some measures to increase the intake into the Air Corps to enlarge the training facilities and the number of personnel available to carry out that instruction.  It is obvious that the Naval Service and the Air Corps have been under a strain for some time past and that the expansion of both services is a matter of immediate importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies seem to feel we had this £30 million lying on the table and were in a position to avail of it.  This is not so.  The discussions among our partners in the EEC with regard to our fishery policy have not been finalised.  There has been a commitment in regard to the amount of money which will be made available to assist the Irish Government in acquiring the planes and boats they would need adequately to patrol the 200-mile limit on behalf of the Community.</P>
      <P>There has not been agreement in the discussions on fishery policy and the money will not be made available until agreement is reached.  We sought 75 per cent of the cost of the expansion and we decided on the figure of £40 million.  Agreement in principle is all that has emerged for a figure of £30 million, 75 per cent of our estimate. We will be claiming that amount retrospectively for the patrolling we have already been doing.</P>
      <P>In reference to the Naval Service, it has been increased at an enormous rate&mdash;100 per cent in the past 18 months.  We had three mine sweepers and the <i>Deirdre</i> and we now have two patrol vessels plus the <i>Ferdia</i> and the <i>Setanta.</i>  The <i>Ferdia</i> is on lease and is being returned to its owners and it is planned to lease another vessel as replacement. Deputy Cogan referred to the intake of engineering and deck officers.  It takes some time to train them, approximately five years for engine room artificers, and I should like to inform the House that a public competition for naval cadets is being considered as well as some major improvements in conditions.  To expand a navy at the rate now planned by us it is necessary to improve conditions for those serving and to attract people to make their career in the service.  I am examining the conditions and where improvements can be made I will have them brought about.</P>

      <P>It is incumbent on us now to improve conditions so that the attractions offered by commercial firms <Col N="651" /> outside do not attract our men away. There is a seagoing allowance of 71p per day payable to all ranks.  I have this under review and I hope to be able to improve the payment of that allowance in the near future.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies asked about the possibility of having a helicopter pad on fishery protection vessels.  The idea seems attractive and when I was at Verolme at the launching of the <i>Éimear</i> I mentioned to some press people that I hoped the next protection vessel we built would have a helicopter pad and all the ancillary facilities necessary for such a vessel.  In the event I agreed to place an order for another vessel which did not have a helicopter pad.  My reason for doing so was that if we were to have a vessel completely newly designed with a pad, hangar and other necessary facilities it would have to go to the drawing board stage and that would mean delaying the placing of an order for our newest fishery protection vessel, and we could not afford to wait another year before getting the keel laid in Cork.  I asked military personnel, the director of the Navy and the officers of the Department to open up negotiations with dockyard for the ordering of another vessel which is to be on the lines of the <i>Éimear.</i>  I had to cut down to the shortest possible time the gap between the commissioning of the <i>Éimear</i> and of the new vessel&mdash;I must put a name on the new vessel soon because it is difficult to be referring to it as &ldquo;the vessel that is being built in Cork&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kerrigan will appreciate that the employment given in the Cork Dockyard because of the building of the protection vessel is very valuable to the local community.  I had representations from the shop stewards on the day of the launching and subsequently I was happy to instruct the officers of the Department to place the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the new vessel, I will have to be convinced by naval experts and by the experience of other countries involved extensively in fishery protection of the benefit of having a helicopter on board such a vessel.  It <Col N="652" /> will naturally pose great problems of maintenance of the helicopter because of the salt water.  From inquiries made by those who have helicopters on board fishery protection vessels I have found that the use they make of the helicopter is not all that great and because of the additional cost its viability is questionable.</P>

    <P>I rise here tonight to support the amendment in the name of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  He stated himself here last night that the Fianna Fáil manifesto was now becoming the most quoted document since the Bible.  There is another document in existence I think &mdash;maybe it has gone out of existence now for reasons which the Deputies opposite will realise&mdash;which I would like to refer to at the outset.  That document is a rather infamous one which was brought out before the 1973 General Election.  It was the 14-point programme presented by the Coalition, as they were at that time and the Coalition Government as they became, consisting of 14 points which they felt would help to bring about changes in our country.  It was entitled <i>There is an Alternative.</i>  Indeed, as we know, looking back with hindsight, there was an alternative to the prosperity and stability that this country had been experiencing for several years under a Fianna Fáil Government.  In relation to prices this document stated that the immediate economic aim of the new Government would be to stabilise prices, halt redundancies and reduce unemployment under a programme of planned economic development. The document went on to say that it was essential to control prices if these important aims were to be realised, and that therefore the Government would introduce strict price control. These statements were believed at the time by a significant number of the Irish people.  Of the 14 points in that programme the one which helped <Col N="654" /> most perhaps to bring about a change of Government was the one on prices and price control.  It made the greatest impact on all of us and it was a pledge which was sadly forgotten in the four-and-a-half years of Coalition Government. We discovered as we went into the last six months of the Coalition reign that a certain degree of fatalism had set in in the minds of Irish people: they felt there was nothing the Government of the time could do to try to control prices.  This was right at the time, because the Coalition Government did not make any significant effort in this regard.  Sad to say, some members of the public got the impression that any alternative to the Coalition Government would achieve relatively the same results as that Government had up to then.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Barry Desmond referred to the excellent work which has been undertaken by the National Prices Commission.  Here tonight on behalf of the people of this country I would like to take this opportunity of expressing our sincere appreciation for the devoted service which has been given by the National Prices Commission since their establishment by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1971.  The volume of work they have undertaken and which goes through their hands is evident from the very many pages of detailed study and report they present to the Minister each month.  The reports themselves are a very valuable guide to many aspects of price control and economic trends.  I am speaking for all of the Irish people when I say we are deeply indebted to them for their excellent work.</P>
    <P>The NPC are an independent body. They comprise representatives of industry, of trade unions and of the consumers. They can make any recommendation they wish on a price increase, which must go to them before it is approved or even considered by the Minister, and the NPC have it at their disposal to ensure that their recommendation is not only an independent one but one which is well researched and based on concrete evidence.  They have resources to help them to ensure that the cost increases claimed by the manufacturer have <Col N="655" /> actually occurred and that therefore the increase in price which the manufacturer is looking for is justified.  The commission have not only a large consultancy unit of their own but also the power and money to engage independent consultants if they feel that their own substantial consultancy unit is insufficient for the type of work and detailed study which they wish to do before making a recommendation to the Minister.</P>
    <P>A criticism which has probably frequently been made&mdash;and has been void&mdash;is that the Minister of the day acts merely as a rubber stamp accepting recommendations of the NPC for price increases.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to assure not only the House but also the members of the public at large that since assuming office early in July last year this Government have taken all possible steps to ensure that only a minimum of price increases has been passed on to the consumer.  This has meant that all recommendations for price increases by the NPC have been under stringent examination and control by the Minister himself.  That is why I say that the commitment of the Fianna Fáil Government to stabilising and controlling prices was brought a step further when the Government insisted that we revert to the pre-1973 position in that a member of the Government would be directly responsible for all price control.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole was here last night when the Minister spoke, and, as he knows now, there were quite a significant number of price increases awaiting the Minister's approval which had been shelved by my predecessor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know why.  I said &ldquo;quite a significant number&rdquo;.  I suggest that 11 price increases in our community at any time is a significant number.  One of those was a proposal to increase significantly the price of building materials.  The Minister decided that in order to avoid a rapid escalation in the price of building <Col N="656" /> materials, which would have its consequent effect on employment within the industry, he would refuse in full the price increases which had been recommended by the commission. Since then the Minister has cut back the commission's recommendations for increases in the prices of tea, flour, wheatmeal and bottled gas.  These I would consider are all basic commodities, and the cutbacks which have been made by the Minister resulted in significant savings to the consumer generally.  In all of the cases where the Minister refused increases or where cutbacks were made he was confident that the firms concerned were capable of bearing the increased costs involved without any damage to their viability.</P>
      <P>This Government are committed to ensuring that only the minimum price increases are passed on to the consumer. The results of the Government's vigilance have already been reflected in the consumer price index.  The annual rate of inflation recorded in November 1977 was down to 10.8 per cent. This means that in a little more than one year the annual rate of inflation of 20.6 per cent recorded in November 1976 has been almost halved.</P>
      <P>Of vital importance to the consumer is the increase in the food heading in the consumer price index.  In this connection I am very pleased to note that the annual rate of increase in the food index for November 1977 was the lowest recorded since May 1974.  Like the Minister and all of us on this side of the House, I had to listen to people who scoffed at the promises and the pledges given in our election manifesto when we said we could achieve single figure inflation in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our estimates&mdash;based, of course, on the acceptance of the national wage agreement&mdash;are for inflation rates for February of 8.6 per cent and for May of this year of 6.6 per cent.  It is in the interest of all of us, and of our country, that those of us who have power&mdash;as all of us here have&mdash;should call on trade union members and urge the trade unions generally to accept the proposals in the national wage agreement. It is despicable that some prominent Members of the far side of <Col N="657" /> the House should have felt the necessity to do a somersault on some of their statements in this regard over the past couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>One does not need to have a tremendous memory to remember times in 1974 and 1975 when annual inflation was running at well in excess of 20 per cent, and when it achieved an all time record of 24½ per cent in the year to May 1975.  Last night the Minister informed the House of major reductions in the prices of petrol, home heating oils, other petroleum products, margarine, cooking fats, electricity charges, tea, coffee and frozen vegetables. I do not intend to go into that list of price reductions again.</P>
    <P>The Minister also announced a further substantial reduction in the price of electricity.  This further reduction in electricity costs will have a significant effect on production costs particularly for our larger industries. It will make its contribution to the Government's plan and programme for the reduction of massive unemployment which unfortunately we on this side of the House had to inherit.  After many long lean years of Coalition Government, it is refreshing for us as consumers to hear of price reductions.  It is reassuring for all members of the public to be told about them.</P>
    <P>At the Minister's request, the National Prices Commission are keeping under review&mdash;a subject which was introduced here last night by Deputy Desmond&mdash;the cost of imported materials and goods, particularly those which affect consumer prices.  The object of this review is to ensure that reductions in import prices are speedily reflected in the prices which have to be paid by consumers.  The Minister asked the commission to pay particular attention to this matter.  In the light of certain circumstances the price of many commodities on the world market are dropping either through a drop in the producer countries' prices in some cases or as a result of the appreciation of sterling.  The Minister's action will ensure that all benefits from reduced imported prices will be passed on to the consumer as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Opposition tried unsuccessfully in the past&mdash;and they tried it again <Col N="658" /> last night&mdash;to make capital out of the removal of the consumer subsidy on cheese and the reduction in the town gas subsidy.  It bears repeating here tonight that these reductions were more than offset by an increase in the consumer subsidy on butter and milk. Furthermore, as the Minister pointed out last night, the expenditure on subsidies on essential commodities will amount to £69.8 million in 1978, which is an increase in excess of £8 million over actual expenditure in 1977.</P>
    <P>The Government have succeeded in a relatively short period of time in halting the mad gallop of inflation to which this country had become accustomed and which prevailed under the previous Government.  I now call upon all consumers to help the Government in their fight against inflation. Consumers can act as watchdogs on the prices charged by different traders. I should like to encourage all consumers to bring complaints of over-charging or seemingly excessive prices to the notice of my Department so that they can be investigated immediately.</P>
    <P>I was glad Deputy O'Toole acted as a responsible consumer here last night when he suggested that excessive prices seemed to have been charged in two supermarket chains in his own constituency. As we know, complaints of this nature can be brought to the Minister's attention, to the attention of the Department, or the attention of the prices inspectors in the Priceline offices located in various centres throughout the country.  The value of the Priceline service to the consumer is illustrated by the fact that, during the year ended 31 December 1977, more than 4,000 complaints were received at the Priceline centres.  It is interesting to note that, as a direct result of the work being done by the price inspectorate, refunds were made in 1,515 cases in the past year.</P>
    <P>One part of the Fianna Fáil manifesto states:</P>
    <P>full dissemination at least once a week, to radio, television and newspapers of comparative prices of the most frequently purchased consumer goods in supermarkets etc., in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> We have always stressed the role of consumer information on prices, promoting price competition and, of course, helping to reduce excessive variations in prices at local and retail level.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission have provided a good deal of that in their monthly reports.  The reports can run into very large volumes with very many pages.  Very often the information in these reports gets to the consumer too late.  To achieve maximum effect, any information we give the consumer must be available quickly and speedily, so that people can use that information about prices in their daily shopping routines.  This probably applies most importantly of all to grocery items which are the basic commodities all of us as consumers buy each week.  Because it takes time to prepare and publish the monthly report of the National Prices Commission, it is not always possible to get this information to the consumer in time.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated last night, RTE now provide a short price survey programme on the radio each Friday morning before 10 a.m.  It was decided that the prices information on this programme should be concentrated initially on fruit and vegetable prices in the Dublin area.  It was felt that as this is an experiment, if you like, in consumer information, it was best to start on a small scale and see how successful the idea would be.  The retail prices used by RTE are collected by prices inspectors in various centres throughout the Dublin area on each Thursday morning.  These outlets include supermarkets, greengrocers and ordinary general grocery outlets.  Prices are analysed for eight areas of the city, and details of the range of prices in each area are provided to RTE together with a short commentary on the prices and quality of each fruit and vegetable.  The data on prices are supplemented in the commentary by isolating the most common price being charged.</P>
    <P>The Department are also supplying details each month of retail meat prices taken from a regular meat price <Col N="660" /> survey which has been in existence since 1974.  Average retail prices are collected for various cuts of beef, lamb, bacon and pork and, of course, for chickens in Athlone, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo and Waterford.  These prices are submitted to RTE together with a brief commentary comparing supermarket meat prices with meat prices in ordinary butchers' shops.  I would like to refer consumers and housewives in general to this price information which is at present being disseminated on radio.</P>
    <P>The success of failure of this type of consumer service depends entirely on the response we get from housewives and consumers in general.  It depends on the consumer reaction we get.  I urge consumer groups, individuals, traders or trade associations to give their comments to us or to RTE. It is only from the comments we will receive that we will realise whether or not the service is sufficient or where it can be improved.  Deputies opposite will recall that last November I answered a question about the dissemination of information and spoke of our plan in connection with this and consumer education generally.  I hope to be in a position in the near future to introduce what I consider to be a comprehensive programme of consumer information and education generally.  I am assured of the full support of the Consumer Association of Ireland, the Irish Housewives Association and all other responsible consumers and bodies who represent them in preparing this.</P>
    <P>The House has already been told by the Minister of the other measures we have taken to ensure the control of prices and the charges for goods and services.  Those measures are worth support.  Therefore, I feel that the Opposition would look very foolish were they to suggest that the Government have not kept their promise or will not in future fulfil their promises fully.  Before I conclude I should like to refer briefly to two matters dealt with by Deputy Barry Desmond last night.  He said that the Minister's contribution was totally irrelevant.  The press and the public were present when he made that statement and I am sure <Col N="661" /> they all agree that the headlines in today's newspapers prove the total inaccuracy of his contribution.  The Minister gave truthful figures last night, but of course the truth is often a bitter pill to swallow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also referred to the Minister's statement about putting revised guidelines to the National Prices Commission.  He said there was not a thought in the Minister's head of what those guidelines should be and told the House that the Minister was making an untrue statement.  While Deputy Desmond did not deliberately intend to tell a lie or state that the Minister was making an untrue statement, he fully realises that the Government, and in particular the Minister responsible for controlling prices, are firmly committed to the control of prices and the charges for goods and services and to subsidising the price of certain essential items.  I am sure the House will note with satisfaction the significant decrease in inflation in the past six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of weeks ago the House heard a speech from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development from which one could be forgiven for drawing the conclusion that a sort of political Salvation Army had made its appearance among the ranks of Irish politicians and was going to play on street corners, figuratively speaking, until they had converted us all to the light.  He gave the impression that there was going to be an end to tendentious statistics, an end to the abuse of figures, an end to the half-truths. The Minister said it made him sick to hear people with an academic background giving an account of a situation which was misleadingly incomplete. I have had occasion since then to decline to take lectures from that Minister, or any other Minister, along those lines.  The reason I will not take such a lecture is because I find examples daily from people on his side of the House which prove to me that he made no converts near at hand. The rest of his Government have not enrolled in his personal Salvation Army.  When I find that the other members of his Government, and his backbenchers, have enrolled under his <Col N="662" /> generalship I will look into my heart and ask myself if I should join it.</P>
      <P>An example of what I mean by that was provided last night by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It was not possible for me to attend to listen to the Minister but I read his speech in the unrevised Official Report.  I find that in support of his amendment&mdash;this gives me an excuse for saying this because I would not have had that excuse had we been confined to the terms of the motion&mdash; which refers to a significant decrease in the rate of inflation in the last six months, he cited the inflation figures for this country over the last months and years without the slightest or remotest reference either to world conditions or to the factors which produced it or those which are now very happily making it decrease.</P>
      <P>I said before that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development appears to be developing the not very lovable political habit of choosing what he wants to defend and slipping away from the dirty work.  I want the House to believe that I do not intend to begin a personal vendetta against a man for whom I have a great regard but when he lectures us along those lines, taking damn good care not to fall in behind tendentious statements uttered by his own people, I confess a certain amount of a lessening of that regard.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy spoke about inflation, about the glory of getting back, as he said, to 6½ per cent by the middle of May.  He told us that that was the prediction of one of his officials.  Of course we have not got those figures yet and the Minister admitted that his official was making the best guess he could.  He pointed out that he was an experienced official.  He anticipated that the figure for mid-February will be about 8½ per cent and that by May it will be down to about 6½ per cent.  I think the Minister is right.  That is the kind of figure we will get.  That is what my Government stated a year ago but it did not prevent us being contradicted even when we pointed to the economic indicators which showed that we were moving in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> Those figures are turning out as we predicted, to within a fraction of a point of what we predicted.  There is no reference to the large scale long-term trends which made that likely and which were visible 12 or 18 months ago.  Is there any reference to the fact that they were the figures we predicted and that they largely rested on events which had taken place in the lifetime of our Government, some of which we had no control over like the rise in the value of the pound which has been more strongly marked since then?  Some items occurred during our time in office like the very painstaking though successfully negotiated national wage agreement which was achieved in the beginning of 1977.  We did not hear a reference to those matters from a Minister who occupies a senior economic ministry.  He made no reference whatever to what happened in the rest of the world, particularly among our trading partners from whom we import.  There was no reference by him to the factors which operated in other infinitely larger economies and which tend to determine the overwhelming portion of our inflation, or lack of it as the case may be.</P>
    <P>A Minister like Deputy O'Malley advancing the kind of stuff he did last night in a parliament anywhere else in the EEC would make a public show of himself, because the people would not permit themselves to be fooled by the insinuation that inflation was a product purely of Government action. Undoubtedly, some forms of Government action will aggravate inflation. Some forms of Government action, which may be unavoidable for political or social reasons, will temporarily aggravate inflation; but, equally, some Government measures may improve inflation but at a cost in employment, at a cost in human misery.  I am not saying that inflation is completely outside the powers of Government but a large portion of the factors which create inflation, particularly in a small economy like ours, are imported.  We must remember that the entire industrial world went through a most appalling economic typhoon in the <Col N="664" /> years which fell in the middle of the period of office of the National Coalition and when one looks at the curbs in the inflation figures in other economies one must recognise that we came out of that situation relatively good.</P>
    <P>These figures are widely available. Let me quote a few to the House in order to dispel, if I can, the sort of mí-ádh there is in this country on truth and straightness.  I will quote from OECD and EEC figures.  In the &ldquo;beano&rdquo; years of Fianna Fáil, from 1963 to 1973, the average inflation rate in the entire EEC was 4.6 per cent.  In Britain in the same period the average was 5.6 per cent, and in Ireland, in those golden years we are being asked to look back on with nostalgia by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and which, she would have us believe, are here again, the inflation rate was 6.7 per cent.  In the orthodoxies of the 1960s that was a damnable inflation rate.  Those figures, which were very high according to the standards of those days, were deliberately and recklessly contributed to in 1964 by an unheard of wage round in this country of 12 per cent which had not even been sought but was gratuitously handed out in order to win two miserable by-elections, one for Deputy Boylan in Kildare and another in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been put in to try to put off their stride people who might say something damaging.  I wonder will the Minister for Economic Planning and Development stand over Deputy Killilea when he comes in and behaves like this?  I am used to him.  Thousands of jobs were sacrificed by embarking us on an inflation rate from which we have never recovered.  That is the record of <Col N="665" /> the golden years, the Lemass era, the rising tide lifting all boats.</P>
      <P>I will tell something else about a somewhat longer spell, from 1960 to 1973.  In 1960 there were 100,000 more people at work here than in 1973.  It is true that new industrial jobs had been created, but they went nowhere near picking up the shortfall and the slack in lost agricultural employment. One of the reasons was our inflation rate which was a difficult one and a damaging one by the standards of those days.  It made our manufactured goods less competitive than they otherwise might have been.</P>
      <P>In 1974 the EEC average inflation rate was 12.7 per cent, needless to say in the wake of the oil crisis.  In 1975 the rate was 12.9 per cent.  It tailed off in 1976 and in that year it was down to 10.3 per cent.  In the year to October 1977, it was 9.3 per cent.  In Britain the curve was more drastic but it was of a similar shape.  The inflation rate there was up to 16 per cent in 1974 and 24.2 per cent in 1975.  In 1976 it dropped back sharply to 16.5 per cent. In the months to October 1977 it was 14.1 per cent and from January 1977 to January 1978 it has gone down to 9.9 per cent.</P>
      <P>The British are celebrating now like everybody else the drop below 10 per cent in their inflation rate.  It is the first time in years it has been below 10 per cent, but the point I am trying to impress on the House is that all those countries have had a similar inflation curve in the last years, triggered off by the oil crisis and by the rise in commodity prices.  We have had the same kind of curve and we are a much more defenceless economy.  When people were thrown out of work here it was in a situation where we already had a high unemployment rate, far higher than any of the EEC countries, three times the rate of many of them.</P>
      <P>Suddenly, in the middle of 1974 and in 1975 people were thrown out of work by the tens of thousands.  That became an immediate burden on the Exchequer and we were forced to continue our programme of improving social welfare payments for all categories. Never had the old age pension age been lowered until we got into office.</P>

      <P>He has nothing to say but by way of interruption.  He said last night that we were back, thanks to Fianna Fáil, to the 1973 inflation figure.  I do not thank him for that. We were heading for that anyway even if there had not been a Government in the country in the last year.  It could not have been avoided once the £ strengthened.  There was only one way a Government, whether Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's or mine, could possibly have avoided the inflation figure from coming down, and that was by printing money, and I believe this Government are embarked on a course which will end up with them printing money.  I believe we will see a progression which will end in monetary measures never seen before here.</P>
      <P>There are the facts about inflation. The course which the curve of inflation has taken is a benign one and we are all happy about that.  I expect to see the figures mentioned by the Minister borne out in a couple of weeks' time and I would not be surprised if his figure of 6.6 per cent is borne out in May.  That was all predictable and predicted a year ago, and the amount this Government have contributed towards it is absolutely marginal.  The amount which any Government can contribute, except by going mad and printing money, to a long-term development of that kind is very slight.  I will leave the question of inflation, which was so dishonestly treated here last night.  A myth is in creation under our eyes that all one has to do is vote Fianna Fáil into office and the inflation rate will fall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The inflation figures, which were bad to start with in 1973, rose in 1974 under the impact of the oil crisis to 17 per cent and rose in 1975 to 20.9 per cent.  In 1976 they were comparable with the British figures and a good deal better than the figures in other European countries and stood at 18 per cent.  In October 1977 the figure had fallen to 13.5 per cent and I scarcely imagine that the Fianna Fáil Government will take credit for a figure resulting last October.  We said at the beginning of the year that inflation figures would keep going down and would be below 10 per cent in 1978.  That has happened. I know it is politics&mdash;and I do not whinge about it&mdash;that a Government should try to claim the credit for something they did not do.  The degree to which any Government can influence long-term developments of this type is very slight.</P>
      <P>There is one area of this whole matter in which the National Coalition are vulnerable.  It is an area in which I will willingly admit we made a mistake.  I said this even when we were in office.  We should never have made the promise in regard to controlling prices.  It was a rash promise.  The only thing I can urge on the House in mitigation is that it was a promise made in the heat of an unexpected election.  It should not have been made. I hope that no Government or prospective Government will ever again make such a promise.  The Government in a country like this cannot control prices.  The Minister of State describes mechanisms which were set up by my Government for monitoring prices and giving consumers the chance to obtain refunds.  A certain amount can be done but the broad spectrum of price increases is not within the control of the Government unless they exercise the same iron control over wages and other costs. Some of these are commodity costs on goods which are imported and would be outside the control of the greatest tyranny that ever existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing this country were self-sufficient in commodities and raw materials, which it is not, certainly one could control prices if one could <Col N="668" /> dictate and make stick wage rates and if one did not mind locking up people who would picket and demonstrate against those measures.  There would not be any problem here if we had a system such as they have in Rumania. In Eastern Europe inflation is virtually unknown.  They control their costs at the expense of people and the way people live.  Certainly we can control prices if we live under such a system, but I would not want it and I am sure Deputies opposite would not wish it either.  Unless such measures are possible and ordinary ways of doing business are thrown out of the window, price control is not possible except within a very restricted range.</P>
    <P>That being so, the House may wonder why the motion is phrased as it is.  I will try to explain that.  I believe that prices over the large spectrum cannot be controlled except in a marginal way with Priceline monitoring and that sort of thing.  We could, however, select sections of the population which are relatively defenceless and control prices for them, either by directly controlling prices in their special category, which means an administratively complicated system of vouchers or tokens, or effectively control the price by a proper system of social welfare payments.  Either form of control will amount to the same number of pounds and pence in their pockets.</P>
    <P>I very much object to being told that merely because the general inflation rate is sinking the social welfare improvements of the kind put forward by the Minister for Finance at the beginning of last month are justified and adequate.  That is not so.  The inflation rate is based on calculations which take into account many goods. services and commodities which are not of any use or interest to the poorer sections of the community.  The poorer and more deprived old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients are, the less use they will have for these commodities.  This motion was inspired by recent increases in bread, the staple of poor people.  We were met with a triumphalistic roar from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, as though he had personally seen to it that <Col N="669" /> the inflation rate would fall into single figures.  It was a shameful reaction.</P>
    <P>An increase in social welfare payments of 10 per cent across the board this year is not enough for the poorest classes of the community who are hit by increases in commodities like bread and by the removal of the subsidy on town gas.  It is not enough to maintain the standard of living which was maintained by the Coalition in the worst of times, faced with the oil crisis and carrying an unprecedented number of unemployed.  The Coalition never shirked.  They looked after first the people who most needed help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to end with a constructive suggestion which I hope the Minister will take to heart.  There ought to be a separate CPI for a class of person which I know one would have to construct artificially.  There should be a separate CPI for the most helpless members of the community, particularly pensioners.  I can see the administrative difficulties in controlling prices selectively for sections of the community like that.  If it is not possible to do it there should be a price index according to which their social welfare benefits are adjusted rather than the consumer price index or the inflation rate.  I said that in other words during the budget debate or on some other recent occasion. When we are invited to admire, as though it were something sent down from heaven by special intercession of the Fianna Fáil Party, one-figure inflation rates, which were largely created by developments which occurred during the time of the Government's predecessor, and at the same time expected not to complain about price rises, which hit the very poorest and most helpless section of the community, then it is time we looked seriously at whether or not there is anything radical that can be done to improve the situation for them.  My suggestion is that we should have a separate price index, in which things which are no use to them and which do not interest them, are left out and we would have a price index which is intended to reflect the needs of the people at the bottom of the heap, and that price index would give the Government some guidance in regard to the calculation of social welfare increases and would also perhaps direct their attention to the possibility of some kind of selective <Col N="671" /> price control for those sections of the community, if not for the community at large.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed this motion was on prices and subsidies but it appears we have been treated to a range of items which I cannot quite reconcile as having anything to do with prices.  It is a sad situation for that reason that the Opposition should put down a motion and then have so little concrete facts and figures to produce on this subject.  Deputy Kelly mentioned the word &ldquo;beano&rdquo;. As I recall it that was a comic.  This motion is a comic.</P>
      <P>We have also been treated to a recall of what happened in 1964 and 1969 and how inflation is controlled in Rumania and many other diverse aspects of a wide ranging number of subjects which have nothing at all to do with prices.  Deputy Desmond last night pinpointed a number of areas during the Coalition period of office and highlighted the fact that inflation got as high as 25 per cent.  It is an indictment of that Government's handling of the country's affairs that inflation was allowed to rise to that high percentage.</P>
      <P>Price control has been discussed. We all know that is a very complex subject.  There is only one way to control prices, confidence in the economy. When the overall development of the economy is going along on a controlled basis one can readily get co-operative price control.  I believe this motion was put down for a very sinister reason at a very crucial time as we watch the responsible members of trade unions assess the recent National Pay Agreement.  The Government have urged members of trade unions to support the package.  We have gone to great lengths to explain why this package should be accepted in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an 8 per cent wage increase. The Minister last night was able to inform the House that he hopes to see a reduction in ESB charges in the near future.  That is a bonus which was not forthcoming during the negotiations for the national pay agreement. <Col N="672" /> We suggest to the country at large that the acceptance of this agreement is a most positive step in ensuring that the forecasted inflation rate of 6.6 per cent will be achieved by May.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, for the first time in many years, is in a position to look forward and to be confident of achieving the plans which his Department have laid before the House since coming into office.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the relevance of the comments we had about the budget. A scare situation has been introduced by the Opposition in discussing this motion.  The trend of their comments was very far removed from actual prices.  One feels that empty vessels make most sound.  One can find very little constructive detail on facts and figures to back up the motion.  It is very hard to understand the Opposition's real reason for putting down the motion.  I feel they are timing the motion for when members of trade unions go to vote on the national pay agreement.  It is the height of irresponsible opposition to do so.  I urge the trade union members to look very closely at the very well-constructed package put before the people for this financial year.  It is a forward-looking and a rewarding period when we have controlled prices not by gimmicks as we have been led to believe were available during the Coalition period but by restoring confidence in the economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly went on to highlight isolated incidents where a couple of items have recently been increased. He also criticised the fact that a 10 per cent increase for social welfare payments was introduced in the recent budget.  The recipients of that percentage can look forward to a financial year which will see that amount of money in their pockets and allow them to make necessary purchases.  We, hopefully, do not propose to have a budget a week, as was the order of the day by the previous Government.  We, therefore, are in a position to feel we can control prices constructively, as has been the case since taking office last June.</P>
    <P>We have seen petrol reduced by 5p <Col N="673" /> a gallon and with the impending ESB reductions this will have a tremendous spin-off benefit for the domestic user, the employer, the commercial farmer, the co-operative and many other people.  Every organisation and individual need electricity or it affects their overall butget in some way.  We can see an invisible benefit for the people when this price reduction takes effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole highlighted the motor insurance increase yesterday. When one looks at the details of this particular increase one sees that the accident-free driver is not subjected to a very substantial increase.  It is scare tactics on behalf of the Opposition and not very responsible.  I believe the work of this House is to charter the course of the country and provide the people with the leadership and example which are so necessary to bring about an improvement.</P>
    <P>This motion has done nothing but show the lack of research by the Opposition in coming forward with a motion which they could not really back up in great detail.  It is a waste of Dáil time to have this motion down for discussion at all.  We have Ministers who are quite busy in job creation and involved in consumer affairs tied up here listening to speeches that have no relevance to prices.  We have been treated to a whole range of different topics having nothing to do with the motion.  We on this side of the House are confident that prices will stabilise and that whatever increases must be granted will be of an acceptable percentage or level.  Never again will we have the type of increases which this country experienced during the National Coalition period in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that what Deputy Lawlor said about being irrelevant will not apply to what I have to say.  To my mind, his reference to all speeches from this side of the House being irrelevant is a reflection on the handling of the debate by the Chair, something with which I do not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night in my opening remarks I commented, I hope with some relevance, on actual price increases.  Subsequently, <Col N="674" /> the Minister made at least one statement to the effect that I had made fraudulent claims in the figures quoted. That is a very serious allegation.  I can now say categorically that any figures I gave were given in good faith and at no time was any fraudulent comment by me intended.  I do not think that the allegation of fraudulent comment has been proved against me.</P>
    <P>The Minister chose to ignore any reference to price increases.  He did give, and I was glad to hear it, some information on what our inflation rate would be in the not too distant future. He gave us some information on price reductions which I was also delighted to hear about.  But despite what Deputy Lawlor has said, we have had price increases.  Let me endorse what Deputy Kelly said some time ago, that many of those price increases have come about due to causes over which the present Government or any Government could have no control.  The fact is that they have come about and the Government of the day must take responsibility for them regardless of whether or not they are responsible. That is the name of the game; that is what being in Government means.</P>
    <P>We have had published as recommended and sanctioned 182 price increases so far, 11 of which we are told were inherited by the present Minister from the previous administration. These 182 price increases are for the period up to the end of October 1977. The Minister referred to price decreases, a decrease in the price of petrol which was also mentioned by Deputy Lawlor, and further reductions in the price of tea and coffee.  What Deputy Kelly said tonight here is borne out exactly and very accurately in the commodities which have shown a reduction in prices.  These are commodities the prices of which are not controlled by the Government here, regardless of which Government that may be.  We import oil; we import coffee and tea, and if the price of tea were to go to £5 per pound in the morning, as it nearly did some months ago, would the Government of the day claim responsibility for it in the same way as they claim that they are responsible for reductions when these <Col N="675" /> happen?  I do not think so, because it would be politically unsound to do so.</P>
    <P>The price levels of these commodities are dictated by factors operating many thousands of miles from our shores.  I do not think the Minister himself believes that our people are as naive and gullible as to accept that kind of implication that he and his Government must be thanked for reductions in the prices of these commodities. There are external factors; we all know that; let us leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The Minister chose to avail of the debate to announce&mdash;I was glad to hear it&mdash;the reduction in the price of electricity.  He said it was a substantial decrease and, if I remember correctly, a very substantial one.  I expected something in the region of 15 or 20 per cent.  It transpires that it was 5 per cent: that is the expected reduction. We should be thankful for small mercies and I am grateful for that news but in announcing the reduction the Minister indulged in what I can only regard as a cosmetic exercise in verbiage.  He said, and the record will show, that the price reduction came about as a result of discussions he had with the chairman of the ESB.  The implication is obvious to everybody; I do not think there is a man, woman or child who would not see the blatant implication that it was the Minister himself who went to the chairman of the ESB and said: &ldquo;Reduce prices by 5 per cent.  So be it.&rdquo;  We all know that is not so.  If it were so I would make a very sensible suggestion to the Minister.  He should meet, consult and discuss with every board chairman of every semi-State body as quickly as possible, and hopefully the same results will ensue if what he said last night is true.</P>
    <P>The facts concerning the reduction in the price of ESB charges are well known to anybody who takes the trouble to find them out.  The ESB for some time back have had an arrangement with the National Prices Commission to have a fuel cost variation revised, I think, twice yearly.  That has been going on for some time.  We all know that the fuel variation cost is <Col N="676" /> one of the elements in our ESB bills. It so happens that at present due to the pound, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the US dollar, a position has been reached whereby a reduction can be brought about in this fuel variation charge.  It is as simple as that and I am glad that this is so.</P>
    <P>The fact is the ESB purchase their oil at a price in US dollars and because of that system they get the benefits which are now accruing because of the upward strengthening of the pound as against the dollar.  Hence the reduction in the fuel variation charge and the overall reduction, hopefully, in our ESB bills in the near future.</P>

      <P>Last night I mentioned the enormous increase which came about last week in the cost of car insurance which is a very basic commodity, because nowadays most people have cars.  Cars are essential and are no longer looked upon as luxuries.  The cost of that increase must be borne by the consumer.  In announcing the increase the Minister made vague references to three factors which necessitated the level of increase of 35 per cent: first, an overall increase in administration cost, which is acceptable, justifiable and understandable; second, statutory requirements, and third, EEC regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last two factors have been left hanging in mid-air.  They have not been explained.  What were the statutory requirements which brought about the necessity to increase insurance premiums to this level?  What were the EEC directives which brought about this position?  Unless the Minister is prepared to give a full explanation <Col N="677" /> why this position was reached, unless he gives an itemised account of the reasons for this increase, and in the light of his Ard-Fheis reference to this company which set the people up to expect what was later to come when he mentioned that the PMPA were the only insurance company genuinely open for business and castigated other companies for not being interested in competition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a public inquiry must be sought to clear the air.  I appreciate that this increase came through the normal channels recommended by the National Prices Commission for whom I have the greatest respect, but they are not the agency involved.  They are not expected by the general public to explain why the increase was recommended.  Ultimately the final say rests with the Minister. As his Minister for State pointed out, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, is no rubber stamp.  While he saw fit to cut down on the demands made by other companies looking for price increases, he did not do it in the case of this insurance company which has what could be regarded as something approaching a monopoly of insurance business.  They reached the situation of carrying 60 per cent of the insurance car cover in the country by dangling the carrot of the low premiums.  Fine, but having dangled that carrot and having had 60 per cent of insured motorists reacting favourably to it, we are now faced with the position where a Minister has to come in and save that company from itself by allowing an increase of an enormous level.  Who pays?  The consumer.  This is something to which the Minister did not refer last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to prices in general is very plain.  As Deputy Kelly said we are a small open economy subject to fluctuations which take place outside the country.  The strange thing is that when good news is being disseminated the Minister makes sure he is there to do it and takes credit for it despite the fact that it is obvious <Col N="678" /> to everybody that he is not in a position to do so because conditions further afield have brought about the position where he can make this announcement.  If and when the items now being reduced in price are put up in price again&mdash;I hope it will not happen&mdash;I hope the Minister will not stand opposite me and say he is not responsible because factors outside his control were the cause.</P>

I have a right to do it, and I will defend that right regardless of what has been said from the Government benches.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper report alleging that prison officers receive only one week's training confined to purely custodial functions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>: Yes, and I regard it as just another attempt to demoralise prison staff by an organisation that purports to act on behalf of prisoners and to have an accurate knowledge of prison conditions. The statement is, of course, completely untrue.  The initial training course lasts for ten weeks.  After he has taken up duty the prison officer receives further on-the-job training which is supplemented by special courses in many cases.  The suggestion that training is confined to purely custodial techniques is without foundation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper report that boys in St. Patrick's Institution, Dublin, receive only one hour's education a day; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The impression sought to be conveyed by the so-called Prisoners Rights Organisation is, in this instance also, a false one.  It is true that less than half of the offenders in St. Patrick's attend class but that is largely due to the fact that a large number do not want to and, naturally, nobody is forced to attend classes if he does not want to. Save for those serving very short sentences&mdash;less than three months.  of whom there are generally about 15&mdash; education is available in St. Patrick's for any offender who wishes to avail himself of it.  It would be extremely difficult to achieve any worth-while progress in educating those serving very short sentences but remedial instruction is provided in appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>At present out of a total population of approximately 190, between 70 and 80 attend classes for an average of three hours per day, not one hour as alleged in the report referred to, on five days a week.  In the institution there is a fully-equipped education unit complete with facilities for the teaching of metal-work, arts and crafts, and remedial and general studies.  Nine teachers work in the unit and the courses are closely related in content to education programmes offered in vocational schools.  In addition about 40 boys, some of whom also attend the formal educational classes, receive training in carpentry, motor repairs, tailoring, plumbing, painting, plastering or toy manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While offenders serving sentences of between three and six months attend educational classes, they present special problems for the teachers in trying to fit them into the educational programmes because of the shortness of their sojourn in the institution.  An extension to the education unit is in course of construction and when this <Col N="598" /> is ready it is hoped to introduce specially designed programmes for these offenders.  At present about 45 offenders are serving such sentences.</P>
