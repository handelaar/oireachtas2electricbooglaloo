      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach which Minister within his Government is responsible for the co-ordination of urban development policy which would result in the provision of infrastructural needs such as telecommunications and public transport in the construction of housing estates and roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment but only in a very general way because the local planning authority are the co-ordinating agency for such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, in the interests of communication could he elaborate on the way local authorities, in particular, are responsible for co-ordinating the activities of, say, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Transport and Tourism other than by way of simple communication?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Fundamentally they are the local planning authority.  That is an indication of what their functions are in this respect.  I understand that, in any event, it is a matter of practice that they consult with authorities such as the ESB and the Post Office in relation to infrastructural undertakings which such authorities would propose in their areas and <i>vice versa.</i>  Obviously it is only with their co-operation and approval, and possibly with their permission in many cases, that these activities can be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that essentially there is no change as a result of either the creation of the Department of the Environment or the Department of Economic Planning and Development in the traditional role local authorities have undertaken with regard to the provision of urban services? Is that the extent of the Taoiseach's answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) if it is correct that Garda Commissioner Garvey, after 38 years service to the nation, was dismissed on two hours' notice; (b) if so, if he considers such dismissal to be in accordance with the principles of natural justice; and (c) if he is aware of continuing public disquiet owing to the circumstances of the dismissal.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will inform Dáil Éireann of the precise reasons for the dismissal by the Government of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Garvey; and why the Government felt it necessary to give effect to that dismissal at two hours' notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4 together.  The Government, through the Minister for Justice, are answerable to Parliament for the Garda Síochána and it is hardly necessary to say that the person who fills the office of Commissioner must have the confidence of the Government.  If, having considered the position carefully, the Government say to themselves that they have not that confidence, it becomes their duty, however distasteful it may be, to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that there is a change.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that such a conclusion on the Government's part need not necessarily be based on any one reason and that, in practice, it is unlikely to be so based.  However, since it is the Government who have to be satisfied, it is they alone who must assess the situation and make the decision; and suggestions that they should be expected to give reasons for their assessment or to enter into public debate about it fail to take account of the central issue which is whether or not the Government have confidence in the holder of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> Mr. Garvey must have been aware for some time that the Government were concerned about the manner in which the general direction and control of the Garda Síochána were being exercised by him.  When the request to resign was conveyed to Mr. Garvey, he then knew that the Government had reached the conclusion that a change was necessary.  As it would be wholly inappropriate that the Garda Síochána should remain under the control of a Commissioner concerning whom the Government had reached such a conclusion, it was imperative that the change should be effected without delay.</P>
    <P>It is clear to everybody that Mr. Garvey had an exceptionally successful career in the Garda Síochána and I think it may be relevant to place on record that his promotions to higher ranks, other than his appointment as Commissioner, were made by a Government of which I and a number of my colleagues were members.  His promotion to the rank of Assistant Commissioner was made by a Government in which I was Taoiseach.  His appointment as Commissioner was one which we, in Opposition, did not criticise, nor would we at the time have had any basis for doing so.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that I will not be taken as making a purely formal gesture when I repeat that the Government took the step they did only with the greatest reluctance and with sincere regret.  Nothing in the decision takes from the positive qualities which Mr. Garvey had shown in various ways in his earlier career&mdash; qualities which were recognised by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that it would be the Government's wish that anything that could reasonably be said to minimise the effects of the decision on Mr. Garvey and his family should in fact be said.  In deciding what is possible in that regard, account has had to be taken of all the circumstances, including the possibility of legal proceedings being instituted by Mr. Garvey, as publicly mooted by him.  I can, however, say at this point that it has been decided that Mr. Garvey will be awarded the gratuity <Col N="5" /> and pension that would have been granted to him if he had retired in the ordinary course.  This of itself necessarily implies that his removal from office was not on the basis of misconduct&mdash;the relevant Garda pensions orders provide that, in a case where there has been a removal from office, a pension may be awarded where the removal was &ldquo;for any cause other than misconduct&rdquo;.  In addition, the Government have directed that Mr. Garvey be given an additional lump sum of £3,250 by way of <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that the House, the people and ex-Commisioner Garvey have a right to be told the reasons for the Government's loss of confidence more especially if, as the Taoiseach has said, in relation to the payment of the pension, the causes are not ones of misconduct?  Would the Taoiseach not accept that the House is entitled to be told when this dissatisfaction arose? Did the Taoiseach and his colleagues before being in Government have reason for dissatisfaction?  If not, why was the suggestion made during the election campaign that he would be removed from office by people in the Fianna Fáil Party and Fianna Fáil candidates and why, long before his dismissal, was a whispering campaign started by leakages in the Press leading to an editorial in one of our daily papers, <i>The Irish Times</i>, highly critical of this manner of attack on the character of a public servant?</P>
      <P>Given this background, would the Taoiseach not agree that the House is entitled to be told when the loss of confidence arose, and why it arose if it was not because of misconduct? Would he not agree natural justice requires that, if ex-Commisioner Garvey was not guilty of misconduct, the reasons for his dismissal and his removal should be stated so that his character may be fully cleared?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had put a question instead of making a speech I would have been able to answer it more comprehensively.  I want to say emphatically that I had no responsibility for, and I know nothing <Col N="6" /> whatever about, and I do not believe there were undertakings, promises or anything else in connection with the election campaign about the removal of Mr. Garvey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As for leakages to the Press about the manner in which the Commissioner was carrying out his duties, again I have no responsibility whatever for those.  They were not anything of the Government's doing in any way.  As far as the time when this lack of confidence occurred is concerned, I think it will be well known to Mr. Garvey that he had been having consultations with the Minister and with the Secretary of the Department for a period of time.  The Deputy is aware, as I have indicated in the answer I gave to his question, that the Commissioner is obviously contemplating legal proceedings so, whether there has been a breach of natural justice will be decided as a result of those proceedings. I do not think I can add any more to what I have already said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that by dismissing Mr. Garvey in the manner in which he was dismissed by giving him two hours' notice with no explanation for the dismissal, that apart from the internal speculation and effect of such an action by the Government it also has repercussions so far as our image abroad is concerned?  Further, would the Taoiseach not agree that it is quite clear that the principles of natural justice were contravened by the action of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I can make no comment on natural justice beyond what I have said in my supplementary reply to Deputy FitzGerald.  I have no knowledge of, nor have I been given any intimation, of any repercussions abroad as a result of the Government's action in this case.  I do not want to say anything here that would in any way add to the hurt that Mr. Garvey must have felt but, in fairness to my colleagues and myself, I want to say it is strange that the decision should have come as a surprise to him. Leaving aside any other aspects, it is a <Col N="7" /> matter of common knowledge that serious questions had arisen concerning Mr. Garvey's approach to serious problems within the Garda force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he was not responsible for leakages that occurred to the press several months ago.  Does this mean the Taoiseach is denying that the press were briefed by or on the authority of a member of the Government in regard to the Commissioner, leading to the protest in the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> against this type of underhand behaviour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying I gave nobody any authority&mdash;I mean a Minister or anybody else&mdash;to talk to the press about the situation.  I do not believe it happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not give the authority but he accepts that it happened and that it has been exposed in the press.  If it has happened without the Taoiseach's authority, what action will he take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's assertion that there have been a number of reports of unrest and dissatisfaction within the Garda force, is it his intention now to accept that there is very much more wrong in the force than ex-Commissioner Garvey? Does the Taoiseach intend to hold a general inquiry into conditions in the Garda force generally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a final supplementary question?  Will the Taoiseach, or persons on his behalf, now reply to the letter from ex-Commissioner Garvey's solicitors, which reply was postponed because of questions here today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That reply was sent last night.  Unfortunately the press were not told because it was sent from the office of the Chief State Solicitor. The press were informed this morning that a reply had been sent and I understand the contents of the reply have been made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply was that there would not be a reply before a statement was issued today.  As I understand it, what it said was the following:</P>
      <P> I am assured that all the issues involved were given very full and careful consideration by the Government, who deeply regret having to act as they did and who had no wish to cause distress to Mr. Garvey or his wife and family.  With regard to your suggestion that a public announcement should be made forth-with, I am to say that a statement will be made by the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann this afternoon. </P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach going to reply to the letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that reply and my answer today together are an adequate reply to the letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of income tax relief in relation to such policies is being examined and a decision in the matter will be made in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Without attempting to push the Minister any further, will he not accept as a matter of principle that there is a very strong analogy between premiums of the kind I have described and premiums paid to Voluntary Health Insurance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider making household fire insurance premiums tax-deductible:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  To grant a deduction for such premiums would generate demands to allow a wide variety of other items of expenditures which would be regarded as equally, if not more, deserving of similar tax treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister has to weigh up competing claims but would he not consider that any State measure that tends to make people more independent and less likely to be the victims of the destitution that can result in the event of a fire where the premises are not insured should be favourably considered even at the cost of a gesture of a financial kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That argument can be made but the Deputy will appreciate that other arguments can be made against it.  Inevitably one must consider other possible claims that might be made and which could be regarded as more deserving of tax relief than the premiums mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In a limited number of cases&mdash;perhaps in the case of insurance paid on people's homes or on premises where a business is carried out&mdash; would the Minister consider making such premiums even partially tax deductible as an encouragement to people to make sure they are fully insured and thus to ensure that they are less likely to become a social casualty if a fire should occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that I would not consider this at some stage but, rather than mislead the Deputy and anybody else who might be interested in the matter, I must repeat that the answer is in the negative.  I have given my reasons.  In due course I will give further consideration to it <Col N="14" /> but, in the short-term, people should not expect that relief.</P>

    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the Government's Supply Services Accounts was underspent to the extent of £44 million during the year ended 31 December 1976; and the action he has taken to ensure that this does not recur in the present and subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of voted authorisation of expenditure sets upper limits to the amounts that may be spent by Departments each year and accounting procedures are naturally designed to ensure that these limits are not exceeded.  However, the number and variety of services financed by voted moneys make it extremely difficult to provide exactly the amount of money which will be spent.  In practice, therefore, some underspending is unavoidable.</P>
      <P>In the period from 1960-61 to 1976 underspending has ranged from 1.2 per cent to 3.2 per cent of the total of voted services.  The amount of underspending in 1976 represented 2.8 per cent of the total amount voted for supply in that year and was, therefore, at the high end of the range.  Of the 51 Votes passed, there were savings on 49, for a variety of reasons which are set out in the Appropriations Accounts.</P>
      <P>While I have said that some underspending is unavoidable, it is my intention to ensure, by striving for ever more accurate estimation of requirements in settling the Estimates, that Government policy is not frustrated by excessive savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with this process, whereby frequently there is underspending on services that need much more money?  Will he consider taking any new initiative to ensure that the spending is carried out in accordance with the wishes of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I am not satisfied where there is substantial <Col N="15" /> underspending.  It indicates in the normal way that the original Estimate was wrong or that sufficient efforts were not made to ensure that the money voted was expended.  There are exceptions to that as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate.  Sometimes certain unforeseen circumstances can arise and I am excluding such instances.  As a general rule I think we could improve the degree of accuracy to which we can reduce the Estimates and I have taken some steps to ensure this.  I will examine the question continuously to try to ensure that we get more accuracy in settling the Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the total amount of Irish tax paid by USA companies on profits earned in this country during the most recent financial year; and the proportion this represents of such profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics are not compiled in such a manner as would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be given.  However, practically all USA companies which are established in Ireland are manufacturing companies of relatively recent origin and export most of their production. To the extent that this is so they would qualify for export sales relief and would pay little or no corporation tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean we will have access to the profits made by these companies in the years ahead, to the actual figures for assessment of their tax relief?  Will we have access to the profits made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in so far as they are relieved from tax on foot of the export tax relief we do not have the figures officially.  Certainly rough estimates have been made from time to time but we do not have the figures officially if they are not liable to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is very important that we should know the amount of money these people are clearing out of their industries or enterprises here as a result <Col N="16" /> of their very satisfactory working conditions here?  Would he agree that we should know something of the amount of money they are making as a result of the favourable conditions they are getting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will exercise his <Col N="17" /> powers as majority shareholder in Irish Life Assurance Company Limited to instruct the company to cease issuing civil bill ejectments against house-holders on the ACRA ground rent strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The fact that I am the major shareholder in the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited does not entitle me to instruct the company regarding the management of its business.</P>
      <P>I am informed that Irish Life has no civil bill ejectment proceedings pending. I would point out also that under section 27 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Bill, 1977, recently initiated by the Government, the ground landlord would not be able to enforce a covenant in a lease for a dwellinghouse giving him a right to recover possession for non-payment of ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that being a major share-holder, we must have responsibility for policy decisions?  We must accept that we have&mdash;all of us in the Oireachtas&mdash;responsibility for policy decisions and, in respect of a decision of the kind mentioned in the question, we must, as a major shareholder in a company like this, have an attitude and ensure, or do our best to ensure, that that attitude is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue seems to me to be one of the ordinary business of the company in accordance with the law.  As I have said, in practice there are no such ejectment proceedings pending.  In so far as our attitude in this matter is concerned the Deputy will find that it is clearly outlined in the section of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Bill, 1977 to which I referred, where we propose to take away the right which ground landlords have at present under the law to eject for non-payment of ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>It is very difficult to reply to that.  They are given the grant for excavation, to pay workmen and the other people involved.  It would be difficult for us to ask for a report on all details.  I should like to inform the Deputy that section 23 of the National Monuments Act 1930 as amended by section 13 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954, stipulates that every person who finds any archaeological object shall, within 14 days after he has found such an object, make a report of such finding to a member of the Garda Síochána or the Director of the National Museum.  While this is a reasonable requirement in the case of the finding, accidental or otherwise, of isolated archaeological objects, it is not always easy to comply with it in the case of an archaeological excavation likely to be in progress for many years where sometimes hundreds of objects of a routine nature can come to light in the course of the excavation.  The commissioners consider that this condition should be interpreted in a reasonable manner and would be satisfied if periodic reports of finds were made to the satisfaction of the National Museum, pending submission of the final report.  The commissioners would expect, however, that any finds of exceptional importance would be reported promptly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say something brief about this motion.  Seen formally the motion is merely intended to tidy up a necessary consequence of legislation that was passed here a few months ago in regard to the abolition of the old and honourable title of Parliamentary Secretary its replacement by the title of Minister of State and the creation of another three offices with that same title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this Party have no objection to this obviously necessary consequential measure being enacted, I should like to remind the House of what was said by the Tánaiste on 2 November last when he introduced the Second Stage of the Ministers and Secretaries Bill.  He gave many reasons for the proposed change, some of which could be taken less seriously <Col N="96" /> than others as, for example, that office holders with the puny title of Parliamentary Secretary were not being taken seriously by foreigners whom they met at meetings in Europe and elsewhere.  There were other reasons somewhat more serious than that, with one of which I had to agree, that was, that there was a very high increase in the burden of work which office holders have to endure particularly, as the Minister had just then realised, as a result of the additional functions connected with membership of the European Communities.  The Minister explained to the House that these Parliamentary Secretaries, with their new and improved titles and salaries could, because of their greater numbers, not only be helping the Ministers to whom they would be junior but in regard to themselves individually would have what the Minister called &ldquo;wider and heavier responsibilities than have hitherto been assigned to Parliamentary Secretaries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If I have missed a Government announcement in this regard I am sorry for holding up the House, but I do not recall any announcement describing or listing these heavier and extended responsibilities, commensurate with the heavier and extended titles and salaries which these office holders were to be called on to discharge.  On the contrary, it seems to me&mdash;I make no special point on this since I may not know what is going on inside that Department&mdash; that in the case of one of these office holders, and here I beg pardon for appearing ungallant in mentioning this one in particular, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who has been joined by another office holder of the same rank, has diminished responsibilities.  I am glad to have the opportunity of wishing Deputy Burke well but I am not sure that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's responsibilities are not being diminished instead of extended by this other appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited by extending the limits contained in the current legislation.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Bill provides for: (1) an increase from £25 million to £45 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares of the company; (2) an increase from £17 million to £22 million in the limit on the issue of repayable advances by the Minister for Finance for the provision of housing and community services at Shannon; and (3) an increase from £17 million to £22 million in the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid, voted annually, which may be made to the company.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides that the level of remuneration and allowances of the chief officer of the company shall be subject to my approval given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for capital expenditure on the Industrial Estate at Shannon and in the mid-west region.  The main headings of expenditure are land acquisition, construction of factories and ancillary works.  A small proportion of share capital is expended on tourism projects of a capital nature. Repayable advances are used for capital expenditure on housing and community services at Shannon.  The houses are provided by the company to rent or to purchase and developed sites are also made available for private house-building.  The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to industries at Shannon.  A substantial part of the company's running expenses relate to tourism promotion. Expenditure in this area is met by a <Col N="100" /> special grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Tourism and Transport is accountable but which, nevertheless, comes within the overall limit now being amended by section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by the company under these three headings at 31 December 1977 was as follows: Share capital. £25,000,000; Repayable advances, £15,281,500; Grant-in-aid, £13,841,150.</P>
    <P>The existing limit for share capital has already been reached and there are no funds available under this heading to meet current requirements and to enable the company to continue with their capital programme.  It is, therefore, a matter of urgency that the statutory limits be now increased.  On the basis of estimates of expenditure available the proposed new limits will be reached by about the end of 1980.</P>
    <P>The type of control proposed in section 5 in relation to the remuneration of the chief executive of the company is now being inserted in relevant statutes governing the different State companies as the opportunity arises.  The power to control the chief executive's salary is already contained in the memorandum and articles of association of the company; so in fact the new provision will not affect the control operating at present but will merely give it statutory backing.</P>
    <P>The last occasion on which legislation increasing the company's expenditure limits was enacted was in July, 1974.  As in the case of the rest of the country the past three-and-a-half years have been difficult ones for both Shannon and the mid-west region. Employment in the Shannon Industrial Estate declined by about 300 during 1975.  The level of employment recovered, however, during 1976 and 1977 and now stands at 4,362, an increase of over 500 on the 1975 level. Shannon's export surplus has increased consistently during the period under review.  The estimated surplus for 1977 is £50 million or over twice the 1974 figure.</P>
    <P>The population of Shannon town has grown steadily over the period and now stands at 8,023.  I note with satisfaction that there is a continuing increase in the number of Shannon residents <Col N="101" /> who are opting to purchase their houses under the company's housing mortgage scheme.  This trend enhances the stability of the town and provides a firm base for further progress.</P>
    <P>Airport traffic developed satisfactorily over the period.  A record level of passenger traffic through Shannon was achieved last year.  Total passenger traffic in 1977 exceeded 1,170,000 of whom over 550,000 were terminal passengers.  The tourism activities of the company also recorded satisfactory progress during the past three years.</P>
    <P>Although the original establishment of the company arose from the need to secure the future of Shannon Airport, the company have had, since 1968, the function of promoting the industrial development of the mid-west region in association with the IDA.  The international recession of 1974-75 cost the region about 2,200 industrial jobs, mainly in the Limerick/Shannon area.  The region would have recovered those jobs fully by the end of 1977 but for the closure of the Ferenka factory.  Ferenka's closure resulted in a net loss of about 450 jobs in 1977 for the region as a whole.  The company are, however, confident that 1978 will see a return to steady industrial growth because of (a) the number of job approvals&mdash; 3,900&mdash;in 1977 which will start to come on stream in 1978-79; and (b) the number of jobs&mdash;3,350&mdash;which remain to be established from industrial projects approved prior to 1977.  In addition, new industry inquiries are encouraging, running at about 25 per cent above last year's levels.  Based on these considerations the company expect that there will be a net increase in industrial jobs in the region of about 1,500 in 1978.</P>
    <P>The news of the Ferenka closure over-shadowed the announcement of three major new industrial developments of Limerick and the region&mdash; Alcan, Beechams and Le Jouet Francais, involving a total job potential of 1,450 and planned fixed asset investment of about £270 million.  The unprecedented level of job loss resulting from the Ferenka closure and the serious impact that it is having on the <Col N="102" /> Limerick area is the reason why the Government decided to designate Limerick city and some adjoining areas for higher maximum levels of industrial grants.  The IDA and SFADCo are exploring all possibilities in regard to getting a replacement firm for Ferenka but it is too early to indicate what the outcome of these efforts will be.</P>
    <P>Alcan's decision to proceed with the establishment of an alumina plant at Aughinish has demonstrated the industrial potential of the Shannon estuary.  SFADCo and IDA will continue to promote estuary locations for suitable new industry.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I think it is appropriate that I should refer to the recent retirement from the chairmanship&mdash; but happily not from the board&mdash;of SFADCo of Mr. Brendan O'Regan. Mr. O'Regan's outstanding record of public service spans a period of 30 years.  More than anyone he is closely identified with SFADCo, of which he had been chairman from its establishment in 1959.  My regret that Mr. O'Regan found it necessary to relinquish the chairmanship is eased by the fact that his guidance will remain available to the board who are now about to embark upon new tasks.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the House that I am at present in consultation with the board of SFADCo with a view to reorienting and giving a new dimension and thrust to their work, particularly in relation to industrial development.  My approach to this has been from two standpoints.  First, I considered that the company have to a considerable extent achieved their original objective&mdash;to secure the future of Shannon Airport&mdash;and that accordingly the considerable flair for innovation and development work that they have shown on a number of fronts since 1959 might be turned in a new direction.  Secondly, it has long been one of my concerns that the tone and balance of our industrial structure, and social and demographic reasons likewise, required that we should seek to strengthen greatly the position of indigenous Irish industry, especially small industry.  We must, of course, continue and indeed intensify for many <Col N="103" /> years to come our efforts to attract here new manufacturing industry that is externally financed and controlled. Industry of this kind is very welcome and, indeed, one of our problems is that we cannot get enough of it but the very success that we have in attracting such industry means that unless we take concurrent steps to develop domestic industry to a greater extent, our industrial structure will get out of balance and in the long term this could pose difficulties for us.  The need to strengthen indigenous Irish industry, especially small domestic industry, was one of the recurrent themes in the recent debates in the Dáil and the Seanad leading to the enactment of the Industrial Development Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>With these considerations in mind I have suggested to the board of SFADCo that the company should assume responsibility for the development of small indigenous industry in the mid-west region in a special and intensive way not hitherto attempted in this country.  I see this as a pilot exercise, the results of which would be evaluated at the end of 18 months or two years when decisions would be taken about the extension of such an intensive drive to other regions.  The board of SFADCo have confirmed their readiness to proceed in the direction I have indicated but the detailed planning remains to be done.  This will involve among other things further consultations between my Department and the Department of Economic Planning and Development, and between SFADCo and the IDA.  At this stage it would be premature for me to attempt to go into detail, but, for example, it is envisaged that the county development officers in the mid-west region would be actively involved in the new arrangements relating to small industry.</P>
    <P>In order that SFADCo will be free to concentrate all their energies on this new task in relation to indigenous small industry, I am arranging that the IDA will resume full responsibility for industry other than small industry in the mid-west region.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This party welcome and support this Bill and I join the Minister in commending it to the House.  I should like to say in a general way that we accept and are glad to say that SFADCo have become during almost 20 years of existence a model of a dynamic regional development agency.  It is right to say, and I was glad to hear the Minister make a reference in this direction, that this is very largely due to the dedication of their personnel.  I am sure the Minister does not wish to devalue the efforts of others but he is quite right in singling out the dedication of Mr. O'Regan, who is a man of dedication not merely to economic development in his own part of Ireland but who sees also the great responsibility which rests on Irish people to do something for those who are less well off. The success of SFADCo has been to a great extent their own personal story.  Everyone in this House wishes them well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from their main function with which I will deal briefly in a moment, there are two things in regard to SFADCo which I would like to underline because I have had some personal contact with them.  One is the very intelligent and sophisticated interest which SFADCo have shown in tourism development of the area for which they are responsible.  In 1975 I remember when Mr. John Hunt was finding some difficulty in getting any kind of official, or enough official, help and backing for his very interesting project in establishing a folk museum near Bunratty in Clare, SFADCo were of constant assistance to him.  I do not want to minimise the help of others, such as Bord Fáilte, but it was in no small part the result of SFADCo's efforts that the folk museum is now well on the way to being completed according to the late Mr. Hunt's wishes.  It does not meet the approval of every archaeologist academic but, on any ordinary standard, it is a very important addition to the area touristically and culturally.  It does what the late Mr. Hunt wanted it to do in giving people an idea of how their ordinary ancestors, not just kings and queens, such as they were, lived in the <Col N="105" /> Iron Age, in the Middle Ages and up to the dawn of modern times.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hunt had a unique collection, unrivalled in any museum in the country.  It was an original collection of furniture and implements and he supplemented it with reproductions of various kinds and his complex, as I am sure the Minister and Deputy O'Donnell will agree, is a major asset to the area.  It is one which would not normally be associated in the first instance with a body like SFADCo which had a very narrow original basis. It is a tribute to the farsightedness and intelligence of that body that it has been able to help by taking a keen and leading interest in the promotion of cultural life in the area for which it is responsible.  I had the pleasure of opening the complex in 1975.  I had to cut through a branch securing the entrance with a reproduction bronze sword.  The branch had already been nine-tenths sawn through before I struck it with the sword so the actual task was that much simpler.</P>
    <P>The interest shown by the SFADCo in the developing areas of the world in which unfortunate people are starving has also been remarkable.  This, too, is to be associated with the personality of the retiring chairman and some other members of the company who have taken a keen and genuine personal interest in the effort to spread around the world as best they can the kind of skills we ourselves had to develop, not, of course, in anything as miserable as the conditions of these developing countries but which nonetheless are not altogether beyond comparison.  We had to lift ourselves up by our boot straps and develop ideas, skills and competences which, in 1922, nobody had, and we are therefore in a good position&mdash;not materially, perhaps, but in terms of instruction and advice&mdash;to assist countries which may wish to follow along the same paths as ourselves.</P>
    <P>When I was Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs I had a good deal of contact with semi-State bodies and SFADCo was a model of what a body of this sort should be living up to from the point of view of the responsibilities many of us do not discharge in regard to the developing world.  I met groups <Col N="106" /> of people repeatedly from all over the developing world who were attending at Shannon in order to receive a course of instruction from SFADCo in the operation of customs free zones, a form of development appropriate to many of these developing countries and something in which many of them are very interested.</P>
    <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that this company is a kind of symbol of regeneration.  It is not the only one but it is a very conspicuous one.  That regeneration has, I think, been very much along the right lines.  It has been characterised by decentralisation, by the very striking growth of a new town, the first ever undertaken here and one which has been a success. It has been associated with the growth of community sentiment.  It has been associated with overthrowing and rendering ridiculous old ideas to the effect that underdeveloped areas in the west could not be made viable and could not be improved very much and should, therefore, be left to the grouse shooters.  It has also been a model of regeneration in regard to our responsibility towards the less fortunate parts of the world and we on this side wish the company all possible success and are glad to support the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are just a few things I want to mention now.  I see the Minister proposes to base responsibility for future industrial development in this region on the criterion of size.  His idea of getting SFADCo to see what can be done through the medium of small home-based industries is a very good idea.  I hope it will work well. We will certainly follow it with great interest.  I hope it will be associated with a maximum effort to get people to do things for themselves individually and in their communities rather than encourage them to turn themselves into lobbies sending deputations to Dublin for the placing of this or that when they might very well be encouraged to do something for themselves. We wish all possible success to this project.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy with the Minister's suggestion in regard to the taking over of large-scale industrial developments by the IDA and I <Col N="107" /> wonder whether SFADCo are entirely happy with it.  If the Minister assures me they are, that will be that, but I would be surprised if SFADCo, who made such headway in the establishment of large and not institutionalised industry, which necessarily means some of their officials must have built their careers around the construction and maintenance of such industry, are happy at being deprived of an arm of activity for what appear to be the best of reasons.  The Minister spoke about readiness.  Is it, I wonder, a somewhat reluctant readiness? I may be reading something into what the Minister said that was not there but I would not be happy were the Minister to deprive SFADCo of a function against their own wishes.</P>
    <P>I am a bit surprised, too, when the Minister speaks about further consultations in regard to this division of function in his Department and the Department of Economic Planning and Development and SFADCo and the IDA that we have heard nothing of this famous industrial development consortium.  I have already explained to the House that this is not a consortium, that it will not have any money to risk, that it will not be a business enterprise in the sense in which the word &ldquo;consortium&rdquo; has been used up to now.  If the Minister wishes to call a co-ordinating committee a consortium he has as much right as anybody else to extend the English language.  I am surprised that this consortium, which was one of the four main planks in regard to economic recovery and in regard to employment creation in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, which was supposed to co-ordinate and monitor industrial progress and development, was not mentioned in what is, as far as I can see from the Minister's short speech, quite a major development in the economy of this region.  The division of responsibilities, on the criterion and size, between SFADCo and the IDA is important.  I would have thought that if the consortium was going to be worth anything, it should have been called into existence long ago and that it would be worthy of at least a mention in this context.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> I am afraid that the Minister's omission to mention it, and the fact that his advisors did not think it worth drawing into a consultation of the kind he envisages here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I welcome this Bill which will enable the Minister for Finance to increase the capital available to the SFADCo from £25 million to £45 million.  Never was such an increase more welcome because at the moment unemployment in that area is very serious and it has recently been aggravated by the tragic <Col N="109" /> closure of Ferenka.  I compliment SFADCo on their contribution to this region, of which north Tipperary, my constituency, is part.  SFADCo did a tremendous job in Shannon Airport and they have complimented industrial development in Ennis and in parts of Limerick city.  From my experience with SFADCo and from listening to the Minister's speech, I can understand the feeling in my area that north Tipperary is not a part of the region.  From the activities over the years, and the terms of the Bill as outlined by the Minister, one would think that north Tipperary was not in the region.  If SFADCo are to be the company they were set up to be, there should be equality of development in the region, and anything that can be done by the Minister to bring this about will be welcomed by the people of north Tipperary.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not extend the designated area into north Tipperary following the closure of Ferenka.  Approximately two-thirds of the work force in Ferenka were employed from outside Limerick city, and I would have thought that that would have enabled the Minister to extend the designated area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's recent statements on the need for small industries in rural areas.  That need was brought home more forcibly by the closure of Ferenka which was a major industry employing approximately 1,500 people. The closure of this factory created untold hardship for the employees and their dependants.  If we concentrate on small industries, employing perhaps 50 people, it would ensure rural renewal, something which has been talked about but about which very little has been done.  If we are to keep people in the rural areas we must give them work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Department's new concept of job creation.  I refer to the enterprise development programme which was initiated in the last few weeks.  I strongly support this revolutionary idea and wish it every success. I understand that a unit has already been set up and is dealing with applications. In keeping with his thinking about small industrial development, the Minister might consider ensuring that this new programme be administered by SFADCo rather than from Dublin. <Col N="110" /> This is a very worthwhile project for the mid-western region the implementation of which should be kept within the region.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's pilot scheme to see if SFADCo can handle the small industries sector of the Department for a period of 18 months. If SFADCo are to have the necessary muscle to combat unemployment in my area, they must be as near as possible to being autonomous.  For that reason I recommend that only the minimum influence on developments in the western region should come from Kildare Street.  We have people with sufficient expertise and knowledge of the region to ensure that all necessary steps will be taken for the betterment of the region.  Over the years I have learned that applications for major industrial development which are processed in Dublin and which originated in this area are moved elsewhere.  I have evidence that many industrialists who had intended setting up industries in the region because of the facilities available were nudged elsewhere.  A foreign industrialist who, because of the facilities in my area, intended to set up an industry there, made application in Dublin but, whether politics entered into it or not I do not know, the industry ended up elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to refer briefly to an aspect within the region itself which is a deciding factor in the internal industrial development of the region, that is, the apparent inequality of industrial grants within the region. I know from experience that the industry can come to North Tipperary and can be inclined towards north Tipperary, but it may be realised later that if that industry had gone elsewhere in the region the grant structure would have benefited that industrialist much better.  If SFADCo are to do the job they set out to do all areas of the region should have equal entitlement to grants and so on. I am looking forward to much better investment in my part of the region than there has been over the years and I hope the Minister will see fit to ensure that North Tipperary get their proper share of the industrial take of the region.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which is designed to provide for the financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I compliment the company on their success to date and I wish them every success in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised to hear Deputy Ryan complaining so much about the situation relating to unemployment in the mid-western region.  His Government were four years in office and his own Minister for Industry and Commerce presided at a time when financial resources were not provided for the company to do the job they were set up to do.  In the 1975 report of SFADCo the former chairman, Mr. O'Regan, had to point out that although the company's earned income continued to grow during the period under review, neither that income nor the grants in aid received for running expenses had been able to maintain parity with increasing costs.  As a consequence the amount of money in real terms available for direct promotion has continued to decline.  In spite of their commitment, the previous Government did not provide the necessary finances for the company to do the job they had been doing so well over the past two years.  Nevertheless, we can change this, and I welcome this Bill as being a further indication of our commitment on this side of the House to the development of the Shannon region.  You must take the region as a full region.  You cannot isolate part of it, such as North Tipperary or West Clare, and try to find faults in these difficult areas.  In West Clare, the area I represent, we are not having the success that we would like, mainly because of the difficulty of attracting industry into remote areas. Therefore we have infrastructural, communication and other problems which militate against the attracting of industry into these regions.  In these things the local authorities and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have equal responsibility with SFADCo.  It will continue to be difficult to attract industry into remote regions unless we have the roads, telephones, communications and water supplies which are vital for this.  This <Col N="112" /> is a regional problem of which SFADCo are fully aware and they recognise the difficulties in this regard.</P>
    <P>Even before Christmas, when the new Industrial Development Bill was passed here, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company had themselves an enterprising unit which had been doing very good work.  Yesterday in Smithstown I opened a small bay just off the main Shannon Industrial Estate.  This came about as a consequence of an enterprise development unit on which SFADCo had been concentrating some of their efforts over the past year and which has already brought about results, in that small industries have already commenced in this region and are now functioning and giving good employment.  They can continue to function and many more of them can be got under way. Also in the Shannon region we have the youth enterprises section known as Youth Enterprises, Shannon.  Here SFADCo in co-operation with the county development team, the schools and industrialists in the area have the project in a place called Ballycaseymore House which will provide employment opportunities for about 50 or 60 young people in the coming year.  This is a valuable exercise which I would like to see further developed.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my constituents I would like to express regret at the departure of Mr. O'Regan from the chair of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  There is no need for me to record here the efforts he has made for the region.  I am glad that he is continuing on the board of SFADCo and that his wide experience and great knowledge of the problems of the mid-western region will not be lost to this region.  I welcome the new chairman, Mr. McCabe, and wish him every success in his task.</P>
    <P>Overall this is a very desirable and worthwhile Bill.  I want to put on record that we in Clare are deeply grateful to SFADCo and recognise the efforts that have been made by them over the past years since the company was formed, and I hope we can continue to see development in the region in the future.</P>

      <P>In the normal way I went down to the Library today and was reading back over the various debates that have taken place here in relation to the chequered, sometimes difficult and very often exciting history of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I think I am now the longest serving Deputy in this House from the mid-western region and I had the privilege always of speaking on it here and in every case I welcomed every measure brought before this House regarding the mid-western region.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with a semi-State body which have a major responsibility for promoting a wide variety of economic developments in the mid-western region which I, like Deputies John Ryan and Daly, have the honour to represent.  It is a region which like every other area in every country in the western world suffered severe job losses as a result of world economic recession in 1974, 1975 and later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mid-western region, however, there was in existence a semi-State development <Col N="114" /> body, SFADCo, which understood the problems of the region and were able to promote job creation projects to the best advantage.  They succeeded, despite the world recession. From 1973 to the end of 1976 a total of 225 new industrial projects were approved for grant aid in the mid-western region despite the world economic recession, which was then at its worst.  These job creation projects were of a wide variety, like the two at Raheen and the pharmaceutical industry at Clarecastle, and others.  As well, there were substantial additions to existing industries which were responsible for increasing employment, some by almost 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, at the outset I want to pay a special tribute to SFADCo and to join in the tributes paid by the Minister and others to Brendan O'Regan the former chairman.  I want to add my voice of appreciation of his contribution to the development not merely of SFADCo but of the airport itself and of industry throughout the region.  I also take this opportunity to congratulate the new chairman, Mr. McCabe, who is an outstandingly successful industrialist, a man who is dedicated and committed to the welfare of the mid-western region.  I wish him well in his onerous task.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the period 1973 to 1976.  We have the latest report of SFADCo, which is for 1976.  It shows that there was a net gain of 1,200 new jobs in the region in 1976; 59 new projects were approved for grant aid; grants were provided for 54 industrial projects, and facilities were provided for five others, a total of 59 in one year alone.  There has been much comment inside and outside the House on the new enterprise programme announced by the IDA.  It is interesting to read in this annual report in relation to 1976 a paragraph on page 9:</P>
    <P>Last year the company had established an Enterprise Development Unit which is geared towards identifying and marrying resources, such as raw materials and people of enterprise and flair, so that the two can be linked in a viable industry. Some success has already been achieved in this work, and a number <Col N="115" /> of small enterprises have been established.</P>
    <P>Before the question of an enterprise unit was mentioned by the IDA or in this House, SFADCo had been doing pioneering work on this.  They also were responsible for a major development in the establishment of the Smithson Industrial Estate, a specialist estate at Shannon geared specially to cater for one-man and small enterprises of various kinds.</P>
    <P>It is not alone in the field of this type of original thinking, the development of small industries and so forth, that SFADCo have been pioneering. In 1976 it became clear that the mid-western region, despite its enormous job losses due to the recession, was emerging successfully.  There was a net gain of 1,200 jobs.  But then we came to 1977 and we learn that the outturn has been a net loss of 500 jobs.  This debate is taking place against the background of the worst and most appalling industrial disaster that hit this country since the State was founded.  I refer to the closure of Ferenka when 1,400 jobs were lost.  I would remind the Minister that in addition to the 1,400 job losses in Ferenka, in the past couple of months there have been further job losses.  I carried out a survey in the past week and I was shocked to find that a further 200 jobs have been lost in the mid-western region in the past couple of months and that there are 500 workers there on a three-day week.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of departing from the protocol of the House, but it is public knowledge in relation to the Scripto company that 55 jobs have been lost in County Clare.  This is a very alarming situation.  It has occurred in the last couple of months at a time when there has been a tremendous upsurge in the country's economy.  These were industries which survived the economic recession, and it is against the background of the Ferenka closure and other job losses in the region that I want to analyse the Bill now before the House.  I also bear in mind that following the debate on Ferenka there were front page headlines in the newspapers about special aid for the mid-western <Col N="116" /> region.  It was represented at the time that the Limerick region had become the industrial black spot of Europe.</P>
    <P>I had expected the Minister to avail himself of this opportunity to initiate some exciting new programme, to indicate to us on introducing this Bill that massive additional finance could be made available to SFADCo to attract industry to the region and to develop the job creation programme. But before the Minister came into the House today I was looking through the Estimates for the Public Services for 1978.  There I saw, instead of what I expected to see which was a substantial increase in the grant-in-aid to SFADCo for promotional purposes, that the subvention to SFADCo had been cut substantially.</P>
    <P>Subhead J:1 the most important of all is for administration and general expenses, all of which are tied up in the matter of industrial promotion.  In that subhead the subvention is cut from £750,000 in 1977 to £465,000 this year.  I cannot figure out how this came about because we were assured extra money was being made available. The Minister came into the House and revealed this extraordinary news.  It is astonishing news.  Not merely has it shocked me, but I am sure it will have reverberations in every parish and village throughout the mid-west region.  Not merely has their subvention been cut drastically but the powers and the very functions of SFADCo have been reduced considerably.</P>

      <P>I am not too worried about heckling by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley.  His attitude is well known.  It was this type of vindictiveness that closed Ferenka. This Bill is a retrograde step.  It is a major step back in the evolution of the functions and the powers of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order that SFADCo will be <Col N="118" /> free to concentrate all their energies on this new task in relation to indigenous small industry, I am arranging that the IDA will resume full responsibility for industry other than small industry in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>In my 16 years in this House that is the most disastrous news I have heard for my constituency and for the mid-west region.  It represents a complete contradiction of the modern concept of regional development and regional agencies.  It considerably diminishes the powers of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I have no doubt it will have a disastrous effect on industrial development in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute, as I always did here, to the success of SFADCo in attracting industry, in developing the airport and so on.  One of the reasons for that success was that they were a special regional agency with a very wide mandate. From my personal contacts with them during the four years in which I had the privilege of being a member of the Government, I know the part they and their officials played in securing such major projects as Alcan, Syntex, Burlington, Analog, and I had the privilege of being present at the official opening of many of those projects.  Senior people from these major international companies invariably, in public as well as in private, express their admiration for and pay tribute to the dedication, the efficiency, the commitment and the hard work of the officers of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company responsible for industrial promotion.  I would go so far as to say that, but for the fact that we had this special development agency in the mid-west region, we would not have Analog today, or Burlington, or Syntex, or many other projects throughout the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>If the Government are serious in their concern about job creation and economic development, they must realise that in so far as it relates to job creation economic development must proceed in a broadly comprehensive integrated co-ordinated fashion. Over the years this company <Col N="119" /> acquired considerable expertise.  They did valuable pioneering work in many ways.  This company and this company only were geared to enable the mid-west region to fight back against the recent disaster which hit them. For the life of me I cannot understand the wisdom behind this.  I cannot understand the thinking behind it.  I cannot see what advantage is in it.  It adds to the conglomeration of organisations which are responsible for industrial promotion.  We have the Shannon Development Company responsible for one type of industry. We now have the IDA responsible for bringing major industry into the region. We have the county development teams, the RDOs and the local authorities.  The beauty of SFADCo was that they co-ordinated the efforts of those bodies.  It was through the initiative of SFADCo that the first RDO was formed in the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Surely industrial development is part of economic development.  Surely within the sphere of industrial development one must include large-scale, medium-scale, small industries and craft industries.  This must be proceeded with in an integrated way. There are spin-off industries from major industries and service industries of a wide variety.  Surely it is logical to have a co-ordinating approach through one agency.  I regret very much that this situation has developed.  This is a bad decision and time will prove it to have been a bad decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the growth in traffic in the Shannon Industrial Estate.  This is parallel with their success in attracting industry to the region before and during the economic recession.  The rate of progress in relation to traffic at Shannon has been absolutely fantastic over the past couple of years.  In 1976 and again in 1977 Shannon Airport had record traffic figures.  The magic one million mark was passed and exceeded.  There is a moral in this and it is very relevant to what I was saying about the scope and potential of a regional development agency.  This dramatic rise in passenger traffic through <Col N="120" /> Shannon took place even in the middle of an economic recession because the Government of which I had the honour to be a member made substantial additional funds available to enable SFADCo and Aer Rianta to go to Europe, the United States and even into eastern Europe to sell Shannon as a transit stop for charter traffic. for crew training, and so on.  They did their job fantastically well and they got adequate financial back up from the Government.</P>
    <P>If the mid-west region is to recover from the disaster which hit us in the industrial field, the logical thing to do is to give substantial additional funds to SFADCo and to give them the necessary wider powers to become a comprehensive, broadly based, regional development agency.  As I said, I do not know what the thinking behind this is.  I have a fair idea but I will not proceed on the basis of hearsay.</P>
    <P>A decision by the Government, as announced by the Minister, is to concentrate on the development of what he calls indigenous industry.  I suppose he is referring to industries indigenous to the region.  I have referred to this matter on various occasions when SFADCo was being discussed.  There are 27 or 28 industries in the industrial estate but, as far as I am aware, not one of them is based on the natural resources of the mid-west region. There is not one agricultural processing plant on the estate.  As far as I know the only industry that is processing the raw materials of the area is the Wyatt Company at Askeaton. That is a major processing plant.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us exactly what he means when he refers to indigenous industries.  Is he referring to industries that are a further expansion of industries based on agricultural raw materials?  If he is, SFADCo with their greatly diminished powers will be unable to undertake such industries. By their nature food processing industries using modern technology are capital intensive, highly mechanised industries.  The Minister should tell us what level of grants SFADCo will have full authority to approve.  What size of industry is the Minister referring to here?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> There is fantastic potential in the region for industries that use the raw materials of the area and, in this connection, I have mentioned the Wyatt Company at Askeaton.  Industries that exploit the full potential of the region will achieve success.  I would include in this category the development of marine-based industries in the Shannon Estuary and also the development of the fishing industry along the west Clare coast.  This part of the country has been disastrously neglected since the foundation of the State.  In the Burren region a small perfume factory has been established and it uses the flowers of the area in the manufacture of perfume.  Now that SFADCo are restricted by the new edict of the Minister and are confined to the establishment of small industries, I cannot see how they can play a proper role in developing industry to the extent of providing the job creation programme that is needed.</P>
    <P>The concept of regional development appears to have been scrapped totally. This raises serious implications in relation to the whole strategy of economic development, and particularly industrial development.  If this is the final decision of the Government all industry will be centralised, with a massive bureaucracy in Dublin.  This will be a retrograde step particularly having regard to the success achieved by SFADCo.  I do not mind that the Government decided to scrap the Western Development Board.  That is a different matter entirely.  SFADCo have been in existence for several years and have had outstanding success in industrial and regional development, in tourism and in the development of the airport.  In 1977 the company broke all records in relation to tourism in the region.  The logical thing should be to give the company more power.  I am greatly disappointed with the news we have been given.  I disagree completely with what has been decided and I have no doubt it will come as a shock to the people of the mid-west region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come in Dáil Éireann for a serious review of the industrial development structures in the mid-west region. I <Col N="122" /> was very much involved as a trade union official in the late 1960s in the general industrial relations of many foreign industries in the Shannon Airport area.  The union with which I was associated&mdash;the ICTU&mdash;is the union that predominantly organises in the area.</P>
      <P>Looking at the matter as objectively as possible, one must be acutely aware of the multiplicity of organisations involved in industrial promotion in the region.  Even on a very superficial count one can think of nine organisations that have a direct involvement. There is Aer Rianta, SFADCo, the IDA, the county development teams, the RDO, Limerick Corporation and Limerick County Council, Clare County Council and North Tipperary County Council.</P>
      <P>It strikes me that the Government and the Dáil should review the extent to which these activities should be more effectively co-ordinated.  I am well aware of the outstanding record of the former chairman of SFADCo and I join with the House in the best wishes extended to Brendan O'Regan on his retirement as chairman.  I have no doubt he will continue to make a distinguished and dynamic contribution to industrial development in the area.  During the years I have had much admiration for work done by executives such as Paul Quigley and other senior executives of the company. Many people, particularly those living outside the Shannon region, were sceptical about the prospects of success.  People spoke of grass growing on the runways of the airport.  I never shared that view and, despite some of the very difficult industrial disputes that took place, nevertheless the prospects of development were always quite good.  I wish Mr. McCabe the new chairman of SFADCo, every success in his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There tends to be an appalling tradition here that if one sets up some structure which proves to be a success, as has been SFADCo, that means permanency.  That is a dangerous illusion. Perhaps there should be another revolutionary step forward in the structure in that region.  It may well be that to achieve a really dynamic <Col N="123" /> future for the region, operating under a co-ordinated, coherent and industrial development structure&mdash;serious consideration should be given by the Government to the feasibility of this &mdash;the ordinary administration of the airport should continue under Aer Rianta, as in Dublin and Cork.  I have no doubt that we have room for at least another two airports in the years ahead.  Cork is not very viable at present; Shannon is.  The 8,500-10,000 people who live in Shannon town should become a normal urban community, with their own local authority. They should be a city in their own right.  I would even go so far as to say there should be a Shannon Town Corporation.  I should like to see Shannon Town having its own senior local authority, not merely an urban district council, not town commissioners but an actual corporation, the property and land at Shannon being vested in such a corporation, with tenants continuing to buy out or rent their houses from such a local authority, with the land and the operation of the town being ceded by SFADCo to that new town local authority.</P>
    <P>It is equally arguable that the IDA should take over the formal operation of the industrial estate itself at Shannon. We have a growing number of industrial estates throughout the country&mdash;in Cork, in Waterford.  Indeed in my constituency in south County Dublin we have an IDA industrial estate growing up in Sandyford. Over the years the IDA have build up an expertise in industrial estate management, leasing arrangements and so on.</P>
    <P>While I would never be critical in any way of the historical role of SFADCo I have always held the view that men of the calibre of Paul Quigley and others should not have been confined to that Shannon area. Neither could I ever see the object of saying to SFADCo &ldquo;Extend your scope of operations into the general region and simultaneously involve the IDA in further co-ordination and consultation.&rdquo; Inevitably, in a small country, this gives rise to confusion, competing <Col N="124" /> bureaucracies&mdash;excellent though they may be&mdash;and does not advance industrial development.</P>

      <P>That is true but not in a country where every shilling in the creation of every half of a job must be spent in a manner which will produce that job, in a country where there are so few people with entrepreneurial ability.  Few of us are capable of hopping on a 'plane at Shannon Airport, flying out and bringing back an industry.  Some have done so, but I am not so sure they should be confined to that area.  Indeed there are IDA executives capable of doing so but there are so few of them that to diffuse them in a massive organisational structure is something which should be examined carefully.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy O'Donnell and the Minister will agree that the area about which we are talking is one of immense political and organisational sensitivity.  By and large empires are established, grow up and are never meant to change.  In 1968 the Fianna Fáil Party, under their industrial development strategy, extended the scope of SFADCo, gave them massive new responsibilities, but, in 1978, back that goes to the IDA.  That kind of thing is not conducive to coherent industrial development.  Neither, in the long run, is it conducive to the broader industrial development of the region.  Supposing, for example, tomorrow morning the Minister sanctioned a new electricity power station for the Shannon Estuary, God forbid, probably we would have a new industrial structure with the ESB getting up to their tonsils.  I should not like to be the Minister trying to co-ordinate that development with so many other structures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Honesty, in terms of politics, of trying to get down to the nitty gritty of promotional development, is not a pleasant thing.  I remember in 1956-57, as a union official, going down to Limerick when one finished up talking to bacon factory workers, building workers, flourmilling workers and so on.  One had to start searching for manufacturing units.  Indeed one was searching in terms of industrial development in the Shannon region.</P>
      <P>I put the thought to the House that it may well be that the Minister will finish up arbitrating between SFADCo and the IDA.  His precedessor had to do it and his predecessor's predecessor had to do it, and in 1968 we had a piece of legislation which extended the scope of SFADCo.  In 1978 the matter is reversed again, as Deputy O'Donnell rightly pointed out.  In the long term this is not helpful for the future of industrial promotion in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the House should seriously consider the situation.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that the proposal before this House to have <Col N="126" /> a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas for the review of the role of State-sponsored bodies is the very issue.  This is the very type of policy consideration which should go before that committee.  We would then have an opportunity, as politicians, of talking to the chief executive of the IDA and to the chief executive and senior staff of SFADCo and asking them what they consider to be the best structure for industrial development promotion in the mid-west region.  We could then bring in the regional development organisation, the county managers and planning officers for the cities of Limerick, Tipperary and Clare, sit down with them to do this job and then make recommendations to the Government in regard to the most desirable structure.</P>
    <P>That could be done because what matters is job creation.  What matters is bringing industry into that region. What matters above all is maintaining employment in that region because the cost of maintaining employment is cheaper than the cost of job creation. Since that is the paramount consideration, the future of the bureaucracies within the area is a lesser consideration. I feel, therefore, it is time the House had a look at the future of the region in terms of its industrial development promotional agencies and it is time we made that kind of recommendation to the Government.</P>
    <P>I would sum up by saying that Shannon should be made a local authority corporation.  The land and houses in Shannon and the buildings and the town of Shannon should be vested in a new local authority known as the City of Shannon.  It is now an area with 10,000 people and I am opposed to giving it just urban district council status or town or town commissioner status.  In the context of existing legislation I would make it a corporation similar to Kilkenny, Sligo, Drogheda and so on.  I would then have the ordinary operation of the airport, a most successful airport, handled by Aer Rianta.  I would have the Shannon Industrial Estate designated as an IDA industrial estate.  I would certainly have the senior executives of SFADCo given a massive new role with no loss of <Col N="127" /> their status in that structure.  We could go ahead on a new basis, on a new phase of development.  What is already there will be a monument to men like Brendan O'Regan, Paul Quigley and many others.  These people would then advance industrial development in the area on a co-ordinated basis at national and regional level.  We would cease to have the undesirable situation where ten years ago Shannon Free Airport expanded and now in 1978 it has suddenly contracted under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the differentiation made by the Minister between small indigenous industries and larger industries is esoteric in the context of industrial development.  The IDA should have responsibility for all forms of general industry.  There is nothing particularly advantageous in giving the IDA full responsibility for industry other than small industry.  Small industries grow and become big industries and there is this excessive preoccupation with the exigencies of size, as though it were the criterion.  One can have a technically advanced capitalintensive industry employing a small number of people.  These econometric preoccupations of the Department are handy demarcation lines for giving a role to the IDA and to SFADCo.  In the long run they do not mean too much in terms of industrial promotion.</P>
    <P>My views may not be popular in certain areas but the Government have two or three years in which to plan that advance.  I am convinced they can do it provided they grasp the problems involved.  I am not totally wedded to my future concept of it.  I am disturbed at the multiplicity of promotional agencies in this region.  If you looked through the annual report of the IDA for 1976 you would have to search to find a mention of Shannon Airport.  If you look through the regional reports you get North Tipperary, South Kerry and so on.  If you waded through the annual report of the SFADCo you would swear that the IDA do not even exist in terms of their role.  That situation is not desirable in a small country where we have a great deal of promotional work to do, where we have to bring in major companies in <Col N="128" /> which the IDA would have to take equity.  There are no political kudos in this for anybody because the young people of the region will not thank us in the years ahead, whether we have SFADCo or the IDA.  They want employment and our job is to ensure that the structures are going to bring about these jobs.  I have grave doubts that the Minister's speech will give the kind of breakthrough which was achieved by another O'Malley on another day.  I recall another occasion when the late Donogh O'Malley announced free education at an NUJ function in Bray.  The following morning he was called in by the late Seán Lemass and was told &ldquo;You have done it&rdquo;, and that it was now the job of the Government to find the money for it.  We need a little spark of imagination such as was evident in the family. That could be sparked off and a new change of structure brought about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to welcome this Bill and its improved financial provisions.  I can well realise why the share capital which will be taken up by the Minister for Finance is far greater than it was in the past. I welcome the other provisions, those relating to the provision of housing and community services at Shannon, for which an increase from £17 to £22 million is envisaged in the limit.  The grant-in-aid voted to the company annually is being increased from £17 million to an aggregate amount of £22 million: We all congratulate SFADCo on their achievements to date.  They have had to operate in a difficult area. I should also like to pay tribute to the retired chairman of the company, Brendan O'Regan, and the staff who worked with him.  I should also like to welcome the new chairman, Mr. McCabe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fail to realise the lessons that are in SFADCo for us all.  From the outset the industrial free zone development at Shannon was an innovation not only in terms of our own country but on a world wide basis. It is an innovation which has been copied elsewhere and the company have given considerable assistance to other countries.  They have always placed the emphasis on quality Irish <Col N="129" /> and on local enterprise under local control.  If we look at the performance of the company, particularly during the recent difficult years, we will find that on the Shannon industrial estate the total trade net balance, which was a favourable one, in 1976 was £41.7 million, while in 1975 it was £31.8 million, an increase of 31 per cent.  The Minister indicated that the estimated figure in net favourable balance for 1977 is £50 million.</P>
    <P>During an extremely difficult period for the country there was a level of achievement in the excess of the development of the total trade and in the excess of exports over imports in the SFADCo area.  We should all commend that.  Over the same period we have been given reports which show clearly that, even though it was a difficult time for tourism, nevertheless in the case of the castle tours and banquets, with their typically Irish nature, there was an increase in attendances of 5,271, or an increase of 5 per cent. The number of day visitors increased over that period also.  That occurred at a time when tourism in general was suffering from the recession and the other factors which adversely affected that industry.</P>
    <P>When we look at the employment performance we find there was an increase in employment in spite of the fact that in that area there were also job losses.  At the early stage of the development of the Shannon free scheme there were fears that there would be low added value industries in that area in general.  It was felt that the companies which would set up there would be of a transient nature and in a position to move off readily. In fact, we had a number of highly-publicised examples of companies pulling out readily.  There seems to have been a change in the nature of the enterprise at Shannon because one can see from the 1976 report that 90 per cent of the new jobs generated as a result of new industrial projects during that year related to the metals, engineering and electronics sectors. They involve high technology with considerable spin-off and servicing in other industries.  This integrated nature of the enterprises which have <Col N="130" /> been developed in more recent times at Shannon is a valuable development in the scheme.  It also led to the stability of the scheme as a whole during that difficult period.</P>
    <P>Looking in general at the performance of SFADCo we find tremendous achievement in the maintenance and creation of jobs during a depressed period.  There was a net gain of 1,200 jobs.  We must ask ourselves: why has this happened in such an area and the circumstances that exist there? We must ask the reasons for this. From meeting people in that area I came to the conclusion that one of the reasons was the strong personal commitment of the people who work in the area for and with SFADCo. Those people saw the development as something that affected their lives totally and they were prepared to contribute as much as possible to the maintenance of the scheme and employment and the development of new enterprises.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which seems to be strong is that relating to local initiatives. There is a lot of evidence of local enterprise and general development based on local ideas and local people.  This change in the nature of the SFADCo developments in recent years has been worth while and it ensures that it will continue to be a successful company in the future.  I was impressed by the work done by SFADCo in relation to youth.  The example there could be followed by Dublin.  The people there did not sit and dream about what might be done about youth.  They tackled the problem and initiated new projects and ideas.  I was surprised to see that there were 2,044 school-going children there while in my small community on the north side of this city, Kilbarrack, we have 3,000 school-going children.  If I travel a quarter of a mile in any direction I see as many children again in the other communities about me. This shows the concentrated approach which has been taken by SFADCo in relation to the children in that area The approach of the company is commendable.  Their Youth Enterprise Shannon Scheme, which is referred to as YES, is a clear indication of their <Col N="131" /> commitment to the young people in that area.  This project is aimed at establishing small service industries at Shannon, controlled and staffed by young people.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to discuss the broad aspect of a Bill like the one before us and not realise some of the microcosms which are within that Bill, which are there to be seen by us and acted on by us because they are very important lessons for the rest of the country.  They bring to my mind two concepts which I pass on to the Minister. The first one is that community youth enterprise projects seem to be well worth pursuing, perhaps something on the lines of those which have been initiated in the SFADCo area. The second one is the community based industrial projects.  We have a new phenomenon in Dublin city and in other cities throughout the country where communities are identifying themselves with and are organising locally a range of activities and events. This organisation is applied particularly to sports activities, local planning activities, arrangements for elderly people and special youth care facilities. It has been sponsored particularly by Dublin Corporation through their community development programme in their community environment section.</P>
    <P>We should, perhaps, start now to think a little further about this and to think in terms of community based industrial projects.  These are the small enterprise projects on the lines of what has been happening in SFADCo. We would devolve some of the responsibility and authority to community enterprise groups and give them aid, some of this capital we are talking about and some advance factory units. I have come across quite a number of people in those small community groups in Dublin who have good ideas and are looking for a means of putting them into practice.  Many of those people have their work elsewhere and are satisfied with the income they are receiving and the amount of energy they have to put into their work.  I believe that their ideas should be considered in community development.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he sees <Col N="132" /> the development of small indigenous industries in the mid-western region in a special and intensive way not hitherto attempted in the country.  He sees this as a pilot exercise, the results of which could be evaluated at the end of 18 months or two years, when decisions will be taken about the extension of such an intensive drive to other regions.  I believe the examples are in SFADCo to take on some of those concepts and to develop them now in the communities in the larger urban areas.  The Minister might consider having a number of other pilot community based industrial projects or community based enterprise groups in the larger urban areas.  My local community on the north side of Dublin is a very small one but we have 3,000 school-going children in this community. A great effort should go into a community like this.  We have examples in the work which has been done and which has been further supported by the Minister in this Bill. Youth enterprise and community based enterprise groups are two concepts which come to my mind from the work which has been going on in SFADCo.</P>
    <P>We very often become too involved with figures and we do not notice the strategies which are adopted by people, which are far more important in the long run.  Very useful strategies have been adopted by SFADCo which could be implemented in the larger urban areas.  This is a very urgent matter in so far as those areas are concerned.  I conclude by welcoming the Bill and the improved provisions which it makes for the further development of SFADCo.  I would like to thank SFADCo for the ideas and concepts they have put forward in the development of their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who reside in the mid-western region welcome any improvements which will provide additional jobs for the unemployed and will also enable those already employed to be retained in industry in that region.  There seems to be a change in the functions of the personnel of SFADCo.  The full responsibility for the promotion of major industries seems to rest on the <Col N="133" /> shoulders of the IDA in Dublin and the functions of SFADCo seem to be totally employed in the siting and promotion of small industries.</P>
      <P>This is only a pilot scheme and we must wait to see if there are permanent results.  We have to decide if we should be too critical of the functions or if it is wise to take away from a body who have promoted industry and given jobs to up to 5,000 people in the Shannon Industrial Estate and have shown an interest in the diversification of industry through the Counties of Clare, Limerick, in North Tipperary, and in particular in Limerick city. I would like to know what will be the functions of the county development teams in the future and how they will work in the SFADCo.  The county development teams up to this were responsible for the promotion of small industries.  It seems now that they will have to tie in with the SFADCo.  I am sure that will be worked out and the administration and functions of both will be clearly defined.  This change will be justified if, because of any innovation, there is a spread of industry to the more remote areas.  Despite the fact that SFADCo were very successful in the Shannon industrial area and in promoting major industry through the mid-western region generally, they have not succeeded in penetrating the peripheral area of west and north Clare in particular, areas that are far removed from the hub of industry in the Shannon industrial area.  That is not to say however that we do not appreciate the continuous development that has been taking place there down through the years.  Indeed, it has been a tremendous achievement to build up an estate of that nature in such a short period and to set up such a successful sales and export system. Even during the recession very few jobs were lost in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the new chairman of SFADCo, Mr. McCabe, will bring to that company initiative and energy of the type he has shown in the industry in which he has been involved. But if he should be deprived of a major function, that is, the promotion of big industry, he shall have <Col N="134" /> to concentrate on the smaller industries. To him and to the Minister I would suggest that if they do not succeed in diversifying industry and establishing industries in areas from where there has been mass emigration and in which there has been permanent unemployment for many decades, they will have failed in their function.</P>
    <P>In saying this I am not criticising any Minister or any Government: all can share in responsibility for the situation in which those areas of Clare to which I have referred were left without permanent employment.  The people in those areas are convinced that no serious effort was made at any time by responsible people to remedy the situation and they placed the blame fairly on the shoulders of those who deserve to accept responsibility for that state of affairs.  No serious effort was made to bring industries to those areas where there is congestion and where the quality of the land is not good enough to provide a decent living for those who wish to remain in the areas in which they were reared. We welcome industry to any part of our county but we shall be very disappointed if in the future there is not a declaration of a firm intention to locate industry, big or small, in the areas of west and north Clare in particular.</P>
    <P>There is an item in the Public Service Estimates which I find difficult to understand.  This item indicates that this year £285,000 less is being allocated towards SFADCo under the heading of administrative and general expenses in the grant-in-aid.  Should the figure not show an increase, rather than a decrease?  I trust the Minister will explain this change when he is replying.  How can we expect the status of a company to be improved if we reduce the amount made available to them in respect of general expenses on administration?  I trust that in any restructuring of SFADCo more of that company's energies will be directed towards the promotion of tourism in their area.  They have succeeded in attracting to the airport quite an influx of tourists.  The figures for last year were very encouraging for those people who depend on tourism for a living in that area.  In the absence of <Col N="135" /> industry, one must find some other source of earnings and the tourist industry is capable of being developed further in this region.  People in the different areas of the county have shown an active interest in the promotion of tourism.  We look forward to some positive results in this sphere on the basis of the money being allocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the success of the castle tours and of the banquets at Bunratty and Knappogue. This area of activity has been a major attraction for tourists in Clare.  Indeed it has sold itself.  One can cite, for instance, the wonderful entertainment provided by the singers at Bunratty.</P>
    <P>I should hope that nobody would get the idea that SFADCo as a body would now have to accept a downgrading of their status.  With the IDA assuming the sponsorship and promotion of major industry in the area, one could infer that there is a downgrading of SFADCo and that perhaps the company had not succeeded in attracting major industry to the mid-western region.  That is not the case.  There are many major and successful industries in the area, but there have been others which, unfortunately, are better not spoken of.  The loss of employment in the latter type of industry has to be overcome by the creation of new employment. The function of SFADCo is much more difficult now than it was in the past because they must endeavour to counteract the effect of happenings in some industries in order to encourage other people who are interested in establishing here.  Nobody should be discouraged by what has happened in some cases&mdash;for instance, Ferenka: that company's huge debts indicated there were many factors which contributed to their failure and these factors should not be given now as a reason for other companies not showing an interest in coming to the mid-western region.  There is available in the area a strong workforce.  In addition AnCO are continuing to retrain people.  One can only hope that the unions will be sensible now and agree among each other.</P>
    <P>I hope that unions will agree and be sensible when industry is being <Col N="136" /> threatened and will not allow any forces to disrupt the permanent industry that is necessary in any country to give good employment.  People who wish to establish industries in this region have all the necessary facilities. There are educational facilities for their families and transport facilities, including the airport at Shannon. Goodwill should be shown towards this area which has had great difficulties during the past six months.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I hope this experiment will give new hope to those who reside in remote areas.  Sooner or later it must be recognised that justice must be done.  While a concentration of industry in one area has been very successful, it may entail for some people a journey to work of 60 or 70 miles. Industry should be located in remote areas away from industrial estates. Small industries seem to be the only solution to the problem of creating permanent employment in such areas.</P>
    <P>I hope that the restructured SFADCo will succeed and will create a favourable image abroad.  We in public life will support their efforts but we expect from them something in return.  We hope that we will not be disappointed.</P>

    <P>We are all delighted that Shannon Airport has succeeded in attaining the original goal of becoming the premier airport in Ireland.  We are also delighted that it has been such a fantastic success as a duty-free airport.  We are delighted, too, that SFADCo has been such a tremendous success.  In all their fields of endeavour they have been a great credit, not only to the people who pioneered the projects in Shannon but also to the Government who backed them to the hilt through the years.</P>
    <P>The success in tourism has been an inspiration for many people.  I mention particularly the success of the banquets held at Bunratty, Knappogue and Dunguaire.  Brian McMahon's tableau at Knappogue is an inspiration for the whole of Ireland.  We had the opportunity of bringing it to Listowel and we had never realised that our own man from Listowel had produced such a brilliant tableau. I believe it should be seen all over Ireland.  There are poetry sessions at Dunguaire.  This is not incidental&mdash;it is of great importance to people who come to Ireland who want to see the background to our culture.  If there is just a short period to initiate tourists to the background of our culture and heritage, it is only necessary to go to Bunratty and show them the hall and the fisherman's cottage and they will see how we have evolved from poverty to our present situation.  It is an inspiration. They can hear about our history at Knappogue and enjoy the poetry sessions at Dunguaire.  These three castles and the folk village have contributed greatly to our reputation abroad.  In the field of tourism SFADCo must be complimented.  If anybody wants to talk about failures, the percentage if it were added up would not amount to 1 per cent.  Anybody who never makes a mistake never does anything.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that we in north Kerry are saddened <Col N="138" /> at times that we do not belong to the Shannon region.  In fact, we do belong to it.  Whilst we are affiliated to the Cork region, there should be some way in which we can be affiliated to SFADCo and the estuary of the Shannon.  What happens in Clare one day will also affect us in Kerry and what happens in Kerry affects the people in Clare and the adjoining region.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I did not come into the House prepared to speak and I have not collected my thoughts, but I want to mention one matter which disturbs me.  Land is being bought up along our side of the Shannon and I do not know whether it is happening in Clare as well.  I sincerely hope that there is a watchdog and that speculators are not buying up large areas of land on our side of the Shannon.  We do not know whether they are <i>bona fide</i> or whether they are chancers, but I hope that somebody in a high place knows what their credentials are.  In the whole of Europe there is no more precious estuary than the Shannon.  It is unpolluted and unspoilt.  Even if there was no industry there, there is potential for thousands of jobs in tourism.</P>
    <P>There is a great potential for industry. There is a great depth of water at Foynes and along to Tarbert and over that whole area I know well.  I know the Minister is keeping a very careful eye on any projects suggested for the area.  Now I believe that big and small industries can work side by side.  There is no conflict between the small industry and the large industry but we must ensure that the kind of industry we will get will not destroy the very important tourist potential of the Shannon.  There is a certain amount of anxiety but I have every confidence in the Minister that all aspects will be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>My main interest has been in cottage industries.  These have been very successful in Donegal and elsewhere and there is no reason why they could not be successful in other areas.  There is an opening for such industries in the Shannon area because the tourists want quality goods and quality goods are not produced in large establishments. <Col N="139" /> They are produced in small, personalised industries.  There is a tremendous potential for such industries in the Shannon area.  At the moment a blacksmith is producing lovely souvenirs.  There is an opening for lacemaking and weaving.  In Muckross there is a potter, a weaver and so on.</P>
    <P>We are all proud of the developments in Shannon.  I was glad to hear the Minister for Labour pay tribute to the late Donogh O'Malley.  I believe &ldquo;Des&rdquo; will do better in his particular field than even &ldquo;Donogh&rdquo; did in the field of education.  I must pay tribute to Brendan O'Regan.  One of my first assignments was to the Tourist Board. At the first meeting I attended there was a Páipéar Bán on the Irish language. It dealt with what could be done for the language in the semi-State bodies.  It was speckled with &ldquo;if it is feasible&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Feasible&rdquo; appeared right through it.  It was all over the place.  Had the people in 1916 adopted that attitude nothing would ever have been done.  When everybody was looking at me because of my amazing outburst, Brendan said: &ldquo;Kit, we like to hear that.  Keep on&rdquo;.  That was the outlook of Brendan O'Regan.  He always wanted to hear what others had to say or what others wanted in order to discover whether it had a national character.  That was the first time I realised his interest in all that was Irish and in all that has made this country.  I am sorry he is leaving but he will make an impact wherever he goes.  He has set a very high standard for those who come after him.  With that example to follow I am sure Shannon will go from success to success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Representing a Limerick constituency it is only right I should take this opportunity to pay tribute to SFADCo for the work they have done.  We can be really proud of the achievements particularly over the years of inflation in 1975 and 1976. I would be worried if there were any downgrading of SFADCo which has been responsible for so much employment in the area.  There were disappointments. Ferenka must have been <Col N="140" /> a disappointment.  These things happen. We must look to the future and stop bemoaning the past.  While we all welcome industries, I am not too enamoured of the large industry even though it will employ more.  More emphasis must be laid on the small industry situated in the towns and villages. Our roads are becoming virtually impassable because of the density of traffic.  The roads cannot cope with the traffic.  Small localised industries would take some traffic off the roads because the employees would not have to travel, as they do now, 40 or 50 miles to Shannon.</P>
      <P>I compliment SFADCo on the way in which they co-operated with the county development team and the local authority.  I was chairman of the county council and a member of the development team and SFADCo were always prepared to listen and to help. I would not like to think there is any danger of SFADCo losing some of their powers, because they have given a great service.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree more with the previous speaker's reference to tourism. We have great tourism potential in our area.  I often wonder if we are getting the best from what we have.  I would like to see a closer relationship between SFADCo and other boards in relation to tourism so that we can encourage more visitors.  We in the mid-west are at a crossroads.  Limerick city, west Limerick and east Limerick, are badly hit as regards unemployment and anything that the Government, the Minister or public representatives can do to alleviate the problem is welcome.  We should come together to work for the general good.  There was never a time when more effort was needed to help the people of the western region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their remarks.  All except one have welcomed the Bill and the various proposals which are not in the Bill, to which I referred in the course of my opening speech.  The contribution of Deputy O'Donnell, the one Deputy who was critical of everything, <Col N="141" /> could well be discounted because it is pretty evident why he wishes to take the line which he takes.  It need not concern us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly inquired whether SFADCo agreed with the proposals which I outlined towards the conclusion of my speech, and I can happily and readily tell him that they do.  I was gratified and encouraged by the enthusíasm with which they greeted my suggestions and my amendments to some of their own suggestions in relation to their future responsibilities.  When I say SFADCo, I do not confine my remarks to the board but I include the chief executive speaking on behalf of the executive of the company generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the proposed division of responsibilities by the size of industry and questioned if that was necessarily the best division. Whether it is the best or not, it is the most feasible from the point of view of what can be done without some of the difficulties that exist at the moment.  Deputy Kelly also referred to the fact that there was no mention in my speech of the Industrial Development Consortium in relation to these proposals.  At the first meeting of the Industrial Development Consortium I made reference to these proposals to the consortium, but the nature of the consortium is such that it is not a body which is there to sit on top of SFADCo, the IDA or any other individual body, and to approve or not of their policies.  It is a coordinating body, there for the advancement of industrial development and for the advancement of job creation and job maintenance.  The proposed division would be roughly on the lines of the existing division within the IDA between small industries and the other types of industry, that is, generally speaking, 50 employees and £300,000 capital assets net, but these kind of divisions are not ones that have to be strictly adhered to by statute as there are no statutory provisions in relation to the proposals made, which SFADCo have accepted. If, for example, an industry that they were promoting started off with 30 or 40 employees and developed over a <Col N="142" /> period to 60, 70 or 80, I would envisage SFADCo, as it were, remaining with that industry in the course of its development.</P>
    <P>One Deputy queried the meaning of &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; in this context.  I want to make it clear that for the purposes of what we are talking about &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; means &ldquo;Irish owned&rdquo;.  I am not to be taken as excluding the possibility of foreign-owned small industries being developed in the region, or being developed generally throughout the country.  Experience has been that 90 or 95 per cent of small industries over the years has tended to be Irish owned, and that makes it particularly valuable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan welcomed the Bill and the proposals that I made in relation to the future activities of SFADCo and he made the point that the processing of projects under the enterprise development programme should be carried out by SFADCo.  I am glad to be in a position to tell him that as a result of the changes we are now making it will be possible for SFADCo to carry out the processing of these projects.  Most of the projects under the enterprise development programme will be small industries and accordingly under these new arrangements they will be dealt with by SFADCo in the mid-western region.  If these proposed changes were not made all of those projects would be dealt with by the IDA from Dublin as has been the case hitherto in the mid-western region and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned that he believed that the North Riding of Tipperary, which he represents, had been perhaps less well looked after than other parts of the mid-western region in recent years and, by implication at least, he was rather critical of me for having designated only Limerick city and the immediately surrounding areas for the purposes of the Industrial Development Acts.  I will give the up to date statistics which indicate where the benefits and the needs are at present.  My decision in these circumstances would not then be quarrelled with.</P>
    <P>The change in employment from January 1977 to January 1978 within the mid-western region is as follows: <Col N="143" /> North Tipperary, plus 230; Shannon Airport Industrial Estate, plus 263; County Clare, excluding Shannon, minus 64; County Limerick, plus 187; Limerick city minus 1,064.  My decision is more than justified by these figures which indicate that apart from Shannon Airport, north Tipperary has done best of all and Limerick city, has done immeasurably the worst.  The Limerick city figures are mainly due to two major closures of factories in the city in the last year, the Clover Meats factory in the early part of the year and the Ferenka factory in the later part of the year.  Unfortunately in Limerick those two closures of 1977 follow hard on the heels of an abnormally large number of closures in each of the years 1974, 1975 and 1976.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell described the Bill and I quote him, as a &ldquo;retrograde step&rdquo;.  As the Bill only increases the amounts of money that can be made available under three different headings to the company, even with the sort of exaggeration that one expects from Deputy O'Donnell, it is difficult to imagine how any such Bill could be regarded as a retrograde step.  The Bill extends the limits which are contained in the current legislation.  The relinquishment by SFADCo of their partial role in regard to large industry is simply a recognition of the reality of the situation as they put it to me. Deputy O'Donnell mentioned three projects in particular which were promoted in the region in the last number of years.  He mentioned them by name, Burlington, Analog and Syntex.</P>

      <P>The new situation will prevent any duplication of effort which may have arisen in the past. Needless to say, with the considerable scarcity of resources at present, duplication should not be encouraged.  What I am proposing will avoid any possibility of this, and SFADCo will be able to devote all of their energies to the promotion and development of the sector in industry which most needs promotion and development at present, and not merely to the interests of the mid-western region.  I do not see this as purely a regional development but as in the long-term interest of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of the provision in this year's Estimates, the 1978 Estimates, for the administration of the general expansion of SFADCo.  I have to say something in relation to the funding of SFADCo for 1978 that I did not want to have to say when I have 12 or so major semi-State bodies attached to my Department. To draw attention to the way that one of them has got on in terms of finance inevitably causes tensions and difficulties with some of the others.  Unfortunately, by virtue of what <Col N="145" /> was said by Deputy O'Donnell I am forced to draw attention to the situation. The total amount of money provided in the Estimates for SFADCo from State sources for 1978 is £8.9 million which represents an increase of £2.46 million or 38 per cent over the amount which was spent in 1977. Therefore, Deputy O'Donnell's allegations about money being cut back and things of that kind are quite untrue.  He picked out one individual subhead where on the face of it there is a reduction, but he failed to take into account first of all the circumstances of that reduction and he further failed to take into account the total provided in respect of this company, which at an increase of 38 per cent over that provided in 1977, is a cause of some embarrassment to me, when other companies under my control are getting increases that are only a small fraction of that amount and which they are already complaining about to a greater or lesser extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to subhead J.1. and from that tried to imply that there was a reduction in the resources made available for SFADCo. The position in regard to J.1. is a rather technical matter because the provision made for the company in the Book of Estimates does not represent the full picture in regard to the company's financing for administration and general expenses.  The company's administration and general expenses are financed mainly from the company's own resources, that is, from rents from factories and houses, and these resources are increasing from year to year.  The 1978 figures of the total available for administration and general expenses for SFADCo are expected to show an increase of 23 per cent over 1977 and not a decrease. There was some kind of accountancy error last year, the nature of which I am not clear about, which resulted, I am informed, in part of the J.1 subhead referring to funding that comes from own resources being understated and the part referring to funding that comes from grant-in-aid being overstated, but the net result is that in that area it appears there is now going to be an increase in the total for 1978 of 23 per cent over the total for 1977.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> There is an overall increase in 1978 of 38 per cent over the overall total for SFADCo for 1977.  That is not the position that would arise in respect of a company being down-graded or run down or deprived of powers or anything of that kind, as was alleged by Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>I listened with considerable interest to Deputy Barry Desmond's contribution. Much of what he had to say was interesting.  It was very much at variance with what Deputy O'Donnell, who had spoken before him, said.  For that reason Deputy Desmond is to be congratulated on having the courage to speak his mind and not be dominated in the way that some people might have expected he would. Deputy Desmond spoke about the desirability of a local authority taking over the property at Shannon town. That is certainly something that I would find desirable also and I think that is the view of the Minister for the Environment.  While this cannot be done overnight I hope the development of a local authority for Shannon Town is something that will evolve over the next few years so that it will become as much of a town in County Clare as Ennis and Kilrush are now and that in the last resort the control over the town would be exercised by Clare County Council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also suggested as one of the possibilities worthy of consideration, as was his nice way of putting what he felt should be done, that the IDA should consider taking over the industrial estate at Shannon. I do not favour that suggestion because I think it would not be in the interests of Shannon Airport to do that.  The position as it will now be is the most satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to put SFADCo in something like their historical context, to show how they have developed up to now and how I feel they should develop in the future.  Shannon was established as an airport just before the last war when development tended to move to Foynes because flying boats were the most popular and the easiest way to convey passengers across the Atlantic in the late 1930s and up to 1946 and 1947. <Col N="147" /> By 1947 the trend had reverted to land planes which were then capable of being flown across the Atlantic from Shannon, being the most westerly airport in Europe, to Gander, the most easterly in America.  Shannon did extremely well in those years up to 1957-1958. About 1957 the jet era came into trans-Atlantic travel.  It was no longer necessary for large passenger planes flying the Atlantic to land at the most westerly airport, Shannon. They were able to overfly to London, Paris, Frankfurt and the various other cities in Europe.</P>
    <P>At that time it was seen that the considerable employment and prosperity which had been generated at Shannon were in considerable danger and my predecessor, Seán Lemass, in 1958 decided, in consultation with Brendan O'Regan&mdash;to whom I have paid a tribute, even though it was only a small part of the tribute that is his due&mdash;that notwithstanding the advancement in technology, that airport and its immediately surrounding areas should be kept as prosperous as they had developed it in the previous ten years.</P>
    <P>It was from that idea and with that object that SFADCo were founded in 1958 and 1959.  Their primary objective, put in simple terms, was to save the airport.  They achieved that objective magnificently.  No matter what happens now in terms of air transport, I do not think Shannon Airport is in danger as an airport, because of what SFADCo did in the past 19 years.</P>
    <P>Very properly, I thought, Deputy Desmond drew attention to something that is a phenomenon in this country, that if a body such as SFADCo are a success they should never rethink their existence or objectives.  That is a popular fallacy in this sphere and I am glad to say that SFADCo do not share that easy way out.  They realise they have achieved their prime objective and, with my encouragement, they will not simply lie on their oars and coast along in a cosy way.  They are going out now to do again the kind of thing they started to do 20 years ago. They were given a task at that time by Deputy Lemass.  They did that task superlatively.  I am now giving them <Col N="148" /> a task.  I am asking them and encouraging them to do something for the whole country, a task which is even more vital.  They realise the importance of that task, the importance of the development of small indigenous industries.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I was gratified and encouraged by the enthusiasm with which they have accepted that task and I have every confidence they will succeed in meeting that challenge as well as they succeeded in meeting the challenges of the task of the past 20 years, particularly the vast one put to them at the end of the 1950s.  Far from downgrading them, they are now being given, in respect of the area outside the airport, grant-giving powers.  For the first time they will be their own masters in that respect. Those alleging downgrading will do well to remember that they had not the power to give a penny of assistance in the last 19 years.  Now, for the first time, they are autonomous as far as their area is concerned.  They will not be answerable to anybody except to me, and through me to the House. They are pleased at that situation, as indeed they should be.  With the extra powers in addition to what they have, the powers now being given to them, I have every confidence in their ability to respond to an important challenge. That challenge is not important because I put it to them but because the needs of Ireland today demand that that kind of situation should be tackled successfully; and I cannot think of any semi-State body which is more likely to take on an innovative task of this kind, to face up to the difficulties that undoubtedly exist and to overcome them, than SFADCo.  I wish them every success in this difficult challenge, this immensely important task, and I am glad to see they have the support of the great majority of the Members of this House in that task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put two questions, one a matter of clarification. At the end of his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I am arranging that the IDA will resume full responsibility for industry other than small industry in the mid-west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> At page 5 of his speech he said:</P>
    <P>SFADCo and the IDA will continue to promote estuary locations for suitable new industry.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister explain precisely what will be the role of SFADCo in estuarial matters?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to deal with that because it was referred to in particular by Deputy Kit Ahern.  Up to now, SFADCo had not a great deal of contact with the estuary as such. In so far as they dealt with industry, in the matter of location, they had a certain amount of contact, but as I understand it they have not had a great deal of development work in that regard.  The reality is that in the future as in the past the IDA will have to promote the kind of major industries that will go into the estuary area.  Certainly SFADCo can work away with the IDA as they have been working with them in that regard.  The reality is that, in the future as well as in the past, the IDA will have to promote the kinds of major industry that will go into the estuary.  In the future as in the past, I have no doubt they will have the assistance and co-operation of SFADCo.  I am certain of that.</P>
      <P>I said I am arranging that the IDA will resume full responsibility for industry other than small industry in the mid-west region.  That is simply a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was relating that to what the Minister said earlier. Despite the decision to give SFADCo exclusive powers for small industries, apparently the Minister is still assigning them a certain promotional role for industries located in the estuary.  Is the Minister referring to small industries in the estuary or major industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be promoters of the small industries in the estuary and they will be the grant-giving authority.  Up to now they have not been that.  They have never been able to give any grants.  So far as the large industries are concerned, as the regional organisation the IDA will continue to assist in whatever ways are open to them in the future as they have in the past in the promotion of <Col N="150" /> major industries for the region of which I am hopeful there will be several.</P>

      <P>That is the small industries limit at the moment.  Of course, we can raise that if it seems advisable.  I have already raised the small industries limit since I took office from £200,000 to £300,000.  If I thought it necessary to do it again in a year's time, I could do it generally or specifically in relation to SFADCo. Therefore, they could be in a position to make grants to a maximum&mdash;I am not saying they will do it&mdash;approaching £200,000.  At the moment they have no grant-giving powers outside Shannon Airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 resembles a section of at least one other Bill I remember in the past few months in that it has a reference to a chief officer whether described as the chief executive or otherwise.  The Minister will remember I went through this matter on another occasion.  In the SFADCo report there is reference to a chairman, a general manager, an assistant general manager, and so forth.  There is no reference to a chief executive.  I quite see the point that there may be a species of chief executive under which one can list general managers or people who run the day to day working of an enterprise.  I cannot see the point&mdash;and I made this point before with the Minister on a different Bill&mdash;of having this parenthesis in the section.  It is confusing. At the moment there does not appear to be anyone in SFADCo called the chief executive.  If there is not, why put in this parenthesis?  It is <Col N="152" /> little more than a drafting point I agree.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 16 and 17, to insert &ldquo;(b) the raising of crops,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from a point I made on Second Stage.  The growing of crops which is the very essence of agriculture is not included in the nine categories of activity described in the section as being included under the term &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;.  For the sake of clarity the raising of crops should be so included and I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  I am sure there has not been a problem about this; otherwise we would have heard about it.  However, I am convinced it should be included.</P>

      <P>The amendment is not necessary.  The list of items from (a) to (g) as set out in the section does not purport to be comprehensive. We know that obviously tillage is agriculture.  If we add &ldquo;the raising of crops&rdquo;, where would we stop in the list of items?</P>

The breeding, rearing, or keeping of animals is mentioned in (a) and, therefore, I think that the words &ldquo;the raising of crops&rdquo; equally should be included.  It has as much to do with agriculture as any of the items mentioned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 31, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;but only after the estimate in which the provision is contained has been approved by Dáil Éireann for the year in question&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment is not directed specifically at the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I have a strong view that money should be paid out only under an Estimate of a Department when that Estimate has been agreed first by the House.  The procedure at the moment&mdash;this has been the case under previous Governments also&mdash;is that money is spent and will be spent throughout 1978 under the Book of Estimates that was published a week ago.  In fact, some of the money covered by the Estimates was spent in the first week of 1978 when the Book of Estimates had not even been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the time the Dáil comes to approve the Estimates nearly all of the money has been spent.  To my mind the procedure is meaningless. There is no way a Deputy who may <Col N="157" /> question the wisdom of certain expenditure can persuade the Minister not to spend the money because by the time the Deputy gets an opportunity to raise the matter the money will have been spent.  This is a grave weakness in our parliamentary procedure.</P>
    <P>I have always considered that we should adopt an advance year basis for the agreement of Estimates.  The Book of Estimates that we should be considering in our discussions here during this year should be the Estimates for 1979 so that Ministers will not be able to spend money until the approval of the House is obtained. In that way we would have a much more realistic debate regarding public expenditure.</P>
    <P>I realise that the power to spend money as contained in section 6 is not a very great one.  I am introducing my amendment on this Bill to make a general point, one that is not confined to agricultural credit.  Irrespective of whether the amendment is accepted here, I shall introduce a similar amendment in respect of every Bill with which I am concerned where such a provision exists.</P>
    <P>If we are to maintain control of the enormous growth of the public sector in our economy we must have stronger parliamentary procedures to ensure that Deputies, who represent the people and who are asked to vote for the taxes being spent by Ministers, have an opportunity of approving and of influencing the Minister's thinking in advance on the amount to be spent on a particular subject and that nothing shall be spent until the House, which is supreme in this matter, has agreed it.  Therefore, I urge that nothing be spent under section 6 until the Dáil has first approved it.  I would ask the Minister of State also to use his influence to ensure that a similar procedure is adopted in respect of all subsequent enactments and in relation to the Standing Orders of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>While valid points were raised by Deputy Bruton, there was raised the bigger issue of parliamentary procedures to deal with <Col N="158" /> finance.  We cannot really deal with those in the context of this specialised Bill.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment because the funds must be made available from the beginning of the year to meet the payment of services as they fall due.  For that reason the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965 was passed to authorise the Minister for Finance to issue, out of the Central Fund, before the passing of Estimates, up to four-fifths of the amount allocated the previous year for any vote of service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister of State must know what was spent last <Col N="159" /> year.  I could understand if he came in here and said he could not tell us what would be spent this year because he does not know what will be the full expenses to be met; there may be unpredictable elements in the operation of the ACC.  I accept that.  Obviously all that could be included would be a general provision under some subhead of the Department of Finance for a specific figure.  That figure could be exceeded or not under the normal procedure whereby savings under one subhead are transferred to meet excesses in another.  If the Minister of State is asking the House to approve this section he should have some idea of how much money was spent last year, a year for which all records should now be to hand in respect of the administrative expenses of the ACC.</P>

May I ask the Minister of State when these passbooks will come into operation and, secondly, under what section of the Bill are they accounted for?</P>

      <P>I am aware that the machinery has been set up already for the provision of passbooks.  Could the Minister of State give us some indication of the date they will come into operation?</P>
      <P>This is a Bill endeavouring to tidy all of the legislation so far as the ACC are concerned; we may not have another Bill for two or three years.  Do I take it that, so far as current account facilities are concerned, they are out for at least the next three years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about current account facilities now.  The section talks about the memorandum of association of the ACC which sets out the objective.  The section more or less lays down the parameters within which the memorandum of association of the ACC can be drawn up.  I submit to the Minister of State it is open to the ACC under the Bill as drafted to grant full current account facilities to their clients and to amend their memorandum of association accordingly. In particular I refer to subsection (1) (a) (iv) which allows the ACC to provide such other credit facilities as they think proper.  Then subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this section shall prevent or restrict the inclusion among the objects of the Corporation as stated in its memorandum of association of all such objects and powers as are reasonably necessary or proper for or incidental or ancillary to the due performance of the principal functions aforesaid and are not inconsistent with this Act.</P>
      <P>My reading of those two provisions together indicates that the ACC have very wide powers to move into the full banking field should they deem it necessary, should the Minister, under his overall responsibility for agricultural credit, decide to allow them do so.  If the Minister were to make such a decision it would not be necessary to come back with amending legislation. It would be appropriate for the Minister to clarify that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right.  Current account facilities could be introduced under this section as it stands.  It is a matter for the Department of Finance, the ACC and the Central Bank to determine when and on what terms these facilities will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>How seriously is the Minister of State taking the situation <Col N="162" /> at present?  In their operations the ACC take up people's papers and they cannot go to the banks for the current account facilities that are necessary to run a farm today.  As far as security is concerned, the ACC must have security.  Current account facilities are essential for overdrafts and short-term loans.  I should like to know how seriously the Minister and his Department are taking this issue.  It was a great mistake not to take the opportunity of tidying up this legislation when the Bill was being drafted.  When a man's papers are taken up by the ACC as security we must ensure that he is able to get short-term credit facilities.  This matter should be given serious consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, that is a matter for the person concerned in relation to the finance he is looking for.  There is nothing to stop him making current account arrangements with his bank while his papers are held by the ACC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Overdraft facilities help a farmer to write cheques whenever the need arises to do so.  If you ask the ACC for £10,000 you will get the full amount in one cheque.  Overdraft facilities should be available.  He should not be charged interest on the full amount for the period of the loan. I am disappointed that this point was not included in the legislation.  I want to know if the Minister is taking this matter seriously, because the farmers are serious about it.</P>

      <P>It appears there is provision in those sections to operate a full banking service to promote any object the ACC feel is necessary in agriculture and I welcome that provision. I have only discovered that this power is there.  The power given in this Bill is similar to the proposal of the previous Government in relation to <Col N="163" /> the IDA, a proposal which was criticised by the Minister and his party.</P>

      <P>I am interested in this matter because I have experience of co-operatives having all their deeds with the ACC.  It is not easy to get accommodation from banks when you have your deeds with the ACC.  I was associated with a large co-operative which had lodged its securities with the ACC and our bank closed our account very fast.  When you have all your securities with the ACC they should provide a full banking service for you. The ACC are doing a great job but they should go a little further and provide full banking facilities for those whose securities they hold.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State explain why this is an internal matter.  Surely a proposal by a body such as the ACC to engage in full banking facilities will have consequences not only for the ACC but for the other banks and the entire credit market.  To say that it is an internal matter is not representing the facts as they are.  If the Minister agrees to that proposal, and there is strong evidence in favour of his doing so, it will have consequences for the business obtained by the banks because undoubtedly the ACC will be taking some of their business. While I agree with the proposal all parties are entitled to know the nature of that proposal before a decision is reached.  I request the Minister of State to reconsider his position and state that the text of the ACC proposal will be made available.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point in relation to subsection (a).  That subsection states:</P>
      <P>(a)  undertake, promote, engage or participate in, manage or supervise any scheme or project which, in the opinion of the Corporation, will, or is likely to, increase, whether directly or indirectly, the productivity of, or be otherwise of benefit to, agriculture, horticulture or fisheries,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read that provision as allowing the ACC complete freedom to engage in any agricultural enterprise on their own account.  It seems to allow them, for instance, to run State farms, to buy up large tracts of land and run farms.  It seems to allow them to set up their own processing plants in competition with processing plants in the private sector.  Generally, it seems to extend the level of public participation in the agricultural sector of the economy to a wide extent.  I know that the ACC's policy has been that of a credit giving institution and that their direct participation in the agriculture economy is largely confined to that sort of activity, but I wonder whether powers as wide as those contained in that subsection should be in a Bill of this type without some check.  It is possible under this subsection for the ACC to completely change their policy without referring that change to this House for approval.  They could decide to devote a proportion of their resources to buying up farms and running them.  I presume they could not do this without the consent of the Minister and I would like to have that confirmed by <Col N="167" /> the Minister.  There is an open possibility there which should not be allowed to eventualise without the further sanction of the Oireachtas being necessary.</P>
    <P>My second point is in relation to subsection (g) which states:</P>
    <P>(g)  assist in and facilitate, in any manner it thinks proper, the formation, promotion, establishment, reconstruction or reorganisation of bodies corporate referred to in paragraph (e).</P>
    <P>There seems to be a degree of overlapping here between the ACC, the ICC which I believe have similar powers, and, possibly, the IDA.  I believe the latter have similar powers to become involved in the reconstruction of companies.  I know that in the agricultural processing field the IDA are already heavily involved.  If there is an overlap, is that overlap desirable from the point of view of State policy in view of the fact that the ACC, the ICC and the IDA are responsible to different Ministers?  However, there is a possibility of overlapping with the result that diverging policies could be pursued by different State bodies in relation to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first point, it is not subject to the Minister's approval under the Act but the Minister, being the only shareholder, would have a say.  As far as overlapping is concerned, that is possible; but generally the ACC, the ICC and the IDA have working arrangements under which they avoid overlap. The objective in this section is to give the ACC a promotion role in areas where private enterprise may be deficient.  The fact is that the ACC rarely used this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State give the House examples of where they used this power?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that. I have grave reservations about this.  I <Col N="168" /> am aware that the power has existed since 1961 and that we did not have a massive State take-over in agriculture in the intervening period.  To that extent the point I am making is a theoretical one but it appears that the ACC, on their own initiative, have the power to get involved in areas of agriculture without even the requirement of formal ministerial consent.  The Minister of State should consider whether such ministerial consent should be imposed as a condition in future.  If the Minister of State indicates that he would be prepared to consider an amendment on these lines between now and Report Stage.  I will be pleased.  If not I will draft an amendment for Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must accept the fact that the Minister, being the only shareholder, would have a say in relation to any of that type of activity.  I do not believe there is any necessity for such an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree in general terms with Deputy Bruton because I feel if there is one criticism which can be made of the ACC in recent years it is that those provisions have not been used.  There is no IDA for the agricultural industry.  This section was included obviously with the intention of its extension at some later stage to cover the promotion of such projects in the agricultural field.  I feel this is a very important section and although, as Deputy Bruton pointed out, it has not been used to any extent previously, I believe it could be used very fittingly now.  We must encourage a greater degree of risk-taking and intensive development in the various facets of agriculture.  I believe that provisions are very clearly laid down here.  The only thing which seems to be lacking is their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The large farmers, unless this kind of provision is here and unless it is actually put into practice, will remain large and prosperous and the small farmers will remain small and will not have the capital and the assistance to grow as the new technologies will allow them to grow.  The young farmers who do not have the capital to set up in business also need venture capital and <Col N="169" /> assistance to engage in the new projects based on their knowledge and skill and the technologies which are available to them to take those projects off the ground and get them under way.</P>
    <P>This is a very important provision. It will have a very valuable effect in the distribution and creation of wealth particularly with the people who do not have it at present.  I am sure we all agree that the larger and better organised farmer who has the assets and the security behind him has done very well since our accession to the EEC.  We are deficient in this area which, in my view, needs to be developed and used a great deal more than it has been in the past.  It is very important to have this power there.  I accept what Deputy Bruton says that perhaps it should exist in another body which have another responsibility.  It is not covered by any of the other bodies but is covered here and is here to be developed.  The Minister will have a say as to how it should be developed. I am not only in favour of keeping it there but in making a little more use of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that the powers are there.  It is a bit far-fetched to talk about them buying up land.  I do not know what people would think, with the price of land as it is at the moment, if a State body started buying it up.  If the Minister allowed that he would not be very long in power.  There is no IDA for agriculture.  There is nobody to promote industry for agriculture.  The reason why they have not done anything in relation to promotion is that all the existing processing firms and co-operatives are financed by the ACC.  The ACC lack initiative because if they do something which is badly needed they will hurt somebody to whom they have already given finance. I do not believe there is any danger that they will plunge into this because they are caught everywhere.  If they went into this the people with whom they would be in competition are already financed by the ACC.  I would like to see the ACC show a little more initiative to help the small farmers.  I would like to see this provision left <Col N="170" /> there for that purpose.  I agree that, theoretically, what Deputy Bruton says is quite possible but I do not think it is likely to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to come back on what Deputy Woods said.  I would not like to be interpreted as opposing the exercise of those powers. My point was that there should be some control on their use to ensure that they did not prejudice the existence of other private bodies involved in agriculture.  I rose originally to make that point.  I believe in doing so.  I have drawn attention to the power which the ACC have which would not otherwise have been adverted to.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the ACC should give much more attention to the exercise of the powers contained in the Bill.  I suggest that the Minister might request the board of the ACC to carry out a specific review in the coming year of their policy in relation to the powers granted to them in section 9 (a) and to report to the Minister within the next 12 months how they see their role develop under such powers.  The Minister should request that the ACC's review of this matter should be contained in their next annual report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 states that the &ldquo;Corporation may do all or any of the following&rdquo; and goes on to say in paragraph (a):</P>
      <P>undertake, promote, engage or participate in, manage or supervise any scheme or project which, in the opinion of the Corporation, will, or is likely to, increase, whether directly or indirectly, the productivity of, or be otherwise of benefit to, agriculture, horticulture or fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very important power for the ACC to have.  I agree with Deputy Woods when he said that it is vital to the smaller people.  It is very important that the corporation have this power to develop, for example, small processing industries, to cater for a number of small people.  It is obvious that the Minister has control because the Minister for the time being is the principal shareholder in the ACC so I do <Col N="171" /> not believe they are likely to do anything that the Minister would not agree with.  We should ask the ACC to look at the promotion of processing industries in agriculture particularly in areas where there are small farmers who cannot get a livelihood.  I believe if the ACC engaged in this that the processing industry in particular areas could become viable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>ACC, to the best of my knowledge, have used this provision very effectively.  In any areas where small processing industries have been set up the ACC have financed them and taken the risks on many occasions.  It depends how one interprets what Deputy Woods said, but I would not like to see the ACC going into what we could describe as the research field because that would involve duplication.  Their primary objective should be to function as a moneylending institution and to follow through that objective to the last.  That is what they are there for, not for research purposes.  Therefore, I trust that Deputy Woods would not have this in mind.  I assure Deputy Bermingham that so far as my knowledge of the ACC goes, they have taken full advantage of this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I mentioned the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; but in effect I talked about the risks taken in regard to ventures and projects but this depends on how one regards a situation. One might say that to engage in something new could be regarded as research but unless we begin to make some innovations and to invest some of our money there will be no possibility of creating the jobs that are necessary.  In that sense I accept that some use has been made of this section but without going into a long debate, the kind of debate which, as Deputy Bruton has said, could be useful in itself, I would suggest that one of the greatest lacks on the part of the ACC has been their failure to put into operation all the possibilities open to them.  To have explored these possibilities would have been to the advantage particularly of the smaller and younger farmers and to all those other <Col N="172" /> young people who have the technical know-how and who are prepared to put that knowledge to use.  I would support Deputy Bruton regarding the desirability of a review of this section by the ACC in conjunction with the Minister with a view to ascertaining how it might be developed in future. Unless this is done, many opportunities will be lost and many young people who are highly qualified will continue to be frustrated in the various fields of research in agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I visited the North of Ireland recently, one of the institutions in aid of agriculture there that impressed me most was the Agricultural Trust which, incidentally, is managed by a man who worked previously in the Agricultural Institute at Moore Park.  The Agricultural Trust may take over an idea which has been developed by the research people in the North of Ireland but which has not been developed to the extent that it has immediate commercial viability although capable of being developed that bit further.  Having developed it the Agricultural Trust are required to sell it to private enterprise where it is worked on a full commercial basis.  In other words the trust have an intermediary role between the research idea &mdash;which obviously is oriented towards commercial practice but not developed fully to that extent&mdash;and the strictly viable commercial operation.  I trust that when replying the Minister will indicate the powers he will be asking the ACC to undertake.  They would benefit greatly from a study of the work being done by the Agricultural Trust in the North of Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides for what Deputy Bruton advocates in regard to the Agricultural Trust.  There is a certain amount of confusion in relation to what Deputies have said about the ACC promoting private enterprise on the one hand&mdash;this is something in which they are involved to a considerable extent&mdash;and their promotion of <Col N="173" /> some activity.  As Deputy D'Arcy has said, there must have been thousands of occasions on which the ACC have supported the activities of various individuals and bodies.</P>

I do not understand the Chair's ruling in this regard but since the ruling has been made it is not possible to discuss the amendment, the main purpose of which was to endeavour to achieve a change in the figure of £20 million in the share capital of the ACC.  It may transpire that because of inflation it is found necessary to alter that figure to, say, £30 million.  A great deal of the time of the House can be wasted by having to bring in a totally new Bill for the sole purpose of changing a figure in an existing Act.</P>

      <P>As the amendment has been ruled out of order I am discussing the section.  Perhaps the Minister would consider providing, by way of amendment, an order making power subject to its having an affirmative vote here, as a sanction to enable him to alter some of the money figures specified in the Bill, thereby obviating the necessity of going through the full process of a new Bill.  If we had an order of the nature I am advocating it could be debated here on its own when necessary.  This would speed matters up and would enable financial limits which tend to become out of date, particularly in times of inflation, to be adjusted more easily in order to take account of reality.  I trust the idea will appeal to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to the necessity of coming back to the House in the near future seeking to increase that amount.  Regarding the amendment that was disallowed, share capital is a matter of fundamental importance and, in accordance with standard practice, should be catered for by statute only.

      <P>I do not understand paragraph (b) of subsection (6).  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>(6)  The Minister may, for the purpose of compliance with so much of the Companies Act, 1963, as requires that there shall always be at least seven members of the Corporation or for the purpose of providing a person appointed or about to be appointed a director with any qualification required by the articles of association, do either or both of the following things:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> (a)  transfer to any person one share for the time being held by the Minister,</P>
    <P>(b)  require any member of the Corporation to transfer any such share held by him to the Minister or to any other person nominated in that behalf by the Minister. </P>
    <P>Is it absolutely necessary for a member of the board to hold a share in the company, even though he is appointed by the Minister?  If so, what is the reason for that requirement?  Is it of any practical value?  It seems rather odd that the Minister should be able to require a person who holds a share to just hand it up.  Presumably a share is something of value.</P>

      <P>There is a provision in subsection (3) (a) whereby the Minister can bear losses on foreign currency incurred by the ACC as the result of depreciation in the value of currency in which they are holding some of their assets or, alternatively, receive the gain if they happen to back a winner and invest their moneys well. If the Exchequer adopts a policy of taking all gains and bearing all losses in relation to the ACC's holdings of foreign currencies, it would seem that the ACC have little incentive to be careful about the way they purchase foreign currency because they know that the ACC will not suffer one way or the other.  If they happen to buy the right currency which rises in value the Minister will take the gain and if the currency declines in value the Minister will bear the loss.  I realise this is qualified by the fact that the Minister is the principal shareholder and he can direct them as regards general <Col N="176" /> policy, but a matter like this would not be referred to the Minister and would be dealt with by the ACC themselves. What is the thinking behind this provision? In practice would the Minister exercise this power only in the event of a very large loss or gain?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No 4:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 49 to 53, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; in line 49 to the end of the subsection and insert &ldquo;elected to either House of the Oireachtas, he shall, on being elected, cease to be a director of the Corporation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My purpose in tabling this amendment is to allow a person to remain a member of the ACC until such time as he is actually elected.  A situation could <Col N="180" /> arise where, if a person were nominated but defeated in an election, he would be off the ACC for good by virtue of the fact that he was nominated even though at the end of the campaign, perhaps 21 days later, he would again be eligible to become a member because he had not been elected to the Dáil.  Membership of the ACC is in some sense a political office, not in a party sense but in the sense of an office exercised in delegation of the functions of the Minister.  Members of the board are people with a knowledge of public policy and it is quite likely that such people would have an interest in becoming Members of the Oireachtas. If members of the board are nominated but fail to be elected they automatically lose their positions in the ACC.  I realise that there is the problem that, if they were nominated, they might use their positions as members of the ACC during the campaign to gain support.  I would not wish my amendment to facilitate that sort of operation because it would be both dishonest and undesirable.  Perhaps the Minister would consider, instead of accepting my amendment, some provision to enable members of the board to continue as members but not to exercise their functions for the duration of the campaign or put some constraint on them to avoid any suggestion that they might be using their positions for political purposes.</P>

That could not be tolerated.  I have no objection to the provision.  Deputy Bruton says he would not like to do anything that would facilitate the possibility I have mentioned.

      <P>It is almost 30 years since the subject matter of this section was the subject of a lengthy and colourful debate here in February 1947, approximately two months before I was born.  Deputy James Dillon was particularly eloquent in his criticisms of the provisions of this section.  I think he was a little more suspicious of the motives of the Government than was actually warranted by subsequent events.  I would like to ask the Minister now how this provision with regard to ability in the use of the Irish language operates.  What sort of tests are imposed on staff to ensure they get this credit? How much credit in monetary terms is involved? What is meant by the phrase in subsection (d) &ldquo;subordinate duties&rdquo;? Apparently people in a subordinate capacity are not entitled to get this credit even though they may be fluent gaelegeors?  If one is not subordinate, whatever that means, one can get this credit if one is able to speak the Irish language.  Is that really fair?  I presume that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  Perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate on what actually happens?</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying the fact that up to now Irish was compulsory, but that now a financial credit scheme is to be introduced for people who speak Irish.  Is this a new departure in public policy in relation to bodies of this nature?  I believe it is the Minister of State's Minister who is responsible <Col N="183" /> for the promotion and the use of Irish in the public service.  Will this institution of credits for people who speak Irish be adopted on a systematic basis across the whole public service? If so, we should hear a statement as to the thinking behind this proposal.  I can see difficulty in a system of credits where the credits could be so easily availed of that everybody with two words of Irish could get a credit so that there would be practically no incentive involved, or alternatively the standard could be so high, and the credit so substantial, that people would receive credits for ability to speak Irish, although that ability would not be necessary in their jobs.  I understand that in some aspects of the ACC's operations the ability to speak Irish would be very important. For instance in the local office in the Gaeltacht the ability to speak Irish would be vital, but for an officer in headquarters in Dublin who would not be dealing with the public the ability to speak Irish would be unimportant. Since we are authorising a credits system, and since this is a new provision that seems to mark a departure from the previous policy, the House is entitled to a little more information as to precisely what is intended to be done under the new powers which the ACC are being given in section 18.</P>

If the object of the provision is not so much to aid the efficiency of the ACC in dealing with Irish speaking members of the public but to promote generally the use of Irish regardless of whether it may be useful, the credits should apply to everyone.

      <P>According to what has been said it seems that extra marks will be given at an examination for the knowledge of Irish.  A situation could arise where none of the people with a knowledge of Irish would reach the required standard, even with the bonus marks, and the ACC could find themselves with no Irish speaking staff.  It is not now compulsory for any member of the staff to have Irish.  The ACC could find themselves in a situation where they would have nobody on the staff capable of dealing with an Irish speaker from a Gaeltacht area seeking a grant.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a point on Second Stage in regard to where the Minister for the Public Service controls the salary of the chief officer of the corporation.  He does not control the salary of the second or third in command of the corporation.  He does not control the salary of some people who might be brought in for special skills, for instance the law officer of the corporation, but he does control the salary of the chief officer.  I am not speaking now of the ACC; I understand in other public bodies to which <Col N="186" /> this provision applies&mdash;and it applies to nearly all public bodies which are based on statute&mdash;the chief officer, as a result of the Minister exercising his control, was in some cases earning less than people who were working under his direction.  That is not desirable.</P>
      <P>To an extent one's salary is valuable not only from its monetary point of view but also as an indication of the public's appreciation through the Minister of the value of the work one is doing, and it does not seem appropriate or conducive to the proper running of a body like this that a situation should be allowed to arise whereby a man who is the top man who has to take the responsibility, subject to the board, for all decisions, should be earning less than people whom he has the responsibility to direct.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy may have some evidence from closer knowledge of the operation of the ACC that this has occurred in the ACC.  I have no such evidence, but I think it has occurred in other public bodies.  I ask the Minister for State if he will make a statement of his Government's policy in relation to this matter and if he will ensure that this situation does not arise in the ACC.  I know that this is a matter for the Department of the Public Service rather than for him but I ask him to consult with his Minister, who is also Minister for the Public Service, with a view to giving such an assurance, if not now then on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton on this point.  I cannot see why the right to decide the salary of the most important officer in any of these organisations should lie with the Minister.  Deputy Bruton has said that this has happened in other institutions as a result of this provision which we are now considering for the ACC.  While this did not happen in the ACC it almost happened there.  I cannot see why the Minister wants to retain this power.  We have had fixed wage agreements for the past five years or so, and surely it should be left to the discretion of the boards of directors to state what the remuneration of their chief officers <Col N="187" /> should be.  This has caused serious frustration in a great many areas over the past three years in particular and unless the Minister has some extremely sound reason for retaining this power I believe it should be withdrawn.  If the board of directors are to have the responsibility of the entire staff of an organisation I cannot see why they cannot be entrusted with fixing the remuneration of the chief officer concerned.</P>

With regard to some specialised staff or some unusually skilled people being required, if they be required on a part-time basis or temporarily, the matter can be discussed between the board and the Minister. The Minister is quite emphatic in regard to this provision and is anxious that it be fully adhered to not only in relation to the chief executive but down the line as well.</P>

It shall not take effect unless it has the consent of the Minister for the Public Service. As the corporation already have a superannuation scheme which, in accordance with their Memorandum of Association, is subject to ministerial approval and which is governed by a trust deed, it is felt that for the purpose of overall supervision and coordination of superannuation in public sector employment it is sufficient to provide for ministerial control over any future changes in the superannuation terms.</P>

      <P>The purpose of having a company separate from the State is that they would be able to function separately.  If, as the Minister has said, he is to appoint members of the board of directors, he has a general overseeing control and I should have thought that that control would be sufficient, that he would allow the company and staff to make their own superannuation fund arrangements and that he would have sufficient confidence in the company to allow this to be operated without requiring the approval of the Minister for the Public Service for any change in the terms of the fund.  I could understand such control in the case of salaries: there might be questions in regard to general pay policy. However, we are talking about a superannuation fund, about pensions, and I should be grateful if the Minister would explain more fully why this control is necessary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take the full time because other Deputies may wish to speak on this matter.  I regret that for the second time in recent months I have been obliged to raise in the House a staff relations dispute in the Post Office.  The Minister and the House may recall that the first one I raised was in Cork city recently in the engineering depot where a protracted dispute was finally resolved after the Minister and his Department paid some direct attention to the views expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Post Office Engineering Union.  That dispute was resolved after some considerable difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that I must again raise the question of the dispute in the constituency I represent.  For the past 16 days, some 70 staff in the Blackrock, County Dublin, Post Office, postmen, drivers and sorters, have refused to work new duty arrangements or rosters. As the House may be aware, this dispute was triggered off by the suspension of one of the men concerned who refused to carry out the new duty.  For some years past I have been aware of the very poor staff relations in this <Col N="193" /> postal district.  When I was on the Government side of the House, local Deputies were aware of the excessive degree of friction and unrest in the district, disputes concerning issues of supervision, inspection and negotiations on new duties, and lack of consultation about the introduction of such new duties.  These have been known for some time to the post office management side and the trade union concerned, the Post Office Workers' Union, have been aware of a deterioration in staff relations and, on occasions, they warned the management side of the prospects of serious trouble.</P>
    <P>In the Blackrock area, in Monkstown, Deansgrange, Booterstown, Mount Merrion and parts of Leopardstown and Stillorgan, there has been no letter or parcel delivery for three weeks.  About 1,000 bags of parcel and letter mail are affected, presumably lying in Sheriff Street awaiting transmission to Blackrock for delivery.  As all Deputies for the constituency know, the effects are becoming widespread and the hardship caused has reached such proportions that we as public representatives have no option but to raise an industrial dispute of this nature in this House.  This is not the best place for the settlement of an industrial dispute. By and large we do not make political issues of such matters across the floor of the House, but we have no option but to raise this matter here. Pensioners may be awaiting company pension cheques.  Employment is also being affected in the area in companies like Glenabbey, Dublin Crystal and the Skerries Shirt Company.  Almost everybody in the area is affected by this dispute. People are becoming more and more irate at the prospect of not much progress being made towards a settlement.</P>
    <P>I have excellent relations with the Minister and the Minister of State, but I must confess I view with some amazement their lack of direct involvement in the settlement of this dispute. When the Minister took office in July, there was a flurry about a flowery part of the manifesto which spoke about a review and an effort being made to improve staff relations in the Post Office.  This was greeted with <Col N="194" /> some respect at the time.  The Post Office Workers' Union did not write to the Minister until about August to give him some time to settle in.  I understand the union wrote to the Minister in August and have heard nothing from him since, and this is January 1978. Unless I am profoundly mistaken, the Post Office Workers' Union have had no meeting with either the Minister or the Minister of State, notwithstanding the fact that such a meeting was requested to discuss staff relations generally in the Post Office.  Therefore, it is no surprise to me that in Blackrock we have this kind of situation.  I do not know what the Ministers are doing, whether they are popping in and out of the GPO, or just doing constituency work.  This Department were abused when Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien was Minister.  He was on the receiving end in regard to many matters.  Now two Ministers are responsible and nothing much seems to be done.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be consultations in the very near future.  Otherwise, at the annual conference of the Post Office Workers' Union shortly some very sharp things will be said to the Ministers concerned.  The Minister should state the position in regard to Blackrock.  It is regrettable that it developed into an unofficial strike. Because of the pressure and the local friction it finished up on that note. As a trade unionist I deplore unofficial strikes, but degrees of aggravation can arise; then when people are told to do new duties, they refuse and confrontation takes place.  The Minister should intervene.  The old roster duties should be continued for an interim period.  Clearcut negotiations on the new duties should commence immediately.  Both sides should be helped to clear the air or some of the side issues including some personality issues.</P>
    <P>For this reason I would ask the Minister to intervene and to consult directly with the Post Office Workers' Union in an effort to resolve the matter.  A lot more could be said which perhaps might better not be said.  I understand that meetings by the men concerned are taking place <Col N="195" /> either tonight or tomorrow night.  I understand that the union officials concerned will be discussing the matter with their members.  I hope the archaic structure of staff relations will be the subject of early review by the Minister.  I understand that other Deputies wish to speak so I will leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister one question about this matter.  He is aware from public and other comments of how serious the situation is.  Has he received information to the effect that the proposed allocation of time involves men in doing without a meal between a period from 9 or 10 o'clock in the morning until 4 o'clock in the afternoon? Perhaps he will consult with those affected to see if this is so.  He might also consider the question of having some outside person to act as intermediary between the personnel involved and his own Department to ensure that the matter would not be the subject of any recriminations on a personality basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to the plea made by Deputy Desmond for direct intervention by the Minister to help in the resolution of this dispute.  Ministers on the Government side of the House have argued in respect of many industrial disputes that it is not appropriate for a Minister to intervene.  In a dispute in this Department where the Minister has direct responsibility, I would urge very strongly on him the wisdom and the advisability of putting his personal prestige and that of his office behind an initiative which would resolve this dispute.  One of the reasons I ask him to do so is the very simple and demonstrable fact that, the longer this rather sad dispute drags on, the more intense the dislocation of social, industrial and commercial life in the area will be.  It is an area that spans not only Deputy Desmond's constituency but also large areas of the South County Dublin constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not be realised generally by the public who do not live in that part of the southern suburbs that despite <Col N="196" /> presumed residential character there is quite a lot of industrial and commercial activity in the area. Needless to say, this form of commercial activity, which with very few exceptions is small industry and smallscale commercial activity, is intensely dependent on a regular postal service for the normal aspects of commerce, such as orders and deliveries and also for the delivery of equipment and machinery to fulfil orders.  One has only to read this evening's papers to see that the effects of the dispute are beginning to bite very severely in the economic infrastructure of the area.</P>
    <P>If the dispute is not solved in the very near future there will be a rapid growth in the concern of many of the private residents in the area who rely quite substantially on the postal services. Many inhabitants of the area would tend perhaps to be rather older than the national average and they rely on the postal services very much more than younger people who are more mobile and who have greater access to other methods of communication. They may be elderly people who are dependent on the postal services simply to bring them funds from relatives or from the social welfare services in order to enable them to live.  I have had a number of first-hand complaints where this sort of problem has arisen.</P>
    <P>Again, people are worried&mdash;perhaps unnecessarily the Minister may say but it is a real worry in their minds&mdash; that electricity supplies will be disconnected because of their failure to pay ESB bills that have not arrived. I realise that is not the direct responsibility of this Minister&mdash;I have put down a question to the appropriate Minister asking him to ensure that this does not happen&mdash;but I would impress on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the increasing urgency of his intervention in order to solve this dispute.  It is a dispute whose effects grow in geometric proportion rather than in arithmetic proportion and I would urge him to use his best offices in the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who have spoken before me for their courtesy in curtailing <Col N="197" /> their speeches.  I should like to add a few words to what has been said.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has inherited a very bad set of circumstances so far as industrial relations in his Department are concerned.  I hope he will understand that although the matter before the House this evening is largely a localised and constituency problem, the concern that has been expressed by the other three Deputies and which is now being expressed by me is something which could very easily become nation-wide.</P>
      <P>I intend no reflection on the Minister personally but I should like to ask him to visualise the situation in which he would find himself if the population of Dundalk or Drogheda were in a similar position.  The population of those towns is roughly comparable to the population served from the Blackrock Post Office.  If that population were without postal services for the last two or three weeks as described by Deputies I think the Minister would be active in the matter and perhaps he would even step over the limitations which Ministers pretend exist around themselves in regard to intervening in industrial disputes.</P>
      <P>Before Christmas in connection with Ferenka we heard it was impossible for a Minister to intervene.  The Minister for Labour maintained the modesty of a daisy for four weeks while that factory was in the process of closing down, on the alleged grounds that a Minister must not get too involved, that he must not devalue his own presence&mdash;which he devalues in other ways every day of the week&mdash; by intervening too easily in an industrial dispute.  Overnight all of that changed.  The Minister for Labour should be present this evening because this matter is one of the most important areas of industrial difficulty. That Minister intervened in the Ferenka dispute to no effect.  He did his best for two days but to no avail and then he disappeared from the scene.  He was not seen again until Ferenka closed.</P>

      <P>The House is discussing another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to impress on the House and on the Minister that <Col N="198" /> this supposed etiquette whereby a Minister does not devalue his own reverence, where he stands clear of industrial disputes, is no use to the people who are suffering.  I wish to support strongly what Deputy Horgan said in regard to the people in the constituency which he and I represent. Many of them are retired and they depend on remittances and pensions which cannot be collected but which arrive through the post.  I will give the House another example which I encountered today when I tried to send a telegram of sympathy in that constituency only to find it could not be delivered.  I am not complaining about this from my own point of view but I am sure the Minister will realise what a comfort and support it is to a bereaved family to have messages delivered at the moment of their anguish.  I know I do not need to press this point because the Minister is a decent, humane person but I must emphasise to him the dimensions of the situation over which he is presiding. I urge him to intervene in this matter.</P>
      <P>Of course that is entirely apart from and is in addition to the point made by Deputy Horgan which I support and repeat, that the commercial and industrial life of the district which spans two constituencies is being rendered impossible.  In common with the other Deputies I am getting messages daily from people whose businesses are being rendered impossible by the continuation of this dispute.  I do not expect the Minister to work an industrial miracle but I say that industrial relations generally, and in particular in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, are one of the top economic and social problems in the country. The Minister will be doing a good job if he regards that as the first nut for him to crack before he is six months in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to express my regret that the public generally and the business community in particular in the Blackrock postal area have been deprived of postal services for more than a fortnight.  I am fully conscious of the difficulties <Col N="199" /> and hardships that arise from being deprived of postal services for any period.  I have been most anxious from the outset that this unofficial industrial action should be brought to an end quickly and service restored to the public.</P>
      <P>Earlier today I outlined in a written reply to Deputy Cosgrave the background to this industrial action.  I have no knowledge of the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave but I would point out that in any event the staff have the opportunity of raising any such problem through the normal channels, through their union.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will realise, with a housing development, the motorisation of deliveries and so on, revision of postmen's delivery routes is a constant feature of postal operations.  These revisions are carried out in accordance with well-defined and accepted standards and, in addition, the average volume of mail to be delivered and the time required to deliver it are determined by practical tests of delivery routes.  The revision in the Blackrock area arose primarily from a need to provide for housing development in the area.  When the revised arrangements were communicated to the local branch in August 1977 they asked that the arrangements be amended to include a five-day week for postmen-drivers at the office.  The arrangements were amended accordingly and they were later discussed locally and with the headquarters union catering for postmen.  Introduction of the revised scheme was deferred on five occasions.  I have a note of them here&mdash;from 24 October to 7 November, to 21 November to 28 November, to 9 January, to 16 January, at the request of the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that point the Department were satisfied that the arrangements were reasonable and in accordance with standard practice.  But&mdash;and I want to emphasise this&mdash;the union representatives were assured that any difficulties that might arise in their operation would be examined in consultation with the union.  Nevertheless, when the Department introduced the revised <Col N="200" /> arrangements on 16 January the staff refused to implement them.  One man was suspended for his refusal and the others took unofficial strike action.  I do not need to emphasise that action of this kind is contrary to agreements existing between the Department and the post office union for the peaceful resolution of problems.  My Department and the union headquarters concerned have been in continuous contact about this action.  I understand the union have advised the men to call off their action and resume normal work. Of course the union and the staff are aware that, when normal working has been resumed, it is open to the union to represent any problems the staff may have whether in relation to the revised arrangements or to any other matters causing them difficulties and to have them examined.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the present action is unofficial.  Deputies, and particularly trade unionists like myself, recognise they are treading on dangerous ground when they ask that somebody intervene in unofficial industrial action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond stated here that he is reasonably satisfied that the staff at Blackrock have justification in respect of a number of their complaints. But if the staff have what the Deputy would consider to be justification in respect of complaints, is he suggesting that this justifies taking unofficial industrial action and inflicting inconvenience and hardship on the public?  The Deputy must be aware that there are agreed peaceful procedures by which any complaints or proposals the men have can be processed through their union.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked in the course of this discussion what action I am taking to resolve this problem.  It must be realised that, in a situation of this kind, the options open to me are limited.  I have been pressed by some Deputies to enter into negotiation with those who are taking unofficial action.  It will be recognised generally that such action by me would lead to an intolerable situation for my Department and for the union.  I could not contemplate such a situation.  The only action open <Col N="201" /> to me is to deal with the headquarters of the union in regard to arrangements for a return to work.  I would ask the Deputies concerned&mdash;and I know they are concerned about the situation&mdash;to use whatever influence they have with those who are on unofficial strike to get them to return to the peaceful procedures for resolving their problems.  I would also appeal very strongly to the staff to return to work so that the matters at dispute can be settled amicably.  The changes which were made, relatively speaking, are minor. They are in accordance with agreed accepted practice.  I feel they do not justify the placing in jeopardy of jobs referred to by a number of Deputies here this evening nor do they justify the very severe inconvenience to the public they serve.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious that this dispute be settled.  Again I would appeal to the staff to reurn to work.  When they do we can immediately have discussions with the union to resolve whatever problems they may feel they have in relation to this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already taken some steps in relation to dealing with the social welfare aspect of it. I would hope the staff would recognise that we are only too anxious to try to deal with the problems facing them but that these can be dealt with only within the agreed procedures. They are not procedures imposed by the post office; they are agreed procedures between the Department and the union.  I would earnestly appeal to them to go back to work and make use of these procedures.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that private dentists in the North-Western Health Board area have withdrawn their services from the fee per item scheme due to the low fees paid by the North-Western Health Board as compared with fees paid by the Department of Social Welfare for similar items of treatment; and the cost of granting the North-Western private dentists parity of fees with social welfare fees over a full year.</P>

      <P>I am aware that private dentists in County Donegal who augment the services provided by public dentists have withdrawn their services.  The public dental officers are continuing to provide a service.</P>
      <P>In an effort to solve the problem an offer to increase the private dentists' fees was made before their services were withdrawn.  This offer provided for an increase in line with standard increases payable under the terms of the various national wage agreements.</P>
      <P>The additional cost of conceding the social welfare rates to the Donegal private dentists over a full year would amount to approximately £15,000.</P>

    <P>There were 109 applicants for these competitions, including those who have applied for a competition, for which interviews are being held in February.

      <P>An application for contributory old age pension was received from the person concerned on 5 September 1977.  Unfortunately, he furnished an incorrect insurance number on the claim form which was, in addition, not fully completed.  This necessitated further inquiries, resulting in delay, before the claimant's insurance record was finally traced.  His record showed that he did not satisfy the statutory contribution condition for receipt of contributory old age pension which requires the claimant to have at least 156 contributions paid since entry into insurance and his claim was accordingly disallowed.  He has been advised of this decision and of his right to appeal against it if dissatisfied. Arrangements have been made to have his eligibility for a non-contributory old age pension investigated and he will be notified in due course of the result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of, and very much regret the inconvenience to people in the Blackrock postal district resulting from unofficial industrial action by postmen there.</P>
      <P>This is the third occasion in two years on which postmen in Blackrock have taken unofficial action.  In April and in September, 1976, strikes followed refusals by postmen there to accept the same output rates on the delivery of telephone directories as postmen elsewhere in the Dublin area. On this occasion there has been a refusal to accept certain changes in delivery routes.  The changes which affect only ten of a total of 49 routes provide for housing development in the district by utilising spare time on some existing routes and, at the staff's request, give a five-day week to some parcel delivery drivers.  Revisions of this kind are a normal feature of postal operations.</P>
      <P>The revised delivery arrangements were discussed fully with the union representing postmen both at branch and headquarters level and their introduction was deferred on five occasions since August 1977 at the union's request. Although my Department are satisfied that the revised arrangements are reasonable and in accordance with standing practice the union representatives were assured that any difficulties which might arise in their operation would be examined immediately in consultation with the union.  The unofficial strike action taken by the postmen is, of course, in breach of the procedures agreed between their union and the Department for the resolution of problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have been in continuous <Col N="63" /> contact with the union representing postmen in an effort to bring about a resumption of normal work at Blackrock.  The postmen have not been prepared so far to return to work although they have, I understand, been advised by their union to do so.  I hope, however, that they will return to work quickly and pursue through the agreed machinery any difficulties they may have.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> It is not possible to give the particulars requested for commonages still to be divided in the county.  Representations have been received in respect of some 50 commonages and these will be investigated by the Land Commission as quickly as possible having regard to the many demands of the land settlement programme.  It will, of course, be appreciated that for various reasons&mdash;low agricultural potential, prohibitive cost of fencing, difficult configuration or lack of interest on the part of some of the co-owners&mdash;not all existing commonages would be suitable for division.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to allocate a specific amount of money for expenditure on commonage division in a particular year.  The necessary expenditure is sanctioned as individual schemes for division are approved.</P>

    <P>(<i>c</i>)  There are no official statistics of total jobs created in Irish industry.  The Central Statistics Office in their annual census of industrial production computes the numbers engaged in individual sectors of industry.  The latest completed census relates to the year 1973.  For 1974 onward the best estimate of the annual numbers engaged is the average of the quarterly figures published by the Central Statistics Office from the results of monthly and quarterly inquiries.  On the above basis of computation, the following were the total numbers engaged in transportable goods industries in each of the years 1971 to 1977 inclusive:</P>

    <P>It should also be borne in mind that Arbour Hill Prison and the training unit cater mainly for prisoners transferred there from Mountjoy Prison.  In these places, a total of about 55 prisoners attend formal education classes conducted by four full-time and two part-time teachers&mdash;17 other prisoners in the training unit receive some formal classroom instruction as part of their industrial training programmes, which are conducted by four specialist instructors.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the overall planning and development of their area rests with the local planning authority and their objectives are set out in the development plan of their area.  It is a matter for this authority in preparing or reviewing their plan <Col N="78" /> to carry out such surveys as may be necessary to assess the needs of the community in the area of physical planning, including the provision of shopping facilities.  Development plans usually contain provisions for the regulation of traffic, the provision of public parking and the improvement of access to existing shopping areas and, where new housing developments are taking place, for the provision of adequate shopping facilities with ancillary car parking in the immediate vicinity of the new development areas.</P>
      <P>In so far as Dublin City is concerned, the development plan, which is currently under review by Dublin Corporation, indicates that it is the planning authority's policy to facilitate improved access to existing central shopping areas by public transport and to secure the provision of additional short term parking facilities adjacent to shops.  The planning authority also propose to seek, in co-operation with the Garda, the exclusion of vehicular traffic for some shopping streets in central areas and generally to facilitate pedestrian movement within and between the shopping areas.  It it also the policy of the planning authority to strengthen existing shopping centres in suburban areas and that shopping facilities to serve new residential areas will be grouped in convenient locations related to the estimated shopping requirements of the areas they serve, adequate provision for car parking and access for goods delivery to be required.</P>

    <P>* Figure for average weekly earnings for Mid-March 1977 is the latest available.</P>
    <P>The Consumer Price Index reflects changes in consumer prices arising from any cause and is calculated for the middle of February, May, August and November of each year.  It will be appreciated that accurate comparisons cannot be made between the increases in the CPI and the increases in average earnings which occur due to the variation as between the <Col N="85" /> periods covered by the CPI and the operative dates of the various national wage agreements and also because of the fact that different categories of workers received the increases provided for in the national wage agreements at differing periods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> However, the percentage increases in the &ldquo;all-items&rdquo; CPI index during the periods most closely related to the operative dates of the National Agreements are shown in the following table:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to vocational education committees to operate the Free Books Scheme in any one of, or any combination of, the following ways in respect of necessitous pupils: (a) by grant of the full cost of books; (b) by grant of the part cost of the books; (c) by the purchase of second-hand books for distribution; (d) by a book loan scheme; (e) by a part loan and part grant scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Necessitous pupils are defined, for the purpose of the scheme, as those from homes where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of parent, large family with inadequate means, mother a widow or other circumstances that would connote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.  All pupils deemed necessitous in accordance with these guidelines rank for consideration; possession of a medical card is not the sole criterion of need and, of itself, does not automatically qualify the bearer for aid under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Where a committee utilises the money available to make a standard part-cost grant for the largest possible number of pupils considered to be in need, the amount of that grant will naturally form a smaller portion of the total cost in each case than if fullcost grants were made to some pupils or if a higher criterion of need were applied.  It is nevertheless, considered that the scheme is worth operating under the present guidelines.</P>
    <P>All moneys available for the scheme for 1977-78 school year have already been allocated to vocational education committees and it would not be possible, at this stage, to make a further grant to the Donegal committee.</P>

      <P>Two groups of staff at the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, are in dispute with the Governing Body of the institute.</P>
      <P>I have already explained the background to one of these disputes in my reply to the question asked in the House on Tuesday, 13 December 1977&mdash;that is, the dispute in which members of the academic staff of the institute have refused to participate in student assessments until an &ldquo;acceptable offer&rdquo; of payment is made for invigilation and marking of scripts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations are still in progress between the governing body and the academic staff and I understand that pending decision on the claim the academic staff have agreed, by way <Col N="91" /> of recognition of progress in the negotiations to date, to set the examinations for Michaelmas 1977 and henceforth.</P>
    <P>In March 1977, ASTMS (The Assocciation of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staff) reactivated a claim by technical staff at the institute for parity with technicians employed by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  This claim had been rejected by the Labour Court in 1976. In November 1977, the Labour Court again rejected this claim.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Labour Court's recommendation, the technical staff at the institute have taken industrial action in support of this claim.  This action by the union appears to be in breach of the national agreement.  I understand that the institute has referred the case to the Steering Committee of the Employer Labour Conference for its advice.</P>

Those items in the report which come within the range of my responsibilities are already receiving, or will receive, my fullest consideration.</P>

      <P>Our statistics indicate that approximately 70 per cent of children aged 4-5 and practically all children aged 5-6 are attending infant classes in national schools.  By international standards, these are higher figures for participation in the pre-compulsory level of schooling.  The needs of this group of children are taken fully into account in the provision of accommodation and the staffing of the schools and it would appear that local school management boards do not need further encouragement in the matter.  The decision whether or not to send a child to school before the compulsory age is of course, one for the child's parents.</P>
