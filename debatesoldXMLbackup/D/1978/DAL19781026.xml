      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter I wish to raise, if I may.  Arising out of the business yesterday I sought a ruling from the Chair and I want now to read the record of what was said.  I asked, on a point of order: &ldquo;Are we now having a debate on the motion for the Second Stage of the Bill?  Am I correct in interpreting it that this is what the debate is?&rdquo;  You, Sir, replied affirmatively: &ldquo;The motion is whether or not the Second Stage should be ordered.&rdquo;  I then drew your attention to Standing Order 86 (2) which makes provision that such a debate shall not exceed a period of six hours in the aggregate and: &ldquo;At the expiration of the said period, if the proceedings have not been concluded, the Ceann Comhairle shall put forthwith the question or questions necessary.&rdquo;  It appeared to me subsequently that there was some confusion between us on the question of your ruling and I simply want now to draw your attention to the fact that you ruled affirmatively on my point of order as to what was the debate we were having and the application of Standing Order 86 (2) follows automatically from that ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, of course, was that the Bill be ordered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What you ruled was whether or not the Second Stage should be ordered and this is precisely in line with what is in Standing Orders, which is a debate on the motion for the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing two totally different things. One was the right to have the Second Stage taken and the other was the actual taking of it.  The latter motion always is: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This refers to every Bill on the Second Stage, as Deputies know very well, and opposing the taking of the Second Stage does not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording is perfectly clear.  The wording is &ldquo;the debate on the motion for the Second Stage of a Bill&rdquo; and that is precisely what we were having and what you ruled we were having.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were right in that, then any time a Second Stage would be ordered the debate could commence immediately on the Second Stage.  That is the logical conclusion. That is not what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the intention of the Committee, the proceedings of which were read out yesterday, and this is intended to implement that intention and it is precisely because that was not, in fact, carried through due to a misunderstanding that I am raising the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have refrained from discussing here the interpretation of a Standing Order which is something more appropriate to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I hope that Committee will discuss the matter.  If it were the intention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that a Private Members' Bill should get on to the Order Paper at Second Stage without any order being made, they should have made that clear in Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the intention as stated in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee should have obviated the necessity for bringing an order before the House, which is what we had yesterday.  The Chair has no option.  When an order is before the House it is a motion and a motion may or may not be opposed.  If it is opposed, the Chair must permit a division. The Chair has no other way out.  I hope that ends the matter until it is discussed in another place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Chair's reference to Standing Order No. 85.  I am concerned with Standing Order No. 86 (2) and your ruling was that this was a motion, whether or not the Second Stage should be ordered and that is, if the definition of English means anything, a motion for the Second Stage. Therefore Standing Order No. 86 (2) applies and there is no time limit on the debate.  I submit that this is the position. If the English language means anything, <Col N="1300" /> I do not think you can decide otherwise, whatever about the interpretation of Standing Order No. 85, which I agree is disputed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I could not be here yesterday but I was a member of the Committee which brought in this Standing Order.  It was presided over by the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The spirit of that Standing Order was that Private Members, as of right, should be able to bring in a Bill and have it read a second time for six hours.  That was the spirit of the Standing Order and there is no doubt about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a further point of order, I should like to clarify what could be a misunderstanding.  Reference was made to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but my understanding of Standing Orders and of the rulings and precedents of the House is that the amendment of Standing Orders is a matter for this House.  Whether or not a matter is discussed beforehand by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is a matter of convenience in the judgment of the people concerned.  It is quite clear from Standing Orders and from the rulings of the Chair that, giving notice of it, a motion can be put down in this House to amend Standing Orders and that is the correct procedure.  I want to clarify that in case there is any misunderstanding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this measure is to detach from the operation of the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977, the agricultural research function which that enactment sought to integrate with the agricultural advisory and training and educational services and to give all three services a better basis.  When the Bill from which that Act emerged was being debated in this House a little over 12 months ago, I made no secret of my conviction that the dissolution of An Foras Talúntais, as the Act proposes to do, would be a most retrograde step and on numerous occasions since then I have reaffirmed that conviction.  Since its foundation in 1958, the institute has not only given sterling service to Irish farmers, processors and others connected with the agricultural industry, but has established for itself an international reputation as one of the foremost agricultural research institutions in Western Europe.</P>
      <P>To be effective, research requires a particular kind of environment.  That this environment is available in An Foras Talúntais is evident from its continued success.  I am satisfied that these favourable conditions would rapidly disappear if the agricultural research service were to be absorbed into another authority which would have to cater also for agricultural advice, training and education.  The incorporation of An Foras Talúntais in an organisation such as the National Agricultural Authority would, I believe, lead to a serious decline in morale in the research sector with consequent ill-effects on valuable research work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read some comments recently suggesting that my stand in this regard is not a matter of conviction and that I am merely expressing the views of certain elements which are pursuing selfish interests. I should like to refer the authors of these comments to the Jones-Davies Report of 1967, the Review of National <Col N="1302" /> Science Policy in Ireland published by the OECD in 1974, the Review of National Scientific and Technical Information Policy in Ireland also published by the OECD in 1974, and the Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Groups 1966 to 1969, commonly known as the Devlin Report.  To a greater or lesser degree all these objective reports favour an independent organisation for agricultural research and, in a number of instances, they reject outright the idea that the advisory services should be amalgamated with the research institution.</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced that a dilution of the research effort could not be avoided if research were combined with the advisory and training services.  The Bill before the House accordingly proposes to retain An Foras Talúntais as an autonomous body with responsibility for the research activities in which it is now engaged.  In this way the Bill will remove the threat of having the identity of An Foras Talúntais buried and its true function lost in an organisation which would also be concerned with the advisory and education services.  The Bill also proposes to assign to An Foras Talúntais additional functions in regard to basic veterinary research which have hitherto been the responsibility of my Department.  These functions were in any event to be assigned under the 1977 Act.  In addition, it is my intention, when the Bill becomes law and is put into operation, to assign to An Foras Talúntais added responsibilities in relation to cereals research which have hitherto been reserved to the Department of Agriculture and which also were to have been transferred under the 1977 Act. This proposed transfer is not mentioned in the present Bill because it is possible to effect the transfer under the 1958 Act which set up An Foras.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the National Agricultural Authority will be dissolved and a new body, to be called An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta, will be established.  This new body will have the function of providing training and advisory services in agriculture and making available the scientific and practical knowledge required by the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> While it is essential that the research function should be independent, it is also necessary to maintain and develop the present liaison and good relations between the research services on the one hand and the training and advisory services on the other.  With this in mind, the Bill provides for a strengthening of existing relations by ensuring that at least two members of the board of An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta are appointed to the Council of An Foras Talúntais and that at least two members of the council of An Foras are on the board of An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>There have been some comments about the substitution of the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; for &ldquo;education&rdquo; throughout the measure.  I made it clear during the passage of the 1977 Act that in this context the use of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; was somewhat patronising as, indeed, is the term &ldquo;instructor&rdquo; in relation to the advisory service.  I reject totally the inference that the people on the land belong to a primitive uneducated class who have to be taken by the hand and put on the path to progress by the more enlightened.  To my mind, the term &ldquo;training&rdquo;, which can cover certain educational aspects, is much more appropriate and includes no patronising overtones.</P>
    <P>With regard to the alleged undue influence of the civil service, it should be borne in mind that approximately two-thirds of the funds that will be expended by each of the two institutions involved will be contributed by the State and voted by this House each year.  Surely it is only prudent that the State should have some control over the use of these funds.  The requirements set forth in the Bill are only the minimum necessary and, while there is no insistence that the man who pays the piper should call each tune, he should at least be able to influence the general programme.  Furthermore, those who talk of civil service control are really referring to power exercised by the appropriate Minister.  In so far as this Bill confers any powers on the Minister for Agriculture, this is being done in accordance with Government policy.  The checks and balances set out <Col N="1304" /> in the Bill are, in my view and in the view of the Government, the minimum necessary to ensure that the interests of all concerned are fully safeguarded.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say a few words about some other amendments of the 1977 Act which are provided for in the Bill.  These are mainly of a consequential or corrective nature.</P>
    <P>As the Board of An Chomhairle will not have any responsibility for agricultural research, it is logical that the number of members of the board should be less than that provided for in the case of the National Agricultural Authority. Provision is, therefore, being made for a total of 16 members instead of 24 for the authority.  The smaller number should contribute towards greater efficiency.  As the board will not be responsible for research or involved in third-level education, specific representation by the universities does not seem to be necessary. It was quite correct in the 1977 Act to provide for University representation on the National Agricultural Authority because that body would have included An Foras Talúntais which itself had four university representatives on its council. Now that An Foras will not be part of An Chomhairle, university representation is not called for.</P>
    <P>Some publicity has been given recently to allegations that the Bill interferes with the status, powers and functions of county committees of agriculture.  I want to make it clear that there is nothing whatever of this kind in the Bill.  Indeed, the only provision in the Bill relating to the county committees is in section 26, which provides for an amendment of the existing law on the method of appointing members of the committees.  This amendment is being made because on examination of the provisions of the 1977 Act I have found that some of these provisions are unworkable.  This did not become clear earlier and in correcting it now I am doing so in a way that calls for the least possible change in the present system.  Section 42 of the 1977 Act stipulated that at least three-fifths of the membership of each committee must be members of the parent county council, the remainder to be appointed on the nomination of voluntary rural organisations active in the County <Col N="1305" /> and designated as such by ministerial order.  However, the second schedule to the Agriculture Act, 1931 stipulated that the total number of members of a county committee of agriculture must not be less than three nor more than four times the number of county electoral areas in the county on the date of the meeting of the county council at which the county committee members are appointed. Because of this, there is no way of knowing how many persons should be nominated by the voluntary rural organisations.  The Bill corrects this by specifying that the number of members of county committees shall be four times the number of county electoral areas instead of a figure which could vary between three and four.  A second difficulty which has come to notice is that while the 1977 Act required that three-fifths of the members of county committees should be members of the parent county councils, the county councils had previously been free to select persons who were not county councillors and, in fact, all but two of the county councils did so.  I doubt if it were intended last year to take this freedom of choice away from the county councils.  I think it emerged accidentally in the course of drafting the 1977 Act.  In any event, the present Bill restores the choice.  Under the Bill, county councils will be able to select their quota of members of county committees from amongst their own members, or from non-members, or partly from each.</P>
    <P>When section 48 of the 1977 Act relating to the State endowment of the National Agricultural Authority was being debated in the House, I gave it as my opinion that the doctrine was one of despair.  I was referring to the provision under which the State grant in any year must not be less in real terms than the total amount provided by the Oireachtas in the financial year immediately preceding the date of establishment of the authority.  I am still of that opinion and have, therefore, included in the Bill a section which will provide for the deletion of the reference to &ldquo;real terms&rdquo; and all that it connotes.  It is my hope that the financial requirements of An Chomhairle will be assessed each year not on the level of grants in the year <Col N="1306" /> before it was set up but on the basis of its real needs to do a proper job.  In this way An Chomhairle can be considered fairly with all others when it comes to dealing with the annual Estimates.</P>
    <P>This Bill also gives An Foras Talúntais access to additional finance.  For the first time since its establishment An Foras is being given power to borrow, subject to the usual safeguards.  It is also being given the power to use for capital purpose moneys in its endowment fund. Up to now the fund has had to be kept invested and An Foras had the use of the interest only.  These new provisions are in line with similar provisions in the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have observed that the Bill as drafted contains a provision at section 12 (a) requiring the approval of the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for the Public Service for any determination by An Chomhairle in regard to the numbers, grades and the conditions of service relating to leave and hours of work of its staff.  Since the Bill was circulated, various groups and bodies have made representations to me about this provision and following consideration of these representations and discussions with the Minister for the Public Service I propose to put down an amendment on Committee Stage providing for the deletion of section 12 (a).  I believe that this should satisfy all those who were complaining about this section.</P>
    <P>In regard to An Foras Talúntais the Bill requires the approval of the two Ministers for the remuneration of directors subsequent to the first director whose remuneration is already determined by the Government.  In addition to the control of remuneration of directors, the Bill requires the approval of the two Ministers for remuneration and allowances of the staff of An Foras Talúntais. This provision is in line with what would have happened under the 1977 Act if An Foras had been merged into the National Agricultural Authority.</P>
    <P>I would like to add in regard to controls on remuneration in both An Chomhairle and An Foras that these controls simply represent the present Government policy in relation to the semi-State bodies in general.  This should <Col N="1307" /> not be misinterpreted, as has been done, as a sinister effort to control the policy or the general effectiveness of the two bodies.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I might mention that on Committee Stage I will be proposing a few minor amendments, apart from the change in section 12 to which I have already referred.  These amendments, which are mainly of a drafting nature, are designed to assist in smoothing the process of transferring functions to An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>Finally I must say that in commending this Bill to the House I am doing so in the belief&mdash;and in the belief of the Government&mdash;that the structure now proposed is in the best interests of the farming community and the nation as a whole.  I am satisfied that by maintaining their separate identities but operating in close harmony, An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta and An Foras Talúntais will provide the best means of advancing and developing the agricultural training and advisory service and the agricultural research service.</P>

      <P>In order that this restrictive and divisive Bill could have been introduced the country and Irish agriculture has had to lose two years during which planning could have gone ahead in developing our advisory and research and educational services under the National Agricultural Authority established by law by the previous Government.  The House must address itself not only to the merits or otherwise of this Bill&mdash;and I contend they are very few indeed&mdash;but must also ask itself was it worth losing two years in which a career structure could have been provided for our advisory services, in which plans could have been made by developing a new educational service based on the directives of the EEC and the most modern technology.  Was it worth losing two valuable years&mdash;and time is money&mdash;in order that the present Minister for Agriculture could be able to come into this House and deliver his personal tablets of stone on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, whatever the judgment of this House in the matter, the judgement of <Col N="1308" /> the country and Irish farmers will be adverse to the Minister.  They will see that his priorities in his first year and a half in office have not been the right ones.  They have been, for reasons on which I shall not dwell for any length, to overturn the work of his predecessor.  I do not believe that is a productive purpose or that it is the best use of his time in his interests.  It certainly is not the best use of his time in the interests of Irish agriculture.  That will become very obvious as the debate continues on this Bill.</P>
    <P>We intend to discuss this Bill in considerable detail not only on Second Stage but also in Committee so that the Minister's error will be evident.  The reorganisation of our advisory, educational and research services has been a matter of public debate for about 15 years.  There have been reports on the subject which it was felt 12 years ago were merely being used as a device to postpone a decision.  The reports were received by the then Government but still no action was taken.  No action was taken until the tenure in office of Deputy Mark Clinton as Minister for Agriculture.  He did not inherit an Act from his predecessor on this subject.  To be fair to his predecessor, now his successor, he had produced the heads of a Bill which had been circulated to his colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>What did the heads of that Bill contain? They contained his ideas in 1973. We know that any Minister is responsible for what is sent by his Department to other Departments as his proposals.  He cannot blame particular civil servants. He certainly would not be in order to name those civil servants in debate and say: &ldquo;This was not my memorandum, this was Dr. X's memorandum.&rdquo;  No Deputy, who has respect for the relationship between a Minister and his servants, would do so.  The heads of the Bill drafted in the Department of Agriculture and circulated in the name of the then and present Minister for Agriculture were his proposals and he cannot avoid that fact.</P>
    <P>What did those proposals contain? They contained, in substance, exactly the same proposals that his successor <Col N="1309" /> brought into the law of the land and which he seeks to overturn.  They are the proposals which he had put to his colleagues in 1972.</P>

      <P>That is not correct. Deputy Bruton and Deputy Clinton know that is not correct.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had to wait 15 years for this.  Development was inhibited and a further two years delay has been added before this Bill was introduced. Is that value for money or value for time?  The main purpose of the Bill, as the Minister said, but not the only purpose, is to separate the Agricultural Institute from the remainder of the educational advisory services.  What is the purpose of State-aided research?  I am not asking what is the purpose of research in the universities. That may be the pursuit of pure knowledge but we are not talking about a Bill which will take the universities under the umbrella of the advisory services. We are talking about an institute set up deliberately separate from the universities to carry out a different type of research.  If there was not a distinction between the type of research to be carried out by the institute and its purpose and the type of research carried out as part of their on-going task by the universities who are autonomous institutions, even though they are substantially State supported, there would not be an Agriculture Institute separate from the universities.  We would just be giving aid to the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Agricultural Institute research is different from university research.  The essential difference is that the research carried on by the Agricultural Institute must be directly related to the needs of agriculture, the pressing needs of economic development in the country.  That is the reason the Agriculture Institute was established and <Col N="1310" /> why it was separated from the universities. Obviously, to ensure that it reflects the needs of farmers, that its distinctive purpose is fulfilled, there must be the closest possible links between the research carried out by that institute and the work being done in the field by agricultural advisers, agricultural educators and farmers, which does not reflect the real need of farmers, which, for instance, places an undue emphasis on pure production increase without taking account of the difficulties that any farmer in an actual situation faces in turning that pure production potential into reality on his farm with his resources of land, labour, capital and motivation.  The value of this research may be of great interest to academics who wish to know what is the ultimate in terms of maximum production.  Its value to the country in that context is a very suitable pursuit for university research in agriculture, which should be endowed generously by the State.  It would not have the immediate effect on increased production that research carried out by the Agricultural Institute should have.</P>
    <P>The real road-block in Irish agricultural development is not lack of research to tell us what can be produced, what is the maximum number of livestock units which can be carried per acre of grass, what is the maximum grain yield that is possible with a particular type of soil and a particular type of fertiliser.  The lack of figures in relation to those possibilities is not the problem.  The problem is in turning them into action on our farms.  The reality is that, notwithstanding the very substantial increase in agricultural prices which has taken place as a result of our membership of the EEC and of the successful work done at the Council of Ministers in terms of increased prices by the former Minister for Agriculture in particular, we have not had the growth in production or the potential which has already been well identified, translated into increased production on the ground and on our farms.  The problem there has been one simply of turning the research into reality.  The way this can be done is through a proper integration of advice and educational services with research so that the research findings can be passed <Col N="1311" /> through to the farmer and the farmer's experience can be passed back through the one institution with a single common direction and a single common purpose, back to the researcher.  The researcher then will be directing his attention to the real problems being faced on the ground by the farmers and will be responding to the needs of farmers and not to the needs of some abstract academic.</P>
    <P>The reality is that we have had very uneven growth in agriculture below our potential.  For instance, notwithstanding the increased price, we have not achieved the targets for increased growth in agriculture which were identified as being possible of achievement in the White Paper circulated prior to our entry into the EEC.  In so far as there has been growth in agriculture it has been uneven, a growth that has not been shared equally by different parts of the country or by different sizes of farms. Clearly the problem is on the farm and not in the research institutions.</P>
    <P>I will give the House two figures which will illustrate our failure to achieve our full potential and the fact that that failure is distributed in an uneven fashion.  From the period 1966-68 to 1972-74 the growth in production per adjusted acre in the east of Ireland has grown on a farm of between 50 and 100 acres by 2.3 per cent while in the same period, which covers the initial period of entry into the EEC, in the west there was a drop of .7 per cent.  The figures are for an adjusted acre and not in respect of an actual acre.  In the east during the same period growth per adjusted acre on a 200-acre plus farm was 3.3 per cent whereas on a 15 to 30 acre farm, the small farms where there is greater dependence on income from agriculture to provide the basic necessities of life, there was a drop of 2.8 per cent in growth.</P>
    <P>The problem is not one of telling farmers what can be achieved because clearly the best farmers can and have achieved it, as can be seen from the figures I quoted.  Those who are tuned into what is going on in the research institutes, those large farmers who, as the Minister said on a previous occasion, are <Col N="1312" /> able to get on to the institute direct and talk to a friend who is the researcher in a particular field, who know other researchers personally, subscribe to <i>Farm Food and Research</i> every month and read other publications, are well served by the existing arrangement.  The Minister and I, as farmers, are well served but that is not the problem.  The problem is involved in translating that into action on the farms I mentioned where potential has not been achieved. That is not a problem which will be solved by the Bill.  The solution to the problem will be inhibited by the Bill because it is dividing off research away from the development role, away from the role of the advisory service in getting to the farmers who need help.</P>
    <P>We do not want an advisory service which is only responding to a demand which essentially will come from farmers who are already motivated, know what they can achieve and are achieving a great deal.  We want a service for research and education which goes out in a missionary way to the farmers who are not achieving what they should.  The figures I quoted demonstrate that there are many farmers who are not achieving their full potential, who are not availing at all, in terms of increased production, of the increased income from the prices which are available.  A research service which is separated from these in an ivory tower and concentrating on ultimate production possibilities which can only be translated into reality on farms whose owners are already motivated, namely the large type farm, will not be doing the best job that should be done for agriculture.  We must recollect that the purpose of the Agricultural Institute is to serve the needs of Irish agriculture.  It is not primarily one&mdash;it may be a secondary benefit&mdash;as the Minister, in opposing Deputy Clinton's Bill seemed to be implying by his constant harping on the subject, of providing jobs for graduates. The fact that people happen to graduate from a university does not give them any right to be provided with jobs.  Indeed, it may be suggested that others have a greater right than graduates who have already had the benefit of a substantially tax-supported education.  They should be better able to fend for themselves than <Col N="1313" /> the farmers on the 15-30 acre farms I mentioned or farmers in the west who have not had the benefit of a university education.</P>
    <P>The idea of predicating a service, as the Minister seemed to be doing in his contribution to Deputy Clinton's Bill, on the notion of jobs for graduates is to my mind putting the cart before the horse. Of course there must be jobs for graduates but there will only be jobs for them in the service of Irish agriculture and the money will only arise out of which to pay those graduates if there is production to produce tax resources to pay them.  We must start with the priority of increased production on our farms, particularly those which have not achieved their potential.  This Bill will inhibit that rather than aid it.</P>
    <P>Even looking at this from the point of view of agricultural graduates who are in the service&mdash;I have not been speaking of their need so far because I believe they are secondary; the primary needs are the needs of the farmers to increase production&mdash;as a determining factor I do not believe their interests are being served by the Bill.  Anybody in the space of his career will benefit from working in a different environment.  A person who spends 40 years working in the same area as an agricultural adviser, unless he is a highly motivated individual or a person of exceptional talent, will not achieve his full potential.  Likewise, a person who spends his entire career closted in a research institute working on the same subject for 40 years of his career will not achieve his full potential. However, if one could move such a person from a research institute into giving advice to farmers for five or six years thereby giving him an opportunity to try to translate his research findings into reality on farms and then return him to the research institute he would be a better researcher and his research would be more relevant to the needs of the community than it would have been if he stayed there all the time.</P>
    <P>An adviser with a particular interest in a certain line of production, as many advisers develop because of necessity&mdash; for instance if they work in the Minister's county they will have a special interest in tillage&mdash;should be <Col N="1314" /> moved for a period to research work. There is no reason why a man who has developed a special expertise in tillage in the advisory service should not be moved to Oak Park, for instance, to work with people in the Research Institute and then he could go back out into the field to work in the county committee as an agricultural adviser on a project in which he is interested having become more conscious of what can be done in terms of maximum production because of his spell in the research institute. That man's advice will be far more relevant in the eyes of the farmer by virtue of the fact that he has spent some time in the research institute than it would be if he had stayed in the advisory service.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland much research is carried out in colleges of education such as Greenmount Agricultural College.  In Greenmount College it is possible for those engaged in research as their primary activity to give lectures to students so that students get the results of research direct from those who are doing the research and students do not have to be brought for one day to a research institute 20 or 30 miles away to see what is happening.  Students in Warrenstown who are interested in tillage have to be brought 60 or 70 miles down to Oak Park in Carlow to see what is happening or else they have to be brought to Grange which is a shorter distance.  In Greenmount the research is taking place on their doorstep, and that is a direct benefit of the integration of research advice and education in one campus under one authority.  There is no doubt that Greenmount College is an outstanding educational college as well as an outstanding agricultural research institute.</P>
    <P>An agricultural development worker's sense of achievement in work can be best achieved in an integrated service where he has freedom of movement and access to specialised knowledge in different areas.  Apart from that, the larger a service the greater is the opportunity for promotion.  Agricultural graduates want promotional opportunities.  If in the course of his work an agricultural adviser proves that he has developed a certain ability in a certain area, it is possible in an integrated service for him to be <Col N="1315" /> promoted to work in that area in a research institute or as a specialist adviser for a number of counties attached to a research institute, but if the service is divided the promotional possibilities diminish.  A man would have to practically abandon his career as an adviser and apply to enter the agricultural institute under the provisions of the proposed Bill.  That is not a good situation. If the service were undivided it would be possible for a researcher who developed a special competence in the course of his work in educating the public about the relevance of his research to move much more readily to become a county agricultural officer or an officer holding a position of responsibility in a geographical area.  There is no doubt that any research institute needs not just researchers but promulgators.</P>
    <P>Research must be development-orientated; it must be active and outgoing. This Bill will ensure that research runs the risk of becoming inward looking because of the deliberate political intervention by the Minister to divide the research from the educational and advisory services.  Those involved will want to know what lies behind this.  If the Minister believed in an integrated service he would not have gone to the bother of wasting two years during which development could have been taking place in order to introduce a Bill which will divide research from the agricultural advice and education services.  The Minister's action in introducing this Bill to delay development for two years expresses more eloquently than any speech his intention to divide the service.  I have no doubt that at every opportunity the Minister will wax eloquent about the need for research to reflect the needs of advisers and farmers in the field.  The Minister will speak with apparent wisdom but people will draw the conclusion that it is a case of the Minister saying: &ldquo;Do as I say but not as I do.&rdquo;  The Minister has removed research from under the same umbrella as advice and education and whatever protestations the Minister may make and whatever arrangement he may make to move <Col N="1316" /> members from one council to another at the top the reality is that where it really matters, at grassroots level, the Minister divided research from education and advice. That will be perceived to be the philosophy of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The National Agricultural Authority set up by Deputy Mark Clinton provided a challenge and opportunity to those working in the present Agricultural Institute which gave them far greater scope for development, for fulfilling their role in society than has ever been possible before and that challenge and opportunity is now, for political reasons, being withdrawn. They, as much as anyone else, will realise eventually that that political decision was not in their interest, any more than it was in the interest of the agricultural industry.  There have been so many statements by various people in authority as to the need for greater co-ordination and unification of our agricultural services that it is hardly necessary for me to quote from any document in support of that thesis, a thesis that is accepted in theory by everybody concerned but which in practice appears not to be accepted by the Minister.  However, I shall quote one passage from the latest document produced on this subject.  This is the NESC report, <i>Policies to Accelerate Agricultural Development</i>, paragraph 3.2.  The council are dealing with the institutional framework, the inadequacies of which have contributed to our failure to achieve the full development which I identified earlier when I quoted figures from this report.  They are identifying what they believe to be the major blocks in the institutional field in respect of the achievement of this growth.  They say:</P>
    <P>The development of agriculture is now the responsibility of a wide range of people and institutions.  These include the farmers, the Department of Agriculture, the County Committees of Agriculture, An Foras Talúntais, the food processing industries, and the food marketing bodies.  Each of these agencies is doing a competent job, yet the aggregate effect of their efforts on agricultural development as outlined in Chapter 1 is not satisfactory.  In <Col N="1317" /> reviewing the situation, one is struck by the lack of overall direction and co-ordination of their efforts....</P>
    <P>It is precisely to provide what the NESC have identified as the major institutional weakness in Irish agriculture&mdash;that lack of over-all direction and coordination&mdash;that the National Agricultural Authority was set up by the Minister's predecessor.  Let it be noted that Deputy Clinton set up an agricultural authority that could take decisions.  He did not set up what is described disingenuously by the Minister as a council.  I do not know whether in legal terms there is any significant difference between the present Minister's council and the authority as set up by his predecessor but it is clear that their choice of words indicates a mental conception on the part of each as to the role these bodies will fulfil.  Deputy Clinton foresaw the body he was setting up as an authority that would go out and make decisions in respect of development and co-ordination while the present Minister sees this body as a council that will come together.  But what function have councils, anyway?  We know that the very essence of a council is a forum where people talk.  The question is whether we need a council or an authority.  I say what we need is an authority to provide over-all co-ordination and direction of the efforts of the institutes of agriculture.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has in mind is only part of a series of councils that he intends producing.  The manifesto promised a plethora of co-ordinating boards.  It would not be in order for me to go into the details of the manifesto except to say that the only interest the Minister seems to have is in setting up bodies and tricking about with existing bodies, separating them and putting them together again when he should be interested in the co-ordination, the growth and development of our agricultural industry.  The Government's contribution in this regard has not been an improvement of the farm but an alleged improvement for those engaged in the various activities in the institutions concerned.</P>
    <P>Is there any provision in this Bill for <Col N="1318" /> the co-ordinated planning of research, education and advice?  The only change I see is that two members of one council can also be members of another council, that they would be interchangeable.  In other words, that A and B may be transferred from the Agricultural Institute to the new AnCOT while X and Y can be transferred from AnCOT to the Agricultural Institute.  That sort of provision will not achieve co-ordination. Let us be honest and admit that the type of co-ordination required is not co-ordination at the level of a council which may meet once a month, whose members are all part-time and have other jobs to do.  The idea that putting two people on a board of 15 will achieve the kind of co-ordination that is required in terms of research and advice is an idea that could only come from an Alice-in-Wonderland  situation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain what is meant by the change in the wording from authority to council.  Also, if one is to judge from the Minister's constant references to the subject, there is a change from the use of the term &ldquo;education&rdquo; to the use of the term &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  Is it for this change of wording that we have waited two years? What is meant by it?  I suggest that the change means very little because we are told by the Minister that training could involve educational services also.  Does the change mean that certain educational activities being carried out now by the advisory services or by the agricultural colleges, will be restricted because they are not unduly educational and do not have a sufficient training bias?  Is the Minister contemplating the vetoing of certain activities being undertaken by the agricultural advisory service and by the agricultural colleges? The Minister should give a clear explanation of the reason for the change.  I see it merely as an exercise in semantics. If I am right or if the change is merely an exercise in literary point-scoring on the part of the Minister, he should explain why he is detaining the House on a matter of such insignificance.</P>
    <P>It is worth quoting in full section 22 of the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Act, 1977, which the Minister has seen fit to <Col N="1319" /> remove in its entirety in this Bill.  I will quote it into the record so that the people can see what exactly he has in mind:</P>
    <P>(1)  Subject to subsection (2), the Authority may charge, receive and recover fees for agricultural research or basic veterinary research undertaken on behalf of any person, firm, institution or agency and for services, courses, seminars, lectures and demonstrations provided or organised by it.</P>
    <P>(2)  No fee may, however, be charged in respect of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any advice that may be given by the Authority in response to a request from the Minister under section 21, or</P>
    <P>and this is the important part</P>
    <P>(b)  any facilities, assistance or courses of instruction that may be provided by the Authority under section 14 or 16 (b),</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister sought to remove section 22 (2)?  Why has he sought to confer on his council something that the previous authority did not have the power to do, namely, to charge fees for facilities, courses and any assistance that might be given?  Does the Minister envisage that, if a man phones his agricultural adviser and asks for advice, the adviser will say he cannot talk unless the individual is prepared to pay 50p for talking to him for 20 minutes?  If people attend a 100-hour course under Directive 161, where the participants are paid to attend to compensate them for the loss of time on their home farms, does the Minister envisage that they will be charged for attending?  Is that what he has in mind?  If not, why did he bother waiting two years, inhibiting development that could have taken place under the National Agricultural Authority, to introduce this legislation and remove section 22 and the guarantees it gave that fees would not be charged?</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister of what he said when he was in Opposition. On 23 March 1977, as Opposition spokesman for agriculture, the present Minister said at column 204, Volume 298:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> I would like the Minister's assurance that this is not a provision under which, possibly at some later stage, the advisory services will become a fee-charging institution and that farmers availing of them may not under this section at any time in the future be required to pay a fee to the Minister or to the authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister of the day gave him that assurance.  The present Minister, as if to underline his conviction, said at column 205 of the same Volume:</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister's assurance about the aspect he has just mentioned.  I want an assurance from him that at no time in the future will the ordinary farmer availing of the advisory service or participating in the modernisation scheme be charged for the services of the authority.</P>
    <P>Having sought those assurances on 23 March 1977, he now comes here with a Bill one of the chief purposes of which is to do the opposite&mdash;to enable fees to be charged.  Was this forced on him by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, who has in his Green Paper that fees will be charged for certain advisory services?  If so, the provisions of the Bill would have been narrowly drafted to confine the possibility of charging fees to the commercial farmers.  But no, that is not in the Bill. The Minister is removing the section holus bolus.  He is removing the provision that fees may not be charged for any facility, assistance or courses of instruction that may be provided by the authority.  There is no provision that only commercial farmers will have to pay such fees.  Under this Bill any farmer will be charged, even those in the 15 to 30 acre category, who have not achieved the increased production and increased income of their more prosperous colleagues. They may all be charged fees under this Bill, notwithstanding the Minister's eloquent seeking for an assurance, on 23 March 1977, that no such fees could be charged.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition one of the matters which was of great concern to Fianna Fáil was the position of members of the county committees of <Col N="1321" /> agriculture.  Fianna Fáil have, as I have, considerable respect for those members because they have stood the heat of the political day, got elected, faced the people and got their support.  That is why they are on those committees.  Whether they be farmers or otherwise, they have a valuable contribution to make in terms of responsibility to the public for the way our policies are carried out.  I have the utmost respect for these men.  In 1977 the then Opposition also had respect for them because they sought to increase the number of representatives from agriculture on the board of the National Agricultural Authority from at least one to at least four.  That amendment has not been reintroduced in this Bill.  That makes me doubt the sincerity of the conviction with which it was moved on that occasion by the then Opposition, who are now in a position to change the law if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I believe that the priority in agriculture is not pure research, it is not segmentation, it is not the achievement of professionalism in a narrow sense for groups of workers, for the raising of their individual standards in their narrow terms of reference; but it is to translate the work of research and of the best talents in the advisory services into action on our farms.  I believe that the National Agricultural Authority, set up by the previous Minister and abolished by this Bill, provided the instrument that could have translated the enormous talent that exists in the Agricultural Institute into action and so increase production on our farms.  It is not good enough to have brilliant men doing great work in the Agricultural Institute unless that work, first, reflects the needs of our farmers and, second, is translated into action on the farms.  If the National Agricultural Authority had been let go ahead they would have done this and achieved this marrying of research with practice.  By upturning the National Agricultural Authority, by withdrawing the Agricultural Institute from the ambit of a central authority with a central goal, the Minister is turning back the clock in agricultural development.  I do not know his motives&mdash;I shall not go into them&mdash;&mdash; but most assuredly he is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>What is important to me, my party and to the country as a whole in regard to this Bill is that the farmers, advisers, institute people and research people know exactly where they are going in the shortest possible time.  Some confusion has been created in the past couple of years because the Minister guaranteed that he would change certain provisions of the previous Bill and introduce a new Bill.  I am glad that at last he has done that.  At least it will clear the air for people engaged in the advisory service, farmers and others interested in agriculture and those engaged in research.</P>
      <P>I have a few criticisms to make of the Bill where I believe progress is not being made and in respect of which I believe the previous Bill was somewhat better.  I do not want to hedge about anything but I have sympathy with the argument which maintains that the research people should constitute an autonomous body. I have considered the various arguments for and against in considerable detail and I do not really disagree with the Minister on that point.  The very Title of the Bill starts a process which runs through it, that of the training <i>versus</i> education.  As I see the functions of the advisory service, they are more educational rather than training in nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that training includes education.  I think they are two different things.  The advisory service has always been considered to be people who educated farmers and others for their own benefit, for greater production in agriculture, and they have done a very good job in this respect.  In my opinion it would appear that this council may be suspected of providing to groups of farmers the kind of training which is similar to what AnCO is providing for industry.  While I agree that AnCO have provided a great service to industry in many ways&mdash;and I presume they could not be considered to be an educational authority&mdash;what is necessary for the farming community is vastly different and will be provided in a very different field.  An adviser will deal personally with individuals and not with groups, as do AnCO.  AnCO provide training for a new industry, retraining where an industry <Col N="1323" /> closes down, but all this is for groups of people.  The important thing about the agricultural advisory service is that they deal individually with farmers, small and large, and for that reason their services are more educational in nature.</P>
    <P>May I give a typical example?  Let us suppose an adviser goes out to a small farmer who is in, shall we say, the milk business.  Perhaps that farmer cannot see that he should increase his herd.  Perhaps he should construct a milking parlour and increase his output, but he must first be educated&mdash;not trained how to do it; that is quite simple if one can convince him and educate him&mdash;into seeing that he should do it.  Education is the vital word as far as the advisory service is concerned.  Their function cannot be compared with that of AnCO.  Therefore to use the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; throughout this Bill constitutes a retrograde step which should be reconsidered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There was in the previous Bill a guarantee that at least the <i>status quo</i> would be maintained as far as the advisory service is concerned.  I agree that that was insufficient.  However that did exist and is now being removed.  The Minister has said it was a restriction, and in that I agree with him.  However, it guaranteed that at least the same provisions would obtain in real money terms for the agricultural advisory service as had obtained in preceding years.  It was a minimum guarantee.  Now that is removed and there is no guarantee at all. This may be interpreted in some areas as meaning that the Minister may be considering reducing in real terms the amount being provided for advisers in the advisory service.  I agree with the Minister that what is necessary in this area is real expansion.  He maintains that the section he removed altogether from this Bill was too restrictive.  If that be so it should have been replaced by a section in this Bill giving greater scope for expansion.</P>
    <P>There are fears also that the Minister may be thinking of co-operatives or somebody else providing the kind of service&mdash;and they are beginning to do it in certain areas&mdash;that the advisory service of the county committee of agriculture <Col N="1324" /> provided to date.  If not for the Minister that may be a way out in the future for someone else.  Reducing the amount might be a way out and there is nothing in the Bill to guarantee that it will not be reduced.  That is a retrograde step and something we should consider before Committee Stage.  We should have some guarantee that there will not be a reduction in the numbers or in the amount provided for the advisory service.  There is then the question of the composition of the board.  I have certain views on this, views with which neither the main spokesman for Fine Gael nor the Minister might agree, but I believe that on this board the least that could be expected by the workers employed by the board is the same terms as those provided in the case of worker participation in State industries.  If there is not that kind of representation this Bill will represent not an improvement but a backward step.</P>
    <P>I believe farmers should be represented. I believe agricultural workers, a very important section in rural Ireland, should be represented, either directly or through the medium of some organisation. Representation by the agricultural committees is somewhat limited.  Different areas should have representation because there are different farming methods in different areas.  The least those concerned can expect is the standard laid down in regard to worker participation in State enterprises.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has agreed to withdraw section 12.  If he did not do so I should have had a great deal to say on the section.  It is important that those engaged in the advisory services and on research should know exactly the terms of their employment and what they will be expected to do.  The farmers will want to know what kind of direction the services will take.  They must know that quickly.  We must not make a political football out of this Bill.  A political football was made out of the earlier Bill and the Minister must take some of the responsibility for that.  I do not disagree with the principal reason for the Minister bringing in this Bill.  I am inclined to accept that the Agricultural Institute should be a separate, autonomous body. <Col N="1325" /> It was a pity agreement could not be reached on the last Bill.</P>

It is vitally important that we should go ahead now. I shall have amendments for Committee Stage, amendments designed to improve the Bill, not just to upset the Minister or anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The previous Bill had two main objectives, to unify the advisory and educational services and secondly, to amalgamate those services with the research institute, An Foras Talúntais.  Everybody is agreed the advisory services needed reorganisation. Over the past 20 years there have been many reports on the subject.  With regard to the research service, it is accepted nationally and internationally that An Foras Talúntais, since its establishment in 1958, has done an outstanding job for agriculture.  To listen to a previous speaker one would think An Foras Talúntais had been totally negative and had made no real impact on farming.</P>
      <P>Take the agricultural exports over the last decade.  In 1967 agricultural exports were valued at £156 million.  In 1977 they were valued at £975 million. Despite the glossy prognostications on the part of some, Irish agriculture has made very considerable progress and the institute, as an autonomous body, has certainly contributed to that progress. Increased production has not been confined to the larger farms.  A study of the farm management survey results show that a big contribution to increased productivity came from the smaller farms because of more intensive farming methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the institute will be allowed to retain its autonomy.  I believe that the linking up of the advisory <Col N="1326" /> service with the institute would put undue emphasis on production research.  Undoubtedly we can increase our production, but the real bottleneck is in the area of processing and marketing. A direct link up of the advisory service would certainly have the effect of laying priority emphasis on production research. It is a much more difficult thing to process additional agricultural produce into products which will be remunerative on world markets.  That is what we must do.  The institute in an independent environment can place more emphasis on research and development in the processing and marketing areas and will not be confined unduly to increasing production, through which we could find ourselves with mountains of various produce which we would have to put into intervention.  We must be able to process and manufacture various agricultural commodities to suit the marketplace.  That is one of the reasons why the institute has flourished since 1958 and I welcome the guarantee of independence contained in this Bill.  The previous Bill was rushed through the House and did not take into account the tremendous contribution which the institute had made.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on his proposal to create a unified advisory and education service.  The handicaps of the present county system have been recognised and the coupling of the advisory and education services will be of great benefit.  The major constraint on improving agricultural production and remuneration for the farming community is the lack of education and the lack of an intensive advisory service.  We are at a disadvantage in this area when compared with our competitors in Europe and the rest of the world.  We have roughly 12 million acres of arable land which is valued at between £2,000 and £3,000 an acre, though in some cases it is even more.  This means that the value of that natural resource is in the region of £30 billion.  This resource can be improved as it contributes to production, unlike some other natural resources to which people look to save the economy, such as oil and mineral deposits which are wasting deposits.</P>
    <P>Agriculture must be utilised for the <Col N="1327" /> benefit of the people as a whole.  At present, 23 per cent of our population work directly in farming.  This is a higher percentage than that in any other EEC country and it has led some economists to believe that we will inevitably have a continous drift from the land.  In fact, we have only half as many people employed per 100 acres as they have in Holland.  I do not accept the defeatist view that we must have a continuing drift from the land.  With modern technology and intensive production techniques, people owning relatively small farms will be able to provide themselves with an income comparable to any they would make in industry.</P>
    <P>One of the limiting factors in the effort to increase production and increase the income of farmers has been the level of advice and education available to those engaged in agriculture, especially when compared with that available in other countries.  Our output from pasture, which is the main area of production, has been only half that of Holland and Denmark, despite our climatic advantages. It will not be good enough for people to say in the future that we have a great advantage over our competitors because of our climatic conditions.  A tremendous input of advice and education is necessary to make the most of these advantages and to achieve our full potential in terms of output of grass, which is our main commodity output. The output in Holland is about 200 per cent higher than it is here.  In 1973 agricultural exports from this country were valued at £400 million, whereas exports from Holland were worth £3,000 million, despite the fact that they must feed a population of 13 million and our population is in the area of three million.</P>
    <P>There is room for further advancement and development of this resource. Some commentators feel we should be doing much better.  I believe we are doing very well in comparison with most other agricultural economies.  It is unfair to compare the rate of growth in an agricultural economy with that in an industrial economy, as has been done by some of those making gloomy forecasts with regard to our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The General Council of Committees <Col N="1328" /> of Agriculture reported during the past 12 months that 84 per cent of farmers have only primary education and less than 2 per cent have attended an agricultural college.  Farming today is a highly technical enterprise, whether concerned with dairying or pig production. It has the kind of technology that is required at farm level where we have farm projects to make, within hours, from the basic raw material a sophisticated product.  It is a big handicap that such a large percentage, 84 per cent, of the people in agriculture have only primary education; less than 2 per cent have the benefit of an agricultural education in one of our agricultural colleges.  For this reason I welcome this Bill as providing a unified and co-ordinated agricultural advisory service so that we can provide a decent level of education for the people who are working this £30 billion worth of resources initially before they enter farming and then they will be able to get the best possible advice from a unified advisory service to follow through.</P>
    <P>In addition to the handicap of having so few people with an agricultural education, the number of advisors per farmer here is only about half the intensity it is in countries with which we are directly competing.  For instance, in Holland and Denmark where we are fighting to gain markets, they have twice as many advisors per farm as we have here.  The addition of several hundred more advisors would not in itself be the answer to our problems but the results of various surveys indicate that a more intensive advisory service does in fact produce results.  We had the pilot area schemes, the small farm incentive bonus schemes, where production was increased dramatically as a result of more intensive advice.  More recently we had the World Bank loan where a group of farmers were given intensive advisory services.  In a difficult time, 1973 and 1974, when other sectors of agriculture were losing money and their incomes going down, the group of farmers involved in the World Bank project actually increased their livestock by 47 per cent and increased their income by over 300 per cent.  That indicates that with the addition of more intensive advisory services we can produce infinitely more <Col N="1329" /> from this resource which we have, namely, the land.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill becomes a legal document I would like An Chomhairle to advise the Minister in regard to section 12. An Chomhairle should also advise the Minister in regard to an overall programme and development plan for agriculture.  I see no reason why we should not have a detailed plan or programme, say, for five years, for the development of the most important sector of our economy.  When An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta is set up they should advise the Minister not only on agricultural training but they should also be able to draw up a development plan for agriculture.  I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the last speaker I cannot say that I welcome this Bill because the Minister intends to detach a very important branch of the farm support services, by detaching the institute from the combined educational and advisory services which the former Minister, Deputy Clinton, in his Bill brought together under the one umbrella. The present Minister is now removing from that structure a very important support of that umbrella leaving the whole structure incomplete and unstable. Having had experience of pilot areas where the combined forces worked together and having seen the results, the increased production in those areas, I am convinced that there would be a far greater production in the pilot areas had on-the-ground support been given by members of the institute.  There are areas in Clare, which is an intensive dairying area, where in the past year a 14 per cent increase was shown in milk production because of the cumulative effects of advice given over a long period.  The results would have been even more marked if we had had a direct line of communication and consultations with members of the institute in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not convinced me nor has he given any valid or convincing reason why the institute should now be detached from the combined agricultural and advisory services known under the <Col N="1330" /> previous Bill as the National Agricultural Authority.  He has given as one of his reasons that the environment within which the members of the institute would work might, in some vague way, impede progress.  In what better area could a person work than with the people who have experience in the advisory services and in the educational services?  Would the institute people not be better qualified and have a broader vision as a result of constant contact with the men on the ground?  The absence of the institute could be likened to an army out of contact with its intelligence corps or its transport corps.  One cannot have an effective agreement if one of its main supports has been taken from it.  Why has the Minister ignored, over the past number of years, the unified approach which we got from the farming organisations?  They were very vocal over a period of 14 or 15 years in advocating this combined unit of our agricultural service.</P>
    <P>I am very familiar with the approach of Macra na Feirme, in particular, but the other organisations were also vocal. I have not heard their voices raised. Perhaps they are influenced by the fact that the Minister intends to give a good representation to rural organisations. We welcome this but surely if we advocate something for a number of years the Minister should consider the combined opinions of united groups.  I suppose it is too late to ask the Minister to allow a closer liaison between the institute and those organisations.  If somebody is isolated from his friends and communications are broken down the desired results cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>I was present, along with other Members of the Dáil and Seanad at the meeting with the Clare County Committee of Agriculture, who clearly expressed their opposition to the proposed Bill. They hoped the Minister would introduce amendments which would make the Bill acceptable to them.  They were all practical farmers and members of the Minister's party.  This meeting was held a few months ago.  They were not satisfied that as members of the committee of agriculture they were getting adequate representation on the board of AnCOT.  They would like to see that <Col N="1331" /> representation increased.  Those people were elected to public life and they would like the opportunity to express their ideas fully as practical farmers. They were disappointed that the Minister only intended to have one representative of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture on this board.  There are 27 such committees in the country.  The Minister should review this section and allow a more reasonable representation from such a very responsible body as the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Permanent appointments have been made by the Appointments Commission but county committees of agriculture had power to appoint temporary staff. Under this Bill they will not be free to appoint temporary staff.  When there is remote control, as there will be when this Bill becomes law, undue delays are likely to happen and eventually areas dependent on the appointment of additional instructors and their services will be without them.  There is a fear that the new board may be like a health board but may be even more remote and central administration would mean a lessening of the authority of public representatives.  Although this may not be the case people fear it is likely to happen. People who work with committees of agriculture, instructors and others, are naturally concerned about their future. When they were appointed permanently to particular counties they became familiar with the people and the particular climatic conditions which affect those areas and over the years they have established themselves very firmly with the farming community.  Those people can now be uprooted under this Bill and can be moved at short notice to any county.  The strong relationship built up over the years between the advisory services and farmers throughout the country will be broken.</P>
    <P>With regard to the composition of the board, the Minister should consider that a board works more effectively if it embraces all the many varied interests which it is supposed to cater for.  We have a very important force in our agricultural life, which has now been depleted&mdash;the agricultural worker.  It <Col N="1332" /> was always considered wise to have agricultural workers on wages boards. Why can we not include agricultural worker representation on this board?  If they are on State-sponsored bodies, and it is recognised that they make valuable contributions there, why can they not be included on this proposed board?  There are many deprived areas west of the Shannon.  All the counties from west Cork up the coast through Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal have a very high percentage of small farmers. In Clare 70 per cent of small farmers have a valuation of under £20.  Would the Minister consider appointing a representative of small farmers on this new body?  Such a person could contribute a lot because of his experience of living on a small farm and providing for his family.  Because of congestion such people have had to operate without any hope of enlarging their holdings.  Most of them have worked hard so that they could live well and have high production.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take note of the fact that in the west there has been a drop in production in recent years.  I part of the country to bring about the necessary changes.  There is scope there for improvement and we should treat the development of farming in the west as a priority.  It is a problem that should be tackled immediately.  It is disappointing that the Minister has decided to detach the institute from the educational and advisory service.  I do not agree with his thinking in this regard and I must make known my views and those of the county committee of agriculture of which I am a member.  I leave the rest to the Minister's common sense to make the best job possible of the new board.  As a practical farmer I would be disappointed if all farmers did not benefit from this.  I hope the Minister will see a way of improving the lot of those people who have a very uncertain life while living on the land. They are subject to varying prices, uncertain climatic conditions and dependent on an uncertain market.  I hope the Minister will bring to agriculture, the main prop in our economy, a better prospect for a stable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity <Col N="1333" /> to comment on this Bill, one of the most important pieces of legislation to be introduced in this session.  We all realise the importance of agriculture in the economy.  The publicity given to the Bill to date is an indication that Irish people are aware of the importance of agriculture.  We have heard that we have 12 million acres of arable land.  From that we can see that land is our greatest natural resource.  As such it must be cared for in such a way that our farmers can increase productivity.  We have been told it is inevitable that the number of people engaged in agriculture will decrease annually.  I do not accept that because it is my belief that agriculture has not reached its full potential.  In recent years new opportunities have been created for farmers with the result that young farmers have a bright future, but they must be assisted in every way possible.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the amount of aid that is given to those who create industrial employment, but at the same time we must never forget that agriculture should be given priority treatment.  We should provide for more research and the appointment of more skilled staff to assist those anxious to remain on the land.  We have been told that the role of the small farmer is becoming more insignificant daily, but I do not accept that.  Small farmers are the backbone of our society.  The day has gone when farmers would say: &ldquo;I am going to send Johnny to college, Joe to school, Mary to the convent and keep Mickeen at home.&rdquo;  The Mickeen kept at home is now an ambitious young man who is determined to play his part in agricultural production.  For that reason we must ensure that this piece of legislation is debated calmly and that we hasten slowly in our deliberations.  The greatest fault with regard to the Bill introduced by the Minister's predecessor was that everything was done in haste. In fact, after the decision of the people in June 1977, a frantic effort was made to appoint the board before the new Government took over.  That was a bad decision and one which was detrimental to the progress of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a more <Col N="1334" /> liberal type of Bill, one which is more acceptable because research and education are important to those engaged in agriculture.  The Bill endeavours to provide the greatest amount of research and education possible.  In order to provide research and education the organisations involved must have a measure of independence.  They must be free from civil service control.  When we talk about civil service control we are talking about people who have been removed from the agricultural scene for many years or may not have been involved in agriculture at all.  We must ensure that any body set up to provide a better service for farmers has a greater degree of independence.</P>
    <P>We must always remember that the biggest percentage of our work force is engaged in agriculture.  I understand that 24 per cent of our total population still get their living from agriculture.  Because of that we should not take any short cuts when carrying out research.  Research is important because of the great changes that are taking place in agriculture.  In recent years science has come to the aid of agriculture in a big way and we must ensure that all available aids are made known to the farmers so that we can have maximum production.  Much of our land has not reached maximum production and those engaged in farming will not be in a position to achieve that unless they fully avail of the research and education facilities.</P>
    <P>I compliment the people in Foras Talúntais for the good work they have done over the years in research and education.  Their work has benefited agriculture and the country generally.  If we fail to recognise the significance of the farmer we will lose out on our greatest national resource.  Agricultural products are not imported but are manufactured and processed here.  Every effort should be made to ensure that all agricultural produce is processed before exportation.  When we export cattle, sheep or pigs on the hoof we lose out in relation to production and job creation. We must have access to organised marketing as we produce more and more of the finished product, and this new body will play a leading role here in advising farmers from year to year of the <Col N="1335" /> markets abroad.  Intervention is only a temporary measure and is not the answer to our problems.  We must know of the markets available and we must be able to compete with other agricultural communities.  That signifies the importance of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the role of the county committees of agriculture is covered in this Bill and that the Minister realises the importance of that role in society.  It is only natural to expect that organisations like Macra na Feirme, the Irish Farmers Association, Macra na Tuaithe, the ICA and all the other organisations involved in agriculture should be represented on this committee.  The people involved in these organisations know the problems. They may not know the answers but they will avail of the educational facilities which will become available to them.  It is good that the future of the county committees of agriculture is guaranteed in this Bill, because if local democracy is removed an important element in the industry is gone.  Many people say that these committees are just talking shops, but they have played an important role in the promotion of agriculture.  The farming community will contribute the bulk of local rates, so local representation is very important. By guaranteeing the future of the committees of agriculture the Government are removing an element of worry that all control would be at departmental level.  There must be an amalgamation of the resources of the county committees of agriculture, the advisory services and the Department, bearing in mind that the Minister is responsible for the activities of his Department.</P>
    <P>By and large agriculture has made great strides in recent years, mainly because of our access to new and improved markets in Europe.  The agricultural community must be allowed to contribute to national development. They are prepared to do that and are becoming educated to do so.  This Bill will make research facilities available to them to help them.  This is excellent legislation.  Because of the importance of agriculture to our economy I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will get a speedy passage through the House and that the <Col N="1336" /> debate will be conducted in a manner conducive to the best interests of the agricultural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the well-known conventional wisdom and orthodoxy in relation to agriculture whereby it is advanced that the development of agricultural research must be divorced from the day to day advisory educational and training services of the industry.  I do not share that view either in relation to manufacturing industry. Regrettably, this Bill, in its initial passage when it was first introduced by Deputy Clinton and now further amended by the Minister for Agriculture, has become a matter of party politics and in a sense a matter of civil service politics.  I speak as an outsider looking in trying to see how we should develop a more coherent structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were in Government we lost the opportunity of making a very simple transition.  We should have given a shot in the arm to An Foras Talúntais by devolving on them the dual responsibility of the research and the advisory and training services of the Department. I had some difficulty in explaining this view to the many representatives I received on a trade union and on a Labour Party basis when we were part of the Government and in explaining this to the representatives of an Foras Talúntais. If agricultural research is to advance in an integrated and effective way, it must have a very positive link with the advisory and training services.  For that reason I felt that a simpler approach could have been adopted by extending the statutes governing An Foras Talúntais, by devolving on them from the Department of Agriculture the responsibility for advisory and training services and by putting the staff involved under the aegis of An Foras Talúntais.  I must confess that at the time I found little support for my view.  But the more I study the situation, the Minister's Bill and his Second Stage contribution, the more I am convinced of the real merit of the approach I adopted.  When the National Agricultural Advisory, Educational and Research Authority were proposed, considerable fears were expressed but this <Col N="1337" /> was understandable.  There was a degree of appreciation as to how these fears evolved.  There was much distrust in the Department, unfair distrust in some areas.  There was the old hierarchial attitude that An Foras Talúntais would be emasculated by a departmental contrivance and that they would emerge as a big bureaucratic structure, their independent budget for research crucified and their being staffed by the Department of the Public Service.  It was alleged at the time that this was the big new planning effort of the mandarins at senior level in the Department to deal with An Foras Talúntais as they would wish in terms of budget, of policy and of control.  At that time I did not share their view but I appreciated their fears and I considered that it would have been much simpler for the then Minister for Agriculture to have told An Foras Talúntais that they were doing magnificent work, that for the past 20 years they had made an enormous contribution in the field of research.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the reports produced from 1967 onwards, right up to the Devlin Report which, incidentally, I do not regard as being gospel here, we should have expanded the role of An Foras Talúntais and given them responsibility for training, education and advisory services.  Now we are landed with a two-tier situation which will make very little real contribution to the progressive development of the agricultural industry. This two-tier system will solve nothing in the long term.  Perhaps for the next decade we will be stuck with what we are setting up here today.  Having regard to the controversial nature both of this debate and of the debate on the previous legislation, no politician will be likely to touch on this area for at least another ten years.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes a two-tier structure of research and training, a structure that is not integrated or coordinated in any way.  All we are getting is a kind of bureaucratic attempt at cross-fertilisation between the board of AnCO and the council of An Foras Talúntais.  This kind of cross-fertilisation between the two boards is typically Irish. <Col N="1338" /> Whenever we find ourselves in trouble in developing structures we have an amazing capacity to wriggle our way out by crossing the blood lines and hoping to get a decent horse out of the situation. This is the attitude in a small country in which there is a unified agricultural industry. I do not agree with a two-tier system.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to my original proposal which, regrettably, the then Minister for Agriculture was not prepared to accept.  It was the expansion of the development of An Foras Talúntais down along the line through the grassroots to the farm whereby the people involved in research would go to the farms and work closely with the instructors and the advisers and work in the field offices in their research and advisory capacities while engaging in training simultaneously.  That is what I regard as real work and real development in terms of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I may be asked what would happen to the county committees of agriculture if the advisory service is to be brought under the aegis of An Foras Talúntais. There is no reason why the county committees of agriculture should not have continued in existence but I would see their offices as being the field offices of An Foras Talúntais.  Their role essentially at that stage would be advisory to the council of An Foras Talúntais and advisory on a consultative basis at local level to such organisations as the IFA, Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe and so on.  They would be in an advisory capacity, too, to the local authorities. That would have been a sane and reasonable approach but I would go further and say that in the initial stages of the preparation of the first Bill, if the staffs of the advisory services had been brought in and told that, with full preservation of superannuation and a full transition of their conditions of employment being safeguarded, they were being transferred to An Foras Talúntais, they might well have accepted the deal. Simultaneously, the council of An Foras Talúntais could have been expanded. However, there were a number of obstacles in that direction, the principal one being a probable policy reluctance, structural reluctance and administrative <Col N="1339" /> reluctance on the part of the Department to see emerging a further flourishing of An Foras that would give them more control, not only policy control but also administrative control.  Such a situation might not have been welcomed by some of the secret policy advisers of the Department.</P>
    <P>After ten years in this House I am tired of the way in which politicians, county councillors and others have a go at the public service.  When we make a mess of something we invariably slag the civil servants because they are the last people who may reply.  I say that with great deference to our public servants because their motives can be impugned and they have no opportunity of reply.  I believe that while the Department should be involved deeply in policy formation, they should not be involved in the administration of advisory and training services and of education.</P>
    <P>My reaction to this Bill is that once again it perpetuates the two-tier system which is not to the advantage of our farmers.  When we had private meetings with the Minister to discuss the original Bill, I strongly held the view that I would like to see the stature of An Foras Talúntais increased into the area of advisory, training and educational services, the board expanded and a transfer taking place on that basis.  That would have been eminently more feasible than what we have now.  This means we are back to the two-tier system.  Part of the reluctance of the Minister to give more power to the board of An Foras is the old story that, as the Minister who pays two-thirds of the budget of the two councils concerned, he wants to retain control over the use of these funds.  I still think An Foras could have been effectively maintained and developed.</P>
    <P>These are my views on this legislation and they are strengthened when one realises that the Bill proposes to assign to An Foras additional functions in relation to basic veterinary research and to transfer responsibility in relation to serious research, hitherto the preserves of the Department.  When preliminary discussions were taking place, in my view, the consultation on the problems of the staff involved was cursory and <Col N="1340" /> was not in sufficient depth to bring about the kind of structure I would have favoured at that stage.</P>
    <P>I view with considerable concern the perpetuation of the two-tier system because in the long term it is not to the advantage of the farming community or of the development of a progressive agricultural industry, and in the years ahead we will regret not having brought forward what I would call proper integration, proper co-ordination and a proper structure which would have ended the excessive dilution of national work between the Department, An Foras, representative organisations and the new council envisaged in this Bill. For these reasons I regret the position that developed.  It need not have developed if there had been more widespread consultations with the interested bodies and staffs concerned.  It need not have developed if the Minister had not shown such indecent and precipitate haste in trying to make cheap political capital out of the situation.</P>
    <P>I am convinced and will always remain so, that if Deputy Clinton had brought this Bill into this House, Deputy Gibbons for party political purposes would have come in with the opposite. Such is the nature of the Minister's concept of agricultural politics and of his personal detestation of everything Fine Gael stood for, that he would have, without even reading the Bill, indicated that he would have changed it, just for the sake of change.  This is a matter of regret because the Minister has an outstanding brain where agricultural work is concerned.  He is a man who has always worked at about 20 or 30 per cent of his potential in terms of his capacity to make a contribution at that level.  Unfortunately, almost everything he does is clouded by a vitriolic detestation for all legislation introduced by Fine Gael Ministers for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>When the last Bill was going through this House so great were the pressures on the then Minister, Deputy Clinton, particularly in relation to the work he undertook with such great competence in Brussels, that he did not have sufficient opportunity to consult and take a more detached view of the proposals he was making.  In my view he accepted <Col N="1341" /> hastily the structure which evolved within the Department.  Had he consulted more widely with interested parties before the publication of that Bill, he would have found that the solution I have advanced here would have been in the national interest.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I am gravely concerned about this Bill.  The fact that it is being tacitly accepted around the country as being the measure which will come into operation is an indication of people's despair of a real structure emerging.  I hope this will in some measure prove successful but I have very considerable doubts about the real impact it will have in the long run, because it leaves us with a structure for research, training and education, still diffused, disintegrated, unco-ordinated, wasteful of resources and of talent in this country, a scarcity of talent in the agricultural field, which in the long run will not be to the credit of the politicians who tried to improve the situation.  That is my interpretation of the position.</P>
    <P>I regret that I found myself being so condemnatory of the approaches adopted.  I am quite convinced that we lost a golden opportunity.  I am quite sure also that when the Minister sees this new structure in operation for, say, five or ten years, he will come around to the wisdom of having an integrated system of operation.  I am sure also that the farming organisations and the staff of the Department of Agriculture will come around to that view and will realise the error of what has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill. It was interesting to listen to the different contributions, particularly those of the Minister and of the last speaker.  I am glad the Minister of State is here to hear my contribution.  I feel I would have a better chance of putting our point of view to him and having it understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After ten years of frustration and uncertainly I regret to say that with the introduction of this Bill we are back to square one as far as reorganisation of the advisory service is concerned.  I believe we are entering an era of frustration on the whole issue of agricultural <Col N="1342" /> research and advice.  I will never understand why the present Minister for Agriculture did not allow the previous Bill be put into operation and ascertain for himself whether or not its provisions would work.  Unfortunately, instead he chose to axe it.  Therefore, we will never know whether that Bill could have been implemented to the advantage not alone of the farming community but the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I say after ten years we are back to square one; others have said after 15 years.  This is a credit to nobody.  Being a new Member of this House it was to my advantage that I did not take part in the last debate on this issue when there were, I understand, very bitter exchanges.  On that occasion some of the contributions&mdash;which I have not read&mdash;I understand were more disruptive than helpful.  Whatever Bill is implemented we must bear in mind the advantages to be gained, first, for the farming community and, secondly, for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>There seems to be only one point of real agreement, that is, the absolute need for the restructuring of both the research and advisory services.  However, there seems to be vast differences of opinion on how that should be done.  I have taken a keen interest in agricultural development and research.  I have very strong feelings on this Bill and its effects on agriculture.  I shall attempt to persuade the Minister to make the necessary changes which I believe to be fundamental to agriculture.  In my comments I shall try to avoid any aggravation or disruption of the position but rather to state the facts as I see them.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity to make a political football out of this Bill irrespective of how much we may disagree with it.  That is what happened the previous Bill.  I believe considerable damage has been done already to a lot of very good people who will be affected one way or another by this Bill.  Whether or not we like it lines are firmly drawn on one side or the other by the people who will have to work within its framework.  That is the unfortunate aspect of it.  We should endeavour not to aggravate the situation further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> The Minister said in the course of his remarks:</P>
    <P>I reject totally the inference that the people on the land belong to a primitive uneducated class who have to be taken by the hand and put on the path to progress by the more enlightened.  To my mind, the term &ldquo;training&rdquo;, which can cover certain educational aspects, is much more appropriate and includes no patronising overtones.</P>
    <P>That statement must be described as warped expression.  What is basic to agriculture at present&mdash;and I think practically everybody feels this&mdash;is education. I shall attempt to persuade the Minister to reinstate the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in this Bill.  He has removed it from practically every section and has substituted the word &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  I am more than surprised at this action of the Minister, a man with practical knowledge and experience in the field of agriculture and its administration.  Few people in this House would have the same practical knowledge of both aspects.  I can see absolutely no logic for the substitution of the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;.  It is difficult to describe the need for education in agriculture.  One of the main functions of the proposed new council should be agricultural education.  In fact the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; cannot be used often enough.  I believe the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; is completely inadequate and greatly reduces emphasis on the need for education.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with a few aspects of farming and point out what I consider are the needs for education in those areas.  Take the man in charge of a herd of cows.  The day is gone when one just said to a worker &ldquo;Take the bucket and stool and milk the cow.&rdquo;  The day is also gone of the old bucket plants costing about £1,000.  The day is with us when very expensive and sophisticated equipment is operating in regard to 90 per cent of our herds.  It is a different situation from what it was 15 years ago. The cost of the equipment is roughly £20,000.  A herd of 50 to 60 cows is valued in the region of £40,000 to <Col N="1344" /> £50,000 and we are speaking, therefore, of a man in charge of £70,000 worth of equipment and cows.  Is it the intention that such a man should be ill-equipped from the point of view of knowledge and education?</P>
    <P>The day is gone when a minimum of knowledge was necessary to operate a proper cow herd.  Knowledge and education are essential requisites and education is badly needed at the moment.  A man in charge of a herd of cows must know something about electricity, about drugs, about the use of compounds and AI.  All these things require a certain level of education.  The word &ldquo;training&rdquo; is totally inadequate.  I think&mdash;and I say this to the Parliamentary Secretary, who may be easier to reach than his Minister is on this particular issue&mdash;that the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; should be put back into every section of the Bill in which it appeared before.</P>
    <P>A man in charge of a herd of cows needs some basic training on how to preserve milk.  The quality bonus operates where liquid milk sales are concerned. It operates right across the board and a farmer can lose up to 5p a gallon if his milk does not reach the required standard.  I am not now talking about the bacteria count.  There are other ingredients in milk which must be looked after.  Education must be the keyword where good quality milk is concerned.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that I am adopting a difficult stance in trying to prove that the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; should be put back into the Bill.  Take tillage.  Our average yields are somewhere in the region of two tons to the acre.  In England the average yield is three tons to the acre and they are talking in terms of four tons to the acre.  This increase has come about as a result of research and education. We have made progress, good progress, in root crops, though not in cereals.  The beet factories have contributed in no small way to this progress because they have made the essential knowledge directly available to the farmers and that has led to improved efficiency.</P>
    <P>Pig production is an area calling for attention.  Would, I wonder, the Parliamentary Secretary or his Minister <Col N="1345" /> put an untrained or uneducated man in charge of a herd of pigs?  I certainly would not.  Such a man needs education and he also needs training.  I have absolutely no objection to the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; but substituting the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;&mdash;I heard Deputy Desmond expatiate on this&mdash;seems to me to be prompted by pettiness simply because of a certain dislike of the Minister who introduced the earlier measure.  If that is true it shows a certain smallmindedness.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Walsh, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, mentioned the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; four or five times at least.  I do not think he used the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; once.  He talked about the need for education in agriculture.  He said it was basic to agriculture.  I am delighted Deputy Walsh took this attitude and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Horticulture is a very important aspect of agriculture.  It is a very technical subject requiring a high level of education.  In this area there is tremendous scope for expansion.  Recently fresh strawberries were offered for sale on the London fruit market.  I understand this was as a result of experiment.  We are in the EEC now and we have wider scope for disposing of our produce.  Wexford is one of the best fruit growing areas in the country.  I understand the farmers in <Col N="1346" /> Wexford are not able to take contracts from British firms, contracts running for three to five years with practically guaranteed prices.  For the small farmer the production of strawberries can be very profitable provided the necessary expertise and knowledge is available and provided those who engage in the production of strawberries have the requisite basic education and training.</P>
    <P>I believe practically all lines of farming are in need of improvement through more knowledge and education being made available to farmers and others to ensure high levels of efficiency and production.  The farm worker is now a very important man.  I am glad to say that the winter farm schools now operating in most counties are taking in these men for training and education. This is absolutely essential.  A farm worker using a tractor is in charge of a machine worth between £7,000 and £12,000 and it is very much in the interest of the farmer that the farm worker has a good basic knowledge of that machine.  A combine harvester is worth about £30,000 and even a slight mistake can cost £1,000.  People need training and education in order to be effective in the use of such machines.</P>
    <P>Someone has said that the labour force on the land has been reduced.  We are at a crossroads in regard to the labour force.  Any farmer who believes he can farm with a reduced labour force is fooling himself.  If a farmer wants to be efficient his labour force must be efficient for his type of enterprise.  The day is gone when one could reduce the labour force on the land.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State to use whatever influence he has with the Minister for Agriculture to include the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in the Title of this Bill. The word &ldquo;training&rdquo; could be more appropriately applied to the work of AnCO, who train people for one line of work and may perhaps retrain them some years later for a different type of work.  One cannot compare this type of training with what is needed in agriculture.  I am prepared to accept that training is needed in agriculture, but we cannot stress often enough the need for education in agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> I believe the most important function of the new authority is the education of young farmers and this has been realised and demonstrated by all farmers.  In Wexford there were 75 applications this year for agricultural scholarships and only 25 places were available.  Four years ago we did not even have interviews for these places.  That clearly demonstrates the realisation of the parents of those who will be taking over their farms in the years to come that education is absolutely essential.  Unfortunately, some of these students who applied for scholarships to Wexford County Committee of Agriculture were unable to get places in agricultural colleges this year.  I do not know who will fill the vacuum here and I hope that this new authority will try to remedy the situation immediately.  If we have a demand for agricultural education and we have not the facilities to give that education, it must be described as a serious deficiency in our system.  I ask the Minister of State to take that into consideration and make the point to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained why he had reduced the numbers on the council from 26 to 16.  The previous Bill dealt very skimpily with the representation offered to the county committees of agriculture.  The General Council of County Committees of Agriculture, which represent 27 committees of agriculture, are being offered one place on this council.  I appeal to the Minister to make available at least three places to the General Council.  We cannot overlook the fact that the county committees of agriculture have carried on the agricultural services in a voluntary capacity down through the years.  Huge strides have been made in our agricultural development and expansion. Are we now to treat them miserably by offering them one seat on this council?  I am prepared to accept that some of the county committees did not do a good job, but that is not to say that the rest of the committees should, as a result of that, be chastised.  By and large, 90 per cent of the committees did a very good job.  We are removing those who are accountable <Col N="1348" /> to somebody in the democratic process.  The majority of the committees are made up of members of the county councils.  I would support the Minister in that the rural organisations should have a say on the council, but I cannot support him in offering only one place to the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture.  It is a miserable effort and does not recognise the great work which has been done by these committees.</P>
    <P>I expressed the same point of view to the previous Minister.  Somebody seems to be bringing pressure to bear on this point.  The Minister's own party disagree violently with him on this point.  The democratic process should not be forgotten. The members of every county council are accountable to the people.  I am asking the Minister to increase the number of members from 16 to 18, giving the two extra places to people who have worked consistently through the years in the field of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has withdrawn section 12.  When I read the Bill first I could not understand how his own Department could allow this section to be put in.  I express the view on it because there is always the danger of somebody coming back and putting in this section.  I am in agreement with accountability but the Department of Agriculture are themselves capable of the responsibility.  Of course they are. Why the Department of the Public Service was ever named is a mystery.  It is right that they should have control over conditions of employment.  Everybody has to get a guideline from someone on that point but why should the Department of the Public Service have any authority whatsoever over this new council?  Over the years it took quite a bit of effort to persuade the Department of Agriculture, particularly in the last four years, to give us a couple of extra girls to do work that was originally done by the agricultural officer.  That man should have been out in the fields. Instead he was sitting there writing letters. As far as accountability is concerned this issue should certainly be looked after by the Department of Agriculture.  I welcome the move by the Minister to remove this section because <Col N="1349" /> one always seems to get a pessimistic view from the Department of the Public Service.  It is their make-up.  They are responsible for everybody's problems. They are responsible for everybody's moneys.  But to give them any authority over this new council would be a retrograde step.  They have influence enough over the moneys allocated to agriculture without giving them the right to say whether or not this work should be done or that work should be done.  I very much welcome the Minister's step in this direction.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the Bill that I wish to refer to.  It is a very serious matter.  We are looking for the same undertaking that the present Minister for Agriculture looked for when the previous Bill was introduced; that is the question of charging fees.  This is the area in which the Department of the Public Service could have some influence. I have not read the debate on the last Bill but the Minister, Deputy Gibbons, asked Deputy Clinton for his assurance that there was no provision under which possibly at some later stage the advisory service would become a fee-charging institution and that the farmers availing of that service would at any time in the future be required to pay a fee to the Minister or to the authority.  I would make a very strong case to the Minister on this issue.  I want an absolute assurance that he has not the intention in the back of his mind to introduce this fee-charging situation because those most in need of the service will be the least able to pay for it and therefore will not be able to avail of the service.  In our present set-up under the farm organisation scheme there is a lot of paper work involved.  People have to call very often on the agricultural adviser to explain this, that or the other.  People can take up the phone and ask for information from the agricultural adviser.  Is the agricultural adviser going to tell him that it will cost him a £1?  This would be a serious development.  This provision was taken out of the last Bill.  I do not see why it should be included in this Bill.  But there is always a reason for putting it in. It can be brought in, I understand, by an amendment.  On this issue I am sure we will have proposals to delete this from <Col N="1350" /> the Bill because it would be a retrograde step to even mention charging for these services.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the issue that is responsible for this Bill being before the House.  I call on the personnel and officers of the Agricultural Institute to reassess their own position in the long term particularly in the light of the implications of this Bill.  I believe those implications will be serious for them, not next year or the year after, but in five years' time.  The Agricultural Institute have at their disposal some of the best brains in agriculture here.  They have a wealth of information and it is the job of the Minister for Agriculture to find the best system to get this wealth of information down to the farm.  This Bill will isolate that information thereby isolating the Agricultural Institute and its officers. I would also like to make the point that this Bill will build barriers between the research section and the agricultural adviser and this will have a very bad influence on agriculture in general.</P>
    <P>The function of the Agricultural Institute is research.  The time has now come when we must look at how that research is being carried out.  In a great many fields the research is far ahead of the ordinary farmer.  I have taken a personal interest in any researches being carried out in the Agricultural Institute. We have free access to Johnstown Castle. I do not wish to add any fuel to this fire because it is not in my interests but it should be the aim of the Bill to coordinate the functions of the researcher and the adviser.  The agricultural adviser is the link between the farmer and the information that is available.  I believe that the system of the researcher must change not for the sake of change but because change is absolutely necessary. People in the entire research field must come out of their institutions and get down to the farms because it is by example on the farm that we will get the best results.  There is no use in having knowledge in this press or in that press. That is no good.  The knowledge must be brought back to the farm.  That is what it is important.  If the institute personnel are brought out to a particular area to do a particular trial within that area then the people living there will see the effects <Col N="1351" /> of that trial and that is what is important. Research by and large is being carried out in the institute's premises.  That is fair enough.  I am not against that but I believe that if we are to get any benefit or any reaction from the agricultural community they must get down to the local farm where the agricultural instructor is.  He knows the type of farmers in the area.  They should go into these local farms and carry out their tests there and let the results be seen so that they can be talked about.  It is no use putting the results of this, that, or the other test in the papers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is doing away with that important link.  The Minister knows the attitude of the advisers and the people in the Agricultural Institute.  I appeal to him to think again about this issue, which is the kernel of the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister of State to use whatever influence he has with the Minister for Agriculture to think about this.  I know it will take a lot to change the Minister's attitude on this particular issue.  He is being completely influenced by the officers of the Agricultural Institute.  I have a lot of friends there.  Did he allow a free vote in his party?  Would all his good county councillors throughout the country support him on this Bill?  How many of his supporters in general would support him on this Bill?  How many of the people working in the Agricultural Institute would support this Bill?  Would the boss himself support him?  He would not. There are thousands of officers throughout the country who would not support him but they are the quiet people, those who are not prepared to stand up and say what they want done.  They prefer to go about their day's work. Although the others are going about their day's work they are more vocal and are getting their points across.  I believe they are influencing the Minister unduly on this particular issue on which he has taken a bitter stand.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to allow the former authority to make any attempt to see if it could operate or to see if advantages could be gained by letting it operate.  I question the advisability of <Col N="1352" /> this change, which has been described as a two-tier system but which I describe as taking away an essential link between the farmer and the researcher.  I believe the vast majority of people engaged in agriculture feel that the research wing should be integrated with the advisory services resulting in new initiatives which would be for the benefit of farmers and the country in general.</P>
    <P>The case for integration has been made very often.  Somebody has said that if Deputy Mark Clinton was introducing this Bill the present Minister would be making this case against it. There is no use in researching information if it cannot be got to the farmers where it is needed.  The real benefit from the researcher can only come by co-operation between everybody concerned. I believe this Bill will have the direct opposite effect.  I have known the officers of both sections in relation to this for at least ten years and I know their views.</P>
    <P>We are erecting barriers between farmers and researchers.  I have said this before and I say it again.  Deputy Toal has also said it but it is no harm to repeat it again and again, because even if the Minister does not come around to our thinking on the matter perhaps the officers of the Agricultural Institute will see that this Bill will sever their link with the farming community.  I appeal to them to come together and have a serious look at this issue.  They should ask themselves what their position will be in five years' time.  The barriers are there already but they will be built higher.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute have available to them huge tracts of land and equipment, which is the property of the taxpayers.  It is in their interest that the links between themselves and the farmers is not severed.  I appeal to the Minister to include the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in the title of the Bill and restore it in every possible section.  I hope some of my children go into agriculture but I would not under any circumstances give young people land without having basic and very necessary education in agriculture.  It is absolutely essential to insert the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in this Bill. <Col N="1353" /> I am glad that the provision for the influence of the public service has been removed because if there was an urgent need for money those people would be very slow to move, depending on how the economy was at that particular time. If we want to strive forward in agriculture we should not have to depend on the public service because they would be completely influenced by the economic situation at the time the decisions had to be made.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute is the reason for the Bill and I appeal to the officers of that body to reassess their position and take a serious view of its implications for them in the years ahead. Unfortunately, this Bill will mean an era of uncertainty for us because nobody can say how it will work.  We know that different threats have been made in various directions and that it will take at least two years to evaluate whether the proposals contained in it will work to the advantage of all farmers.  But agriculture is committed to expansion, the money has been borrowed for that and the expansion will go ahead anyway.  What is important is that research is reflected back to the farmers to help them improve production and make available more produce for export.</P>
    <P>The markets are available for our agricultural produce.  Heretofore fluctuating markets were our greatest problem in agriculture.  One year farmers were paid a certain amount for their cattle but the following year they had to accept a reduction.  We experienced many slumps particularly when Britain brought in Argentine beef.  That problem has been eliminated because we have the markets of Europe.  We have other problems but by and large we will never return to the day of fluctuating prices. Our farmers are willing to work their land and increase production and we have the stock on our farms.</P>

      <P>I accept that we do not have enough stock but it is the duty of the Minister for Agriculture to help increase our stock and productivity.  This <Col N="1354" /> Bill will build up many barriers which will have an upsetting effect on the agricultural situation.  I am not trying to inhibit the Minister in his work but I have been in agriculture all my life, have worked with the advisory service, been a member of a county committee of agriculture for a number of years and am aware of the workings of the Agricultural Institute and I know what I am talking about.  We will not have to wait ten years to see the effects of the Bill.  They will become evident in the next few years because the Minister has severed the link between farmers and those engaged in research, a serious thing to do at this stage of development in agriculture.</P>
      <P>I accept that agriculture will expand but at what pace?  I have heard talk of a growth of 4 or 5 per cent but why not strive for a growth of 6 per cent?  That would be a great advantage to the farming community and to the country.  At present we export agricultural produce worth approximately £400 million and every extra 1 lb. of beef or lamb and every additional stone of grain can be exported because we are almost self-sufficient in those fields.  I hope the Minister will change his views on the question of the Agricultural Institute.  It will not be possible for us here to get him to do so and for that reason I call on the officers of the institute to have a serious talk with the Minister about the implications of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill raises a number of important issues in relation to the future development of agriculture, our most important industry.  It has serious implications in relation to national thinking and outlook on the question of the potential of Irish agriculture.  It is unfortunate that the Minister in the Bill is doing something similar to what was done by a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, in 1957.  Following a general election in that year one of the first actions of Deputy Smith on assuming office was to scrap the parish plan for agriculture.</P>

      <P>The parish plan was the first attempt to apply at local level a co-ordinated and integrated agricultural development programme.  It is regrettable that this Minister has introduced a Mickey Mouse Bill which is motivated purely by political vindictiveness.  When the previous Bill was introduced by Deputy Clinton we were in a pre-election atmosphere and the present Minister, then Opposition spokesman on Agriculture, allowed himself to be pressured by certain vested interests.  He walked into the trap of committing himself to doing something about that Bill if Fianna Fáil were returned to office. The Minister is putting into effect the promises and commitments he gave to those vested interests who objected to our Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years I have paid many tributes to the Agricultural Institute and I have also been critical of them from time to time.  I should like to pose fundamental questions in relation to this matter: what do we mean by research? What type of agricultural research do we want?  What type of agricultural research will be conductive to the expansion of our agricultural industry?  The fundamental purpose of agricultural research is that it must be practically orientated and not just research for the sake of research.  The Agricultural Institute has been engaged in a big number of research programmes over the years and has accumulated massive documentation and reports on all types of research projects and I should like to know what percentage of the total research undertaken by the institute since its foundation has been practically applied.  The role of the institute is basically a practical role, engaging in research projects, but it does not stop there.  Research is no longer isolated. Research and development are two vital components of any development policy and to isolate research is a retrograde <Col N="1356" /> step which represents Victorian thinking which has no relevance today.  I believe in the great potential of Irish agriculture and that agriculture is our greatest industry.</P>
    <P>Sections of the country produce virtually nothing.  For instance, north Mayo has 110,000 acres of semi-peat land which continuous research by the Agricultural Institute has shown can be put to productive use.  Bearing in mind that agricultural land is now making £3,000 per acre, and that estimates of the cost per acre of making that land productive are well under £1,000 per acre, it would be well worth while to apply the vast volumes of research work done by the Agricultural Institute.  What attempts have been made to apply it? How will the Minister's Bill make it easier to apply this research in a practical way in the field?</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing this Bill for political expediency.  I challenge the Minister to justify dividing the roles of research and development in either manufacturing industry or in agriculture. This division will create a barrier.  Let us face facts.  There has always been a problem in relation to the dissemination of the vast amount of information accumulated by the Agricultural Institute as a result of their research.  This research could be practically applied in north Mayo and all over the country in a way which would bring non-productive land into productive use, thus generating greater agricultural output and contributing substantially to job creation.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to Choirce Dhuibhne in the Kerry Gaeltacht where a local co-operative in Ballyferriter has done immense work in bringing non-productive hillside land into high intensive production.  Another highly successful co-operative has started in the Joyce country in Connemara, with a land reclamation programme and so on. The Agricultural Institute assisted in these projects but from my experience having been Minister for the Gaeltacht at that time, I noted that there was not a free flow of information between the Agricultural Institute, the local advisory services and very often the Department of Agriculture.  It is vital and fundamental for the maximum development of the <Col N="1357" /> economy that research should not be separated from development as the Minister proposes to do under this Bill. It is essential to have an integrated coordinated educational advisory research and development programme under the aegis of one responsible organisation. Such an authority was in the mind of the then Minister, Deputy Clinton, when he attempted to bring all the elements in agricultural development under one authority.  The powers of that authority are now being diminished because the Minister is dividing the most fundamental elements in any agricultural development programme.  As well as that the Minister is by implementation prohibiting the universities from participating in any future overall development plan for agriculture by not giving them any representation.  Traditionally, there has been intense rivalry between the Agricultural Institute and the agricultural faculties in the universities and between the Department of Agriculture and the advisory services. The expertise, resources and the manpower available in these bodies could be brought together under the umbrella of one authority.  In this Bill the Minister is putting the Agricultural Institute to one side, and he is telling the university agricultural faculties that they will have no say in the formation of policy, except that as a gesture he will put two representatives from the Agricultural Council on this and vice versa.  This is contradictory because if the Minister says on the one hand that research should be separated from the National Agricultural Development Authority he is on the other hand saying that there should be some link between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the arrangement applicable to Spanish fishing vessels fishing in waters of member states of the Community for the period 1 October 1978 to 31 December 1978 are contained in Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2327/78 of 4 October 1978 which is available in the Library.  These arrangements were adopted by the Council of Ministers in Brussels on 25 September.</P>
      <P>The arrangements are of special importance to Ireland in that during the period to the end of this year Spanish vessels are precluded from fishing within a minimum of 50 miles outside Irish baselines.  Since prior to the present arrangements Spanish boats were entitled to fish to 12 miles and in parts to six miles outside baselines, this reduction in pressure on fish stocks should further the development of the Irish fishing industry by providing increased catching possibilities for Irish fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister say that this will help the Irish fishing industry when he has increased from 41 to 141 the number of licences for Spanish boats that can fish at any one time within our 200-mile limit, that is, in areas six and seven off our coasts?

      <P>The figure of 240 licences operating over the whole area relates to the French and British coasts as well as to the Irish coast.  This is an increase on 202 licences, the number that were available during the corresponding period last year.  As far as we are concerned the important gain we alone have obtained is that the Spanish have agreed to give up what is not only their historic rights but their written six-to 12-mile rights.  These rights were written into the London Convention as recently as 1964.  Not only have the Spaniards agreed to give up these rights but they have agreed also to fish only 50 to 100 miles off base lines, rather on the same basis of exclusion so far as they are concerned as the Coalition Government prepared in relation to the box which they unilaterally declared but which was ruled out subsequently by the European Court.  In effect the Spaniards have agreed to stay outside that box until the end of the year and, hopefully, on a continuous basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take <Col N="1366" /> Questions Nos. 3 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the establishment or development of fish processing plants in any part of the State is a matter in the first instance for private enterprise which can be either Irish, foreign or a joint venture.  Every encouragement and advice is given by my Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to set up or extend fish processing plants and grants are available for acceptable projects from the Industrial Development Authority or Gaeltarra Éireann as appropriate.</P>
      <P>We have at present 20 fish processing proposals on hands comprising expansion schemes by existing firms and the establishment of completely new projects including the Castletownbere project mentioned by the Deputy.  The estimated total capital cost of these projects is £5.7 millions with a potential job figure of 610.  The individual details of these proposals are confidential between the promoters and the State agencies involved.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured that I would not recommend the payment of a State grant or otherwise encourage any project unless I was satisfied that it was in the national fisheries interest to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of Question No. 3, is the Minister completely satisfied that this is not a device, a backdoor method of gaining further access to Irish fishing waters by the fishing fleet referred to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied.  This will be a very controlled and carefully monitored project if it gets under way.  It will have the very positive effect of introducing new fishing grounds to Irish fishermen.  For instance, there has been talk about 50-mile fishing, but Irish fishermen do not fish for hake between 50 and 100 miles.  It would be to their advantage if they were encouraged, developed and guided towards such fishing grounds and this type of fishing by co-operating with Spanish fishing interests. That is what I have in mind.</P>

No agreement was reached at these discussions on conservation policies and quota allocations because of UK reserves.</P>
      <P>Measures agreed at these councils include a Community grant of £30 million to Ireland towards the cost of fishery protection, an interim scheme of grants for fishing boats and fish-farming and a regulation restricting Spanish fishing in our waters to an area nowhere coming within 50 miles outside baselines.

As regards the successful conclusion of fishery talks, what I said a few minutes ago is apposite.

      <P>That is a matter between the British Government and the Community.  I want to emphasise another point which was raised by Deputy Treacy and Deputy Deasy.  I am sure Deputy FitzGerald will agree with me on this.  The fact is that the more we distance ourselves from the British in this respect the better.  I got a guarantee and commitment that anything the British get we will get.  On top of that we have the guarantees embodied in the Hague Declaration, of which Deputy FitzGerald is aware.  We have the preferential quotas arising out of that, and we have got extra bonuses in relation to fishery protection costs and in respect of direct grants towards the purchase of vessels.  Anything the British may obtain we will get also.  I cannot think of a better arrangement than that. If anybody can come up with one here I will be glad to hear of it.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy's brother is in the Naval Service, but that is nothing personal.  The fact of the matter is that the Navy have been very stringent in their control and operations in regard to the herring fishing area in particular.  Indeed, I went to the extent of arranging that the secretary of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, Mr. Byrne, would go along with a naval vessel that apprehended Dutch boats in the past few months.  After full investigation of the situation it was found that the boats had less than the 5 per cent by-catch allowable. The fact of the matter is that the Naval Service are prosecuting. Where prosecutions are warranted, they are apprehending.  In regard to all cases concerning the Dutch which the deputy has raised, they have been found to have been catching well within their by-catch limit.</P>

      <P>State financial aid for the purchase of new and secondhand fishing boats by fishermen is provided under the marine credit plan administered by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM).  The detailed information sought by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which, I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement.</P>
      <P>(1)  New Fishing Boats.  Boats up to 90 feet long&mdash;Grant: 25 per cent of purchase price.  Loan: A loan up to a maximum of 70 per cent of the purchase price is available subject at present to an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum for vessels up to 65 feet long and 8½ per cent per annum for vessels from 66 feet to 90 feet long.  The loan repayment period varies with the size of the boat as follows&mdash;(i) under 50 feet&mdash;15 years maximum (ii) 50 to 90 feet&mdash;12 years maximum.</P>
      <P>Boats over 90 feet long&mdash;At present the marine credit plan does not extend to boats over 90 feet long.  Each application for financial aid is considered on its merits by BIM.</P>
      <P>New boats are eligible for consideration for grants up to 50 per cent from the FEOGA Fund administered by the EEC Commission provided&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  they are between 12 and 24 metres between perpendiculars and are equipped for any type of fishing, or (b) they are between 6 and 12 metres between perpendiculars and are equipped for a method of fishing other than trawling or purse seining and are operated by persons whose principal activity is fishing, and (c) the applicant is fishing and contributes not less than 25 per cent of the cost of the vessel and the national Government 5 per cent of the cost.  This is an interim measure applicable up to 31 December, 1978.</P>
      <P>(2)  Secondhand Fishing Boats&mdash; Grant: Nil.  Loan: A maximum loan of 90 per cent of the valuation of the boat as made by BIM is available subject at present to an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum.  The length of the loan repayment period depends on the age and condition of the vessel, subject to a maximum period of ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each application for financial aid is <Col N="1374" /> considered on its merit by BIM.  Vessels must be constructed in approved boatyards and conform to BIM building regulations.</P>
    <P>In general, a loan for a secondhand vessel is normally only made available for a vessel coming on the market as a result of the seller's purchasing a new vessel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to indicate what EEC grants are available, if any, to the various classes of boats referred to and how these grants are being disbursed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>For Ireland and Southern Italy the EEC propose to give grants of 50 per cent of cost in respect of boats up to 90 feet; on boats under 90 feet, 50 per cent cost grants, which is a substantial achievement.  That is an interim arrangement this year.  We hope to incorporate it in a permanent Common Market fisheries regime once the British agree to such regime and it has been finalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in fact the reverse.  I said under 90 feet.  The whole thinking behind this is based on regional and social considerations rather than encouraging heavy commercial investment in fisheries.  Candidly the view within the Community is that conservation is the important matter and that smaller fishermen are not the people who are damaging fish stocks&mdash;it is the larger operators, both from third countries and from some Community countries.  It is very progressive thinking and I go along with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the extent of the damage done by both red tide and brown tide affecting marine life, in particular sea trout stocks in the south west coast area; the steps his Department have taken to cope with the situation; and if he will take steps to compensate owners of sea farms for heavy losses sustained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the only quantifiable damage to fish which could be attributed to the recent appearance of the phenomenon popularly known as red or brown tide off the south and south west coasts concerned fish in privately owned fish farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  I have looked into it in great detail.  I am being candid here.  It is a type of marine disease about which the experts are, frankly, puzzled as to cause.  This is not just in Ireland but worldwide.  At present they are investigating it.  There is a special team working on this at present&mdash;internationally, not just nationally&mdash;to get to the root of the matter.  It is a toxic substance caused by decomposition of large concentrations of fish life, not fish itself, but fish-associated life, marine organisms.  They have not got down to the root of it yet.  I have very detailed information on it here.</P>

      <P>I was also concerned when this matter arose during the summer. I went into it.  The owners involved in the Cork outbreak&mdash;that is, West Cork Sea Farmers Limited&mdash;were insured against this and were compensated to that extent.  I am afraid it is an occupational hazard until the scientists and experts get to the root of it.  That is all I can say at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he is aware that this country's jurisdiction over, and enjoyment of, the fisheries of the River Foyle and Lough Foyle is now being seriously reduced by the action of the Six County fishery authority, which is steadily extending its jurisdiction over the Foyle fisheries area to the detriment of our fishermen who have fished these waters until recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any <Col N="1377" /> developments which would substantiate the charges contained in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not recall some time in the early part of the year meeting a deputation from along the Foyle when, among other matters, this was discussed?  Is he not further aware that in the fishermen's <i>Almanac</i>, which is regarded as the bible in so far as these matters are concerned, different editions in different years show what I maintain is the truth&mdash;that the Six Counties fishery authority is gradually closing right across the Donegal coast and that fishermen from Greencastle and right up the Foyle, who down the years enjoyed salmon fishing right across the Derry coastline, not only are not now allowed there but in fact have been prosecuted on many occasions and their gear, boats and so on seized?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I are both aware of the problem here.  I am very sympathetic concerning the Greencastle situation, particularly where traditional rights have been exercised up the Derry coast outside the Foyle area. The question of these rights and, in my view, the legitimate claim to them, having regard to the traditional exercise of these rights by the fishermen concerned, is being pursued at the moment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs with the British Government with a view to establishing the situation.  Discussions have taken place.  We have not yet reached agreement but I shall keep the Deputy informed because I share his concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While these discussions are taking place, might I ask the Minister if he could ensure that the encroachment already by British gunboats in that area should cease forthwith and the <i>status quo ante</i> be allowed to stand until agreement has been reached, if it can be reached.  Those fishermen have been cleared out of this area and there is no reason why they should be, unless might is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>But can the Minister not intervene or intercede at this stage?  A reasonable interim arrangement or holding operation would be that matters be allowed to continue as they were before the encroachment began while discussions and negotiations are going on to try to reach an acceptable settlement for both sides.  Why should our fishermen be at a loss and others have the gain while discussions go on?</P>

Could he indicate why the matter has slipped back in this way since then because the position as I recall it&mdash;and there is always a <Col N="1379" /> problem of a possible deficiency of memory&mdash;was that we established clearly the position and the rights of Irish vessels in this area and when they were interfered with we took the strongest measures which led to a cessation of the interference.</P>

A decision will be made shortly as to the measures to be adopted for the protection of our salmon stocks generally during 1979 and, in view of the gravity of the situation in the Erne estuary, special measures may need to be taken in this area.

      <P>Whatever he proposes to do to improve the situation, I would ask the Minister before doing it to have a full investigation on the spot, probably an inquiry in or around Ballyshannon in order to ascertain what the worst causes are.  Regardless of what arises from that, would he take steps to ensure that the ESB would facilitate him and the fishermen by enabling fishermen's representatives at all reasonable times to check the counter in the fish pass at Kathleen Falls on the Erne because, whatever the truth is, the fishermen are far from satisfied that they always get the actual facts in regard to this particular counter.

      <P>I am aware of the views of An Taisce on both the current and long-term proposals for the development of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre which have been the subject of a meeting and correspondence between officers of my Department and the association.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that current development proposals, spread over a period of five years, pose no threat to the amenities presently enjoyed by the general public at Howth harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points involved and one relates to Claremont beach, which is a very important place for Dublin working class people in summer. Is there the possibility of that being eroded to any extent?  The second point is: are the lovely old buildings, including some active businesses, along the pier likely to be interfered with?  These are the two major points for consideration. Obviously everybody welcomes the developments in relation to the harbour. What is the position about these two features?</P>

      <P>We have gone to considerable pains over the past 18 months to have full and frank discussions on the ground in Howth.  I initiated these discussions. We met the representatives of Balscadden Bay Fisheries Co-operative Ltd., the Howth Yacht Club, the Harbour Committee, the Howth and District Association of An Taisce, and the residents of Howth in an open forum. Concensus agreement was reached at a meeting in my Department on 21 April. Matters are proceeding along those lines. Frankly, I was surprised at An Taisce coming into it at that stage of play because their local committee were in on all these discussions.  There will be demolition of buildings on the pier to which the Deputy referred.  That is inevitable because there will have to be an auction hall there for fishing purposes. There has been very full consultation on all of this.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>In recent months a number of discussions have taken place between officials from my Department, the Office of Public Works and Mayo County Council to resolve difficulties, mainly financial, about repairs and improvements to Killala harbour.  As a result, revised proposals to complete works, estimated to cost £128,000, were forwarded to Mayo County Council for consideration on 16 October 1978.  In June 1973 when the need for the works was discovered the estimated cost was £40,000.  The difference between the 1973 and present estimates of cost is accounted for by inflation and by the cost of making good the deterioration of the surface and face of the pier which has occurred since 1973.</P>
      <P>I am advised that if Mayo County Council accept the proposals and the financial requirements are met the actual work would take about nine to 12 months to complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government have been involved at all stages of the lead-up to the decision to sink the vessel <i>Christos Bitas</i>.  Officers of my Department have attended three meetings in London in the past six days at which representatives of the British Government and all other interested parties were present.  These included the meeting on 25 October at which the decision to sink the tanker in the North Atlantic was taken.  In addition there has been constant telephone communication between officials of both Governments.  I have personally discussed the matter on a number of occasions with Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis, my opposite number at the Department of Trade.</P>

      <P>I am astonished that the Government would support what could <Col N="1407" /> be interpreted as an act of international vandalism by dumping an oil-clogged tanker off our south-west coast.  Does the Minister accept that there is a serious risk, a risk which will remain indefinitely, to the coast, the environment and the marine biology of south-east Ireland by virtue of the fact that an unknown quantity of oil remains in the ship?  Can the Minister indicate the quantity of sludge in the ship at this time and whether any officers of his Department have analysed the type of oil therein?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said.  We have consulted all available expert advisory services. We have studied the proposal carefully. We are satisfied that, having regard to the distance of the sinking site from our coast, the pattern of winds and tides, the prospect of any oil reaching our shores is minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that serious concern has been expressed no later than today by the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and that they are in direct conflict with what the Minister has said?  Why was the tanker not dragged back to its port of origin, or any other port that would take it, for dismantling in a responsible way instead of being dragged hundreds of miles over the sea to be dumped off what appears to be the dumping ground of Europe, namely, the Irish coast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that 500 miles off our coast is on the Irish coast.  I studied this matter carefully and got all the expert advice that it was possible to get.  Obviously, failure to take decisive action would lead to a continuing hazard to the fisheries and environment. Whether any port would accept the ship is another matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting it. As I have explained, it will be 500 miles from the Irish coast.  Even if some oil were to escape it would not affect our coast because of the distance between the dumping site and the coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): May I suggest to the Minister that getting rid of this ship by sinking it was getting rid of it on the cheap and at considerable danger to this country?  What consideration has been given to the problem of dealing with this oil when it surfaces, as it is very likely to surface?  Can the Minister tell us how much oil is still in the ship?  The best opinion I can get is that the tides and currents mean that it will flow towards our coast.  Have any long-term arrangements been made to monitor the sunken ship so that evidence of the surfacing of oil can be detected quickly and appropriate action taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the Deputy got his expert advice but the expert advice given to me is contrary to the advice given to the Deputy.  Having consulted a number of authorities in relation to this matter I am unable to think of where he got that advice.  There is approximately 1,000 tons of oil on this ship.  It is very thick oil and much of it will adhere to the ship.  The quantity that is likely to surface will not reach our coast.  Let us put this matter in perspective. In October 1974 2,500 tons of crude oil was spilled from a tanker in Bantry Bay.  Clean-up operations were successfully undertaken by Gulf Oil in consultation with the Departments of the Environment and Fisheries.  We are now talking about a percentage of 1,000 tons of oil which will be more than 500 miles from our coast and efforts are being made here to raise a scare about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the question of the manner in which in the House action is taken when an allegation is made against a Deputy, and when it is denied, and evidence is not produced. Which procedures should then be taken by the Chair?  On two occasions yesterday allegations were made against Deputy Mitchell by the Minister for Health.  The first was that Deputy Mitchell had been briefed by someone, the implication being that the briefing was from someone who had a vested interest, which Deputy Mitchell denied, and the Chair's reaction was to say: &ldquo;I take it the Deputy is not briefed by anybody&rdquo;.  The Chair then said: &ldquo;I accept it is withdrawn.  It is withdrawn, and that is that&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister had not, in fact, withdrawn it, or said anything.  On the second occasion, the accusation was twice made that Deputy Mitchell had a vested interest in tobacco consumption. The Minister made it in specific terms. The Chair's reaction was to say that he was not aware the Deputy had any vested interest, and the Deputy asked was it the Chair who accepted that.  The Chair subsequently said: &ldquo;If the Deputy says he has no vested interest, that is OK, we accept that&rdquo;.  He later said: &ldquo;If the Minister states that Deputy Mitchell has a vested interest in the matter before the House, in cigarette or tobacco firms, and he says he has not, the Minister withdraws that&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, of course, had said nothing of the kind, or intervened at all. Finally, the Minister said: &ldquo;What I said <Col N="1411" /> is that the Deputy's speech left me with the impression of being a supporter of the vested interests of the tobacco companies&rdquo;, which is not the whole of what the Minister had said.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle then said that he had been given the impression of the Deputy's speech being in support of the vested interests of the tobacco people, and that there was nothing wrong in that.  At the end, the Chair said: &ldquo;The Minister has accepted that the Deputy has no vested interests in the tobacco people.  I have got that acceptance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Up to that point the Minister had not in any way accepted the denial, qualified or unqualified.  I am asking the Chair whether the correct procedure in such cases is for the Chair to put it to the person making the allegation that he must withdraw it, rather than to say he has withdrawn it when clearly he has refused to do so.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Chair seeks to pacify the House, to have a mollifying effect on all concerned, but I submit that there is a danger that if the Chair does not adopt a procedure of seeking a withdrawal from the Deputy who has made the allegation, or if, as in this instance, the withdrawal may not be received, the allegation may stick, and the protection of the Chair will not have been accorded to the Deputy against whom the allegation had been made.  Therefore I would ask the Chair if the correct procedure in such circumstances is to seek the withdrawal of such allegations and to pursue the matter with the Deputy who has made the allegation, unless there is substantiation.</P>

I am not aware that there was any complaint.  I would not be competent to make any further comment at this time except to add that unparliamentary remarks should be withdrawn freely.  There are times when the Chair does not like to ask a Deputy to leave the House for a remark made, <Col N="1412" /> sometimes not too audibly.  Indulging in such remarks is a practice which denigrates the House and affects the prestige and decorum of the House. Where possible, the Chair would take immediate action.</P>

      <P>Before questions I was endeavouring to express my views in regard to the role of agriculture and I expressed vigorous opposition to the decision of the Miniser to take the Agricultural Institute from under the umbrella of the new Agricultural Authority.  In a country like this where agriculture is a vital national resource, the most important part of our economy, which offers the greatest potential for economic development and for employment, I cannot understand the logic of separating the Agricultural Institute from the proposed Agricultural Authority.  It is a retrograde step and the reasons are purely political.  There does not appear to be any credible or acceptable reason why the Minister should have made this decision.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment the Agricultural Institute has done an immense amount of research but there is a problem here in relation to scientific research of all kinds.  There is a great weakness in the whole area of scientific research, not only in agriculture but in other areas also, in that a number of research institutes have been engaged in scientific research but there has been only a feeble effort to convert the findings of such research into practical projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of the National Scientific Council was a step in the right direction towards attempting to harness the research function to economic development.  I do not like to speak theoretically on these matters.  During my period as Minister for the Gaeltacht I found that there was a vast amount of scientific research carried out not merely by the Agricultural Institute but also by the universities and other scientific bodies.  It was highly impressive research well up to international standards.  Many of our scientists have read scientific papers abroad and this applies to the Agricultural Institute.  However, I was appalled at the very insignificant amount of work done in applied research.  Much of the work of the Agricultural Institute has been translated into practical improvements on the farm but a vast volume of research has not been put into practical action.  I look on agricultural <Col N="1414" /> research not merely from the point of view of translating the research work down to the work on the farm; it has a much broader dimension in the area of rural economy, into research into social problems, a rural and community development and, very importantly, research into food technology and food processing that are vital dimensions in the overall development and exploration of the potential of Irish agriculture.  I cannot see how any Minister or Government can contemplate the formulation and implementation of a properly integrated, co-ordinated agricultural development programme without giving the research function an important and integrated role in it.  In my opinion this is the weakness of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The integration and involvement of the research function via the Agricultural Institute and the university faculties of agriculture in the national agricultural development programme is vital.  It works in two ways.  The integration of research into an overall development programme will ensure that the people implementing the policy will have available to them the findings of the research worker.  The other aspect is even more important.  The people charged with the formulation and implementation of a national agricultural development programme will be able to channel their work into specific projects or areas that offer the best potential for development.  The liaison which the Minister is proposing is not enough.  I cannot accept that mere liaison between the agricultural authorities and the Agricultural Institute is sufficient.  There is a vital need for an overall, comprehensive, integrated development programme involving all areas, research, training, education and advisory services and the farmers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking I do not like to quote authorities or to base my view on what other people say.  I am sure the Minister accepts the need for a vigorous, dynamic national agricultural development programme.  I agree with this but I recognise the vital role that research can play and mere liaison between the development end and the research end is not enough.  Research and development <Col N="1415" /> are complementary and it is vital that the two be integrated.</P>
    <P>In a recent publication by the National Economic and Social Council there was an article headed: &ldquo;Policies to accelerate agricultural development&rdquo; by Dr. Séamus J. Sheehy and John J. O'Connell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously they accepted the fact that the Minister had made up his mind and was going to bring in this Bill now before the House. They recognised the need for the kind of co-ordination I have been talking about and they stated:</P>
      <P>Specifically, we propose an Agricultural Development Council consisting of Department of Agriculture officials, representatives of the proposed agricultural training authority, representatives of An Foras Talúntais and representatives of the farming organisations.</P>
      <P>In other words, they recognised the need for the proper co-ordination of efforts between the different elements that go to make up a national agricultural development programme.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows that the rationalisation and reorganisation of the advisory services is long overdue.  A continuous debate on the matter has gone on since 1957, since the Minister's predecessor scrapped the parish plan for agriculture. I make no apology for having expressed my conviction during the years that the parish plan was a unique idea.  However, it was scrapped and since then debate has gone on about the matter and reports have been published about the need for reorganising the advisory services. The whole situation is ludicrous. The worse feature is the system of temporary appointments and the system of permanent appointments.  I know that many people spend a large proportion of their time at a certain point in their careers attending interviews for permanent positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> One of the most appalling aspects is where an instructor in a temporary capacity in a predominantly dairying area is appointed to an area which is a non-dairying area.  One example of that was the appointment some years ago of a temporary instructor in County Limerick to the Midlands where the system of farming was entirely different. That man was an excellent instructor but, in order to avail of a permanent appointment, he had to move away into an entirely different environment.  That has been the pattern and the time has now come when this diabolical system must be changed.  I know instructors in temporary capacities who come up here to Dublin for interview after interview.</P>
    <P>The worst example I came across personally was the case of a temporary instructor in County Limerick.  He was a very progressive type and he initiated a unique experiment.  He formed a small group of 12 farmers and that group met every week in a different house and planned a very excellent programme.  This instructor won their confidence.  He was not merely their scientific agricultural adviser but their adviser in every sense of the word.  The project he initiated was showing every sign of success.  Two or three years later he applied for a permanent appointment in Limerick.  The committee and everyone else involved were most anxious that he should be appointed so that the project would be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. What happened?  He had to leave the area and the whole project fell through. It would have been unfair to except a young instructor coming in to have the same outlook, attitude and motivation.</P>
    <P>There is no diminution in the service. A growing number of co-operatives are now employing agricultural advisers. Commercial firms employ agricultural advisers.  Banking and other institutions are appointing agricultural advisers.  To me, the most interesting development is in the growing number of co-operatives employing agricultural advisers.  Now, it would be a great pity if any conflict of interests were to arise between these and the official advisory service.  This is something that should be looked at very carefully.  Human nature being what it is, <Col N="1417" /> inevitably conflict could arise.  The terms of reference and the directives issued might be at variance.  There must be proper co-ordination and all must be motivated towards achieving the same objective.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have excluded the Faculty of Agriculture from this new authority.  There is an important link between third level institutions catering for agriculture and the advisory services. The advice the local officer will give, the quality of that advice, his scientific and technological competence and his competence as an adviser <i>per se</i> will be determined largely by the type of course pursued in the university.  Some years ago criticism was levelled at the course on the ground that it was too scientifically orientated.  Last week I took the trouble to examine the syllabus of the agricultural science course in UCD and to compare it with that of seven or eight, or more, years ago.  I was agreeably surprised to find it is now less scientifically orientated.  There is a broader range of subjects of a practical nature.  In second year, for example, the student is introduced to the basic principles of farm management and agricultural economics.  That did not happen in the past.</P>
    <P>Now, while some changes may be for the better, it inevitably happens that some changes are for the worse.  Some years ago there was a change&mdash;I am not too sure whether or not this system still prevails&mdash;whereby at the end of the second year a student could opt for a specialised degree.  One unfortunate student, who was quite brilliant, opted for such a degree in the field of animal nutrition. He received an honours degree but he could not get a job here even in the livestock section of the Minister's Department.  These anomalies should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>There is not merely a direct relationship between agricultural research and agricultural development, but there is a very important relationship between third level education in agricultural science and the advisory service and agricultural development. Perhaps the Minister would rethink this whole area and, as Deputy D'Arcy said, <Col N="1418" /> think of the long-term rather than the short-term effects of divorcing <i>de facto</i> the Agricultural Institute from the mainstream of agricultural development. That decision could in the long run well prove to be a disastrous decision on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe there is an immense potential for the development of agriculture. Almost daily, and certainly weekly, new ideas and proposals are being put forward for the development of agriculture.  I referred briefly to one to-day, but the Library is full of documents of this kind.  The Agricultural Institute, the universities and the farming organisations are coming forward day after day with new ideas.  The formulation and implementation of a comprehensive, integrated and co-ordinated national agricultural development programme is vital at this stage.  In that programme, contrary to what the Minister proposes in this Bill, the Agricultural Institute has a vital role to play.  Mere liaison between development and the institute is not enough.</P>

      <P>Somebody once said that to open the wound of the past tends to make us lose sight of the future.  I do not intend to get involved too deeply with the wounds of the past.  The Minister opposite has one of the most important portfolios and, sitting with the immense array of empty seats behind him, he should be aware of the tremendous political power he has.  Our greatest resource is our people and our second greatest resource is the land.  There is a distinct difference between agriculture as carried on in western areas and agriculture as carried on in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential point in this Bill is that the Minister proposes to give the institute autonomous powers and to make it an independent body.  I cannot see the logic in that.  The impression of many hard-working farmers is that there are politicians in this House spending hours arguing over titles and words, with little real discussion as to the action which could result from those things.  Do people really care what title is given to a Bill or what words are inserted in a Bill as long as the action and the effect resultant <Col N="1419" /> from that legislation are to their ultimate benefit?  The former Bill introduced some time ago would provide the necessary benefit without all the quibbling and verbal infighting over titles and words within titles.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that research needs a specific environment and I agree with that.  Successful agriculture has become a highly sophisticated enterprise.  The real need is for increased production in all aspects of agriculture.  If sophisticated research is carried out by highly qualified people in an independent body, there is a possibility that the results of that research could be locked away in an ivory tower far from the practical experience of farmers carrying out the everyday work.  The National Agricultural Authority is to be dissolved.  It is quite simple to do that when the majority in this House is so large.  I respect the intelligence of the people, their political opinions and their decision last year.  I wonder what the cost was of introducing the former Bill.  It was introduced at a time of extreme political pressure and many hot words were used during the debate.  The real loss has been the time lag between the introduction of the former Bill and the introduction of the present one.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a particular conflict over the words &ldquo;education&rdquo; and &ldquo;training&rdquo; and we could have a long discussion on the meanings of these two words.  What is the difference between education and training?  What is education and what is training?  Is a person ever educated or trained?  When a student attending a teacher training college receives a certificate, has he or she been trained or educated?  The same could be said to apply in farming.  Who has a farming education?  Who has a farming training?  According to a report published by the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture, 84 per cent of farmers have only primary education.  In that case, it must be said that primary education is of a very high standard because, as every Deputy knows, the keenest minds in the country are those of people who may not have achieved the so-called highest level in any educational sphere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> I have come to the realisation that the will is there among the farming community to accept the challenge presented by modern farming.  The setting up of a unified and properly co-ordinated body would be for the benefit of everybody, but if research is segregated and divided from advice and services, it creates an impression that all may not be as well as it should be.  There is concern for co-ordination even in the area of education and schools are being amalgamated. People are under the impression that the various agricultural services should be co-ordinated and research should not be removed to an autonomous independent section.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill to charge farmers for services given by agricultural advisers.  If an attempt is made to introduce this in the west, the result will be that many farmers who could benefit from agricultural advice will not avail of it.  For generations families have been raised on very limited budgets, many on finance coming from abroad through enforced emigration.  People are not inclined to part with money for advice.  I suggest that the Minister should pay the advisers an appropriate sum and they should give their valuable advice to farmers free of charge.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister that, according to the agricultural enumeration information of June 1975, which relates to numbers of holdings classified by acreage only, there were 24,635 holdings in County Mayo.  Of these 9,172 were greater than 15 and less than 30 acres and just over 5,000 were greater than 30 and less than 50 acres.  These are very small holdings. There is a definite lack of realisation of the physical barrier that many of these people have to cross to derive a decent income from the holding of ground. There are thousands of acres that need to be drained.  I welcome the Minister's recent announcement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going into areas that could not be connected with the present Bill.  He is talking about drainage, the size of holdings and so on.  The Deputy will have to relate all that to the advisory services of the Agricultural Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1421" />
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to research an area of County Mayo one must be able to get into it.  If there are no roads into it then we must provide roads into it.  I welcome the Minister's announcement from the EEC in relation to that.  Replying to a parliamentary question from me some time ago, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, said there was not enough bogland in Erris in the north Mayo area to provide a peat briquette factory.  There is over 110,000 acres of bog down there.  There is a research station in the heart of it and that research station has proved that valuable agricultural work can be carried out in areas of high density bogland.</P>
      <P>If it is proposed to introduce a charge on farmers for agricultural advice there will be a significant section of the farming community who will not avail of this advice for their own personal reasons and possibly for the reason that they might consider the advice might not be worth it and that they would be better to continue as they did in previous years. The important point is that production on our farms must be increased.  To do that we must have education, training, research and advice.  It appears to me that it would be much better to have all of these things co-ordinated rather than segregated, with research in one section and advisory services in another section.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal to introduce this Bill is seen by western farmers as the result of pressure brought to bear upon the Minister prior to June of 1977.  There seems to be very little logic in it.  The former Bill, if introduced and implemented as it should have been by now, would have provided all the benefits necessary to the people whom it was supposed to benefit rather than wasting the time of this House, of the Minister and the Deputies in discussing the verbal differences and distinctions between words as phrased in the Bill itself.  I do not welcome the Bill.  I would like the Minister, his advisers and his Department to note that if a charge is to be levied on farmers for agricultural advice there will be a section in western areas who will not accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I can say about the Bill.  It has a lovely sounding Irish name, An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta.  I have tried to compare the amended Bill with the original Bill.  Being a pragmatist, I know that the requisite number of votes are available on the other side of the House so that this Bill very shortly will be law.</P>
      <P>This is all about the interests of the farming community.  It is not about politicians or civil servants or anybody else.  It is really about farmers and production from Irish farm land.  That should be in everybody's mind on both sides of the House.  A few short years ago farming was a comparatively simple matter.  It was a question of hard work, where weeds and all sorts of things were eliminated manually.  Everything was done the hard way.  The only reason we maintained production was because the people on the land were more numerous. But now, with the advent of modern technology, with the fast changing methods of farming, this is no longer the case.  Nowadays we have to compete in an exciting new market place whereas previously we were only concerned with the British market.  Now we have a new set of competitors and the onus is on the Irish farmer and the authorities, the Government and the Department, to ensure that we can compete efficiently and effectively on those markets.  My only concern in relation to any Bill is that it will be the most effective legislation to do that.  The Minister knows as well as I do that at the moment farm prices have escalated.  He said that he was going to do something about it by trying to endeavour to make small holdings more viable, but this is not the place to talk about that.  The Minister fully appreciates that, unless a farmer is efficient and effective and treats his farm as a business, then he will not survive.  We all owe it to the farmer to do what we can to ensure that not only does he survive but that he prospers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to a few points in the Minister's speech.  The word &ldquo;education&rdquo; has been removed and the <Col N="1423" /> Minister has made his point.  He has removed the word from every place in the Bill.  He seems to be obsessed with its removal.  I cannot see the logic of that at all.  There is nobody so innocent or ignorant that they are going to confuse agricultural education with ordinary primary school or second level education. Everybody knows what we are talking about so why not let that stand? The word &ldquo;education&rdquo; was a useful addition in the Bill.  The Minister agreed with me on one occasion in this House that not enough emphasis was put on agricultural education.  In what rural school in Ireland is agriculture taught as a subject at primary level?  Not everybody in that school will be involved in farming, but surely it is in the interests of everybody to know something about it.  I would disagree with the Minister.  I think the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; is the operative word.  For instance, by taking the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; out are we leaving ourselves open in the future to some Minister coming along and saying that we should get rid of all these educational courses because they are costing us too much money and that in any case it is not mentioned in the Bill?</P>
    <P>We all know the value of these courses.  We have sponsored courses in various areas under the county committees of agriculture.  In Midleton, where I live, there is one for ladies at the moment and I am reliably informed by my wife that it is a very worth-while exercise.  The EEC have provided funds for this course.  We should put more emphasis on this sort of thing.  Education is the operative word.  There were many young boys this year who could not find places in our agricultural colleges.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about this because I know he is as concerned as I am.  Those young people will be the farmers of the future.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us what he has in mind in regard to providing proper educational facilities for our young farmers.  We know that the farm apprenticeship board are doing a very good job, but they are short of funds.  They have made successive appeals to the Minister for more funds.  We <Col N="1424" /> know about the large sums of money being spent by the IDA for the creation of jobs which very often do not exist.  We are talking here about training people for jobs which actually exist.  At the moment we have not a sufficient number of farm managers to go around.  If this Bill does nothing else but improve the educational status of our young people we will be on the right road.</P>
    <P>I do not see any mention in the Minister's speech about a firm programme for the future of our agricultural advisory service beyond fiddling about how they would be run, who would rule what, who would be somebody's boss. We should be talking about a five-year programme for our advisory service. This Bill should spell out where we are going.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the autonomy of the institute.  There is merit in this.  I believe that since its inception the institute have done good work in research.  In the early days we all went to them for advice and assistance which was freely given.  The fact that it was autonomous in the past helped.  I would like to see the Minister going one step further and making this new body equally autonomous for the same reasons he gave when he was talking about the institute. In the past we accepted our advisers as representing a fair viewpoint but this was often due more to the character of the men than the type of outfit they were operating under.  We are now looking for a more perfect system.  I believe the most perfect body would be a fully autonomous one.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said it is necessary to have control in relation to State funding.  The institute have proved that there is no need for that sort of control. They have worked very well without any interference at all from the civil service.  I would like to see the new body being free to do exactly the same thing.  The important thing now is to get on with the job. The morale of our advisers at the moment is very low because of bringing in Bills, taking out Bills, adjusting them and so forth.  I believe we are wasting time because developments are coming so quickly in agriculture that we have to be abreast of them at all times.  We need a good advisory service readily available <Col N="1425" /> on the ground but we have not this at the moment.  The CAO in my area told us recently that we have two vacancies. Two men were sanctioned by the Department for County Cork although we had not the money to pay them.  Is this only grandiose talk?  In my area our adviser is covering one-and-a-half times the territory he covered some time ago. We should have three advisers here.  Top class farmers will seek the advisers but there are many farmers who have to be encouraged and helped and in those cases the advisers have to make the approach. The Minister is aware that the role of the adviser in farming was never more important than it is today.  He is aware that because of the implementation of the farm modernisation scheme our advisers must sit in offices working over heavy files when they should be, and would prefer to be, dealing with farming problems, coping with disease eradication, helping to plan next year's crop programme and helping to ensure that farmers get the best possible return from their land.</P>

      <P>If we had autonomy for the new board we would have closer collaboration in future between the institute and that board.  We would have a general blending in of the two bodies that would give young agricultural graduates greater scope because they would be able to spend some time on research and some time in the advisory service.  Research is just as important as advisory work.  I have yet to meet an adviser who is satisfied with second-hand information.  Advisers want to find out things for themselves and they should be given an opportunity to do this.  If they were appointed to the institute for a period they could do this.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have given more thought to research because there is a considerable amount of overlapping in this area at present.  The universities, the advisory service, the institute, the Department and companies like the Sugar Company are all engaged in research with the result that there is bound to be a lot of overlapping.  At present trials are being carried out on seeds which should be done by an independent authority.  We have been told of the wonderful yields that are possible if farmers use imported winter cereals but we discovered that they are not very good after we tried them in Ireland.  For that reason we must have more emphasis on the co-ordination of research.  We should not have many groups carrying out research into the same thing and coming up with different answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke about charging a fee for advice but I do not <Col N="1427" /> think that is on.  As the Minister is aware farmers are probably the largest ratepaying group in the country.  They are paying well for this service.  The Minister should tell the House if he has had any success in his efforts to get EEC funds for agricultural advice and improved technology.  He is aware that the prospect of creating many jobs in agriculture is great at present.  We have entered the European area with dairy and horticultural produce and met with great success.  Many of our products are in the front row of European supermarkets, a great compliment to our farmers and concerns like Erin Foods who process agricultural produce.  The Minister should investigate the possibility of helping out concerns like Erin Foods in their research work.  As he is aware the price obtainable for our produce in Europe is limited and the profit margins are very fine.  We are depending solely on new and better varieties, on disease control and all the rest of it.  The importance of all this in the context of this advisory Bill is that any money spent by the Minister and by the Department will not stop at the farm gate.  The real money starts outside the farm gate in the processing industry, in the supermarkets in the case of sugar beet, in processing and in transport and in fertiliser sales.  A massive industry hinges on agricultural output and yet we allow one small semi-State body to carry the can for research and development when all of this should be properly funded and tabulated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that the National Agricultural Authority will be maintained in real terms but we have no guarantee of any level of funding and there has been no firm commitment from the Minister.  This point needs to be clarified.  I agree that elected representatives should work together as is proposed in the Bill, in local committees of agriculture, and this move will bury any suspicion that might exist and will help both groups to understand each other's point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> In the final analysis this Bill is about agricultural development, it has nothing to do with who introduced it or moved it. There is a lot in this Bill to be commended and there is a lot that I am unhappy with.  Basically it is a negative Bill which deals with who governs what and who will be responsible to whom.  It is a nicely tabulated civil service type of approach. I had thought that a man with such a wide experience of farming as the Minister has would have come up with an exciting new programme which is what we have waited for, but we have been disappointed.  There is not much merit in this document.  When this Bill is passed the advisers should get an opportunity to get on with the job.  I hope that agricultural processing will be expanded. As Deputy Kenny mentioned, nobody is ever fully educated and as somebody else said &ldquo;The more you know the more you realise how ignorant you are&rdquo;.  The same applies to farming with the fast-changing technology, the new ideas and the sophisticated new equipment and at a time when a decision in farming which could go wrong is expensive and every decision in farming is expensive.  A little application of nitrogenous fertiliser could wipe out a harvest, and neglect in spraying in the case of mildew could also wipe out a harvest.  I am not under-estimating the work of the farm modernisation scheme all of which could not be done adequately by a clerical staff. There will always have to be the type of semi-confessional arrangement with the adviser who goes out onto the farm and discusses in detail with the farmer his most private affairs and his business. The farmer likes to think that that is a highly confidential discussion and he may not be quite ready to walk into an office and spill out the whole story.  We cannot cheesepare on advisers by just putting in more office staff.</P>

      <P>My information is that the <i>Christos Bitas</i> was proceeding from Europoort (Rotterdam) to Belfast, that she went aground off the Welsh Coast and was refloated and that the Master of the vessel decided to continue his journey to Belfast.  Subsequent events made it impossible for the vessel to continue the voyage to Belfast.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that the vessel did not at any stage enter Irish waters and as far as I can establish never came nearer to the Irish coast than might be expected on a voyage from Rotterdam to Belfast.</P>

      <P>The total number of indoor staff employed by the Land Commission who are exclusively involved in the acquisition and purchase of land is 38.  On the inspectorate side it is estimated that the staff's direct involvement in this work is the equivalent of 45 officers working full time.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the staff of the Land Commission have no reason to be apprehensive as to their employment. Indeed, I would expect that, through their experience and expertise, they will have a valuable contribution to make in implementing future policy.</P>
      <P>I have already announced that I hope to put proposals on future land policy to the Government before the end of the year.  It would be premature for me, therefore, to make any statement on the future of the Land Commission at this stage.  For the present, however, the current policies of the Land Commission will continue to operate but priority must be given to distributing the 70,000 acres of lettable lands already in the possession of the commission and to finalising the 1,130 cases, comprising almost 54,000 acres, in the process of acquisition.</P>

      <Col N="1405" /> The boys in Loughan House will receive full-time education.  The programme is designed to meet general, compensatory and remedial needs as well as practical subjects.  County Cavan Vocational Education Committee are assigning eight full-time teachers.  The curriculum will include Remedial Teaching, general subjects, Religion, Woodwork, Drawing, Arts and Crafts, Home Economics, Music, Rural Science and Physical Education.  All the teaching posts have been filled with the exception of the post of music teacher.  Advice and counselling will be available to the boys from staff at all levels.  The staff includes welfare officers and a psychologist as well as Chaplaincy.</P>
    <P>Recreational facilities include a gymnasium and an equipped cinema/theatre and television.  There is a generous range of indoor games.  The grounds provide football pitches, a volleyball court, a pitch and putt course and there are facilities for swimming, boating and fishing on Lough Macnean which adjoins the grounds.  The water sport facilities will be afforded only to boys whose behaviour has stabilised.</P>
    <P>It is planned to have an easy progression from the class-room programme to hobby work and indoor and outdoor recreation.  The literacy class, for instance, leading on to theatre activity; physical education extending into the playing fields and woodwork and arts and crafts influencing hobbies and leisure time.</P>
    <P>The total cost of making Loughan House custodially secure amounted to £198,800.  This included £7,000 for approximately 930 metres of coiled security wire which is not manufactured in this country and was imported from West Germany.  This wire has been used in the enclosure of grounds of approximately ten acres.</P>
