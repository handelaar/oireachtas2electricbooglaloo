      <P>The available information relates only to net migration&mdash;there are no data on the gross flows of migrants in and out of the country.  The only reliable estimates of net migration are compiled for intercensal periods by relating successive population figures to data for births and deaths in the same periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An indication of the trend of net migration each year can be obtained from the figures for net passenger movement by sea and air.  While these have shown the correct direction of the net migration flow and provided a reasonable estimate have yielded of magnitude, it should be borne in mind that these estimate have yielded significantly different aggregates when compared with the more accurate estimates for some past intercensal periods based on population counts. The following are the net passenger balance figures for sea and air for the 12-month periods ending in February for each of the years 1973 to 1977:<Col N="300" /></P>

      <P>If a person suffering from muscular dystrophy is the holder of a medical card then, in common with other medical card holders, he is entitled to free general practitioner services, to the free supply of drugs, medicines and appliances and to free hospital in-patient and out-patient services.</P>
      <P>If such person is not the holder of a medical card he is entitled to the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and appliances for the treatment of this condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> I am informed that constant hospital care is not normally associated with this condition, nor does it normally lead to other conditions requiring in-patient or out-patient hospital care. Such care is, as the Deputy is aware, available to some 85 per cent of the population free of charge and would be similarly available, in the normal course, to a muscular dystrophy patient.  If the question of hardship should arise in a particular case there is already provision to deal with this. I do not propose, therefore, to extend the service further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty-two local committees were established under the Health (Local Committees) Regulations, 1972.  Their main function is advising the health boards on the provision by the boards of health services in their functional areas.  The cost of administering the eight health boards in 1977 was £1.9 million.  This covers the cost of management personnel, their support staff, and appropriate overheads and the expenses arising in connection with the local committees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I had already met a deputation from the Deputies of all parties from Monaghan to discuss the situation.  I received the submission in writing from the committee.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot possibly physically receive every deputation that wishes to come to see me about a particular matter.  Where I can not receive a deputation I invariably suggest that the body or organisation concerned submit a memorandum for consideration and if after study of the memo it seems that receiving a deputation would be helpful I endeavour to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If a body like the advisory committee, which is representative of all sectors of the public, asked to see the Minister on a matter as important as the continuation of the hospital in Monaghan surely they ought to be met by the Minister concerned if he places importance on their advice.</P>

      <P>I have received the written views of this committee.  It is not necessary for me to receive a deputation in every case from somebody who wants to put a point of view before me.  The Deputy knows enough about these matters to know that if I get a good memorandum submitted by the body concerned that is usually much more effective than receiving a deputation, which can be quite wasteful of everybody's time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together. The revision of the present limit of £3,000 per annum and of the criteria determining &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; is being considered in the light of the proposed introduction in 1979 of a scheme of pay-related contributions concerning health and social welfare. This review will take account of the distinction between manual and non-manual workers for eligibility purposes.</P>
      <P>The existing provisions are adequate to ensure that persons who require hospital services need not suffer financial hardship as a result of getting these services.  All insured workers who were eligible because their earnings came within the £3,000 limit when it was first introduced in July 1976 are still eligible, and will retain this eligibility at least until the beginning of 1979, even though their incomes may since have exceeded this limit.  Furthermore, any person who no longer satisfies the standard criteria of eligibility may still qualify for services without charge if the chief executive officer of the relevant health board considers that payment for the required service would involve hardship.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964 and the regulations made under that Act in 1966 govern the setting up of homes for incapacitated persons, which include homes for persons unable to look after themselves because of old age or infirmity.  The Act requires a person setting up such a home to notify the appropriate health authority at least one month in advance.  The regulations specify the standards to be maintained in the homes, including requirements that every home shall provide <Col N="317" /> suitable and sufficient care, accommodation, equipment, facilities and staff having regard to the nature and extent of the incapacity of the persons in the home and the number of incapacitated persons maintained.  Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the health boards and their authorised officers.

Old people's homes are supposed to care for old people but such homes have been set up in which there are neither the facilities nor the medical qualifications to deal with old people.  Would he agree that this area is open to exploitation due to the fact that hospitals generally are very reluctant to admit old people unless they are suffering from an acute illness?</P>

      <P>No, I do not.  The precedent to which the Deputy refers was a mechanism introduced by the Coalition Government to try to cope with the rampant inflation which was raging at that time.  It is simply an indicator of the extent to which inflation was raging that there had to be these two increases in the two years concerned.  At present the rate of inflation is decreasing very satisfactorily and my calculations are that the 10 per cent increase granted in April will work out at an increase of 6 per cent in real terms in 1978.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy knows that this matter was discussed before and on that occasion I pointed out that, perhaps regrettably, the take-up of free milk in rural areas is inconsiderable. There does not seem to be a demand in rural areas for milk as part of a free meals scheme.</P>

When we last discussed this matter the funds were made available from the EEC and since then there has been a new development and money contributed by Irish farmers is being used in other parts of the Community to finance school milk schemes. Would the Minister agree that this strengthens the case for the introduction of a comprehensive school milk scheme, including milk products?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that <Col N="328" /> local authorities have the capacity to take the initiative in this matter and they would presumably respond to popular demand if it existed; they do not.  The local authorities who could introduce free school meals do not do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister is taking that as an indication that there is not any demand.  Surely the Minister must be aware that direct representations have been made to the Department of Social Welfare by local communities asking that the scheme should be extended to their areas, which are not covered at present. Quite obviously the Minister is wrong in assuming that because local authorities do not extend the scheme there is not a demand.</P>

      <P>Title to unemployment benefit is based on employment contributions and does not depend on the means of the claimant.</P>
      <P>As regards unemployment assistance, the value of free or partly free board and lodging is one of the items which deciding officers and appeals officers are obliged by the law to take into account in the assessment of the means of applicants.  This amount is deducted from the appropriate maximum rate of unemployment assistance and the applicant is paid any balance.

      <P>I have no information in regard to what the Deputy has suggested.  I do not know that there is any significant evasion.  I have never heard any complaints that it exists.  I agree there is fairly widespread resentment at the fact that young people living at home are assessed on the value of board and lodgings given to them.  I am looking into that, but as the law stands the value of all benefits which a person derives has to be included by the deciding officer or the appeals officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if it is his policy to deny unemployment benefit to married women on the ground that they are unavailable for work; if so, if he considers such policy to be fair and just; and if not, if he will take steps to ensure that unemployment benefit is paid to married women according to the same criteria applied to everybody else.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor my Department have any separate policy in relation to claims for unemployment benefit from married women, as such, and the same criteria for entitlement are applied equally and impartially to all claimants.</P>
      <P>All claims for benefit, including those for unemployment benefit from married women, are decided by statutorily appointed deciding officers.  Each claim is decided in the light of the relevant statutory conditions and of the particular facts and circumstances pertaining to it.</P>
      <P>In considering a claim for unemployment benefit a deciding officer is obliged to determine on the evidence available to him whether a claimant is &ldquo;available for employment&rdquo; which is one of the statutory conditions applying to that benefit.  A person who is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer has the right of appeal to an appeals officer.  Both deciding officers and appeals officers are appointed statutorily and are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There should not be, and if there is discrimination against married women I would deplore it. <Col N="333" /> This is a very difficult area and I would point out to the Deputy that it is not alone in this country but in Great Britain.  There they have very grave difficulty trying to solve this problem of when a married woman is available for work and when she is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a popular belief about that but it is not so and I want to assure the House about that. The decision in each case must be taken by a deciding officer and on appeal by an appeals officer on the basis of the circumstances.  He must go into the facts of each case and decide factually whether the woman is free and available for employment.  I will quote what the National Insurance Advisory Committee in Britain stated about this:</P>
      <P>It has been ruled that availability for employment is a question of fact to be considered in the particular circumstances of each case, but at the same time it was pointed out that availability is to a very great extent an attitude of mind.</P>
      <P>I am quoting that as an example of what they think.  I do not accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the criteria in the case of married women were drawn up in the past with reference to the situation of men and that the influx of married women into the labour market has created peculiar circumstances because of women getting married and changing addresses or of having babies.  The criteria were originally drawn up for men and those criteria need to be broadened with concern for the circumstances of married women.</P>

    <Title>Copenhagen Meetings: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with precedent, I propose to inform the House of the discussions and results of the meeting of the European Council which I attended together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Copenhagen on Friday and Saturday last, 7-8 April.  I have had the Conclusions of the Presidency laid before this House and the Seanad for the information of Deputies and Senators.  I also intend to give an account of my separate meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan.</P>
      <P>For some years past, progress towards Community aims has been generally disappointing.  This is perhaps scarcely surprising given the intensity and persistence of the international economic recession.  Since last autumn, however, I detect a renewed sense of purpose in the Community, a process of fresh thinking, a readiness to contemplate more ambitious concepts in pursuit of its basic aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that in any future review of the development of the Community, particular significance will be attached to the agreement we reached in Copenhagen that the first direct elections to the European Parliament shall be held in all member states in the period from 7-10 June 1979.  The formal decision will be taken shortly by the Council of Foreign Ministers.  This agreement marks the end of a battle going back over 20 years.  It will invest the European Parliament with full democratic legitimacy.  I believe that, in <Col N="340" /> addition, as the concept of accountability of the members to their electorate gradually becomes a reality, it will lead to far-reaching innovations in the institutional development of the Community.</P>
    <P>I welcome this prospect, as I do the more immediate prospect of the direct elections campaign itself.  I hope that, both in Ireland and throughout the Community, it will give rise to a constructive debate on the major common issues confronting the people of Europe generally.  One issue to which we and other smaller member states will need to give attention is the development of the institutional checks and balances against the acts of simple majorities which are characteristic of the constitutions of federal and confederal states.</P>
    <P>At Copenhagen, we also adopted a Declaration on Democracy.  This is included in the Presidency Conclusions laid before the House.  Essentially, it confirms the basic values common to the peoples of Europe&mdash;pluralist, representative democracy, respect for the rule of law and for human rights and social justice&mdash;which must be upheld in any member state of the Community. The issue of this statement of principles on the occasion of our agreement on direct elections is particularly appropriate.  This is also true, I believe, of the timing of our agreement on the establishment of a European Foundation, as proposed in Mr. Tindeman's Report on European Union, Mr. Tindeman being the Belgian Prime Minister.  I personally fully share his perception that this union requires greater understanding of European integration and of the European cultural heritage as well as improved mutual knowledge and understanding among the peoples of the Community. These are to be the objectives of the foundation, which will be seated in Paris and set up on a Community basis by means of agreements concluded by the representatives of the Governments of the member states meeting within the Council.</P>
    <P>A problem, regrettably common in recent years to almost all member states, which engaged our attention was that of terrorist violence.  The <Col N="341" /> European Council declared its deep distress at the kidnapping of the former Prime Minister of Italy, Signor Aldo Moro, and the murder of his escort and expressed its complete solidarity with the Italian people and Government. I avail of this opportunity to reiterate in a parliamentary context the personal concern and sympathy I have already expressed and my hope for the early safe deliverance of Signor Moro, whom I had the pleasure of meeting on a number of occasions and who participated, as Italian Prime Minister, in the first meeting of the European Council in Dublin three years ago.</P>
    <P>We agreed that high priority must be given to the intensification of co-operation among the Nine to protect our societies against such terrorist violence.  I spoke particularly in support of the proposal&mdash;which was agreed&mdash;that the relevant Ministers should increase their mutual co-operation and submit as soon as possible their conclusions on the proposals to establish a European judicial area, as suggested at our last meeting by President Giscard d'Estaing.</P>
    <P>Also at his initiative and arising from the recent pollution disaster affecting the coast of Britanny, we adopted a text assigning a high Community priority to the prevention and combatting of marine pollution, particularly by hydrocarbons.  Community action in this area is very desirable and, of course, greatly in our interest, as an island State with substantial interests in tourism and fishing.</P>
    <P>The principal political matters discussed within the framework of European Political Co-operation were East-West relations in the wake of the Belgrade conference, the Middle East and the situation in a number of areas of Africa.  In relation to the Middle East, there was full support for the resolutions of the UN Security Council dealing with the situation in Southern Lebanon and with the principles of a general peace and settlement in the area as a whole.  The Government, of course, as I was happy to confirm yesterday to Secretary General Waldheim, are fully in accord with this common position of the Nine <Col N="342" /> in their support for these resolutions and for co-operation by all parties with the UN Interim Force for Lebanon in the execution of its mandate.  I may mention that the question of Irish participation in the peace-keeping force there was discussed with the Secretary General yesterday and will be decided in the light of developments.</P>
    <P>All of the matters I have mentioned are important.  But undoubtedly the principal area of concern at the Copenhagen meeting was the international economic and monetary situation.</P>
    <P>The general assessment of this situation and of future prospects remained sober and the focus was on how to achieve non-inflationary growth in the Community generally.  I am glad to be able to say that the Head of Government of one of the larger member states noted that the Government here seemed already to have discovered the secret of success at national level, by achieving last year and perhaps again this year the highest rate of growth of any country in the Community combined with a substantial reduction in inflation.</P>
    <P>It is good to see our achievements noted abroad but I have no illusions but that the continued success of our efforts will depend to a considerable extent on successful action to master world economic problems, and on our own ability to act with moderation and foresight.</P>
    <P>The Copenhagen meeting was not an occasion for final decisions on action.  It concentrated rather on analysis, looking forward to decisions at the next meeting in Bremen in July and at the so-called World Economic Summit in Bonn shortly thereafter. There was concern at the continuing high unemployment and at the sluggish rate of growth in the Community, which at less than 2 per cent last year was totally insufficient even to maintain employment at its existing level, not to mention the difficulties which could emerge with the greatly increased numbers of young people who will be seeking jobs in almost all member states in the next few years.  It was felt that the endemic monetary instability <Col N="343" /> of recent years had a large role in creating the problems from which we suffer.  Particular attention was given to the effects of disturbances affecting the dollar which are greatly in disproportion to its importance in world trade.  It was noted that the EEC was the only one among the three main forces in the developed world suffering from internal monetary disturbances&mdash;and this despite the fact that the member states have $150 billion of trade among themselves.  We talked of certain ideas on how the Community could make a contribution to world-wide monetary stability that would be commensurate with its importance in world trade.</P>
    <P>Further work is to be done on these ideas within the context of a common strategy which we agreed to develop over the coming three months and which, in addition to economic and monetary affairs, will cover employment, energy, trade, industrial affairs and relations with the developing world.  There is to be an assessment of the effects of present national economic policies and of the scope for additional co-ordination measures.  During this period the Community will make better use of existing common facilities to alleviate present restraints on member states' scope for action, particularly those arising from balance of payments difficulties.  This will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, a doubling of the capital of the European Investment Bank and the Community Loan Facility.</P>
    <P>It was thought essential that the Community should have achieved an annual growth rate of 4½ per cent by mid-1979 but it was recognised that, even with progress in accord with this guideline, there was a need to advance consideration of complementary, specific measures to combat unemployment, particularly among young people.  The Council agreed with the tripartite Standing Committee on employment that, while the best way to deal with unemployment was to create new jobs through active economic, employment and investment policies, there should be further consideration of whether work-sharing <Col N="344" /> measures could play a supplementary part.  Here, I might mention that the same committee noted, rightly I believe, the need to overcome difficulties both of principle and implementation, particularly as regards the costs involved.</P>
    <P>At my suggestion, with Italian support, the Council pointed out that the pursuit of greater internal cohesion, implying also a reduction in regional imbalances, constitutes one of the key objectives of the Community.  It is an ill wind that blows no one any good and one satisfactory result, from our point of view, of the general economic difficulties, is that the larger countries within the Community have come to appreciate how unacceptable is the persistence of high rates of unemployment of the kind to which, unfortunately, the less developed regions have had too lengthy experience. There is a danger that policies to overcome unemployment might be tailored largely or exclusively to meet the more recent problems of the central areas of the Community.</P>
    <P>We have indicated clearly both at the meeting in Copenhagen and when the President of the Commission paid a visit here in advance of the meeting, that Community policies generally must be applied with due regard to the different impact between central and peripheral regions and that there must be better coherence between the implementation of industrial structural policies and the objective of reducing regional disparities which requires that less developed states and regions must achieve higher than average growth. Regional policy guidelines, including proposals for systematic assessments of the regional impact of proposals in other areas of Community policy, have been under discussion at official level for some time: in addition, the Commission's work programme for 1978 suggested that there might be a need to establish correcting mechanisms where the regional impact of policies would be harmful.  These are useful ideas, so far as they go, but their implementation has been too long delayed.  I suggested, therefore, that progress should be expedited with a view, possibly, to an early meeting of <Col N="345" /> the Council, that is the Foreign Ministers, concentrated on regional policy. We will be pressing this further, in the light of the positive attitude of the European Council.</P>
    <P>While I might have wished that we had already reached the stage of taking concrete decisions, I am otherwise generally satisfied with the moves envisaged in the economic sphere.  In particular, I believe that an enhanced Community role in the promotion of greater monetary stability is necessary and deserves support.  The Government have the national implications of this matter under study.</P>
    <P>Associated with our general economic discussion we had a report on progress made in Community consultations with Japan with special reference to the reduction of Japanese balance of payments surpluses, consultations which resulted in a joint communiqué in Tokyo on 24 March.  This was seen in Copenhagen as a first step in continuing consultations.  We wish to increase our exports to Japan and Japanese investment here and I therefore hope that co-operation between the Community and Japan can be further developed and extended in the interests of both sides of the world economy.</P>
    <P>Before going to Copenhagen I had written to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan, suggesting that it might be useful if we met on the occasion of the Council to discuss different aspects of the Northern Ireland situation and other matters of mutual interest.  Mr. Callaghan readily agreed.</P>
    <P>We had an informal and most useful meeting.  We looked back to our discussion last September, affirmed the views expressed in the communiqué following that meeting and reviewed the progress since then in the political, economic and security areas.  We agreed that there should be further meetings between Ministers, as necessary.</P>
    <P>I mentioned our belief that the only basis for permanent peace and stability and a harmonious relationship between Britain and Ireland is the coming together of the people of Ireland under agreed structures.  I said that we thought that progress towards this <Col N="346" /> objective would be facilitated if the British Government were to declare its interest in Irish unity and join with us in working towards that end.  The difference between us on this issue was clearly and frankly acknowledged.  In particular, we agreed that within this known framework of difference, there was scope for the fullest co-operation on political, security and economic areas.  All three are, in fact, regularly discussed at political, diplomatic and official level.</P>
    <P>I reiterated my belief in the need, in the interim, for structures of government in Northern Ireland involving power-sharing, partnership, or participation&mdash;however described&mdash;on a basis agreed by both sections of the community there.  I am satisfied that the proposals for a system of limited devolution of powers to a Northern Ireland elected body are still on the table and I indicated our support for any effort to advance these proposals on the principles I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>On the security and economic issues, we did not go into any great detail. Both of us were concerned that the meeting should look forward, rather than backwards.  I stressed the very real commitment of the Government in relation to security.  We are anxious that the existing co-operation, which is satisfactory, should continue.  This, with political and economic issues, will be among the items to be discussed at the forthcoming meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State.</P>
    <P>The meeting in Copenhagen was only the second of the European Councils I attended and I do not propose to give any general assessment of these meetings or of the role of the European Council.  Deputies may recall that I was critical of the results of these meetings in replying here to statements by my predecessor.  I regard the Copenhagen meeting as having been useful in developing personal contacts and an appreciation of the views and preoccupations of the various heads of state and government.  The meeting provided a forum for an exchange of views at the highest level on the critical problems facing the Community and the world, and on possible ways of dealing <Col N="347" /> with them: and it is in that light that increasingly its benefits will be seen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement to the House in accordance with the practice after these European Council meetings.  We are glad on this side of the House that the date of the European elections has finally been fixed.  I noted in a statement by the Taoiseach on the radio that within the range of 7 to 10 June, the most likely date for us to hold the election would be on Thursday 7 June, the midweek day, in accordance with our past practice, which would appear to be the same day as the elections are likely to be held in Britain and Northern Ireland. This party accepts that as a reasonable date.</P>
      <P>I was, however, a little surprised at his statement in this radio interview that the results of our election here would be published immediately.  Has there been a change on this point since the discussion at the European Council on 1 April 1976 when, in order to meet objections by one head of government in regard to the results of elections on later days being influenced by the publication of election results on earlier days of the proposed Thursday to Sunday span, it was agreed at that meeting that the boxes in all countries would not be opened until the close of the poll on Sunday night?  I have a record of the discussion in front of me and that was what was agreed at that time because otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not discussed. I was not cognisant of what the Deputy has just referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something which I think is not the subject of any formal decision but, in fact, as I recorded at the time, the agreement to have a span of four days was conditional on the non-publication of the results&mdash;&ldquo;not opening the boxes&rdquo; was the actual phrase used&mdash;until the Sunday night.  Perhaps it is something which the Taoiseach might wish to clarify further in consultation with his colleagues in due course.  I remember <Col N="348" /> commenting at the time, in respect of one country whose prime minister had suggested this arrangement, which seemed to me an acceptable one that his people must be very incurious if they are willing to wait from Thursday until Sunday night for the results.  I am afraid we also will have to be incurious in this respect.</P>
      <P>I note the Taoiseach's statement about a feeling that no other election should take place on the same day. Where does this feeling originate from? Has there been a decision of the Council of Ministers of the European Council on this point?  Up to the time the Government here changed I do not recall any discussion of this kind.  My feeling&mdash;I thought some of my colleagues in other countries shared it&mdash; was that there could be advantages in having other elections on the same day. In our case, very opportunely the local elections now seem likely to be due at about the same time.  There would appear to be advantages in having two rather dissimilar elections which would tend to increase the poll.  People whose interests are primarily in local matters and who would come in to vote for their local councillors, would vote also in the European elections and people with broad European interests, not terribly interested in local affairs, might vote additionally in the local elections.</P>
      <P>Is there some agreement that there shall not be two kinds of elections, or is this simply a view which the Taoiseach holds?  Will the Taoiseach clarify as soon as possible the Government's intentions in this regard?  It would seem unreasonable to postpone our local elections for a year, so as not to hold them on the same day, when there seem to be certain advantages in holding them on the same day.  I share the Taoiseach's hopes about the kind of debate that should take place on the European elections.  I hope the debate will be concerned with the broader European issues with which the European parliamentarians will be concerning themselves and that it will not be concerned too closely with narrow domestic party issues, which will not be excludable from the debate but which should not form its exclusive content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> On the declaration on democracy, I note the statement by the European Council that the principles behind the foundation of the Community and terms of the Copenhagen declaration on the European identity imply a political system of pluralist democracy.  In legal terms what force does this declaration of the European Council have?  How could such a declaration affect the juridical position of a member state which ceased to be democratic, but which resists pressures on it arising from its departure from the democratic process by threatening to veto all Community decisions thereafter, thus bringing the Community to a halt?</P>
    <P>In the discussions at Leeds Castle nine months ago this danger was adverted to; and, in referring the matter to the British permanent representatives for further discussion, one of the suggestions put forward to meet the possible juridical problems that might arise was that, if a situation arose in which one member state ceased to be a pluralist democracy, the majority of member states could refer the matter to the European Court for a decision which would have a juridical effect.  This would require an amendment to the Treaty.  Is it the case that the inclusion of this declaration on democracy in the statements at the end of this European Council meeting is designed to take the place of any such procedure and that there is no intention to take the matter any further, which would still leave the Community very vulnerable to a departure from democracy on the part of any member countries?</P>
    <P>I welcome the European Foundation. I hope it will avoid the bureaucratic influences which have infected other similar bodies and the sometimes unedifying in-fighting for jobs on a national basis regardless of the merit of the individual applicants.  The establishment of this foundation, if it follows the pattern of some previous similar bodies, could damage the cause it is intended to serve, which is to improve mutual understanding among the people of the Community and promote a better understanding of the European cultural heritage in its rich <Col N="350" /> diversity and oneness and to further a greater understanding of European integration.  Could the Taoiseach tell us if Press reports that his Government are supporting the location of this foundation in France are correct?  We are quite prepared to accept that as reasonable and desirable.</P>
    <P>I note the statement contained in the communiqué at the end of the meeting about Japan and the continuing concern expressed at the Japanese balance of payments surpluses in the context of the whole world economy.  Clearly the discussions between the Commission and Japan recently were not very successful, and the whole world faces a problem in not merely the extreme competitiveness of Japanese goods, which one might be able to accept if at the same time the Japanese market were as open to the goods of other countries as our markets are to goods from that country.  I hope that future discussions will lead to an opening up of the Japanese market in a way that will be beneficial to our exporters.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement concerning marine pollution.  I hope it will be followed through.  Hitherto this matter has not been taken seriously enough. What is disturbing about this statement is that it should be necessary at this stage to call for the implementation of existing international rules, in particular with regard to the minimum standards for the operation of ships, and that it should be necessary to call for a satisfactory functioning of the system of compulsory shipping lanes and for more effective control over vessels which do not meet these standards.  It is disturbing that we should be at the stage where not merely is it necessary to take further action to avoid the danger of pollution but where the real problem appears to lie in the fact that existing provisions are not being carried out and that there is, judging from the wording of the statement, a failure under three headings to fulfil the existing compulsory requirements and standards.  That is a matter of very great concern to us.  It is deplorable that in international relations there should be such apparent large scale failure to carry out existing obligations, <Col N="351" /> given the dangers that this carries for all countries which have coastlines that could be affected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the declaration on Namibia and trust that, despite the recent tragic assasination there, this declaration will contribute to a solution of the problem of achieving genuine independence for that country.  I also welcome the declaration on terrorism and, on behalf of my party, I join in the expression of distress at the kidnapping of Signor Moro, the murder of his escort, and in the declaration of the European Council of solidarity with the Italian people and Government.  I note that the relevant Ministers&mdash;it is not stated clearly, but I take it that they are the Ministers for Justice or the Interior&mdash;have been asked to submit as soon as possible their conclusions on what is described as the proposals before them for a European judicial area, which the Taoiseach mentioned as having been put forward in some general form by the President of France at the previous European Council meeting.</P>
    <P>Could we be informed what these proposals are?  Will the Dáil have an opportunity to debate them before a decision is taken by a future European Council or Council of Ministers?  Can the Taoiseach assure the House that these proposals conform to the terms of the European Council declaration of 13th July 1976, under which all member states undertake to prosecute or to extradite those who engage in the taking of hostages, and under which Ministers for Justice were invited to draw up a legally binding convention among the nine member states to this effect.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;to prosecute or to extradite&rdquo; were added to the original draft of that declaration on my proposal at that meeting.  They are important in view of the clear inability of the process of extradition to resolve this problem and indeed the wider problem of terrorism because of constitutional difficulties in Ireland, in France and what appear to be either political or legal difficulties in the Netherlands and Germany in recent cases.  Given that Germany has refused extradition to <Col N="352" /> Italy, that France has refused extradition to Germany, that the Netherlands has refused extradition to Germany and that France has refused extradition to Spain, it is clear that extradition does not provide a very satisfactory basis for dealing with terrorism. I wish to be assured that the proposals which are now under consideration by the Ministers for Justice or the Interior, if they are the relevant Ministers, are one which provide for this alternative without which any further convention among the Nine will be as ineffective as existing arrangements are among the wider Council of Europe group.  The system which we have instituted here, although it has not yet been used very much for one reason or another, is one which offers an assurance against the possibility of terrorists avoiding justice by moving from one state to another.</P>
    <P>In that connection I am anticipating the question under discussion with the British Prime Minister.  Has the Taoiseach been able to establish clearly from the British Prime Minister whether the absence of any application for the arrest of anybody here for a crime committed in Northern Ireland in the four years since this has been brought into effect in respect of murder and the two years since it was brought into effect for other offences of violence represents a position in which the British Government have no evidence against anybody in this State in respect of such offences committed over that period, or whether there is any other explanation of a less satisfactory character for the total absence, except in one instance, of any such application?</P>
    <P>I welcome the full support given to the United Nations Declaration on Southern Lebanon.  I hope for its early implementation in full by an effectice UN force which will take all necessary steps to stand its ground and operate effectively in the area.  This party would welcome the participation of an Irish contingent in that force. We hope that, in the weeks ahead, arrangements can be made for this.</P>
    <P>On the economic situation I note, though with a little scepticism, the <Col N="353" /> Taoiseach's reference to a renewed sense of purpose in the Community, to a process of fresh thinking, to a readiness to arouse more ambitious concepts. I welcome his reference to the Heads of Governments noting that the Government here already have discovered the secret of economic success at national level by achieving last year, and perhaps this year, the highest rate of growth in the Community and a sharp drop in inflation.  This is a very welcome tribute to the policies of the National Coalition because even the most extravagant propagandist for the Government party has not yet claimed that the new Government's policies have had any perceptible effect on last year's growth rate which I notice has now been assessed at not 5 but 6 per cent by an international organisation, the Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva.  It is very disturbing that the growth rate of the EEC last year, originally forecast at 4 per cent and during the year reduced, as a forecast, to 3½ per cent, 3 per cent, 2½ per cent and 2 per cent, is now assessed at less than 2 per cent.  It really is extremely unsatisfactory that the performance of the economies of the Community countries should fall so far short of the projected levels and that their Governments, neither jointly nor separately, seem able to take action in time to maintain anything like the target growth rate set.  It was evident throughout virtually the whole of 1977 that that target of 4 per cent&mdash;which may have been 4½ per cent originally&mdash; would not be achieved.  Yet, as the time passed, no joint action was taken, nor was action taken by certain key member states to ensure that their targets were achieved.  Therefore we have this extraordinary shortfall to a level of growth much less than half that projected originally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of doubling the European Investment Bank capital and the Community loan facility but, even with provisions of that kind, I have doubts about the growth target of 4½ per cent set for mid-1979.  First of all, I consider that growth rate too low to do anything other than stabilise unemployment throughout the Community. Secondly, I find it disturbing that the <Col N="354" /> target is set so far ahead, 15 months away, because experience has shown that if a target for growth is set a long distance away then States&mdash;which are reluctant for one reason or another to fulfil their obligations, which is a word one could reasonably use, to achieve the target growth rate&mdash;are given an excuse to do nothing for some time ahead on the grounds: &ldquo;Well, it is still not clear that we are not going to achieve that target.&rdquo;  If one sets a target 15 months ahead one will have some Governments telling one nine months hence: &ldquo;Well, it is still not quite clear that we could not achieve it.&rdquo;  Therefore there could well be a period of nine months during which no action was taken to stimulate growth when, once again, there would be a major failure to achieve the target growth rate.</P>
    <P>I note the reference in the statement from the European Council about the need to examine sharing methods as a supplement to growth policy.  I believe this may well be necessary and that growth policies, even if more effectively operated than heretofore or seems likely to be the case in the foreseeable future, do not seem capable of achieving anything like full employment in anything like the time scale that we in this country or the peoples of other Community countries expect and seek. It is good, as the Taoiseach has said, that larger countries are starting to appreciate how unacceptable is the persistence of high unemployment in the less developed regions of the Community. I agree about the need for differentiated policies as between central and peripheral areas.  The early meeting of the Council of Ministers on regional policy, which I understand the Taoiseach sought, could well prove worth while.  Certainly it is important that there should be serious discussion of this whole matter.  It is of interest not merely to this country&mdash;we are not simply pursuing a single national interest here&mdash;but indeed to a number of other countries in the Community as well as to some applicant countries. Moreover it is important, in putting forward our views on this whole subject, that we should not appear to be pressing a narrow national interest.  It is in the interest of the whole Community <Col N="355" /> that there is a convergence of the economies of member countries and it is to the disadvantage of the whole Community if this is not achieved.  Therefore, it is not simply a question of this country going with a begging bowl on its own behalf or on behalf of others.  It is a question of achieving a convergence of the economies of member states without which the existing Community arrangements could indeed at some point be endangered.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the discussions with the British Prime Minister, from the experience I had in Government, I feel that relatively frequent meetings between Ministers of our two Governments in relation to Northern Ireland are desirable.  My experience was that if the period between such meetings ran to more than say, three months, nearly always misunderstandings arose, mini-propaganda wars started, or difficulties of one kind or another emerged which could have been avoided had the meetings been more frequent.  Even if there may not be a very major content for discussion at a given point, even if there may not be a prospect of any very hard or concrete decisions emerging, frequent meetings at intervals of approximately three months are desirable if only to avoid the kind of misunderstandings and irritations that can arise in their absence.</P>
    <P>I note the Taoiseach's statement that . . . the coming together of the people of Ireland under agreed structures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and I am using his words</P>
    <P>... would be facilitated if the British Government were to declare its interest in Irish unity ....</P>
    <P>However, I wonder if the Taoiseach, in making this point, reminded the British Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Government's declaration at Sunningdale at which the word &ldquo;support&rdquo; was used in relation to the concept of Irish unity by consent, the only kind of unity which any of us seeks. It would be a pity if, by calling for a new declaration by the United Kingdom Government, we were to devalue the declaration made at that time and which was, to my knowledge, the only <Col N="356" /> such declaration involving the concept of support made by any British Government in the period from 1920 onwards.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the unnecessary and undesirable tensions between the two Governments have been alleviated; there is no future in slanging matches across the Irish Sea.  The solution to the problems of Northern Ireland will be found only by a meeting of minds between the Irish and United Kingdom Governments paralleling a future coming together of Northern Ireland political representatives who would need perhaps to reflect more accurately than they have done up to now the underlying will of the Northern Ireland people, which has been repeatedly shown in surveys of public opinion there, for a peaceful resolution of the problems of government of that area on the basis of a partnership of both sections of the community.  I am glad &mdash;I am deducing this by omission&mdash; that in his discussions with the British Prime Minister the Taoiseach did not pursue the declaration of intent to withdraw idea, the dangers of which were so cogently exposed by the Deputy Leader of the SDLP a month or two ago in an interview in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  I recognise with the Taoiseach, I think realistically, the difficulty of achieving significant movement in the political situation in Northern Ireland in the period between now and the next United Kingdom general election. I recognise our duty to contribute to progress after that election.  I feel&mdash; and I think the view is fairly widely shared&mdash;that we can make a contribution to this by clarifying now our ideas on possible future agreed arrangements for the government of the island of Ireland, an exercise which I believe, if undertaken with honesty and clarity, could dispel many of the fears of unionists in Northern Ireland which have been aroused by past, vague&mdash; and consequently to them&mdash;threatening talk on our part about unification without the implications of that being spelled out.  Therefore I think our aspirations have been misunderstood and have unintentionally contributed to the tensions in Northern Ireland which themselves have led to the violence there.</P>

      <P>I should first of all like to welcome the continued opportunity afforded to the House by the Taoiseach of discussing the Summit meeting.  I should like also to thank the Taoiseach for his courtesy in giving me a copy of his statement.  I appreciate it but, quite frankly, I appreciated it far more when I got it an hour in advance rather than seven minutes in advance. I found it more useful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>My immediate reaction to the Taoiseach's statement must be that we have heard it all before.  I intend to deal with the Summit meeting and subsequently with the meeting with Mr. Callaghan and in the same brief way that the Taoiseach dealt with it.</P>
      <P>The only positive thing that emerged from the Summit meeting was the date of the direct elections to the European Parliament.  This is disappointing.  The danger inherent in continuing these meetings at that level without any positive move being made, and this is something becoming quite apparent, is obvious.  If the meetings continue on that basis there will be serious need to reconsider the whole concept of the European Community. We welcome the decision that direct elections will take place in June 1979.  While we have absolutely no illusions about the present or likely future of the powers of the European Parliament we believe that direct elections will provide the opportunity to advance on two very important fronts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, direct elections will provide the Community with the novelty of really democratic political activity directly related to the institutions and the policy-making procedures laid down in the Treaty of Rome.  The people of the nine member states will be involved, even if initially only for the first few weeks of the election campaign next year, in the life of the Community and that will be a positive move <Col N="358" /> towards some democratic procedures in the Community.  Secondly, direct elections will mean there will be a real opportunity for political debate on the key issues which arise in connection with the past performance, the present problems and the future development of the Community.</P>
    <P>A Community with 6,000,000 out of work as a result of its slavish adherence to an economic system devoted to commerce rather than human interest requires a real political debate.  A Community where regional imbalances are increasing rather than decreasing, because of its total failure to match its policies to its greatest problems, calls for a political debate and we must look forward to that debate both here and in the Nine because we believe we have something positive and relevant to say about the issues now confronting Europe.  We also believe that in the months ahead we will see for the first time a very fundamental discussion about the future of the Community in which the main emphasis will have to be on the capacity of the Community to do something worth while as a group of nations about the problems with which it is faced.  Failure to adopt policies relevant to the scale of the problem will surely lead to serious questioning of the whole future of the EEC.  The parliament has often been called a talking shop and unless there is some meaningful action soon the other institutions of the Community will be seen in the same light and will receive the same negative public response. The European Council above all stands most in this danger.</P>
    <P>On the broad range of economic problems facing Europe, notably those of unemployment, economic growth and currency, we are told that the Copenhagen meeting is to be a preparatory one for the Bremen meeting which, in turn, will be preparatory to the world economic Summit in Bonn. All this may sound very impressive, but I wonder is it getting us anywhere so far as the problems in the Community are concerned because, while preparations go on, so also do redundancies and dole queues in the <Col N="359" /> Community.  A growth rate of 4.5 per cent is projected this year on the basis of likely policies and one has to ask is such a growth rate sufficient to make any inroads into the massive problem of unemployment.  I doubt it and, in so far as it fails, it can only add to the difficulties and the disillusionment I find to be widely growing regarding the whole EEC.</P>
    <P>I had some personal experience of the Community's approach to the unemployment problem and I must say that, sitting there in the forum used by the social partners to deal with unemployment, one began to wonder whether or not unemployment was being taken seriously at all because the only thing that seemed to come out at the other end was discussion documents. There did not seem to be any really serious attempt to tackle the very severe unemployment problem within the Community, a problem of 6,000,000 people out of work, and I believe that unless some new positive and serious initiative is taken in this regard the view our people already take of the Community will become even more negative.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to regional policy and he claimed some credit for having a sentence or two included in the report of the President.  We must face the fact that the regional policy of the Community has been, to say the least of it, extremely disappointing. It is in no way a regional policy or a social policy.  It adumbrates no prospects of employment.  It in no way lives up to the expectations raised among our people during the campaign for entry into the EEC.  The expectations raised then by the Fianna Fáil Party and others here are now seen to have been just election promises which have failed and one detects from the Government now an approach similar to the approach taken by this party then.  We are hearing now from the Government statements we made during the referendum campaign in regard to our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of protective measures to ensure the continuance of our industries, some of which are very vulnerable, Protocol 30 must be invoked and used firmly by <Col N="360" /> the Government to ensure that we give protection to these vulnerable industries because so long as the declared intentions of the Treaty of Rome to correct the economic imbalances in the Community are not seriously faced up to we must use these protective measures.  The approach initially made in regard to free trade, regarding many of the provisions which we have found to our great disadvantage from the point of view not only of increased employment but of continuing employment here were made on the basis that they were among nations that were somewhat of equal economic strength. That is not the case with us.  So far as the peripheral areas of the Community are concerned, such as Ireland, it has been a considerable disappointment.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that if we go to the Community and talk about a transfer of resources from one area within the nine countries to another area that is poorer and that needs development and growth, we are looking for a transfer of resources from the rich to the poor. If we do that internationally it does not strengthen our case when we see what the Government are doing nationally because there has not been any serious attempt by this Government to transfer resources, to have some kind of distribution of the existing wealth within the country.  As long as the Government pursue that policy of not trying to distribute equitably and fairly the existing wealth in the country it will not give us a serious voice in Europe on the question of regional policy.  It is no use in our going to Europe and saying we are entitled to get paid under the regional fund because we are a peripheral area in relation to the central part of the Common Market and we need assistance because there are 20 per cent of our own people who could be described accurately in that context as a peripheral area and the Government have done nothing to help them. It would help the Government considerably if they would practise on the national scene what they are printing on the international scene.</P>
    <P>This party would like to be associated with the Taoiseach's remarks regarding <Col N="361" /> the kidnapping of the former Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Moro, and the murder of his bodyguards.  We wish to be totally and unreservedly associated with the Taoiseach's comments on the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's meeting with the British Prime Minister, I shall be fairly brief.  I do not think it would be helpful in the national interest for me to make some of the comments that I could make on the situation that led to the strained relations that developed between the British and Irish Governments and I shall refrain from doing so.  However, I have one comment to make.  In the Taoiseach's statement he said:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proposals for a system of limited devolution of powers to a Northern Ireland elected body are still on the table ....</P>
    <P>The only comment I wish to make on that is that they have been on the table a helluva long time and it is about time the British Government picked them up.  It would not do any harm if the Taoiseach were a little more insistent on the British Government picking them up off the table and making a serious attempt to implement their policy with regard to power-sharing or partnership, or as the Taoiseach said, that would involve both communities in devolved government in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>On some occasions the Taoiseach seems to have an extraordinary understanding of the difficulties of the British Government.  On other occasions he does not have that understanding but I think this is one occasion in the interest of this country and of the lives of men and women living on this island when the Taoiseach could be a little less sympathetic with regard to the difficulties of the British Government and where he should be more insistent on the implementation by them of their own declared policy. I do not think that raising some of the political hares that he has been doing in the past is helpful in this respect. In fact, I believe this is welcomed by the British Government.  They are only too glad to chase after them if it distracts from what should be the priority&mdash;the implementation of power-sharing <Col N="362" /> by the British Government in Northern Ireland.  That is the starting point and I sincerely hope the Taoiseach will be a little more insistent with the British Government on that issue.</P>
    <P>I note that the question of British withdrawal was not mentioned by the Taoiseach when he spoke to Mr. Callaghan.  At least I assume it was not; it is not in the statement.  I can only hope that we do not have again what happened before, where he spoke to the British Prime Minister and where the question of British withdrawal was not mentioned but a week later the Taoiseach in a speech was looking for withdrawal by the British Government. If the Taoiseach wants withdrawal by the British Government and if that is the policy of his party, surely he should say that to Mr. Callaghan when he is talking to him?  I do not think it is helpful from anyone's point of view that he should meet Mr. Callaghan, not discuss an issue of major importance&mdash; whatever one's view may be of it&mdash;and subsequently in a radio interview or at a meeting of a cumann in Skibbereen to mention the matter.  That is not helpful in the circumstances that exist on this island.  I will not go any further on this point.  I am glad that normal relations have been restored.  If they are strained again I hope it will be as the result of some statement or action by the British Government rather than any contributing factor from anyone in our own country.  In the circumstances that exist it is necessary to have constant communication with the British Government. The interests of the nation as a whole cannot be best served by a strain in that relationship, particularly one that is not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally I do not think a statement like this calls for reply but there were one or two points raised by Deputy FitzGerald about the holding of the European elections and whether they should be on the same day as other elections in member countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than one member country expressed difficulty about the proximity of their statutory local elections to the proposed date of the European elections. I specifically raised the matter <Col N="363" /> whether it would be considered desirable or undesirable if the dates of such elections should coincide and the only reply I got was that it would be a matter for each member country.  I then expressed, as the Deputy pointed out, in reply to a question on a radio interview my preference for holding them on a Thursday.  I said I thought it would be better to announce the results as soon as the count was over.  I did not realise it was envisaged that the ballot boxes would remain closed until Sunday night in the event of our elections taking place on Thursday.</P>
    <P>Another point is that it is just not only one other form of election everywhere in this country that would take place because we have areas where county council elections and urban council elections are held at the same time.  I should like to give some consideration as to whether or not having a third form of election in which there would have to be separate ballot boxes would tend to confuse the issue.  It is a matter for consideration and one that I, naturally, will give more thought to.  I believe the gist of my reply on that occasion was that I would give it some thought before any decision was made.</P>

      <P>With regard to the judicial area proposed by President Giscard of France, I should like to state that the examination of the Ministers for Justice will take account of the results of the meeting of July 1976 and in particular the concept of the phrase, <i>aut dedere, aut judicare</i>, which was agreed upon then at the Deputy's suggestion.</P>
      <P>With reference to another point&mdash;I can take Deputy Cluskey's comment into consideration with this&mdash;I should like to state that it is not envisaged, even if we reach 4½ per cent growth within a 12-month or 15-month period, that that would have any impact itself on the level of unemployment.  In fact, it is believed that 4½ per cent would only maintain the level of employment at the existing level.</P>
      <P>Many different points of view were expressed and some members of the Council suggested that we should set a higher target that may not be realised. Others wanted to be more realistic and set a target that could be realised, while others did not want to set any target.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> The Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Bill, 1974, which lapsed on the dissolution of the last Dáil, contained provisions for the control of mergers, take-overs and monopolies. The need for the introduction of controls of this nature was recognised some time before the emergence of the 1974 Bill but, unfortunately, it did not prove possible to bring our proposals for such control to fruition.  I feel it is desirable to proceed with this legislation without further delay.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the proposed controls have not altered much since their inception.  Notwithstanding the depressed conditions through which industry has been, there have continued to be take-overs of industrial and commercial businesses and with the revival of the economy an increase in merger activity may be expected.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of judicious merger activity are valid and indeed weighty.  This has in fact been recognised by the Government in the Industrial Development Act, 1977, which provides a positive form of assistance to enable Irish firms to engage in planned and orderly restructuring. Such judicious mergers can achieve important economies of scale; underutilised resources can be switched to sectors where optimal use can be made to them; efficiency can be improved; sluggish management can be revitalised; rationalisation of production and marketing can be achieved.</P>
    <P>One does not, therefore, require very much convincing that merger activity can be, and indeed has been, beneficial to our economy.  I trust, therefore, that these proposals will not be viewed, as some commentators have suggested, as an inhibiting factor in the further strengthening of Irish industry, but rather will they be seen as a necessary check against the type of merger activity which is motivated by considerations other than those which achieve the effects I have referred to.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the object of some mergers can merely be the elimination of competition with possible adverse effects on productive efficiency and allocation of resources <Col N="366" /> and, ultimately, restrictions in consumer choice and higher prices to the consumer.  Other undesirable objects could be the milking of profits from a business which has built up large reserves or even the run-down of a perfectly viable industry by assetstripping. Mergers so motivated can do great harm not only to persons immediately affected but to our economy as a whole and for this reason Government controls as proposed are essential.</P>
    <P>Mergers, therefore, may be good or bad.  I believe that in our circumstances the great majority are likely to be beneficial, but the need remains to distinguish these from the minority of cases which would be positively harmful.  It is necessary to have some quick means of distinguishing the good from the bad, and I am convinced that the decision should rest with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  In view however, of the substantial powers which are thus vested in the hands of the Minister it is considered not only desirable but essential that there should be established a framework involving various checks within which the Minister must operate.</P>
    <P>The first constraint on the Minister in the exercise of his powers will of course be the criteria set out in the Schedule of the Bill in respect of which a decision on a proposal must be considered. Additionally, the Minister may not decide against a proposal unless it has been examined by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and has been the subject of an inquiry by the Restrictive Practices Commission.  In this way the Minister will be considering the matter in the full knowledge of all the facts of the proposal.</P>
    <P>Finally, and most importantly, the Minister's decision to prohibit a proposal will be by way of an order which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and must be annulled if a resolution to that effect is adopted by the Houses within 21 days of the order being laid before them.  I am satisfied that this framework allows of the most expeditious control while containing at the same time sufficient checks against arbitrary use of ministerial power.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern which <Col N="367" /> arises from the proposed controls, and to which I have referred, is the possibility of delays resulting from the procedures laid down in the Bill and the possible consequential discouragement of even the most desirable merger. I am very conscious of this danger and I have tried to frame the Bill on lines which would minimise it.  The procedures created by the Bill are to be brought into operation only where the Minister contemplates the possibility of prohibiting a proposed take-over. In other cases the machinery need not be activated at all, and it is the intention that in the majority of cases the go-ahead will in fact be given in a number of days.  In cases where an immediate go-ahead cannot be given and where the procedures set out in the Bill have to be put in motion, it will be the intention to reach a conclusion as quickly as possible. Deputies will have noted that the maximum time available for this purpose has been cut from nine months in the 1974 Bill to six months in this Bill, but I want to stress that this is a maximum time and that normally a period of three months or less should suffice even in the minority of more difficult cases.</P>
    <P>In connection with this maximum period within which the Minister may act, I should like to point out now that I will be introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to provide that where a person who is under investigation by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices seeks, by virtue of the application of section 8 (2) of the Bill, a declaration from the High Court that the investigation is not warranted, the relevant period may be extended by the period during which the request for a declaration lies before the court.  While it is accepted that such an extension could be of a substantial duration, the proposal should not cause any concern for persons who are willing to comply with reasonable requests for information in relation to a proposed merger and I have no doubt but that in the majority of cases which will be referred to the examiner for investigation the persons concerned will come within this category.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are <Col N="368" /> summarised in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated and I do not therefore intend to go into any great detail at this stage except to say something about the criteria in the Schedule to which I have already referred.  These criteria are of course of utmost importance as it is by these that proposed mergers and take-overs will be judged.  The extent to which they would be likely to restrict competition and their possible effects on the continuity of supplies and services must be considered.  As regards the latter criterion I should point out that the phrase &ldquo;supplies and services&rdquo; was originally qualified by the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; but I have deleted this qualification as being too restrictive and possibly inducive of problems of definition.  As regards employment, it will be noted that we will not be solely concerned with the effect of proposals on present employees of enterprises concerned in a proposed merger but also with the much broader aspect of the possible effect on national policy for employment.  Accord with national policy for regional development is also a matter to be considered more especially when one envisages a merger which would involve the transfer of certain resources away from a depressed area to one which was already well provided for.  Other criteria, which are for the greater part carried from the 1974 Bill, include plans for the rationalisation of the industry, improved efficiency in a number of respects and the interests of shareholders and partners in the enterprises.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have added a new criterion to the Schedule&mdash;the interests of consumers, which, while these are perhaps already catered for to varying degrees in some of the other criteria, I feel are deserving of explicit reference.</P>
    <P>In order to complete the picture in so far as mergers or take-overs are concerned, I should refer briefly to the EEC aspect.  When my predecessor addressed the House at this Stage of the 1974 Bill he referred to the EEC Commission's vigorous line in defence of competition, the various methods already available to the Commission to facilitate effective <Col N="369" /> implementation of this policy and the proposed regulation on the control of concentrations which will provide powers in relation to proposed mergers not unlike those which this Bill proposes.  Discussion on this proposed regulation, which was submitted to the EEC Council in 1973, has proved to be very protracted and, in fact, decisions have not yet been reached on matters basic to the proposal, such as the principle of premerger control, the field of application and the decision-making procedure.  However, in view of present trends in discussion relating to the scope, it appears that the regulation, when finally adopted, will affect only very large mergers, so large in fact that it is most unlikely that any proposed all-Irish merger will be affected.  It is, therefore, essential that we should, on the domestic front, supplement the measures to which we shall be party on the international front.</P>
    <P>My comments so far have been confined to the merger/take-over aspects of the Bill and, as Deputies are aware, the Bill applies also to monopolies.  The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 already provides for controls on undesirable practices of monopolistic concerns.  Under this Act the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is empowered to regulate and prohibit practices that may be engaged in but it is the general experience that statutory controls may be rendered at least partially ineffective where a particular market is dominated by one, unitary concern or undertaking.  It is, therefore, as necessary to provide powers to restore competition by breaking up monopolies as it is to preserve competition by controlling mergers and take-overs.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting, however, that all monopolies are undesirable and should be broken up.  On the contrary, in an economy the size of ours it is inevitable that there should be monopolies within the meaning of the Bill, that is to say which provide more than one-half of the goods or services of a particular kind in this country but it does not follow that these monopolies <Col N="370" /> are abusing their dominant positions.  The fact is, however, that given the existence of monopolies the possibility exists for certain undesirable market behaviour.  It would be unwise not to recognise this and to provide for remedial action where necessary.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill in relation to monopolies is to amend the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 to provide, by adding to the powers conferred by it, the power to break up a monopoly.  As with the other decision-making powers in this Bill, this power is conferred on the Minister but it is subject to control by the Houses of the Oireachtas in that any order made by the Minister under this Bill relating to a monopoly will be subject to confirmation by Act of the Oireachtas before it has the force of law.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that this Bill contained much of the Bill introduced by my predecessor.  I should now like, however, briefly to draw attention to a number of further changes contained in the present Bill and to which I have not already referred.  First, the 1974 Bill was so worded that, apparently unintentionally, a take-over of a firm below the threshold sizes set by the Bill would have been caught by the Bill in certain cases.  I have corrected this by providing that the Bill applies only where two firms&mdash;which would normally be the acquiring and the acquired firms&mdash;are above the statutory limits of size.  The Bill also provides a protection for the seller of shares who, when disposing of his shares, may not be aware that an effect of the purchase of those shares would be such that notification of the proposed sale should have been made to the Minister.  The purchaser of those shares will now be required to make good any loss incurred by the vendor by virtue of the invalidity of the sale.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the inclusion of an appeals provision which I am confident will be welcomed by Deputies.  For various reasons, however, I propose to include two qualifications to the use of this provision: the first that appeals should be on points of law and the second that there <Col N="371" /> should not be an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in this Bill can be seen as an effort to ensure that Irish business will operate in a healthy competitive environment to the betterment of the economy and not as measures designed to frustrate further business development.  I accordingly recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I must respond to the Minister's speech against the background of a certain amount of Dáil history in relation to the control of mergers, take-overs and monopolies. The Minister of State has drawn attention to the fact that the predecessor of the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy sponsored a Bill here four years ago of which the present Bill is almost a photocopy. Perhaps calling it that is not doing justice to the changes which the Minister of State has outlined but it is in large measure a copy, word for word, of what the House debated on Second Stage in 1974.  On that occasion both Government and Opposition were broadly in agreement that some measure of control of mergers, take-overs and monopolies was necessary. The then Minister, now Senator Keating, listened with interest and attention to the very non-partisan speeches made on both sides of the House and in his closing speech on Second Stage he made it clear that he was going to do some serious thinking in regard to various parts of the measure that had been discussed and some that were criticised by Members even on his own side as well as by Opposition Members at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil moved in 1974 into a period of very intense activity, as the Chair will have reason to remember better than many other people in the House.  That is certainly one reason&mdash; perhaps even the main reason&mdash; together with reasons in the Department, why the Bill made no further progress in the 20th Dáil.  At the same time it would be disingenuous if I did not say that I suspect that the degree of displeasure evinced by Irish industry and business at the main thrust of the Bill played some part&mdash;I cannot say <Col N="372" /> how great&mdash;in the delay which subsequently overtook the Bill.  Even making allowances for the enormous volume of very contentious reforming legislation and other legislation which the 20th Dáil put through after the spring of 1974, the fact that a full three years went by without that Bill making any further progress in a sense speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>While I have not discussed this Bill with either Senator Keating or any of the Deputies or former Ministers who were closely associated with the former Bill, it would be wrong if I were to pretend that a certain element of reserve and certain second thoughts had not intervened as a consequence of the very severe opposition displayed towards the Bill outside the House. That is as it should be.  The Government elected here of which Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn is an office-holder, and indeed the Government who preceded her Government, are supposed to take notice of what the public are saying.  There may be an occasion of national emergency or of severe and urgent difficulty when a Government may feel they know best and must press ahead irrespective of what leader writers and protest groups are saying, but normally it would be right for a Government to take note of what is being said.  We did so in regard to the thresholds in the wealth tax legislation and other important legislation. The Fianna Fáil Government that lost office in 1973 did so in other instances, such as the Succession Bill which became law in 1965 in a very different form from that which it originally had, and the Criminal Justice Bill of the former Deputy Ó Moráin which was completely dropped, the outcome in each case being the response to very severe pressure from the public.  That prefaces my feeling completely free to look at this Bill as though it had never appeared in the Dáil before and as though I had no allegiance of any kind to anything in it.  I worked for a Government who sponsored a very similar, almost identical Bill but who did not go ahead with it.  I feel free to assume that the degree to which the delay in the former Bill was a response to strong representations from the sections <Col N="373" /> of our industrial society who were going to be affected by it entitles me to treat this whole matter as though it were <i>tabula rasa</i> and that I am not obliged by party, Governmental solidarity or anything of that kind to say something that I do not believe or to omit to say something I do believe.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government in regard to this Bill if they have clearly made up their minds about what they are aiming to achieve and whether the abuses which are to be supposed in what the Minister for State said are really grave enough to warrant a measure as drastic as the one now before the House.  I notice that in the 1974 debate which I have in my hand here&mdash;that Bill did not get beyond the Second Stage&mdash; frequent references were made by way of example to particularly undesirable and dangerous forms of take-over, mainly the take-over of newspapers. Newspapers are important factors in our society but, as the people working in them themselves would be the first to say loudly, they have a dimension which is more than a commercial dimension.  Newspapers are a special case.  They are an organ of public opinion, or so the Constitution describes them.  It is not a very good description, but they do perform a role in the formation, reflecting and instructing of public opinion and they have a dimension which is completely beyond and over and above the commercial dimension of a brewery or a boot factory.  If the best example that anyone can think of of the sort of merger or take-over which this legislation is designed to prevent is the take-over of newspapers, let us treat that as a special case.  I will go along with that willingly.  I agree completely that it is wrong that newspapers should be concentrated in too few hands.  This is a field where the State ought to step in to prevent this undesirable concentration, and that interference in the ordinary market process can be justified by reference to the common good which is the more served the more free voices there are debating the more issues. Of course a multiplicity of free voices debating issues will tend to be diminished according as papers fall more and more under the control of fewer and fewer people.  But that is a very <Col N="374" /> special case, and if that is the fly that the Government are trying to swat&mdash; and I would support that very eagerly if that is what is in the back of the Government's mind&mdash;this Bill is far too ponderous a weapon for that job. If there are other special cases which the Government have in mind I suggest that the Government should tell the Dáil what these special cases are and whether or not there is some simpler method, one better proportioned to its target, for meeting those special cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did mention processes which are recognised to be socially wicked and undesirable.  She instanced the acquisition of one company by another merely for the purpose of realising its assets, the asset-stripping process, the consequent ruthless running down of employment, the loss of employment, the social dimension of being an employer and not playing any part in the acquiring firm's calculations and so forth.  She mentioned also the monopolistic acquiring of price dominance and of market cornering.  I agree that these are social abuses, and I hope the House will believe me when I say that I am as far left as anyone in this House could be in my willingness to control abuses of that kind.  But I question whether this is not a somewhat over-ponderous weapon for the achievement of what in a country like this are probably, in practice, rather limited aims for the moment.  We may turn into quite a different State in the next generation, but for the moment it seems to me that there is not a lot of room for complaint that the public interest is being damaged by the sort of operation which this Bill contemplates. That is one thing I would like the Government side to think about in the course of this debate.  What exactly are they getting at?  What exactly are the abuses they have in mind?  Could they make them concrete somehow so that we can see examples of what they are upset about, and could we see whether a somewhat simpler, less interfering and less ponderous method would not be a more appropriate one for doing this job?</P>
    <P>I do not acquit the Government of a degree of muddle-headedness and of <Col N="375" /> a certain element of not knowing exactly what they are about in this area, as in others.  I ask them to let the Dáil know whether the Dáil can be sure that we have not here an instance of two arms&mdash;perhaps more than two but certainly two arms of State and indeed two arms of the same Department&mdash;working against each other, not perhaps absolutely in confrontation with each other but certainly not in gear.  I look at the Bill before the House, at the Explanatory Memorandum and at the Minister's speech.  That all comes from the building across the way in Kildare Street which houses the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  That is the Department responsible for the Industrial Development Authority and, indeed, the IDA grew out of what was once a cell or section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It was the first Coalition Government who established the IDA.  That work of establishing the IDA was damned from a height by the then Deputy Seán Lemass to whom so many tributes are conventionally paid in this area.  He called the IDA which was being set up by the first Coalition Government &ldquo;a typical product of the Fine Gael mentality.&rdquo;  I am proud of that mentality if the IDA is a typical product of it.</P>
    <P>The IDA have proved themselves over the years and have proved themselves as an authority who function not in Kildare Street&mdash;I use that expression of course figuratively&mdash;but as a separate authority who look to the State for funding but operate on a day-to-day basis independently. It would not be too wrong to describe the IDA as being one the Government's arms in the field of industry and, in a sense, an arm of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, independent though it is.</P>
    <P>I noted in the March issue of the IDA News, volume 4 No. 7, page 6&mdash; I did not go looking for this, my eye fell on it as I read it in the usual way &mdash;an article entitled &ldquo;Rationalisation programme for Irish Industry&rdquo;.  If the House will allow I will read the first two paragraphs&mdash;they are not long:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> The need to encourage the rationalisation of certain sensitive sectors of Irish industry which would substantially improve the structure of the various industries has been under consideration by the Industrial Development Authority for some time.</P>
    <P>It was concluded that mergers and takeovers within these sensitive sectors would help reduce direct competition between firms, strengthen sectoral bases, secure home market sales against imports and develop export potential.  This would also bring about fewer firms with imports and develop export potential. This would also bring about fewer firms with improved management structures, more productive efficiency through economies of skills and stronger marketing.</P>
    <P>That is what the IDA is all about.  I do not know if they have been consulted about this Bill but I would like to be sure that the IDA&mdash;I will not say they are muzzled because of what such an expression implies and that authority cannot set up in competition with the Minister who provides the money&mdash;were asked about every section in this Bill and that their rationalisation programme will not be hampered by a Bill produced by the same Minister.</P>
    <P>That article refers very rightly to a Bill which we passed only a few months ago&mdash;the Industrial Development Bill, 1977.  Section 2 of that Bill has a side title &ldquo;Grants, etc. for re-structuring of industry&rdquo;.  The point of this section is as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  For the purpose of promoting the re-structuring of industry, the Authority may, in the case of the acquisition by an industrial undertaking of the whole or part of another industrial undertaking or in the case of an amalgamation between two or more industrial undertakings, in addition to the powers conferred on it by the Acts&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  make a grant, on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, towards the reduction of interest payable on a loan raised in connection with such an acquisition or amalgamation,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> (b)  guarantee the due repayment of the whole or part of the principal of any moneys (including moneys in a currency other than the currency of the State) borrowed in connection with such an acquisition or amalgamation or the payment of interest on such principal or both the repayment of the principal and the payment of such interest.</P>
    <P>Here is a situation in which with one hand the Department, represented by the Minister of State, are trying not only to facilitate mergers and take-overs, but to pay money, our money, to effectuate them and, on the other hand, we have a very drastic Bill which, in its present form and in the form produced by the National Coalition produced very severe criticism&mdash; it cannot all be selfish and dishonest criticism&mdash;from the branch of our society the Department are supposed to be there to serve.  I would like the Minister of State to tell the Dáil whether the IDA, the authority charged with our industrial development, were consulted as an authority on the necessity for this Bill in its present shape.</P>
    <P>This party will not oppose this Bill on Second Stage or in principle.  We support the broad principle of defending the people, consumers, employees and everybody else, against the effects of an abusive merger or take-over. There were some forms of mergers and take-overs which I cited and which made frequent appearances in the 1974 debate, such as take-overs of newspapers, in which a dimension of the public interest, over and above a commercial dimension, was involved.  I would be shoulder to shoulder with the present Government trying to exercise some degree of control in such cases.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the experience of hostility from industry on which we and this Government rely so heavily for the creation of employment and prosperity, my party would feel happier if that arm of our economy could be sure that legislation of this kind is running in gear with itself and that measures to facilitate monopolies and mergers&mdash; and we passed such legislation in this House three months ago&mdash;will mesh <Col N="378" /> properly and satisfactorily with whatever machinery we are now creating to control and break up mergers and monopolies.  That is a vital thing to do.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Minister of State when reading the Minister's speech did not advert to the fact that only a few short months ago we were voting to empower the IDA to spend money for doing the very thing we are now trying to put under a form of control.  The encouragement of rationalisation of industry is correct and the control of abuse of mergers is correct but I would wish these two functions to be properly geared and meshed with one another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the principle of this Bill but we will try on later Stages to improve the mechanism which this Bill seeks to apply to mergers and take-overs.  I want to make a few general observations.  It will be on these observations, apart from trying to marry these two legislative measures better, that our amendments will be based.</P>
      <P>The first observation I want to make, and this was implicit in something the Minister said, is that the scale of Irish business is very small.  The scale of everything in this country is very small.  When I hear people talk about wealth&mdash;I think the Government were criminally foolish in proposing to abolish the wealth tax&mdash;and violent attacks being made on wealth by commentators or politicians, I wonder if they have any conception of how little wealth there is in Ireland by comparison with how that word is understood elsewhere.  The same goes in regard to the scale of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no business which ranks within the top 500 businesses in Europe.  In other words, a list of the 500 largest enterprises in Europe will <Col N="379" /> not contain one single Irish enterprise. That point needs to be noticed, and, parallel with that is the fact that since Irish industry is small and in many ways vulnerable it needs a firm home market and home base but in order to give it the maximum capability and to get the maximum good from its home-market base it may require rationalisation of the kind that this Bill is designed to control.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with the Confederation of Irish Industry that the thresholds proposed in this Bill and <i>a fortiori</i> those proposed in the other Bill&mdash;although the difference could be explained partly by inflation and by the effect of the lapse of four years&mdash; over which control is to be exercised are too low.  The Confederation of Irish Industry estimate that the thresholds at present levels might affect as many as 1,000 businesses.  Of course there are businesses that are in a situation of near monopoly and whose operations would obviously affect the consumer. These businesses are so big that anything in the nature of a running down of employment would mean a heavy loss of jobs.  However, businesses here are not big by European standards and any measure or net that will catch the top 1,000 Irish businesses will involve relatively small concerns.  It is proposed that a business and the enterprise proposed to be acquired will be caught if the turnover is not less than £2.5 million.  It is not necessary to stress that turnover is not the same as profit.  The profit of a concern may be only a tiny percentage of the turn-over.</P>
    <P>I should not be surprised to learn that there are publichouses, especially some of those vast concerns in the city suburbs that have seating for up to 2,000 people, in respect of which the turnover is approaching the figure proposed for the threshold.  I cannot be sure about that but I expect that some of those concerns have turnovers approaching that figure.  Certainly, that will be the situation if inflation continues during the next few years even at its improved rate.  I wonder whether we ought to be thinking in terms of operating control of this kind on concerns <Col N="380" /> which are not really of national significance or even of very great local significance when measured against a turnover of that dimension.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by the CII, and one which was raised here in 1974 during the debate on the last Bill, is the delay which the operations of the examiner, possibly of the Restrictive Practices Commission, may involve. The maximum delay has been reduced in this Bill from nine to six months. That is still a long delay and I shall be endeavouring to persuade the Government to make further economies in their time arrangements in this regard.</P>
    <P>A further problem I have with the Bill although I can see that an almost similar problem existed with the previous Bill, arises from the criteria in the Schedule.  These are criteria for the purposes of sections 7 (b) and 9 (2), the sections on which the merger or take-over is to be either permitted or forbidden.  It seems that a couple of these criteria may be mutually exclusive.  I understand and appreciate that very often a government must deal with a problem in which it must have regard to two different values which are in conflict.  Consequently, a government must effect a balance between the two.  However, there should not be presented blandly in a Bill criteria which are a potential conflict without saying how this conflict is to be resolved.  To illustrate my point I shall read the paragraphs concerned.  Paragraph (c) reads:</P>
    <P>The extent to which the proposed merger or take-over would be likely to affect employment and would be compatible with national policy in relation to employment.</P>
    <P>That is a value or an objective that we all support.  We are all keen on keeping down unemployment and on trying to reduce it.  Any government criterion that is directed towards protecting employment is good but we must ask how the criterion in paragraph (c) assorts with the criteria in paragraphs (e) and (f).  Paragraph (e) reads:</P>
    <P>The extent to which the proposed merger or take-over is in harmony with the policy of the Government <Col N="381" /> relating to the rationalisation, in the interests of greater efficiency, of operations in the industry or business concerned.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) reads:</P>
    <P>Any benefits likely to be derived from the proposed take-over or merger and relating to research and development, technical efficiency, increased production, efficient distribution of products and access to markets</P>
    <P>These are all very well but rationalisation is very often a euphemism for laying off people, for making a machine do the work done formerly by a man or perhaps by two men or even by ten men.  It is a euphemism frequently for trying to get more production from fewer people.  It is a method for paying wages to fewer people, keeping costs down in that way.  The same can be said in regard to the matter mentioned in paragraph (f).</P>
    <P>A government operating any kind of policy must weigh up the advantages against the disadvantages in order to strike balances but in regard to this Bill which will be read thoroughly by business people I can hear them asking what kind of Department are running this aspect of government when they try to tell the business community how to run their concerns while the criteria <i>pari passu</i> is giving preference to one over another and are so blatantly in potential conflict.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to imply that these criteria are totally of this Government's making.  A similar situation existed in the former Bill.  Regarding the other criteria there is a presupposition of the existence of things that do not exist and that, too, will be a bone that will stick in the business throat and will convince people that the Government and the Department do not know what they are at.  The criteria in paragraph (d) reads:</P>
    <P>The extent to which the proposed merger or take-over is in accordance with national policy for regional development.</P>
    <P>Where is the national policy for regional development?  Have we got such a policy?  The Minister made <Col N="382" /> reference to run-down areas of the country.  What is a run-down area of the country?  Would it be Leitrim or Dublin, for instance?</P>
    <P>I hear nowadays that priority must be given to concentrating more on employment in Dublin, not because Dublin is shorter of amenities or is more poverty stricken than Leitrim but because it has a far worse unemployment problem and one which has social dimensions.  There are urban problems of all kinds of which unemployment is the greatest possible aggravator.  If I were a businessman contemplating a merger or permitting myself to be taken over I should look at this Bill and ask myself about all the talk of national policy for regional development. Can I buy a copy of that policy in the Government Publications Office? Is it in print?  How can I discover by looking at the Minister's speech whether I am in a run-down part of the country?  Is it Dublin, which we now understand is to be the target for maximum employment effort, or is it Leitrim, which is, as it was in our grandparents' time, the poorest and most underdeveloped county?  I should like to know which it is.  My livelihood would be at stake.  It is all very fine for a Minister or a journalist simply to note that we have an eye on regional development but we have not a regional development policy.  If we have, I am not aware of it.  If it is there at all it changes from day to day and from year to year.  I would be resentful if my lawful business, in which I did not have to tip my cap to anyone, were to be subjected to a policy of regional development which did not exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to &ldquo;the interests of the shareholders and partners in the enterprises involved&rdquo;.  Since when is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy an expert on the interests of shareholders?  Has he staff capable of advising shareholders where their interests lie?  That is the kind of empty pretentiousness which, if I were a businessman, I would find enraging, as though there were not already legal and professional mechanisms for protecting shareholders and their interests.  Where is the expertise <Col N="383" /> which will be at the disposal of the Minister for taking a particular view as to interests of shareholders?  Is that expertise superior to the expertise which the law already provides in that regard?  These things were in the former Bill as well and if that Bill had gone through I hope they would have taken a hammering from some side of the House along the lines I have adopted here.</P>
    <P>A further problem with the Bill is a point to which the CII draw attention. I interrupt what I am saying to venture a guess that the first part of the Minister's speech was hastily rewritten yesterday or today in order to take account of the submissions of the CII.  The Government are quite right to pay attention to what the CII say.  My evidence is that this part of the Minister's script seems to have been typed by a different typist, as several clues show, and there is a strongly defensive note which is absent from the latter part of the speech.  In their submission on this Bill the CII state:</P>
    <P>However, it should be noted that Irish legislation cannot control direct sales of a firm from outside the State on the Irish market if the firm does not have an establishment in Ireland.  The Bill would, therefore, control providers of goods and services with an establishment in Ireland but can have no control over external companies which sell on the Irish market without going through an Irish establishment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use violent language but if the CII are right&mdash;and they seem at first blush to be so&mdash;the Bill will have a discriminatory effect not against outside enterprises but against our own enterprises.</P>
    <P>I am not very keen on the provision in section 2 (5) (a).  This occurs in a section which is laying down money thresholds above which control will operate and, by implication, below which control will not operate. It is being represented to the Dáil that anything with a turnover of less than £2.5 million or with assets under £1.25 million will not be <Col N="384" /> affected.  Section 2 (5) (a) states:</P>
    <P>Where he is of opinion that the exigencies of the common good so warrant, the Minister may by order declare that, notwithstanding subsection (1), this Act shall apply to a proposed merger or take-over of a particular class specified in the order and, upon the making of such an order, this Act shall apply to a proposed merger or take-over of that class.</P>
    <P>Note the phrase &ldquo;exigencies of the common good&rdquo; dragged from the entrails of Article 43 of the Constitution. That means that the Minister does not have to pay any attention to the thresholds mentioned in subsection (1).  If he makes an order it will have to come before each House of the Oireachtas and an affirmative resolution will have to be passed.</P>

    <P>The note on which I want to end is one of puzzlement.  I cannot understand exactly where this Government are going in relation to the private sector and private enterprise.  The National Coalition Government, who went through a most appalling period of recession on stage, with the IRA off stage, were considered, wrongly, to be in the grip of unnamed and unidentified left-wing ideologists.  I do not know where the idea came from and it may be that by faulty public relations we helped it.  They were certainly not Labour members of the Government or Labour Deputies.  We paid the political penalty for allowing that idea to spread and not effectively countering it and I make no complaint about that.  The concomitant effect was that the party which beat us was supposed to be the businessman's friend. They demonstrated that by an act of criminal political foolishness in proposing <Col N="385" /> the abolition of the wealth tax in the budget.  There were other measures of which I strongly approved designed to help industry.  They were not spectacular and were of the kind which Deputy Richie Ryan had adopted in his 1977 budget.  A couple of spectacular moves of that kind, the most spectacular being the abolition of wealth tax, entrenched the Government in the minds of commentators and the public as the friend of wealth, the friend of &ldquo;let it rip free&rdquo; enterprise. I considered that their action in regard to wealth tax was extremely foolish and wrong.  Though I cannot prove it, I believe their action in that regard probably added a point or a couple of points to the figure achieved in the National Pay Agreement, a very high price indeed to pay in jobs for the abolition of the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>In a concerted series of speeches&mdash; I have never seen them so well orchestrated&mdash;by Ministers from the Taoiseach down, private enterprise were told the ball is now in their court, that the Government had, as indeed they had, bent over backwards to make life easy for them; that the Government had, as indeed they had, showered benefits on them of a kind previously unimagined, and that it was now up to them.  The voices over the weeks and months became shriller and shriller and the demands on the private sector became more and more specific. They were told they were the ones to create the jobs.  Now we are getting the reaction.  In the past week the chairman of a company which curiously are themselves the product of the most spectacular take-over or merger we have ever had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy relate this to the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if you would allow me to go into a broader piece of water.  I want to relate the Bill, if I can, because I think it is the product of muddle-headedness on the part of the Government, to the Government's general strategy in regard to the private sector.  The private sector are beginning to resent&mdash;this is clear from the statement of the chairman of Cement&mdash;Roadstone Holdings having <Col N="386" /> the baby pushed into their arms.  They are quite happy to hold on to the benefits the Government offered them but they resent being made the job-makers, the whipping boys, as the chairman of that company described them, if the jobs do not materialise. And the jobs are not materialising.</P>
      <P>The job figures published this morning show that between the end of March 1977 and March 1978, the year-on-year improvement, in spite of the world upturn and the expansionary 1977 budget of Richie Ryan and the expansionary measures which this Government have undertaken and for which they have claimed miraculous results, is 4,900-odd.  A month ago it was nearly 6,000, still very far from the Government's target.  Ministers bellowed that figure truculently across the floor of the House.  The figure is now 4,900 and I do not know what it will be next week or the week after. I know, though, that the private sector are getting worried about the tone of Ministerial speeches pushing, as the Germans say, into their shoes the responsibility for job creation.  The Cement Roadstone chairman asks what about the agricultural sector, the service sector, where are their responsibilities, why are they not being lectured in the same tone as private enterprise?</P>
      <P>It shows a pitiable simplicity on the Government's part if they seriously imagine that flesh and blood, particularly flesh and blood that has been through the furnace of the business world and therefore a good deal tougher than yours or mine, will feel a lively sense of moral obligation to take on more workers than a businessman needs, and therefore to increase his operating costs, make his goods less competitive and cut his profits as a gesture of thanks to Deputy Colley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for having abolished the wealth tax.  If the Government think the private sector will reward the Government by creating a lot of jobs which they would not otherwise have created, which their business instincts <Col N="387" /> would have told them they should not create, they are making a big mistake, and I will not be sorry for the Government when they are found out, because there was not a world at the time of the election about this responsibility of the private sector: it was simply a question of returning that party to office and, as the manifesto had it, there were tens of thousands of secure jobs waiting to be created by the exploitation of our natural resources and by other means which the silly, musty old Government which I worked for were too stupid to see.  That is the message that put us out of office and I will not be a bit sorry when that bird comes home to roost.</P>
      <P>Where are the Government going in their relations with the private sector? They flattered private enterprise and poured benefits on them on 1 February. Since then there has been a crescendo of demands on them to create jobs which they otherwise would not do. There is no one better than a businessman to decide for himself.  There is none in the Minister's Department who is better able to know than he when he needs an extra pair of hands, and the idea that he will create what otherwise would be unnecessary jobs to please any Government, even though the businessman may be a Fianna Fáil supporter, is insane, and a Government who base their strategy on that expectation are soft in the head.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Government still hold themselves out as being the businessman's friend, the supporter of the private sector and so forth.  What will the private sector say, if this Bill leaves the House in its present condition, when it is hung around their necks as well as the responsibility to provide jobs?  Though we support the Bill in its broad object of defeating abusive and undesirable mergers and take-overs, its operation may be the opposite to being conducive to employment and industrial expansion.  The world of business will feel that this is a puzzling, unexpected and unwelcome extra burden to thrust on them at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go back over what I have said, but I will briefly summarise <Col N="388" /> the last part of it.  The main social, political, economic target of this Government and of the Government which went before them is the reduction of unemployment to a figure which would reflect a situation of full employment.  That campaign does not seem to have worked.  We said it could not be done in the way this Government propose to go about it.  The private sector are being saddled more and more shrilly every day with the responsibility to do the job which the Government thought they could do themselves.  The Minister opposite has flown the emigration kite as a solution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat all this stuff.  I will conclude by saying that the Bill, though we support the general idea of controlling abusive mergers, will require amendment in order to make it mesh and gear properly with the Government's other proposals in regard to assisting rather than hampering fresh business rationalisation.  The Bill will also require explanation from the point of view of letting the Dáil know where exactly the Government are going in regard to the private sector.  I am puzzled about where they are going in this regard and I will be very surprised if they do not end up making the business community, among other sectors, wish that the National Coalition were in office again.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party support the Bill.  Apart from some adjustments on inflation grounds and some detail adjustments here and there, the Bill for all practical purposes is the same as that introduced by Deputy Keating in 1974.  Indeed we regret the measure was not enacted in 1974.  It can be argued that that was an appropriate time because then we were in a recession period, in some ways the best time to bring in legislation of that nature because it would have anticipated economic recovery and would have seen that the fruits of economic recovery were not syphoned off by some individuals who would avail of economic recovery to indulge in concentrations which would not be in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> That is water under the bridge.  The enactment of this legislation reminds me of previous legislation enacted when a former Inter-party or Coalition Government were thrown out of office. I recall the health legislation which brought down the wrath of God, through the Irish Catholic hierarchy, on the head of the Minister because, they said, the legislation would destroy every cultural and spiritual value the Irish people had.  At that time the Government lost control of the situation. The Minister also lost control of what he was doing and the Government found themselves out on the street.  Within six months of coming back, the Fianna Fáil Party had similar legislation enacted.  They cleared the way.  A couple of visits to Armagh and the legislation was on the Statute Book.  They did it with a great sense of enjoyment, and with a great sense of politics, working from the seat of their trousers, they managed to pass it through with the degree of blandness for which they are renowned.</P>
    <P>We have a situation here where the CII poured scorn on the Coalition goose in 1974 and it is now a very muted piece of scorn that they are pouring on the Fianna Fáil gander, if I may put it that way.  We only got a reaction yesterday from the CII.  With a bit of scurrying around they dug up their objections to the Bill in 1974. I only got the document today and Deputy Kelly may well have only got it today also, and there was a hurried response from the Department, as we can see.</P>
    <P>The criticisms are rather muted from the CII.  I think they are for the record rather than having it said that when the Coalition were in power they adopted a particular stance.  I think they adopted an ideological stance.  They were suspicious of Senator Justin Keating's efforts in that regard. Apparently, they are now in a more muted political frame of mind.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, it does appear that the legislation will go through.  I asked the former Minister why in the name of God it did not go through in 1974-75.  Apart from indicating that there was considerable legislative pressure <Col N="390" /> of work at the time, particularly in relation to natural resources, which required a great deal of attention from the Minister, together with the oil crisis, nevertheless I still have the impression that the Cabinet of the day decided it did not wish to allegedly exacerbate the situation in view of the economic recession.  As a result they deferred the enactment of the legislation. That was not a wise policy because right through that period there were successive criticisms of the Government for having deferred the legislation. We knew it would have to eventually reappear.  I am glad it has reappeared and I wish it a speedy enactment.</P>
    <P>In approaching legislation of this nature one of the difficulties is the dearth of up-to-date information on mergers and take-overs.  There is a degree of information available in relation to take-overs but in relation to monopolies there is a dearth of information. As a former trade union official I recall the contacts I had at the time with the Committee on Industrial Organisation and subsequently the Committee on Industrial Progress.  In the early sixties and in the mid-sixties there was a great deal of information available to us in a general political sense and that information was invaluable. From the old CIO reports one could get a reasonable picture of the degree of concentration in each sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>There is still a great need for further information.  I refer in particular to the recently published report of the Restrictive Practices Commission, which is the report of studies into industrial concentration and mergers in Ireland.  It is document 5601.  I would refer to one recommendation of the commission because it is of considerable importance.  While the report has now been published, I would point out that the recommendation was made as far back as 18 September 1975.  At page 38 of the report, Chairman John Walsh and members Patrick Lyons and Charles McCarthy said:</P>
    <P>A more comprehensive study of concentration, especially in a manner which is quantifiable, must await more detailed statistical information <Col N="391" /> classified on the basis of enterprises. More immediately, however, bearing in mind some of the provisions of the proposed legislation to control mergers, take-overs and monopolies, there is need to study closely those sections of Irish industry where concentration is already high, or where it is increasing at a rapid pace, especially when this is the result of merger activity.  Care must be taken to ensure that adequate powers are given to the appropriate authorities to obtain the necessary information to assist their investigations. A major problem in undertaking a study of this nature is the reluctance or indeed the refusal of firms to furnish information essential for the exercise.  This would be more likely to happen where the information sought might be regarded as confidential or where it might not be readily available.</P>
    <P>The statement goes on to suggest that section 12 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, should be used to require firms to furnish the relevant information where it is available.</P>
    <P>That form of recommendation is of crucial importance to the State in any effective monitoring or any effective enactment of the legislation.  It is undoubtedly fair to say that in the 1974 to 1976 period there were a number of take-overs in industries and services. There were a number of mergers in industries where, quite frankly, if we had had that legislation the State would have been able to take a sharper look at some of the practices at that time. We did have a period during which a number of shell holding companies of a dubious nature indulged in practices which did not appear to be open to effective public scrutiny.  We as parliamentarians would have legitimate reservations about the practices which were indulged in at that time.  A number of these companies have gone out of business or have ceased such practices; but it is a pity that that legislation was not available at that time to prevent some of the worst redundancies and traumatic experiences which the workers in those firms were obliged to undergo during that period.  If that <Col N="392" /> kind of legislation had been in operation then some of the disastrous effects of the so-called rationalisations would have been prevented.</P>
    <P>In so far as I have had an opportunity of considering it in any detail, I have taken account of the submission of the CII in my reaction to this Bill.  One of the plausible and comprehensive arguments from the CII in their general reaction to the Bill is that the scale of Irish industry is small.  One could list on two pages of foolscap our top 60 firms.  However, that is not an argument for not having legislation of that kind, which is the crucial point.  It is true and objective to say, as the CII suggest, that none of these Irish firms in the private sector would rank in the top 500 firms in Europe.</P>
    <P>However, one can have a situation, even in a relatively small scale economy such as ours, where, in relation to a single product a small Irish company can have total control over the production outlet and can exert over a short period a massive control over the market.  It appears for a while in relation to supermarket sales that a couple of groupings were about to emerge totally controlling the major wholesale and retail outlets of the country.  The retail margins here are fairly tight and one would want to have one's head examined to be unduly speculative in looking for prospects to make a great deal of money in the retail business today.</P>
    <P>I believe the undesirable concentrations which develop in any country should be mitigated to some extent by this Bill.  I do not accept that because it is inherent in the initial preamble of the CII submission that because Irish industry is on a small scale that <i>per se</i> there is no need for this Bill.  One can be a very wealthy individual in a small economy by virtually having a monopolistic or total take-over control of a situation.  I believe the criteria laid down by the Minister of State in the Bill are quite appropriate.</P>
    <P>I can see a certain validity in the argument of the CII that many foreign firms can come into the Irish market, need not necessarily establish an Irish <Col N="393" /> base and can proceed on a very substantial degree of monopoly intrusion into the Irish market.  They are exempted from the rigours of the Bill.  This is a matter of concern and is an area within the context of our involvement in the European Community and bearing in mind the very strict limitations of action on our part in that area which is a considerable concern.</P>
    <P>There is a daunting prospect facing us in the next five or ten years because we could become a little dumping depot on the periphery of Europe whereby some of the major multinationals would not regard the market in the whole of this country as being worth their while to set up a general manufacturing plant. Many of them may adopt a simplistic attitude of simply having, in relation to a wide range of products, half-a-dozen depots spread throughout the country and would withdraw from any interests in manufacturing.  The Government should keep this aspect of the matter under very constant review.</P>
    <P>Competition from the major foreign firms will intensify.  I feel that the current degree of substitution for domestic products is a cause of very considerable concern.  That particular preoccupation of the CII in the submission they made to the Government and the Opposition should be of concern to all of us.  I do not accept the other objections of the CII in relation to the Bill.  I believe the turn-over criteria are fair and reasonable.  I also believe the asset criterion is reasonably fair on the part of the Government as well as the criterion in relation to market share.</P>
    <P>I believe those criteria have been well examined by successive Ministers. We have had a long gestation period of looking at this Bill.  It has remained in its pristine glory from 1974 on and it has become a saga in terms of legislative enactment.  It is about time we sent off the vellum copy to the President for his signature.</P>
    <P>It might be worth while looking at certain areas of the Bill during Committee Stage.  I find the general principles of the Bill acceptable.  Deputy Kelly criticised the appraisal criteria in the Schedule.  It is wise in matters <Col N="394" /> like this to have those criteria as broadly based as possible.  If we take the criterion which he subjected to particular criticism and which is a bit of legislative curiosity in any Bill today, in relation to national policy for regional development, it may bring a laugh now, as it did in relation to the previous Administration, but it is the national desire that we should have an effective policy for regional development. If there was a major firm in the west giving massive employment in a particular region and if that firm were involved in a take-over or merger situation it might well be that within the context of regional economic development the Government, using that criterion, should carefully examine the situation.</P>
    <P>There are several firms throughout the country who employ a few thousand people in concentrated regional areas.  Any major disturbance of employment or mergers in one particular area can be catastrophic for that small area, even if only 500 or 600 people are employed.  It is wise to build that kind of criterion into legislation even though the CII might say that national policy for regional development is a lot of hoohah since there is no national policy.  That is no excuse for the Government of the day not trying to have such a policy.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the reactions I have to the Bill.  I do not accept the other criticism which was levied against the Bill that the criteria should have nothing to do with the specific protection of shareholders.  I saw some queer happenings in Irish shareholdings during 1975, 1976 and 1977.  Some people shifted their money to the Channel Islands and to other tax havens.  There was a short sharp period in Irish development which was quite disastrous for Irish manufacturing industry and for the services sector, but there was no protection for shareholders.  Some people sitting in new, well-carpeted office blocks in Dublin did not care a twopenny curse about the future of the shareholders in the companies.  It is entirely appropriate that reference should be made in the general criteria of the Schedule to the rights and to the protection <Col N="395" /> of shareholders.  The Minister and the Department have as much right to defend shareholders in the national interest as a crowd of shareholders careering off to the High Courts.  Some of them have been hanging about the High Courts over the past few years like bluebottles. They have been trying to protect their money&mdash;usually after the birds have flown.  For the CII to suggest that this is a matter of company law, that it is purely a matter for the barristers and solicitors of the day, is wrong.  It is not just a question of company law. It is not even a matter entirely for the Stock Exchange or a matter entirely for a code of conduct.  These criteria should be there, but the State has certain entitlements on behalf of certain citizens.</P>
    <P>There are other criteria to which there was some objection.  I am amazed that it should come from the CII.  They were critical about the inclusion of the extent to which the proposed merger or take-over would be likely to affect employment or would be compatible with national policy in regard to employment. There is a suggestion from the CII that that criterion is catered for in a protective sense in existing redundancy legislation and in proposed EEC legislation relating to the rights of workers.  We all know that redundancy legislation is retrospective following the termination of employment. The purpose of this Bill is to hold out some prospect of controlling a prospective development which would, in effect, lessen the prospect of redundancy.  Redundancy legislation simply means that the worker loses his job and gets compensation. In this case it is a question of keeping the horse in a productive stable for the time being by the State moving in.  I do not accept the CII's criticism.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that in some respects they are going through the motions. To use the current Dublin phrase, they went &ldquo;bananas&rdquo; when they saw Justin Keating bringing this in after being in office for a couple of months. The CII thought that they had a <Col N="396" /> raving red ideological lunatic on their hands.  It was bad enough to have Richie Ryan, but Keating on top of it was just too much for them, and they decided to scuttle the whole operation. They were successful.  We now have a bland, almost non-political party in office, there is no problem and the Bill will go through.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  It will be law in due course, perhaps with some minor amendments.  We may have to have a look at a later stage at some of the areas outlined.  It is essential that the Bill should have a reasonably speedy enactment.  We have a number of Senators, such as Senator Alexis FitzGerald, who are very competent. I would love to hear Senator Fitz-Gerald's views on this Bill.</P>

      <P>One would have thought that the Bill was in hospital, listening to Deputy Desmond wishing it a speedy recovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputies Kelly and Desmond for their contributions.  Deputy Kelly gave the Bill a qualified welcome and Deputy Desmond gave it an apposite welcome.  A number of the points raised by Deputy Kelly can be discussed on Committee Stage, but I will deal with some of them now. Deputy Kelly felt this Bill was a case of two arms of the Government working in opposite directions.  Deputy Kelly was talking about the IDA, which in the <i>IDA News</i> for March issued a statement in which they set out the advantages of mergers and take-overs in Irish industry.  Deputy Kelly felt that this Bill may not coincide with the IDA views and questioned <Col N="397" /> whether or not the IDA had been invited to give their views on the Bill.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Kelly and the House that there is no conflict between the IDA and this Bill.  As I stated in my Second Stage speech, in the circumstances of Irish industry most mergers and take-overs are desirable but a minority can be harmful and undesirable. We want the type of machinery that will enable us to deal properly with each type as it arises.  As Deputy Kelly pointed out, and as I pointed out in my opening speech, the IDA already have machinery for promoting desirable mergers and take-overs and their powers were strengthened in this regard last year in the Industrial Development Act, 1977.  This Bill constitutes the machinery for dealing with undesirable mergers and take-overs.  I cannot follow the logic of saying that because we have machinery for dealing with one type of merger or take-over we should not have machinery for dealing with the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Minister for a moment, if she will allow me?  I just want to say this: the 1977 Industrial Development Act does not give the IDA any discretion to decide which is and which is not a desirable merger.  It does not give them any function in the matter at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat and listened very patiently to Deputy Kelly and I will expect him to do the same. There is no realistic possibility of any conflict between the two sets of machinery. <Col N="398" /> It is very safe to prophesy at this stage that any merger or take-over engineered or supported by the IDA will receive very rapid assent indeed from any Minister of the day whether on this or that side of the House.  The Deputy asked also whether the IDA had been given an opportunity of commenting on the text of the Bill.  They were not.  I will give the reason: Deputy Kelly is one who stands up at all times for the dignity of this House and talks a lot about breaches of parliamentary privilege if they occur.  This is why the IDA were not consulted or given an opportunity of commenting on this Bill because, of course, it would be a breach of parliamentary privilege to release to them the text of a Bill before it had been circulated to Deputies here.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly points out, this Bill is not very different from the 1974 one.  This Bill has been before them since 1974 and is virtually the same in all major respects.  Therefore, they have had that length of time to make their comments known.  I am sure that if there were provisions that concerned them, when the present Minister announced his decision to reintroduce this Bill, they would have given their comments and made their concern known.  In fact, they have had no criticism to offer of the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly criticised a number of the criteria contained in the Schedule. He said that a conflict may arise between certain criteria laid down.  Of course, there may well be a conflict, in which case the Minister has to weigh up the pros and cons and decide.  I am sure any Minister would act in the best interests of all of us because, after all, he is the person responsible at the end of the day and, if the people are not satisfied with him, they can throw him out of office.  For instance, in connection with criterion (g), Deputy Kelly protests that shareholders in a firm do not need a Government Department to tell them what are their interests.  We all fully agree with that.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no intention in the Bill to do anything of the sort or to interfere with shareholders in any way. In the normal way I would expect that shareholders' interests would be expressed <Col N="399" /> by themselves, whether in general meeting or by their board of directors on their behalf.  But, if it is so expressed, then it is only fair to provide that it should be given weight along with the interests of all other people, all other groups, workers and consumers obliged to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is quite wrong to read this criterion as merely a ground on which a proposed take-over may be prohibited.  In fact, in the case of criterion (g) it may be a reason why the criterion should be allowed go ahead.  There are nine criteria in all, some of which may point in a particular case to prohibition, while others may point to gift permission. It will be the Minister's responsibility to weigh up the net advantages or disadvantages and to act accordingly.  If criterion (g) were to be omitted the Minister would be debarred from taking into account the interests of shareholders&mdash;I would remind Deputy Kelly&mdash;who might stand to gain quite handsomely from the terms of a take-over bid.  It would be unfair that regard should not be had to the interests of shareholders as well as to those of others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also thought there was some clash between criterion (c)&mdash; the protection of employment&mdash;and criterion (f)&mdash;the promotion of rationalisation. Rationalisation and generally the promotion of efficiency are absolutely essential in the long-term protection of employment.  In the short term it is true to say that a certain number of people may be made redundant.  It may lead to limited unemployment but, in the long run, there will be massive unemployment unless Irish industry is allowed to increase and maintain its efficiency.  It will be a matter of taking an overall view of all of the criteria together in coming to a decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred also to criterion (d) relating to the national policy for regional development. Deputy B. Desmond answered that objection so well it is unnecessary for me to do so at all.  In his remarks Deputy Desmond referred to the Restrictive Practices Commission's report on take-overs and their recommendation <Col N="400" /> that, in undertaking surveys under section 12 of the 1972 Act, they should have power to require firms to supply information.  The question of the amendment of the 1972 Act in regard to this problem, which he and others have raised, is under consideration at present but I do not think it arises under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have not covered all of the points raised by Deputies Kelly and B. Desmond this evening.  Very many of them were specific points which could be raised better on Committee Stage. I would re-echo what Deputy Desmond said&mdash;seeing that Fianna Fáil took the initiative in reintroducing this Bill so quickly after their return to office, we hope it gets a speedy passage through the House, or a speedy recovery as Deputy Desmond said.  I am sure neither Deputy Kelly nor Deputy Desmond would wish to delay it unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke about the 1974 Bill and said this was almost a replica of what was sponsored by at least one of the parties in Government at that time.  He made a statement in the course of his remarks which was, to say the least of it, suspicious, when he said he felt free now to treat the Bill as it had never been in the House before.  He said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>We supported the broad principle of the Bill when in Government.</P>
    <P>I wondered if the reason for the delay or interruption of the Bill was not, as he said, because of opposition from outside the Houses of the Oireachtas but rather from opposition from within the Houses of the Oireachtas, in fact within the parties in Government. I offer that as perhaps one explanation of why the 1974 Bill was not enacted during the period in office of the previous Government.  However, that is beside the point; let bygones be bygones. I hope this Bill will be got through as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P>In page 9, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where a lessor of land which is held subject to a lease tenancy or interest to which this Part of the Act applies intends to dispose of his interest in said land for valuable consideration such disposal shall be void unless such lessor can show&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that he has given at least one month's notice in writing of the intention to dispose of his interest to the person entitled under this Part of the Act to purchase same, and</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Keeffe).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned we were discussing amendment No. 5 designed to add to section <Col N="402" /> 16 a provision whereby a lessor of land held subject to a lease, tenancy or interest intended to dispose of his interest for valuable consideration.  In such circumstances such disposal would be voided unless he gave one month's notice in writing of his intention to the person entitled to purchase and such person failed within the said period of one month to serve notice of his intention to purchase. One of the major frustrations suffered by ground rent householders arises when they discover the freehold interest has been sold over their heads and the purpose of this amendment was to impose a restriction on such a sale.  Through this amendment the tenant would be given an opportunity of purchasing.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that this proviso would be unconstitutional.  It would not be unconstitutional.  It would rather be a considerable boost and encouragement to the whole process of sale to ground rent tenants.  I read the comments of the Minister.  He seemed to think that this amendment would prohibit the landlord selling his interest except to the tenant or with the consent of the tenant.  I want to emphasise that this is not the case.  The amendment would impose a temporary bar on the sale until such time as the tenant had been given an opportunity to exercise his right.  The tenant would have an option.  He had an option even before this and the intention is to encourage householders to exercise their rights by having it brought to their attention that they have these rights and are entitled to exercise them.  I believe this clause would give a great incentive to ground rent tenants to exercise their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said one has to look at the position of the landlord.  I think the Minister overstressed the disadvantage of such a proposal to the landlord. The landlord will lose nothing because the tenant will be merely exercising rights he already has.  It might be argued that the boost to the purchase of the ground rent by the tenant would be largely psychological, but I maintain that any proviso adding to the householder's knowledge of his entitlement and any incentive to him to <Col N="403" /> exercise his rights would be an advantage if we are, as I think we are, committed to encouraging the purchase of freeholds by all tenants.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he thought there was no advantage to the tenant.  I think it is an advantage to the tenant if his rights and entitlements are brought to his attention.  The Minister said such a clause would be an unwarranted interference with the fundamental freedom to dispose of property.  My amendment would not be a bar to the sale of property.  All that is required is that notice should be given to the householder and the only effect would be to encourage the householder to exercise his rights.  I would ask the Minister to give further consideration to this amendment.  He probably accepts the spirit and the intention in which it was tabled, bearing in mind the fact that we are trying to frame a Bill that will encourage householders to exercise their rights.  By including a subsection of this kind in the Bill we will improve the chances that householders who are paying ground rents will exercise their rights under this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 8 March Deputy O'Keeffe moved an amendment to section 16.  He made a comprehensive case for the amendment and I gave my reply to the case he made.  Before the Deputy reported progress on that day, again he explained the purpose of his amendment.  Basically the amendment would require ground landlords to give their tenants a right of pre-emption. As will be seen from the Official Report, I described this an an unwarranted interference with a fundamental freedom to dispose of property.  In fairness or in justice it is not a correct function to impose on landlords, namely, to make them liable to encourage their tenants to exercise their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has adverted to the objection in principle to his amendment although he gave the opinion that such a restriction on the sale of property by a landlord would stand up constitutionally.  I have not involved myself in the question of <Col N="404" /> whether such a provision would or would not be contrary to the Constitution but obviously it must at least raise doubts as to its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the provision is objectionable on general principles and cannot be justified by reference to any benefit it may bring to tenants.  The right of a tenant to acquire the fee simple is not affected by a change of ground landlord and the terms of acquisition could not be affected adversely by such a change.  The Deputy made the point that the amendment would provide an opportunity, perhaps even an encouragement, for tenants to avail themselves of the legislation but I do not think this a matter of great significance.  I do not think the scheme will need any encouragement of this kind.  Indeed, recent inquiries indicate there is virtually no market in ground rents so that, in effect, the situation envisaged in the amendment is somewhat unreal.</P>
    <P>There is little point in imposing an objectionable restriction on persons in relation to the disposal of property, one that at least raises doubts as to its constitutionality.  To my mind there are no clear benefits to be seen and the whole situation is somewhat unreal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to giving a right of pre-emption to the sitting tenant, the householder.  I have to suggest to him that this amendment does not have that effect.  It is the 1967 Act and this Bill that give the right of pre-emption.  It is those measures that give the right to purchase.  The effect of this amendment would be merely to discourage the landlord from selling to anybody else and to bring home to the tenant his rights.  I cannot put it more strongly than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that the Act gives the right of pre-emption.  It is already there and from that point of view I cannot see that the amendment would be an unwarranted interference with property rights of the landlord.  I know from my own experience the difficulty people had in exercising those rights.  Possibly there will be difficulties <Col N="405" /> arising under this Bill.  It will be merely an additional encouragement to householders to avail of this measure which I would encourage them to do.  At the same time it would be a discouragement, actual and psychological, to landlords to dispose of their interests other than to the sitting tenant.</P>
      <P>Obviously the Minister is looking at this matter from a somewhat different angle.  Perhaps he would be prepared to consider an amendment somewhat on the lines I have stated.  It would be an encouragement to people to exercise their rights and it would discourage landlords from selling over the heads of sitting tenants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable merit in what Deputy O'Keeffe is proposing. Situations have arisen where the landlord sells a property over the head of the sitting tenant.  It is my belief that it would be in everyone's interest if it were possible to merge the fee simple and other subsisting interests along the line.  There are many practical reasons why this should be done.  If a sitting tenant is informed that the property is being sold he can go along to the bank and obtain a loan there or from some other source to merge the two interests.  This would be in his interest.  When a new lessor arrives on the scene and buys the property he has a considerable investment in that transaction.  The Minister has stated that there is not a very great market for ground rents.  Nevertheless, if an investment company or a private individual acquire an interest in a property they will do what they can to make a profit from the interest they have purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for supporting this is that a landlord may have some reason for maintaining a property which is appreciating in value.  Because his property is appreciating in value he can sell his fee simple interest.  There may be an elderly person or a person of poor financial means living in the dwelling and the landlord may not be carrying out any repairs with a view to allowing the property deteriorate over the head of a sitting tenant.  If there was an obligation on the landlord, such <Col N="406" /> as I have in mind, included in the Bill the lessor would be more likely to try to keep the buildings on his property in better repair.</P>
    <P>If a dwelling house on, for instance, an acre of land in Dublin is allowed to deteriorate the house would depreciate in value but the area of land would not.  If the Bill provided that notice must be served on the sitting tenants it would be of benefit to them. I do not believe it would affect the free sale of the property by the lessor but it would help sitting tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make two points in relation to this section. The first concerns the exclusion of leases made by the Commissioners of Irish Lights and by harbour authorities. This amounts to a further restriction on tenants to protect semi-State institutions.  There is already a restriction in section 4 which is to the effect that the Act does not bind a Minister of Government, the Office of Public Works or the Land Commission.  When we were discussing section 4 we made a number of points in relation to this. We highlighted the difficulties of tenants of such bodies who in other circumstances would have an entitlement to purchase their freehold but, because they were unfortunate to have as their landlords one of these bodies, they would lose such entitlement.  One of the major points made in relation to that section was the difficulty of tenants who would have had an entitlement where the landlord was a private individual but subsequently lost that entitlement because of the acquiring of the freehold by a State or semi-State body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Minister indicated that he was somewhat sympathetic to the situation and that he was making a review of the matter.  Can he tell the House how many people would be <Col N="407" /> affected by the provisions in sections 4 and 16?  The second point I wish to make relates to subsection (2) (c) which refers to the loss of entitlement to acquire the fee simple where a lease of land contains a covenant by the lessee to erect a building or buildings or to carry out development on the land if and so long as the convenant has not been fully complied with.  I suggest that the Minister consider deleting the word &ldquo;fully&rdquo;.  The spirit and intention of this clause would be adequately covered without that word.  I do not see why that word was included. In principle, if such a covenant had been substantially complied with a landlord should not because of some frivilous matter be entitled to avoid the terms of the Bill, which he might be able to do because of the inclusion of the word &ldquo;fully&rdquo;.  The hands of any arbitrator or judge in such circumstances would be tied because the subsection seems to imply that any such covenant has to be honoured in the letter and the spirit to the last dot and comma.  That is a small point but I could see a strict interpretation of the section on a minor matter&mdash;possibly relating to the colour of the paint put on the outside of the House&mdash;leading to a landlord being able to avoid his obligations under the Bill.  If the wording of the subsection was changed in a positive way that would be sufficient, or if the word &ldquo;fully&rdquo; was deleted it would permit a legal interpretation allowing substantial compliance to qualify for purchase.  I accept I have not given the Minister any notice of that point, but it is a matter that could be of some relevance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The object of the Bill is to enable certain categories of lessees to purchase the fee simple in their premises.  Accordingly, the point I wish to make is somewhat out of line with the reasoning behind the Bill, but it is relevant under this section, a section which seeks to restrict the right of a lessee to acquire the fee simple.  In certain cases landlords may also undergo hardship and be the subject of sharp practice of some kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> I want to put to the Minister the case of a man who buys a short lease of a business premises with eight to ten years to go.  He has vacant possession and spends a considerable amount of money, say about £10,000, in reconstructing the premises and putting them into suitable condition.  He then leases the premises to a tenant.  The tenant proceeds to acquire the fee simple from the ground rent landlord.  He then finds himself in the position of the ground rent landlord, and the tenant in occupation and when his lease expires he refuses to renew it and the man A, who bought the premises finds himself in this situation: A bought a premises for thousands of pounds, spent thousands of pounds improving their value.  He leases them to B who acquires the fee simple over his head and without notice to him.  When the lease falls due for renewal B refuses to renew the lease and A is then deprived of the benefits of his lease and is a very large sum of money out of pocket.</P>
    <P>I suggest for the Minister's consideration that it should be incumbent on the ground rent landlord to serve notice on the current lessee before selling the fee simple to give the lessee an opportunity of purchasing.  I do not know if I have got across this specific case to the Minister.  It is a case that has been brought to my attention but in considering it I have come to the conclusion that many other people could be similarly affected.  This is a Bill to facilitate&mdash;I am not saying that in any provocative way&mdash;the purchase of ground rents or fee simple interests by lessees, not by third persons.  I am putting it to the Minister that he should consider between now and Report Stage the desirability of imposing on the ground rent landlord or the head landlord the obligation of serving notice on the lessee of his intention to sell the premises and of giving the lessee an opportunity to purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I first deal with the comments of Deputy O'Keeffe?  I have already said during the discussion on section 4 that I was having a further detailed study of all leases given by the State as lessor to <Col N="409" /> see whether the State should be bound by the provisions of the Bill.  I did say then that this examination was taking longer than necessary.  While it is not finalised yet I gather that it will not be very long more.  We shall then see what the position is in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised another point in regard to section 2 (c).  There is a good deal in what he says but I am sure he will agree that the point he raised is one that would require to be considered by the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  I am advised that this would probably be the proper thing to do and I am quite prepared to have the Deputy's views brought to the attention of the commission for examination and comment.</P>
      <P>I should certainly like to think that the case Deputy Fitzpatrick made comes within the scope of the Bill.  It might, or it might not as the Deputy was ready enough to accept.  I am prepared to have it examined without going into it now because it is the sort of case in which we might easily get lost.  I shall have it examined and if I can help in any way in regard to the type of case mentioned I shall do something about it on Report.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment to set up a Fair Rents Tribunal to ensure that tenants of private houses and <Col N="410" /> flats benefit from the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings.</P>
    <P>I am moving this motion in my own name and in the names of the other members of the Parliamentary Labour Party affixed to it.  It is noted that the circumstances which bring me in here at comparatively short notice are ones over which people on this side of the House effectively have very little control. We are grateful to the Minister for being ready also at such short notice to attend and no doubt to contribute to a debate on this very important topic.</P>
    <P>Several things may be noticed about this motion.  The most obvious is that we are here dealing with a comparatively small proportion of the total number of households in the State, and yet the fact that they are a relatively small proportion of the total number of households in the State should not make us any less concerned about them.  If anything, it should make us more concerned about them.  Because they are a minority their rights are in a sense almost more important than those of the majority; because they are a minority they do not have as powerful a voice as have the owner-occupiers. It is because they are a minority that the failure of the Government up to now to make any public move towards extending the benefit of rates relief to them is all the more lamentable.</P>
    <P>The House will realise from the names of the sponsors that with one exception we represent areas which have a very high proportion of rented private flats.  Deputy Quinn's constituency has the highest proportion of such accommodation of any constituency in Ireland.  I suspect that Deputy O'Leary's, Deputy Barry Desmond's and my own are not far behind.  Certainly in my constituency, which borders University College, Dublin, there are substantial numbers of students living in accommodation of this kind who are most unlikely to be tenants of controlled dwellings and who are much more vulnerable to landlords who may be unscrupulous and who know that students have to live reasonably near to the college if <Col N="411" /> they are not to spend a large portion of their grants or their parents' money on expensive transport facilities in the city.  Deputy Eileen Desmond, who has also signed this motion, is our spokesman on Justice and it is important that she should also have signed it because when there was confusion about which Minister was responsible for precisely which part of this overall operation the rent control area was authoritatively stated to be an area of responsibility of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I will refer very briefly to the rates relief policies adopted by both the outgoing Government and the new Government, then the Opposition, in the general election campaign of last year.  There were two main differences between these two policies as I see them.  The first was an actual difference and we can hardly quarrel about that because it is a matter of fact about pounds and pence.  The outgoing Government promised that the remaining rates burden would be removed in two equal moieties.  The then Opposition promised to remove the rates burden more speedily.  But there is also a potential difference which did not form part of the election campaign as such and which I like to think is important.  Part of the rates burden, it is true, had already been removed, but it is inconceivable that any further removal of rates could have been instituted by a Government of which the Labour Party formed a part without a prior assurance that the tenants of private rented accommodation would benefit. We certainly would have been looking for and would have demanded such an assurance from the Government.  It would not have been enough for us to come in and to take another cut off the rates bill and then to go fiddling around with ways and means of trying to ensure that flat-dwellers and occupiers of private rented accommodation would somehow benefit from it afterwards.  That would have been too late, and indeed we are still waiting for Government action on this issue.</P>
    <P>The occupiers of private rented <Col N="412" /> accommodation might have been forgiven for thinking that rates relief would instantaneously be passed on to them.  On page 26 of the Fianna Fáil manifesto in the section dealing with local government it is stated, and I quote:</P>
    <P>1.3.  there will be no rates content in the rent paid by tenants of privately rented accommodation,</P>
    <P>As far as I know the manifesto is not dated, although we all know when it was issued, but it is now some nine or ten months since it was issued and for every single one of that 40 weeks there has continued to be for very many tenants of private rented accommodation a rates proportion payable.  We do not even know precisely how high that proportion is. We do not know how many landlords removed the rates portion of the money that they charged to tenants on the Monday of one week and increased the rent payable by the same amount on the following Monday, as indeed in many cases it was their legitimate right to do under our system.  I have heard of only one landlord&mdash;maybe because such people hide their light under a bushel&mdash;who has reduced his net rent by the amount of the rates formerly payable on that part of the premises he owns. I am sure the Minister would like to know that that landlord is a Protestant.</P>
    <P>There is considerable confusion and concern among the occupiers of private rented accommodation.  They want to know, and they have not been so far told, if and when they will be given secure and adequate mechanisms to ensure that this rates relief will not simply be transformed&mdash;as the famous £1,000 grant was transformed&mdash;into a virtually free gift into the pockets of the builders and of people who already own property.  Shortly after the manifesto was issued the outgoing Government issued a statement of their own on the problems being experienced by the capital, and they outlined the series of measures which in their opinion were necessary and would be taken if that Government were returned to office.  It should be no surprise that the problems of people in <Col N="413" /> private rented accommodation formed a considerably large part of that &ldquo;manifesto for Dublin&rdquo; as it might be called.  I am very glad to inform the House that Deputy Quinn&mdash; Senator Quinn as he then was and he is now on official business connected with the EEC in Brussels&mdash;was one of the mainsprings of that document and, I suspect very much, of the section of the document which deals with the problems of flat-dwellers.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10 July 1977 reported the then Minister for Finance, Deputy R. Ryan, and Deputy Quinn as undertaking specifically to publish a flat-dwellers' charter:</P>
    <P>Rachmanism in Dublin's flatland may be on the way out because of the new &ldquo;flat dweller's charter&rdquo; announced yesterday by the Government ....</P>
    <P>Under legislation planned by the Government, all landlords would be registered with the special authority which would be set up to promote the orderly development and improvement of rented dwellings.</P>
    <P>Landlords not registering would then automatically find that their tenants had their own statutory rights to permanent tenure at a fixed rent.  A condition of registration would be the provision of a rent book to each tenant, rent receipts, and the maintenance of flats in good order.  Where a flat did not meet registration standards the landlord would either have to renovate it or take it off the rent market.</P>
    <P>The size of this problem varies from area to area.  It has been estimated, for example, that up to 5,000 people, many of them young people and people leaving the land, come to Dublin every year and are forced into the market for an ever-dwindling supply of private rented accommodation.  Because the supply is inexorably or gradually dwindling, the amount of rent they have to pay is higher and higher.  It is virtually still a seller's market.  I need hardly underline for the benefit of the Minister or the House the particular problems which are experienced by young married couples with children <Col N="414" /> who want to rent for any period of time private accommodation.</P>
    <P>The total number of people who are affected by the failure of the Government to implement this promise on rates relief is, though a minority, still fairly substantial.  On 13 December 1977, in answer to a question from me, the Minister noted at column 1231, Volume 302, No. 8, of the Official Report as follows:</P>
    <P>The latest available figure for the number of households occupying rented accommodation, other than local authority dwellings, is 96,884, as set out in Volume VI of the Census of Population of Ireland, 1971.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept that this figure has probably dwindled slightly in the intervening seven years, but if you assume an average occupancy of 2 or 2.5, we are still talking about a couple of hundred thousand people, some of them very young and some very old, both groups intensely at risk in the fierce competition for available housing resources.</P>
    <P>These private rented accommodation units are distributed differently in different areas.  The census report from which the Minister's parliamentary reply quoted also notes on page 13 that there were a fairly substantial number of private rented furnished and unfurnished households in, for example, Dublin County Borough and Dún Laoghaire Borough.  In these two areas in the period in question there were some 17,806 housing units rented unfurnished other than from the local authority and they had a grand total of 21,629 private households in them. When we look at the furnished and part-furnished tenancies you see an interesting variation in the pattern because, while there were 7,359 housing units, there were 17,805 private households in those units.  In other words, the trend is fairly clear: where furnished or part furnished accommodation is concerned, the housing units are much more likely to be occupied.  In the other county boroughs the pattern is more or less the same. While it is true that this is to a large extent an urban problem, it does not follow necessarily that it is a problem <Col N="415" /> which does not exist to any significant degree outside the urban areas.</P>
    <P>Page 14 of the same volume of the census points out that in 1971 some 16 per cent of private dwellings in the aggregate town area were rented from people other than from the local authority.  In the aggregate rural area the percentage of rented accommodation was much lower&mdash;5.8 per cent&mdash; and the overall average for the country as a whole was 10.9 per cent. Even when you fine it down to its absolute bare minimum, we are still talking about 10 per cent of the private households in this country.  As I said before, this 10 per cent, because they are small, vulnerable and voiceless, need our support much more than the very vocal, and deservedly so, and well organised owner-occupier group in the population.</P>
    <P>It was some time before the question of what precisely the Government planned to do about this 10 per cent of households surfaced in the Dáil. When we finally got our teeth into it, on Tuesday, 21 February 1978, Volume 303, No. 10, of the Official Reports, when the Minister was subjected to some fairly intense questioning about what he proposed to do and when he proposed to do it, he said, after first noting that local authorities had ceased to levy contributions in lieu of rates at column 1605:</P>
    <P>As regards private rented dwellings controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts, rates, following the abolition of domestic rates, will cease to be a lawful addition to the basic rent.  Where such additions have not already been removed, it will be open to tenants of controlled dwellings to consider availing of the procedure of serving a notice on their landlords under section 13 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, reducing their rent.</P>
    <P>The position of other private tenancies in regard to payment of rates varies a good deal.  Some tenants have been paying rates directly and in such cases the benefit of domestic derating will pass to them directly without the need for special administrative or legal <Col N="416" /> action.  Other tenants have been contributing less directly to payment of rates.  Generally the matter will be dealt with by appropriate provisions in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1978.</P>
    <P>There are approximately three columns of toing and froing following this reply in which the Minister on various occasions pointed out that the legislation had already been introduced, that it was almost ready and that it would be circulated&mdash;I quote from column 1608&mdash;&ldquo;very soon&rdquo;.  It is six weeks since those questions were answered and we must now ask the Minister how soon is &ldquo;very soon&rdquo;? If it was already introduced, it is about time we saw it, and it is about time occupiers of private rented accommodation had some sort of answer to the questions they and we have been asking.</P>
    <P>There is one major problem in relation to this legislation and that is that I find it almost impossible to believe that the Minister can make it retrospective.  I would be delighted to see him try but I would be astonished if he succeeded in this.  The longer we are waiting for this legislation the more rates will be paid by the occupiers of private rented accommodation and the less chance they will have of getting anything back <i>in lieu</i> of them.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the category mentioned by the Minister because, as he pointed out rightly, there are several categories involved. The first is the tenant of the controlled dwellings category.  As the Minister announced this it seemed that here at least was something that could be done. Tenants of controlled dwellings have the legal right of access to the courts for the purpose of having rents reduced by the amount of rates payable formerly but if we look more closely at the situation we will see that the actuality is a little more complex than the Minister, perhaps, would have us believe.  For example, it is pointed out very carefully in section 19 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960 that the special provision for the relief of tenants of small controlled dwellings refers only to tenants living in such dwellings in appointed areas and these areas are as <Col N="417" /> follows: (i) the county borough of Dublin, (ii) the borough of Dún Laoghaire, and (iii) the parts of the Dublin Metropolitan District outside the area consisting of the county borough of Dublin and the borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>It includes also: (b) the county borough of Cork, (c) the county borough of Limerick, (d) the county borough of Waterford, or (e) any area prescribed by regulations for the time being in force as an appointed area for the purposes of this Part.  We would like to know whether in pursuance of his desire to relieve people of the burden of rates the Minister has made any order extending the areas, for example, to include the whole country whereby the tenants of small controlled dwellings might apply for relief from rates.  If the Minister has not done this it means that there is discrimination, that a legal remedy is available only to people living in the areas listed in the 1960 Act.  In other words, there is discrimination between people living in the urban areas and those living in the aggregate rural areas.</P>
    <P>Although, as I pointed out, the discrepancy is fairly large between those living in urban areas and those living in the rural areas there remains about 5 per cent of households in rural areas that are occupied by tenants of private rented accommodation. It is one matter for the Minister to say that these people have a relief open to them but it is another matter to see whether this relief can in effect be availed of.  As legislators we have a reasonable familiarity with the Acts of the Oireachtas.  We spend much of our time in advising our constituents of their rights under the various Acts. Frankly, it is comparatively unlikely that many applications have been made under sections 19 and 20 of the 1960 Act for removal of rates from private rented dwellings since this Government came to office.  If the Minister has any such figures we would be interested in hearing them.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Act reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  The tenant of a dwelling which he claims to be a small controlled <Col N="418" /> dwelling may apply to the District Justice assigned to the district in which the dwelling is situate for a provisional order fixing the lawful rent of the dwelling.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every application under this section shall be made by the tenant attending, in person or by agent, the District Court Clerk of the court area in which the dwelling concerned is situate and furnishing particulars in support of his claim to the said District Court Clerk who shall record such particulars and refer the application as soon as may be to the appropriate District Justice.</P>
    <P>There are several other sections and subsections dealing with this area which make it quite clear that anybody who is the tenant of a small controlled dwelling has this remedy but I am asking whether the people are aware of this right.  I would like to see it go out from this House this evening that tenants of small controlled dwellings have this right.  Also, I would like the Minister to commit himself to a greater publicity campaign than one involving two or three lines by way of answer to a parliamentary question to explain to these tenants, particularly in the urban areas, that they have these rights and that in order to claim them they must contact the registrar of the District Court.</P>
    <P>Again, we must remember who these people are likely to be.  They are likely to be elderly and living alone, people who hardly ever read newspapers, who fall into that category of people that we as public representatives know all too well are often the last to claim their legal rights.  Therefore, the very least we expect from this motion is a firm commitment from the Minister to give the maximum publicity to the rights that are available to people under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The motion suggests and, indeed, argues strongly that the only real way in which it can be assured that the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings will benefit the tenants of private houses is to set up a fair rent tribunal. The reason for this is that there is <Col N="419" /> absolutely no control in respect of landlords of very many units of private rented accommodation.  Nor is there any control preventing them from increasing rents when and as often as they wish subject only to the provisions of any tenancy agreement they may have with the tenant.  I should be interested in hearing, too, whether the Minister has any information regarding the proportion of private rented accommodation that is under control and the proportion that is decontrolled. This is very germane to the problem before us.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a fair rents tribunal does not appear in any part of Fianna Fáil's manifesto and so far at any rate has not been hinted at by any Government Minister.  Yet, there are many precedents for such legislation. In Britain, for example, the Rents Acts of 1968 and a number of subsequent Acts set up and refined rent tribunals with very wide powers in relation to the fixing and the controlling of rents.</P>
    <P>These tribunals have the power to determine rents and to reduce rents. They have the power to allow a tenant to reduce a rent by the amount he has spent on repairs that the landlord refused to carry out.  These tribunals have the power also to give to tenants greater security of tenure than the landlord is prepared to give.  On certain occasions they even have power to increase the rent if this is judged to be fair.  The legislation is complex and I do not propose to go into it in any great detail.  Neither would I go so far as to urge the Minister or the House to follow slavishly this kind of blueprint.  I say this partly because there is no reason for us to follow something adopted in a neighbouring country simply for the sake of doing so but even more so because we should profit from the experience of that country in relation to the operation of fair rent tribunals and to see whether the legislation there achieves the very desirable effect that it has intended to achieve.</P>
    <P>Already there is some evidence that the sheer complexity of that legislation has contributed in part to the fact <Col N="420" /> that many tenants have not been getting what were in common sense their rights.  In a situation in which the owners of private rented accommodation who are comparatively wealthy people with instant and permanent access to expertise in the legal area, in the accountancy area, in the building area and in all the areas relating to the cost of housing, the experience of many of these tribunals has been that on the one side there would be the unfortunate tenant whose rent is being increased and who goes to the tribunal asking that the rent be fixed more fairly while on the other hand there is the owner of the property concerned who is very rarely seen by the tenant but who is represented frequently by his solicitor with a battery of accounts, facts, statistics and perhaps even more expensive advice from a member of the Bar.  No tribunal in the world can resist forever this kind of pressure.  In the problem that has arisen because of the operation of the rent tribunals in Britain there seem to be two options which should be considered.  One of them is to try to equalise the financial power of the owner of the property by allowing to the tenant pleading for a fair rent a reasonable amount of civil legal aid. This might prove rather expensive.  It might be arguable that a preferable way would be to reduce the complexity of the mechanism so that any advantages that accrue to private landlords by virtue of their increased financial fire power would not act unfairly on their side in any argument with a tenant about the appropriate level of rent.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of experience here, a wealth of mistakes has been made and a wealth of options is open to us. We want to see from the Minister some indication of a serious approach to this.  It is already very late in the day.  I doubt that any legislation is likely to be passed until the summer, which would mean that the tenants of private rented accommodation would have to pay an extra year's rates, a year more than anybody else.  They could hardly be blamed for feeling bitter, having voted for a programme which in unusually categorical terms stated that there would be no rates <Col N="421" /> element in the rents charged to occupiers of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The only thing we have seen in the past couple of months giving any sort of indication of the Government's intentions in this regard has been the White Paper on National Development, 1970-80.  There are two sections of this White Paper which give scant comfort indeed to any tenant who may have looked to it for any sign that there would be an early and speedy and just approach by the Government to the problems of people who are still paying rates or who have to pay inflated rents on private rented accommodation. The first straw in the wind is on page 48 at paragraph 5.8 on local authority housing.  It is no more than a straw in the wind, but it is enough to frighten one.  The paragraph reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The continuing and accruing subsidy of up to £1,500 per unit per annum for normal rented local authority dwellings now being provided is placing a very heavy burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If this is the writing on the wall for public rented accommodation, what are the implications for private rented accommodation?  These implications are quite obvious.  If public rented accommodation by virtue of Government policy becomes more scarce and expensive, more and more people will be thrown into the arms of the private rented sector.  It is not impossible to think that the private rented sector, which has been decreasing at a relatively slow rate, might begin to expand again.  I believe that this is not a very desirable objective.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5.9 of the White Paper deals with housing stock and states as follows:</P>
    <P>The abolition of rates on housing will help to achieve the same result by encouraging improvement in existing dwellings.</P>
    <P>How many occupiers of private rented accommodation have seen a landlord rushing in with buckets of paint and whitewash, together with plumbers and electricians, celebrating the removal of rates from premises which they occupy?  Very few: none at all in <Col N="422" /> my own experience.  They must read that section of the White Paper with an ironic sense of humour, if they read it with any sense of humour at all.</P>
    <P>From the manifesto to the White Paper there has been a combination of, on the one hand, inaction and, on the other hand, increasingly depressing noises.  This national 10 per cent of households must by now have given up hope.  They have certainly given up a fair amount of hard cash which they will not get back.  If it is any consolation to them&mdash;and they may have to wait some time until they get real justice&mdash;I would urge them to read that section on private rented accommodation in the position paper presented by the Administrative Council to the 1978 Annual Conference of the Labour Party.  This does not represent party policy at this time but I sincerely hope that the major elements will form part of party policy when that policy is adopted at our conference next year. If it is, we can hope not just for cosmetic improvements in the area of private rented accommodation but genuine structural changes which will remove many of the unfair disadvantages under which such tenants labour at the moment.</P>
    <P>The section on private rented accommodation states as follows:</P>
    <P>5.3.1.  The provision of private rented accommodation has not been properly managed in the past. Labour will undertake the following measures:</P>
    <P>5.3.2.  A full analysis and study of the needs of this sector of housing will be undertaken as a priority.</P>
    <P>5.3.3.  The present landlord and tenant legislation governing control of rents in privately owned houses will be replaced with new legislation which will:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Establish a rents tribunal.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Establish and protect the rights of tenants.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Provide a direct rent subsidy, where needed, to tenants in private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>One is not normally in favour of <Col N="423" /> putting public money into private hands in circumstances of this sort but there may be emergency cases in which this may need to be done.  The position paper continues as follows:</P>
    <P>(iv)  Encourage the creation of mid-term leases of up to 10 and 20 years for flats and so enable tenants to purchase leases, giving them security of tenure and a stake in their home.</P>
    <P>(v)  Provide for an income tax allowance for flat dwellers against the cost of their rent.</P>

      <P>I need hardly underline the importance for those 10 per cent of our households living in private rented accommodation.  At the moment owner occupiers of houses are allowed to set all the interest on their mortgages against income tax.  No such provision exists for occupiers of private rented accommodation and this is a discrepancy which any socially just Government would have to tackle and the sooner the better.</P>
      <P>There are two further provisions in this section of the position paper and they are as follows:</P>
      <P>(vi)  Revise the system of registration of all flats, bedsitters and dwellings available for rent.</P>
      <P>(vii)  Establish the rights of both tenant and the landlord.</P>
      <P>The section finishes with the following:</P>
      <P>5.3.4.  Labour will ensure that an adequate supply of short term and mid term rentable accommodation is made available at an equitable cost to the tenant with proper conditions of tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to compare in all honesty the skimpy, long-delayed and inadequate implementation of a promise that has not been fully thought out with the depth of analysis of thinking contained not just in the Dublin manifesto that the outgoing Government issued in the course of the election campaign but in this draft policy document.  I have no doubt that <Col N="424" /> this 10 per cent of the tenants&mdash;the percentage is 17 in the urban areas&mdash; when they come to consider the implementation of Government policy and the options they were offered will make a certain choice in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this very important question.  Like the previous speaker and other Deputies, I represent a very dense flatland area with a very high proportion of rented accommodation, and I am quite familiar with tenants' day to day problems in Rathmines, Rathgar. Terenure and Harold's Cross, traditional flatland areas.  I am aware there is a high degree of turnover and recycling of flats in these areas.</P>
      <P>It has been a difficult problem to quantify flats or other rented accommodation in the city of Dublin.  The previous Government did not make matters easier by their negative attitude in not even permitting a census to be taken, at least in the city of Dublin.  I do not doubt the sincerity of the last speaker's intention, but I found it difficult to listen to the myriad inaccuracies meted out to us.  As a Dublin Corporation member, I have been aware of the inequity of the rating system.  Many people who live in rented or private dwellings were not able to discharge that penal debt.  But, to put the record straight, the Minister must be congratulated on his speedy action in abolishing rates on private dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the Government are providing £80 million to abolish rates on private dwellings and certain other buildings.  About 850,000 dwellings will be relieved of rates as a direct result. People all over the country know exactly what this means.  They have realised they are being relieved of a burden which had been tearing into their economic budget year in, year out.  They include owners of houses and people buying houses with the help of building society mortgages, many of them in hard pressed economic circumstances.  I will refer to those who benefited by the rates waiver scheme operated by Dublin <Col N="425" /> Corporation.  That scheme affected 8,000 to 9,000 people out of a total of 120,000.  They included local authority tenants as well as people in private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The last speaker missed the point when he spoke about the establishment of a rents tribunal.  That would come within the framework of the Department of Justice, not the Environment. As I have said, the majority of our people know what Fianna Fáil have done.  They have implemented their promise outlined in the manifesto. The part read out from the manifesto this evening will be implemented in forthcoming legislation and therefore it is inaccurate to read from the manifesto and state that Fianna Fáil have not implemented their promise. They have abolished rates on private dwellings and they will provide legislation to ensure that tenants will get relief of the rates element in their tenancies. Local authority tenants are already feeling the benefit.  People in rented dwellings who pay rates through increases in rents know full well what the effect will be: they know that when the rents would be due to go up later in the year under individual tenancy agreements, this will not happen.  This is a fact, not a supposition or a hope that something will be changed.</P>
    <P>Domestic rates have been abolished and trying to linger on with some false thinking that this has not happened is plain stupidity.  People know that Fianna Fáil at one fell swoop cannot alter the law because legislation has to go through the necessary parliamentary stages.  Laws cannot be enacted within 24 hours.  Therefore there is no point in speaking about lingering on or about people being kept in animated suspension, not knowing where they stand.  That only misleads people.</P>
    <P>Tenants must be protected and Fianna Fáil will protect them by legislation about to be introduced.  A small number of people whose position is not now clear, those who do not pay anything in respect of rates, know that when forthcoming legislation has been enacted they will get as fair and reasonable a deal as the Government can give to them.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there are about 100,000 <Col N="426" /> units which have benefited by the Government's action in abolishing rates.  Though the financial split between business premises and private accommodation is approximately 50 per cent, the number benefiting from domestic rates abolition in Dublin is nearly 90 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>I referred to the rates waiver scheme. That was difficult to administer because of a sliding scale.  There were borderline cases who should have benefited but did not for one reason or another come within the guidelines of the scheme.  Fianna Fáil have abolished rates.  In the new Bill there will be some fine tuning to be done, areas that will need clarification.  One of these areas includes tenants who have a rate element in their rent structure and who will automatically benefit by a reduction in their total rent.  Some clarification will be necessary in regard to the various types of rents people pay.  First there are those who pay rents and rates as separate components of their tenancies.  Obviously the relief will be immediate for these agreements; they will not have to pay the rates element at all.  For those who pay rent and rates together, as a single payment, it is the Minister's intention that they will also benefit.  That is not a political ploy but a straightforward intention.</P>
    <P>I referred to a Bill which is at an advanced stage of preparation.  This Bill will cover rented accommodation and will give adequate protection to tenants.  It will embrace cover for the rates element in privately rented accommodation.  This Bill will place a legal obligation on the landlord to pass on the relief to the tenant.  What could be more protective than that? Surely a legal measure that is provided for the benefit of the tenant is the least expensive and least cumbersome system for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a rents tribunal would be another way of doing it, but in my opinion there is a danger that it might work against the tenant, apart from the enormous expense and the cumbersome manner in which it would work, bogged down by civil service bureaucracy. After all, it is the tenant that must be protected.  If the tenant is <Col N="427" /> protected under the law of the land, I cannot see any sense in trying to set up a system that might work against him in certain circumstances.  It could be self-defeating.  I have an open mind about a rents tribunal, but as it is referred to in this motion, &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment to set up a Fair Rents Tribunal to ensure that tenants of private houses and flats benefit from the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings&rdquo; it is like setting up a rents tribunal for one aspect of rented accommodation in the city.  It could be a futile exercise.  If a rents tribunal is to be set up, surely it will need broader powers than the reference to a rating element of a rent agreement which would already be covered by legislation.  A rents tribunal would need more embracing powers and would have to list the quality of the accommodation offered and take into account the actual rent itself and how it is costed.  It cannot be set up for the purpose that is stated in the motion&mdash;that tenants would derive a relief in the rate element.  They are entitled to that and they will be protected by law.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, this matter would come within the sphere of the Department of Justice and I cannot see how the Department of the Environment would be involved.  Perhaps there is some oblique tie-up in that the Department of the Environment administers local authorities and local authorities enact bye-laws, and there are bye-laws which direct landlords to register accommodation.  Otherwise, I cannot see how you could take a rents tribunal within the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be more efficient in dealing with this problem and will protect the tenant directly under legistation. The tenant will not be required to submit his case to a tribunal and have to wait for a protracted length of time before he is given an answer.  The tenant's right to seek a reduction in rent will be protected by law.  This point must be stressed because it is of paramount importance.  The Minister has referred to it before.  If this point is not understood.  I am certain that <Col N="428" /> the Minister will amplify it in his reply.  Unscrupulous landlords who do not comply with this legislation will be subjected to the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to a rents tribunal as it is mentioned in the motion.  It is not for me to say whether or not I would favour a rents tribunal.  If it worked for the benefit of tenants in getting a fair deal in the striking of rents and in regard to the quality of accommodation in Dublin, then by all means; but rents tribunals have been found wanting in other countries.  We do not want a situation similar to the one in England at present where there is a consistent shrinkage of the flat market with consequent increases in the rents, leading to Rachmanism and exploitation of tenants.  A rents tribunal has been in operation in England for eight or ten years.  Has it worked for the benefit of the tenant?  A memorandum is being prepared on the subject of privately rented accommodation and is under active consideration at present.</P>
    <P>That the rights of individuals are protected is what matters most.  There is no point in setting up bodies if they are going to be ineffective.  Fianna Fáil have delivered the goods in this respect. Everybody knows that we have abolished rates and we are now introducing legislation to protect tenants, legislation which will cover more than the element that is referred to in the motion.  Any tenant who is bullied or maltreated by landlords will be able to take action.  I represent a large area of flatland in Dublin and any public representative who receives complaints of this nature from tenants will give categoric advice on it.  If there is any question of a case being taken to court the judge will treat the tenant fairly and it is hypocrisy to think otherwise.</P>
    <P>The tenant must be protected.  This is the object of forthcoming legislation. It will protect the tenant much more than would the setting up of a body which might not work.  There is a danger that what is proposed in this motion might not work.  My objection to it is that it could be counter-productive. It is better to have all-embracing legislation which will empower the <Col N="429" /> courts to take action as necessary against unscrupulous landlords who are not giving a fair deal to tenants.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what the Minister said in this respect.  Part of the Minister's reply to a question on 21 February was read out earlier this evening.  On that day Deputy Quinn asked the Minister for the Environment:</P>
    <P>the action that has been taken to ensure that flat dwellers in private rented accommodation obtain a proportionate reduction in their rent as a result of the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings.</P>

      <P>The Minister in reply said:</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the benefit of domestic derating is passed on to tenants of rented accommodation.  On my instructions, local authorities have ceased levying contributions in lieu of rates in the rents of their tenants as and from 1 January 1978.</P>
      <P>As regards private rented dwellings controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts, rates, following the abolition of domestic rates, will cease to be a lawful addition to the basic rent.  Where such additions have not already been removed, it will be open to tenants of controlled dwellings to consider availing of the procedure of serving a notice on their landlords under section 13 of the Rent Restriction Act, 1960 reducing their rent.</P>
      <P>The important part is in the end of what the Minister stated.  It is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of other private tenancies in regard to payment of rates varies a good deal.  Such tenants have been paying rates directly and in such cases the benefit of <Col N="430" /> domestic derating will pass to them directly without the need for special administrative or legal action.  Other tenants have been contributing less directly to payment of rates.  Generally the matter will be dealt with by appropriate provisions in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1978.</P>
    <P>I repeat the point that it will be covered by legislation.  It will become the law of the land and the tenant will be protected automatically once this Bill has been passed.  It will be up to every public representative and local authority to inform tenants of their rights in this regard.  It will not be a matter of hoping that we can enact something which might work.  It will work.  This is why Fianna Fáil have now set the seal of implementing one of the finer parts of their manifesto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important motion.  This matter is causing people anxiety.  When rates on private dwellings were abolished many people thought they would reap some benefit but it now transpires they do not. There is no benefit whatsoever for people in the vast areas of flatland. While I have not seen the legislation the Minister proposes to bring in, I do not believe it will be very meaningful. If he brings in a Bill demanding that the rates element be removed from the tenant, there is nothing to prevent landlords the following week putting up the tenants' rents.  If he wants a precedent for it, the local authority tenants were very jubilant when the rates content was removed from their rents but they found a couple of weeks later that their rents went up.  So much for that bonanza.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that the great majority, except those who are paying very high rents, who thought they would get some benefit from this great bonanza, found they were penalised.  There is nothing to prevent the landlord from putting up the rent.  I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Brady say that landlords who might use bullying tactics could <Col N="431" /> be dealt with by the law.  He knows very little about the matter if that is what he thinks.</P>
      <P>Tenants in unprotected dwellings have very few rights.  They can find themselves outside their doors either on a seven-day oral request to move or on a written notice to quit.  While no violence may be used to put them out, their belongings can be placed outside their doors and, if they are not, their locks can be changed.  When that happens we will see what rights they have.  I believe it is necessary that a fair rents tribunal be set up to examine all aspects of private lettings. I do not say that all landlords sprout horns and persecute their tenants. There are some very good landlords but there is the other type of landlord. Unless we can set up a fair rents tribunal we cannot determine any question of reasonable rent control.  It is important in this area, which has not, as Deputy Horgan said, a strong voice, that the laws are there to protect the rights of all people.  Unfortunately as the law stands it tends to protect the landlord and not the tenant.  During the week I heard of a person in receipt of £22 home assistance per week having to pay £10 per week rent and her landlord is demanding another £2.  Where can she turn? She can go out on to the street and then she will be put on the local authority housing list.  That is the anomaly that exists today.  For too long this area of accommodation has been neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan advocated rent subsidies for the landlord and I agree with him.  If we set up a fair rents tribunal people will receive a fair rent on their investments, but if the accommodation is priced too high for a tenant, there should be a subsidy.  It should not be the business of a private landlord to subsidise a tenant.  That is a matter for central government and it should be examined.  Many houses are going into decay because there is no real return from them and it does not pay to maintain them in good condition.  The whole aspect of private housing should be looked at with a view to preserving and improving it. <Col N="432" /> This can only be done with aid from central government through the local authorities.  It is very expensive to develop new units of accommodation. To let houses decay and then to build new units at a very high price seems useless and ludicrous.  When we speak of a fair rents tribunal we must look at it in that context, otherwise it will not work.</P>
    <P>An elderly lady or gentleman living on an old age pension in a local authority apartment is well subsidised.  If they are living in their own dwelling they have no expenses except for repairs to be carried out, but if they are in a private dwelling they are subject to the whim of the landlord.  Why should such people be at a disadvantage? Why are they not entitled to some form of rent subsidy?  We should have an in-depth study to ensure that the legislation brought in is not piecemeal but comprehensive, even if it takes 12 months to bring it in.  Such legislation is worth waiting for provided it takes into account the various aspects of private housing.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a rent subsidy could contribute to the improvement of property which otherwise would go into decay.  Another way to assist improvements would be to ensure that landlords who make improvements get a reasonably generous tax concession.  On the Continent if one only paints the front of one's house one can claim tax concessions.  Any improvements to this type of property are important and an incentive must be provided.  The local authorities by way of bye-laws have certain constraints upon the type of bedsitters that can be developed and also the number of bedsitters in a house having regard to sanitary conditions and so on.  These bye-laws should be more stringently enforced to improve private accommodation. People who wish to build one-bedroom apartments should be given some reasonable tax concession which could be built into a fair rents tribunal system.  This concession could be taken into account in assessing rents in this type of dwelling, as bedsitters presently being used are not up to currently acceptable living standards. <Col N="433" /> This whole area must be looked at comprehensively by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The fact that a number of people were not getting the benefit of the rates remission was what prompted this motion.  This has been a festering sore for a number of years.  People have sought this type of legislation before and the motion is worthy of serious consideration by the Minister.  If we look at controlled dwellings and uncontrolled dwellings it can be seen that they are poles apart so far as the profits made are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the Government subvent the whole of this type of housing to ensure it is maintained at a reasonable standard, that people can afford the rents sought, because the cost of buying and developing any type of property now is expensive and rents can run very high.  But that should not debar young couples with children from having access to reasonable housing conditions at a fair rent. If a fair rent means that there must be subsidisation by the Government, then that is necessary.  In the Government's White Paper they speak about cutting back on local authority dwellings.  If they do that it will place even greater pressure on the private sector and that, in turn, will lead to hardship and exploitation.  Unless money is made available with which to tackle this serious problem the Minister will find that it will remain on his hands.  There are no short cuts on housing problems, no soft options, as was seen in the past few days when the Government examined the area of cheap housing.  There is no such thing as cheap housing.  If we want proper housing we have got to pay for it.  If we want to provide our people with decent accommodation it must be paid for.  If people invest money in property they must make a reasonable profit. Therefore it is important that a rent tribunal be set up to control rents, make the whole proposition viable, in turn, making housing available at a rate people can afford.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Brady speak about rates, that the far side of the House had made their abolition possible and that nobody else had done anything about them.  It <Col N="434" /> was difficult to hold one's tongue when it was contended that in December 1972 and succeeding months it was impossible because it would have cost a fortune to have anything done about rates.  Anything that was done about them emanated from the National Coalition.  It is hard to listen to this Government wanting to claim credit for something they said could not be initiated.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised listening to Deputy Brady who said that he represented an area with large numbers of flats.  I was tempted to ask him to knock on door after door when he would find very few places where people could lawfully say they had received rates relief since the abolition of rates.  I was even more surprised to hear him say that everything in the garden was rosy, that the imminent legislation the Minister will introduce will solve all of the problems and that a fair rents tribunal would be cumbersome and would not be necessary. If they removed the rates this week there is nothing to prevent a landlord imposing them again next week.  The local authorities have already done it. That should be sewn into the record to ensure that note is taken that there is no protection for the tenant.  I do not think the Minister's imminent financial provisions Bill will meet what this motion is seeking.  I do not think it can; it will merely pay lip service to it but will not solve the problem. The only way in which this problem can be solved is by a thorough examination of the whole aspect of private dwellings and the provision, if necessary of a subsidy, because the cost of constructing new dwellings has become so high that we must now take a very hard look at developing our current housing stocks.  In Dublin lots of houses are in a state of decay; why? &mdash;there is no real machinery, no grants system, no incentive for their repair or maintenance.  The next step is demolition, with open spaces and no new development.  We must tackle this problem.  We must encourage housing trusts.  We must examine also housing aid societies&mdash;such people may be capable of dealing with a particular grey area in house-letting that perhaps <Col N="435" /> the Corporation or other local authorities may not be catering for.  But they cannot do it alone; they must have funds and the Government must make those funds available to them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Horgan sought and was granted permission to raise on the Adjournment the following matter&mdash;the failure of the Department of Education to take an urgently needed decision about the final examinations for students in St. Catherine's College of Domestic Economy, Sion Hill, Dublin.  Deputy Horgan has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for permission to raise this on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing what the Minister for Education will have to say about this problem.  The first point I should like to make is that this is not a debate about principles; it is not a debate about the Fianna Fáil manifesto; it is not a debate on the relationship between the NCA and/or the various university colleges and colleges of domestic economy in Dublin and Sligo.  What we are talking about here is a question of procedures, procedures which have a very real and immediate effect on the students in the colleges concerned.  I asked permission specifically to raise the question in relation to St. Catherine's College, Sion Hill, with which I am personally most closely acquainted, but I am aware there may be similar problems in relation to St. Angela's College, Lough Gill and the National University of Ireland.  I think the staff and students of the institution will be grateful to the Minister if he will indicate in his reply what his attitude is to the situation obtaining there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in St. Catherine's is that up to comparatively recently St. Catherine's operated a course in home economics which was conducted in accordance with the regulations laid down in Memo E7 issued in January each year by the Department of <Col N="436" /> Education.  The students who followed the course established by these regulations normally acquired a diploma at pass or honours level at the completion of their course.  Now in the most fluid situation relating to higher education as it has developed over the past few years St. Catherine's was among the colleges which apparently decided to explore the possibility of other forms of validation for the award its students would get at the end of their course.  At the same time the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin, for their own good reasons, indicated to this college and, indeed, to a number of other institutions that they were interested in broadening their base and in validating courses that up to then had not led to the award of a university degree.</P>
    <P>I must make it clear that I am not proposing here&mdash;it would be inappropriate&mdash;to go into the merits of who should award a particular qualification and why they should award it, but the facts are that quite some time ago negotiations were undertaken between the authorities of the college and the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin &mdash;negotiations at which the Department of Education were also represented&mdash;to try to discover a way in which the requirements of the Department of Education and the requirements of the college and the requirements of the university could be satisfactorily reconciled.</P>
    <P>In the spring of last year it was generally accepted in St. Catherine's that the courses the college was providing for its students would lead to a degree to be awarded by the authorities of Dublin University.  There was considerable pleasure, I gather, in the college at this prospect.  There was a problem about those students who were <i>en route</i>, particularly the students who were doing their third year in the academic year 1977-78.  It is my understanding of the situation that outside assessors were called in to find out and to tell the college and the university if, in their opinion, the courses that would be followed by these students would reach the appropriate level for the award of a degree and I am informed they said that, if the college made certain changes in its courses, these third-year <Col N="437" /> students in the year 1977-78 would be given a university degree. The inevitable consequence of this was that from approximately last spring&mdash; certainly in relation to the current academic year&mdash;the courses being offered by the college to the students diverged very substantially from the course which traditionally led to the award of a diploma at pass or honours level.  I am unaware of the extent to which divergencies occurred in the other college in Sligo but some of the more obvious divergencies were, for example, in the area of continuous assessment.  The university authorities were keen on continuous assessment, so assessment was introduced into the course.  Lectures were arranged in Trinity College, Dublin, for the 30-odd students concerned.  There were also some important differences in the sociological course followed by the students after the agreement with the university compared with the course followed before that agreement.  The changes meant that practical work was dropped in some areas and increased in other areas.  In general it is, I think, true to say that the course was changed to take account of the recommendations made by the outside assessors called in to find out if third-year students could do a degree examination this summer. There are, as I said, approximately 30 students involved this year but there are 100 students in the college and, even though the immediate problem affects only the final year students, of course all the other students are affected as well because they too have been following a course which has now been altered to take account of the fact that the university is now apparently involved.</P>
    <P>The second-year and first-year students are also affected.  But when I say the third-year students are those immediately involved that is a considerable understatement because the examination in this college traditionally has been held at the beginning of May &mdash;that is, the examination for the diploma.  The Trinity College authorities have proposed examinations at the beginning of June.  Even if you take the further date it is still uncomfortably close.  The students concerned are literally <Col N="438" /> on the last lap of their educational career and they are now faced with the appalling situation that they are preparing for an examination that they do not know they will be allowed to take.</P>
    <P>I understand there was to be a tripartite meeting organised at which the college authorities, the university authorities and the Department would be represented in order to try to sort out the situation.  This meeting was unfortunately cancelled at very short notice and the students who were looking to this meeting to provide a resolution of their difficulties are now faced with a further period of uncertainty which must naturally very seriously affect their ability to concentrate on and work for their examination which is now literally only weeks away.</P>
    <P>The Department's position in relation to the problem the students are facing has been indicated to the college in at least two documents.  One dated 16 February 1978 is headed: Outline of the Department's position in regard to the Home Economics Course. Paragraph 2 reads:</P>
    <P>In the case of the students of St. Catherine's College there is the expectation that a B.Ed. degree of the University of Dublin would be available in 1978 at ordinary level and in later years for people who have done three years and at honours level for people who have done four years.  The Department would hope that the expectation in relation to degrees at ordinary level would be fulfilled.  It would seem desirable, however, that students should not be subjected to more than one examination and that it should be possible for the university authorities to be associated with the diploma examination in such a way as to facilitate the award of degrees.</P>
    <P>About three weeks ago the co-ordinating committee, on which the Department, the college and the university are all represented, circulated a further document under the same heading but with slightly different wording.  The wording of document No. 2&mdash;if I may use the phrase popularised by Mr. de Valera&mdash;was as follows:</P>
    <P>. . . that the Department would <Col N="439" /> hope that the expectation in relation to degrees at ordinary level would be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>That is the same wording as in the original document.  The second sentence is changed.  It reads:</P>
    <P>It would seem desirable, however, that students should not be subjected to more than one examination and that it should be possible for the authorities of the college, the university and the Department to co-operate in relation to one examination in such a way as to facilitate the award of a diploma and a degree.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might parse and analyse the difference between the two documents. The second document seems to be a substantial improvement on the first because in the first document it appears that the university authorities were being asked to accommodate themselves to whatever the Department decided to impose on the college concerned, whereas in the second document there seems to be an acceptance of the fact that there should and could be a reasonable tripartite agreement between the parties concerned that would result, without any unfairness to the students concerned, in the award of both a degree and a diploma.</P>
    <P>The critical question&mdash;and it is the question that the meeting today was supposed to answer&mdash;was whether it is possible for two separate examinations to be held, one for the college of St. Angela's and the other for St. Catherine's College at Sion Hill.  In passing I would point out that last year there were separate papers for education in the two colleges so that a precedent for two separate examinations has been established.</P>
    <P>The need for two separate examinations is clearly obvious.  There has been a divergence of approximately 30 per cent in the courses between the two colleges.  As far as I am aware, the authorities of St. Catherine's College have not sent in, as they used to do when the Department administered a diploma only, their ideas for questions to the Department of Education. <Col N="440" /> If there are to be two separate examinations, one for St. Angela's College and one for St. Catherine's College, the Department, the authorities of St. Catherine's and the university authorities must get together as a matter of urgency to ensure that the students will be able to sit an examination that is related to the course they have studied.</P>
    <P>I find it impossible to believe that the Department would actually insist that the students sit an examination for a course that had been followed in a different college and which they had not followed themselves.  I am also informed that the authorities of TCD have said that if the Department insist on the students in St. Catherine's doing this they will withdraw completely from the validation procedures.  One could hardly blame them.  The critical question behind all this is in relation to the employment of the 30 students concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my position clear.  Students are now heading into the last three or four weeks of their course.  Their peace of mind&mdash; if anybody facing an examination has anything remotely resembling peace of mind&mdash;has been completely undermined by the failure of the Department of Education to indicate what kind of examination they will be given and what kind of qualification they will be awarded at the end.  The most important thing is that this examination must have the sanction of the Department of Education because if it does not have that sanction one has a very clear idea of what the representatives of the Department of Education on the Teachers' Registration Council will say when this year's graduates from St. Catherine's College come to be registered as secondary teachers because, of course, without this registration they will not be entitled to any incremental salary paid by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>The failure to hold the meeting today was literally the last straw for the students.  Matters have been postponed and they have been considerably distressed about the situation.  To my mind it is quite extraordinary that a situation that arose more than a year ago and which they thought had been resolved a year ago is now facing them still unresolved and is something which threatens not only their success in the examinations but their possibilities for earning a livelihood afterwards.  Even if the Minister tells us now what will happen, it may be too late for some students.</P>

      <P>In the few brief months he has been in this House I have learned to assess the mountains Deputy Horgan says are in labour and inevitably a ridiculous little mouse is born.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke of a problem in the Department of Education.  I want to tell the Deputy and the House that there is no problem in the Department of Education.  On 16 February of this year the Department issued a document to Dublin University, to St. Catherine's College and to the committee in which it was stated that the students who had entered the college up to now had come in under Memo V/57, not Memo seven, as Deputy Horgan stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said seven. I thought that was what he said and I checked with the Secretary of the Department who confirmed what I thought.  In any event that is a minor point.  Students who came in under that memo had certain expectations and among those expectations was that at the end of a three-year course they would sit for a diploma.  On this diploma the Department of Education awarded pass and honours credits. Deputy Horgan referred to that in introducing this debate.  I should like to emphasise this important point: getting an honours in this diploma meant for the student an extra £500, approximately, per annum when working. This diploma at honours level is recognised by the registration council as such.  It is recognised in the Department as attracting a very substantial extra increment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education have a legal and moral obligation to the students to see to it that the possibility of earning full salary on the pass diploma and a salary plus honours increment on the honours diploma should be available to them.  Under the terms of Memo V/57, the memo under which they were taken into the college&mdash;St. Catherine's, Sion Hill&mdash;they are entitled to that expectation.  The university then enters the scene and we are glad of that but there is a problem. The university will award a pass degree <Col N="443" /> after three years.  There is no possibility of getting honours with that degree so that Miss X, for example, who does the degree simpliciter without any reference to the diploma will not have the possibility of distinguishing herself and on going to work attracting a £500 increment for honours qualification.  Therefore, the Department feel they have a legal obligation, an obligation which could be pursued in the courts by a student, and properly so, to provide an examination for the student which will give her the possibility of earning an honours increment.</P>
    <P>There is no problem as far as the Department of Education are concerned. As far as the University of Dublin are concerned they can make their own arrangements with regard to the conferring of the degree.  The Department of Education do not want to deprive the student of the possibility of earning almost £10 per week extra if she achieves an honours standard in her diploma.  The Deputy mentioned that his interest was in the students and I believe that to be true.  It is my interest also and it has been an abiding interest with me all my life.  I should like to reassure the students that, despite the scaremongering, not very emotional, of Deputy Horgan, the possibility of their gaining an honours diploma recognised by the registration council and attracting a substantial extra salary is a commitment of ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

      <P>Will the examination be based on the course?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up a point Deputy Horgan made about continuous assessment.  Somehow or other in his simplistic way he assumes that continuous assessment if it has taken place will inhibit the student who is taking our diploma.  If it is a valid educational pursuit I contend that it should enhance the student's possibility of gaining a diploma or even an honours diploma. There is no problem at all with regard to the degree.  As the House is aware the universities are autonomous in so far as the setting of the degrees and the naming of standards are concerned. The University of Dublin have <Col N="444" /> decided that in so far as getting an honours degree in home economics is concerned they will demand a further year.  Obviously, there is an area here where further discussions will have to take place but we cannot have the laughable situation where we could be pursued in the courts because, just to suit the university, we did not make available to a student the possibility of earning a substantial extra salary.</P>
      <P>We recruited people under certain conditions and we are legally and morally bound, and bound by the interest which I share with Deputy Horgan in the welfare of students, to provide an examination for the students which will give them the opportunity of getting an honours degree.  I am a little worried about what the Deputy said, that what the Department have done has put an extra worry on the students.  I want to assure students about the sole concern of the Department.  I understand that the Leader of the Labour Party has a daughter doing her degree this year and I would like him to tell her, a very intelligent contributor to this whole discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will answer that later. Deputy Horgan said that the University of Dublin intended to withdraw from the scene altogether.  That was news to me and I ask the Deputy to name the administrative council in the University of Dublin that informed him because I do not have such information. If he does not have from an authoritative source in the University of Dublin a statement to that effect then he is totally irresponsible and should not be the spokesman for an important political party here</P>

The Department's legal and moral obligation and the Department's concern for <Col N="446" /> the student is to make sure that there will be available to them an examination which will facilitate them in earning, if they reach the grades, £500 per year extra when they start working.

      <P>A claim for injury benefit was received on 29 December 1977 from the person referred to by the Deputy.  The claim was in respect of an accident which was stated to have occured at his place of work on 9 December 1977.  It was necessary to seek confirmation of the accident from his employer and, pending the completion of these inquiries, the question of entitlement to disability benefit was examined.  According to his insurance record the person concerned did not have sufficient contributions to qualify for that benefit but, following investigations, arrears of contributions were collected and his entitlement to disability benefit was established.</P>
      <P>Disability benefit was, accordingly, awarded to him on 13 March 1978 and has been in payment since that date. It has now been accepted that the claimant was injured in an occupational accident on 9 December 1977 and injury benefit has been awarded from that date.  A cheque in respect of the injury benefit due to him, taking account of the disability benefit already paid, has now been sent to the claimant.</P>
      <P>His entitlement to pay-related benefit is under examination.</P>

Expenditure on the local authority housing construction programme generally will be reviewed later this year and further moneys may be allocated within available resources to the council to enable them to make additional starts later this year.</P>
