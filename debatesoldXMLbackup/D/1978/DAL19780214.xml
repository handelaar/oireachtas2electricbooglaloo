      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.  All prisons and places of detention are supplied with books from the public county and city libraries.  The local authorities and librarians concerned have been most helpful and co-operative in supplying a full range of books including light and serious fiction and books of general interest including some advanced text books.  Care is taken to ensure that all reasonable requirements are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> In Mountjoy prison the library contains more than 1,000 books and about half of that number are replaced at intervals of a few months.  In the circumstances, the offer of some books by the organisation in question has to be regarded as a propagandist exercise, a fact which was in any case evident from the advance notice which representatives of the communications media had of the proposed handing-over and from a document subsequently issued by them in relation to the affair, a document containing statements that are not in accordance with readily ascertainable facts.</P>

      <P>I received the report of the Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice on 14 December last.  The report, which is long and detailed, is at present with the printers.  It will be published as soon as printed copies are available, which I hope will be within a few weeks.  In the meantime, I am proceeding with my examination of the report with a view to submitting proposals to the Government as soon as possible and I shall, of course, be dealing with the question of legal aid for particular types of cases&mdash;including family law cases&mdash;as an interim measure in that context.</P>

    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of applications for permission to marry received by his Department in each of the past five years from persons serving terms of imprisonment, distinguishing between (a) prisoners who wish to marry other prisoners, and (b) prisoners who wish to marry non-prisoners; the number of such applications granted, refused, or under consideration; the criteria adopted in reaching his decision; and if he will give permission for marriages of prisoners in all cases in which the applicant prisoner and his or her intended spouse are expecting or are the parents of a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No special record of such applications is kept but it is known that they have been few in number.  A check of records which may not be exhaustive has shown that persons serving sentences of imprisonment have married in four instances in the period in question.  One such marriage took place in each of the years 1972, 1973, 1977 and 1978.  The marriage in 1978 was between people each of whom was serving a sentence of imprisonment.  In the other three cases, only the man was serving a sentence.  The marriage in 1972 and 1978 took place within the prison; the others did not.</P>
      <P>No specific rules have been established for dealing with applications by prisoners to be accorded facilities for marriage and I think that that is as it should be as each case is different and is considered individually having regard to the particular facts relating to it.  The length of sentence is an important factor and the fact that a child had been born to the couple or was expected would be among the other factors taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the Garda Síochána have been consulted by the Department of the Environment and by local authorities regarding the maintenance of law and order on the streets and the proper development of this country's urban environment; if so, the nature of those discussions; and if any proposals for action have emanated from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together. While there are major differences of opinion between persons who have studied crime and its causation, it is scarcely open to doubt that certain environmental factors, such as bad housing and lack of recreation areas, can be a contributory cause.  This, however, is obviously well known to the agencies dealing directly with these problems both at national and local level, and I would not agree that special or formal discussions between those agencies on the one hand and my Department and the Garda Síochána on the other hand are likely to be either necessary or worth while.  Where in any particular locality there is an exceptional environmental problem, as has been the case from time to time in Dublin, for example, the Garda Síochána have found that the housing and planning authorities were very well aware of it and were doing everything they could to improve the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together. A review of the whole area of private rented accommodation which was begun during the term of office of the previous Government was recently completed in the Department of the Environment, including the workings of the Rent Restrictions Acts, 1960 and 1967, and the supply and condition of rented accommodation generally. The results of that review have been circulated to other Departments and the replies are awaited.  This is directly relevant to questions that arise in extending control to rented accommodation not now covered by rent restriction legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that, while the Government are in favour of amending legislation, they recognise&mdash; and this was made explicitly clear on our behalf, before the election, to the National Flatdwellers Association&mdash; that in particular any legislation which operated to keep down rents of flats to <Col N="1097" /> an unreasonable or unfair degree would not only be unjust to the owners but detrimental to the interests of those needing rented accommodation, both by reducing the amount of new accommodation coming on to the market and by discouraging the proper maintenance of existing housing stock. A system that would be fair to both sides and that would not be against the public interest is what is to be aimed for and this must take time to produce, all the more so since it may well be necessary to see how existing accommodation that is subject to rent control would fare in the context of such new legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a guarantee that the pledges given in the pre-election charter of rights which was circulated by his party to the flatland areas of the cities will be implemented in full?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When must we expect the legislation arising from the review which has now been finalised, as it would appear that the pledges given did not hint at the kind of delays we are now experiencing?  When do we see some action?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <P>The Garda say that they are taking all reasonable steps to prevent this type of offence and that there has been no noticeable deterioration in the position in recent times, either as regards <Col N="1102" /> numbers of vehicles taken or as regards numbers recovered.  For instance, the number taken in December last, while higher than in December, 1976, was lower than in December, 1975. Most such incidents are in fact the work of young people returning from functions such as dances who take the cars to get themselves home and then abandon them.  Car owners can greatly help to reduce such incidents by the use of steering locks, burglar alarms or other suitable devices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together. First, I do not accept that what was agreed at Sunningdale in relation to a police authority has any relevance at this stage.  Secondly, it is common knowledge that special and serious problems have existed in the North in relation to the acceptability of the RUC by all sections of the people of that area and accordingly the arguments for a police authority there are not necessarily of any relevance here. Similarly, the position in England, for <Col N="1103" /> instance, is different as the police there are not organised as a national force and it is worth bearing in mind that the police authority for the biggest force in England, namely the London Metropolitan Police, is in fact a Government Minister, namely the Home Secretary.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals now or in the near future to put to the Government for the setting up of a police authority and consideration of it is not a priority as far as I am concerned but obviously it is not something I exclude completely for the future.</P>

      <P>There are no rigid rules governing the matter of temporary release of persons in custody and I believe that this is as it should be, as an important consideration is the assessment of the individual offender by those in the various services who come in contact with him while he is serving his sentence.  Other considerations that call for an individual, flexible, approach include such matters <Col N="1110" /> as his domestic circumstances and the availability of a job for him.</P>

Would the Minister consider trying to facilitate the return to public life of the ex-prisoner, particularly from the point of view of his entitlement to social welfare benefits or assistance of some kind?

      <P>The Deputy will probably be aware that reasonable progress has been made in regard to providing extra educational facilities for inmates.  We are becoming fairly sophisticated in the use of television and cassettes and things like that.  One of the greatest problems we have is in providing staff, teachers to do the work they are trained to do.  If I could overcome that difficulty, which is a fairly serious one, we could have a pretty clear run at doing other things. For the Deputy's information&mdash;I know he is interested&mdash;I might add that we are commencing the building of a purpose-built unit for education and work training in Arbour Hill.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that in many areas of law English &ldquo;Law Books&rdquo;, which are now becoming increasingly out of date, are the only authoritative books available; and if he will consider the establishment of a commission to compile, edit and publish a comprehensive series on the Laws of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of books on various aspects of Irish law have been published privately in recent years, including a series under the auspices of the Incorporated Law Society under the general title &ldquo;Modern Law Publications&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there is a long-standing arrangement whereby public funds are available to support the writing and publication of legal texts.  This arrangement operates in conjunction with the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting, a body which includes the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Attorney General and representatives both of the Bar Council and of the Incorporated Law Society. Under that arrangement, three legal textbooks have been published and three others are at various stages of preparation.  I can think of no better qualified body than this to encourage and support the writing of text books and I see no point in setting up some other body to deal with the matter. The very first requirement, for any text book, is the willingness of a competent person to undertake the job of writing it and it is that, and not the absence of funds, which is the limiting factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.  Although I have not fully completed my review of matters relating to the questions raised by the Deputy, I have made sufficient progress to be convinced that it is neither necessary nor desirable to establish a State-sponsored body or agency to administer the Government's development assistance programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I feel, and indeed have held this view for some time, that there is a strong case to be made for the setting-up of an Advisory Council on Development Co-operation. I am at the moment, therefore, considering how best such an advisory council might be constituted with a view to putting a proposal to the Government on its establishment as soon as possible.  In this regard, and as the advice which may be tendered by the proposed council could well concern Ministers other than myself, I have sought the views of relevant <Col N="1119" /> Cabinet colleagues on the question.  I hope very shortly also to hold discussions with groups outside Government, including the voluntary agencies, in order to proceed with as broad a consensus as possible on what, in my view, would be a most significant step for development co-operation in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Having consulted with his colleagues the Minister felt that an advisory council in this context would be the proper thing.  Consultations are still continuing with his colleagues.  He also suggests that persons who might be consulted in addition to his Cabinet colleagues might be, DEVCO, APSO, voluntary agencies such as Concern, Trócaire, Gorta and other agencies.  He would consult with the trade unions, industry, agriculture and other bodies including those representing women, churches, the media, the universities and so on before setting up this advisory council. The Deputy will appreciate that it will be quite a substantial body.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply, I am concerned with the time. I would like the Minister to indicate now, having rejected the idea of a State-sponsored body and the executive people that implied, when such a council will be established?  The Minister of State has already indicated that he is in favour of such a council and therefore must have some views on its formation and structure.</P>

These are all matters which will take time, so I do not want to be trite with the Deputy when I say that the Minister it is hoped, will have the advisory council set up in the near future.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State not aware that the bodies directly concerned with overseas development aid, some of whom he refers to in his reply, have been unanimous in seeking the establishment of a development agency to manage development aid and that this was the intention of the preceding Government, as I have declared on their behalf prior to change of Government?  Does he not accept that it is a most retrograde step to reject this proposal which operates successfully in a number of northern European countries subject to overall political control of the Minister in question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider this a retrograde step; it is a very progressive step.  This is bringing the question into the hands and counsel of people effectively outside the civil service, which is not a good or bad thing in itself.  I consider that the Minister's step is very progressive.  The fact that the previous Government thought the proposal was right does not necessarily make it right for this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is not answering my question. I accept that development of the council is a useful step and one which was contemplated.  It is the rejection of the agencies who manage development aid which is retrograde.  Would the Minister of State not agree that the statements published in defence of this, suggesting that it is impossible because the Minister must retain control, do not justify this retrograde step?  In a number of countries in northern Europe there are such agencies operating subject to the overall political control of the relevant Minister but otherwise managing the development aid programme.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I will take Questions Nos. 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>My attitude and that of the Government will be clear from the fact that an application from the organisers, the Irish Tug-of-War Association, to the Minister for Education for a grant to meet part of the cost of the event referred to was refused after consultation with my Department because it appeared to us likely that the South African team which proposed to take part would not be selected on a genuinely multi-racial basis.</P>
      <P>I may also mention that the Irish Tug-of-War Association was informed some time ago, along with other international sporting organisations, of the Government's firm attachment to the Olympic principle of non-discrimination in sport.  The attitude of the Government on this issue was also brought to the attention of the association at the end of 1976 when they proposed to take part in the World Tug-of-War Championship held in South Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister of State to explain why the increase in official development assistance in 1978, namely .04 per cent of 1978 GNP, falls short of the target increase of .05 per cent of 1978 GNP, especially as the process of catching up on the shortfall forced on the previous Government by financial stringency in 1976 was started by the National Coalition Government last year, when the increase significantly exceeded .05 per cent of that year's GNP?  Why the step backwards, in the light of the assurances of the previous Minister and his enthusiasm in Opposition for moving ahead in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the former Minister for Foreign Affairs is aware, the increase this year is 32 per cent over last year, and it represents the intention of the Government to aim at the .7 per cent of GNP prescribed by the United Nations.  There has been quite a substantial increase on this year's figures over last year's and previous figures.  Taking all in all, it represents the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government to give aid where it is so urgently required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is .04 per cent as against last year's .055 per cent?  Will he <Col N="1124" /> accept that the European Economic Community and other national agencies have increased their development assistance between 1974 and 1979 by .05 per cent of each year's GNP taking one year with another, and that this would involve an ODA level of about £16 million in 1979?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If progress was to be made as the Deputy has outlined it would be probably £16 million in 1979, but that is not the reality of the position.  The scheme was begun in the lifetime of the last Government and has been continued and improved upon by the present Government.  I think the Deputy would agree that 32 per cent increase over last year is not bad at all.  It does not represent the ultimate but it shows a genuine concern. This figure has been bandied about quite a lot but there are quite a number of other areas of aid that could be added to that figure of £9.6 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether, in view of the grave national crisis now arising from the dispute in the telecommunications section of his Department, he will now personally intervene with a view to resolving the problem without further delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret the inconvenience and hardship caused to users of the telecommunications services and to the public generally as a result of action taken by certain engineering staff in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained to the House last week the background to the current difficulties.  The industrial action began in May 1977, and has continued in a series of strikes and other acts aimed at disrupting the service which have involved groups of staff for different periods in many centres.  Various efforts have been made over the period through the Employer Labour Conference and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to bring the industrial action to an end.  I accepted and implemented the proposals in every case and these would have allowed any claims, problems or proposals to be processed speedily through the agreed procedure.  The IPOEU also <Col N="1157" /> accepted these proposals but did not honour them.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that I should accede to truce proposals.  In fact, I have twice previously done so and cancelled all suspensions, but the agreed proposals were not honoured by the union.  The alleged issues on which the present industrial action is being taken are related to a productivity deal, to work practice and to staff rules and regulations.  I explained in detail to the House that these cannot be the real reasons.  If they were, they could be dealt with within the procedures agreed with all unions in the Department and the Department are more than willing to deal with them within these procedures.  I have already guaranteed that all problems will be dealt with speedily and sympathetically as soon as normal work is resumed.</P>
    <P>The problem has been that some members of the executive of the union have been campaigning openly against the executive and threatening to bring the Department&mdash;that means the community&mdash;to its knees by a disruption of the telecommunications services. The response to my appeal to the union last month to implement the settlement arranged by ICTU was the withdrawal of &ldquo;key&rdquo; men from the Central Telephone Exchange.  That, in itself, was an unwarranted escalation of the dispute since at that time no one was on strike or suspended in the Central Telephone Exchange.  The withdrawal of the key men by itself would have adverse effects on the telephone service only over a period. Shortly afterwards, however, widespread interference began with the circuits, and the service began rapidly to slide to a halt.  Service was grievously affected by Friday evening last.  Management checks over last week-end established 1. that very large numbers of trunk circuits were out of service because power and other essential supplies had been disconnected; 2. the western coaxial cable system which supplies the telephone service to the west and north-west was found to be out of service because a wire had been disconnected; 3. large numbers of trunk circuits were found to be out of service as a <Col N="1158" /> result of being wired together in such a manner as to make them unusable.</P>
    <P>Management succeeded in bringing a very large number of these circuits back into operation and, by 8 o'clock on Monday morning, very considerable progress had been made in restoring full service.  Shortly afterwards a number of suspended or striking technicians attended at the exchange saying they were coming back in response to my appeal to return to work.  Soon after, it was found that most of the work done over the week-end had been undone and the country was isolated again. Some of these men refused to leave the exchange on being directed elsewhere and a court order for their ejection had to be obtained.  This morning there was a similar attempt to invade the exchange.  I am glad to say that efforts by management last night and today have succeeded in restoring some services.</P>
    <P>As I outlined in reply on the adjournment last week, the basic consideration here, dealing as we are with an essential service to the public, is that there must be orderly, peaceful procedures for settling claims and problems.  If these are to be set aside, then the service will be subject to disruption at the whim of any individual or group within the service and the community will suffer.  Such machinery is, of course, available.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme, which caters for almost all civil servants operates to the advantage of the staff and the public.  There are also domestic procedures agreed with the Post Office unions for the solution of problems.  The agreements are there but, as I have said on a number of occasions, none of them is sacrosanct. For example, if the civil service staff organisations concluded that the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme needed to be changed, I have no doubt the Minister for the Public Service would consider any proposals made to him in the matter.  Similarly, in relation to the agreements operating in my Department, if the various unions urge that these are in need of change or, indeed, if they consider they are <Col N="1159" /> not operating as they were intended to, I will gladly consider any complaints or proposals for change.</P>
    <P>The kernal of this whole dispute, and it is a matter those who are calling on me to settle this dispute must consider, is whether there is going to be an orderly way of resolving claims and problems within my Department.  It seems to me that what some of those who are calling on me to settle the issue are saying is that I should set aside the orderly procedures at the instance of a minority group within one of the civil service unions taking unofficial action, because that was what was involved here.  To accede to this would be a recipe for chaos and would undermine the position of all the unions who are prepared to honour the agreements they have made.</P>
    <P>The way to end this dispute is for the union and the staff to call off their industrial action and return to the use of agreed procedures for settling claims and problems.  I have repeatedly appealed to them to do that and assured them that, if they did so, I would give their claims and problems urgent and sympathetic consideration. This is the only way forward.  I would hope the union and the staff would realise this and act accordingly.  They have nothing to lose and everything to gain by adopting this course.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to Deputies on all sides of the House and to the public generally to use any influence they may have with those involved to get them to accept that this is the only responsible way for dealing with whatever problems they may have, and so bring to an end the crippling effects of their actions on the community at large.</P>

During the seven months I have been in office there has been a constant repetition&mdash; as happened during the time the previous <Col N="1161" /> Government were in power&mdash;of certain actions by this particular union and I think it will be agreed that I exercised restraint.  There were many occasions when I felt it had become necessary for me to take certain measures but so long as I felt there was any possibility of bringing the dispute to an end I continued to exercise restraint.  I want to appeal again to the members of the union and to their executive to go back to work.  As I said before, I can assure them of every sympathy in dealing with the problems facing them.</P>

      <P>When speaking on the budget last Thursday I made the initial point that the budget was cohesive, courageous and imaginative. It is putting fairly and squarely to the people a situation where they can improve themselves and the country.  The magnitude of the budget was mentioned and, in particular, the sophisticated means by which it can be implemented. Among those I mentioned were the various banking activities and the terms of business that were influenced by the different Governments as to how the banks conducted their business.  I made a plea that the running overdraft be restored.  The abolition of that facility to the business and farming community was a retrograde step.  In the present circumstances it would help the budgetary requirements if it were reintroduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the activities of the banks in their ability to introduce foreign capital here for the benefit of <Col N="1162" /> the people as a whole.  I also made a plea that the declaration of the £70 interest in the implementation of that policy would be a positive step forward. Undoubtedly the budget is promoting a positive encouragement of industry and in this context the semi-State bodies, with their access to large amounts of capital and their ability to use it, should be used to the maximum.  These companies have within them entrepreneurial ability of a very high order but occasionally this ability is not utilised to its full extent or to the extent hoped for in a budget of this kind.  I suggest that the typing of this ability to a narrow concept of just providing jobs might not be in the best interests of attaining the budgetary goals.  I would suggest that if some of these companies have middle and top management&mdash;and they undoubtedly have such people&mdash; who are capable of using foreign capital and even foreign labour they should be allowed to do so in order that every facet of our national ability may be utilised for the benefit of all. For instance, I suggest that the buying of hotels abroad and staffing them is a worth-while contribution towards the budgetary aims.  I suggest also that Irish shipping should not be tied down so tightly that they must use 100 per cent Irish materials and labour if there is a market in a far-off place that can be used for the generation of capital. If middle and top management is capable of benefiting the country perhaps by unorthodox methods, they should be given the go-ahead and allowed to do so.  In certain circumstances it might be necessary and it would be to the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>The whole aim of the budget has been towards job creation and wealth creation, coupled with a strong social bias towards a situation where people can help themselves.  The situation here so far as health is concerned is that a health policy that is openended is bound to fail.  The aim of this budget where situations are created in which people can help themselves is much more practical than telling the people we will give them what they want.  It is much more practical that people should be in a position to pay their own bills and look after <Col N="1163" /> themselves rather than having to depend on the State to do it for them. The budget is a practical step towards that direction and is worthy of support.  Practical solutions of this type are much more realistic than empty formulae that may be based on foreign ideological ideas that are totally irrelevant to this country.</P>
    <P>In this context the abolition of wealth tax has removed the doctrinaire bogey from the back of every businessman, farmer and fisherman. Its retention always carried the fear of the lowering of the threshold and if the previous Government had their way all of us would be paying this tax.  There is no doubt that the wealth tax was totally unsuited to a country drastically in need of establishing new businesses and expanding existing enterprises.  Therefore, its effect was one of stagnation and it was a typical example of doctrinaire legislation enacted to satisfy empty egos with no regard whatever for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>The mild restructuring of farmer taxation must be constructive in its effect.  This restructuring must encourage farmers to keep books and to conduct their businesses on a more businesslike and budgetary-conscious basis.  In turn, it must have an enervating effect on farm business.  In this context it must be said that no longer can the finger be pointed at farmers or the farming community to suggest that they are not meeting their obligations with regard to financing the machinery of State.  Therefore, hopefully, we can expect that the climate of urban-rural misunderstanding or even animosity that the previous Government allowed to develop will be removed.  In some cases farmers are paying more than their fair share of taxation, in the case of low taxation and high rates.  I suggest that occasionally a rate burden may be heavier than an income tax ability.  I have no doubt the farmers will rise to the occasion.  Agriculture and its associated businesses are the most important source of wealth in the country.  The greatest achievement of Fianna Fáil in various Governments <Col N="1164" /> was the introduction of the value added products that this industry produced in a basic form.  The meat industry was a product of such encouragement and it is commented on in the budget.</P>
    <P>In this context we must be proud of this fantastic industry that we have pioneered in Europe.  There is no other country in that Continent that can say it has reached such high standards so quickly in what was virtually a new business.  In some ways we are world leaders in this regard.  Confused marketing conditions exist within the industry at the moment.  It is important that the meat trade play its part, along with the other job creating industries that exist.  With regard to the carcase export trade, it is a pity this is used as an excuse because it may be more profitable to export a cargo of carcase than the value added cuts which are more profitable to the country.  If there is a situation where it may be marginally more attractive financially to export carcases than it is to export the packed product, I would remind the factories that they have a duty to the farmers, their workers and to the country as a whole to continue this business even though it may not be quite so profitable as another line.  The supply position is there and there is a sufficient number of cattle to keep people at work.  The management of the factories have a heavy responsibility in this regard.  There is no use in pointing the finger at a working man and saying he is disruptive when management can be disruptive in a much more effective and lazy way.</P>
    <P>The meat industry is worthy of praise.  On occasion, however, it is a little lax in taking advantage of the opportunities that exist.  On the question of the sale of animals, it is right that all doors should be opened and the live animal trade allowed to coexist with the dead meat trade. The only question I would raise is in regard to calf exports.  Some of the countries importing our calves subsidise the production of beef from these young animals.  If we are to get the best benefits from the EEC we must have the same level of support <Col N="1165" /> right through the industry from the production of the calf to the sale of the finished product in consumer acceptable form.</P>
    <P>This budget is an affirmation of the people's ability to provide for themselves an opportunity for expanding and increasing prosperity.  There is no whinging and whining about the budget.  It puts fairly and squarely before the people the fact that they are being given an opportunity which was sadly lacking over the last four or five years.  It is in total contrast to and refutation of the despicable statement of Lloyd George when we achieved our independence: &ldquo;We have given them a sea of grass.  Let them drown in it.&rdquo;  This sea of grass we have, in fact, turned to our advantage.  We have through the efforts of Bord Bainne and the Irish farmers turned it into a rising tide. As I said earlier, this has given a fantastic impetus to a new industry, namely, the meat industry.  Though we may have been treated with despicable disdain by people who thought they knew better, in fact this budget says firmly that we do not have to go anywhere with a begging bowl. We can stand on our own feet and make real achievements.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to quote my colleague's predecessor, a person held in great esteem and affection by many in this House: &ldquo;Indeed, great things are happening in our time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak at a time when many have already spoken and at a time when there has been a great deal of reaction in the media and in what we refer to as the grassroots to this budget.  It is fair to say everybody was very pleased with the budget.  Anyone who pays income tax is pleased since the increased allowance will mean virtually more money in his or her pocket.  These are facts recognised in the general reaction to the budget by commentators, political journalists and, for want of a better description, by ordinary people.  The benefit received is not necessarily an equal benefit.  Deputy Callanan pointed out correctly in an interruption when Deputy Cluskey was speaking that <Col N="1166" /> in a system of percentage increase those with more automatically get more.  After a week and a half during which the budget has been tested, on the surface so to speak, in the crude way that budgets are tested, everybody is fairly happy.  The pint is the same price.  Tobacco and cigarettes are the same price.  More money is coming in by way of tax allowance and, while borrowing is now up to 13 per cent, that really does not matter a damn to the ordinary man in the street. Borrowing on that scale is a Disneylike figure, a Funland figure.  It does not make sense, or rhyme, or reason to him.  In a sense this is the tragedy of this whole debate because there are major fundamental assumptions and implications implicit in the budget which we can only look at now and possibly project.  There is no way of measuring the implications and assumptions until such time as time itself works out and tests the assumptions of the Minister for Finance and of his economics assistant, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true&mdash;it is only fair to mention it&mdash;that the proposals outlined in the manifesto have in the main been implemented.  The promises made with regard to tax reductions have been met, and so on.  To that extent one can say that the country was provided with a choice back in June and the country made a choice and so this budget is a justification of the decision made in June and people have no argument against what has been done.  I would dearly love to think that all elections and political debates were as considered and measured as that kind of argument would suggest. I would like to think that everybody who got the various pieces of literature from the different political groups sat down, measured them in a comprehensive way and came to a decision as to what was the best for the country and for themselves over the next four years and then went out to vote.  Unfortunately&mdash;perhaps fortunately, but I think unfortunately &mdash;all of us know that is just not the case.  The goodies were spotlighted and the people grabbed the goodies.  I am not at all sure they recognised <Col N="1167" /> there was a possibility the goodies might ultimately prove to be so much Dead Sea fruit.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken a very specific direction in this budget in regard to economic development, a direction from which they obviously will not deviate in the next three or four years. This is the first budget of this Fianna Fáil Administration and there are certain matters about which I would like some clarification.  There are certain principles which would appear to be basically major guidelines which will apply over the next three or four years. That being the case, we can begin to sharpen up on some assumptions and projections, not for this year in which we are in fact borrowing up to 13 per cent, but for the years ahead when borrowing will have to be reduced, as the Minister himself has told us.  What is the direction this budget is taking?  Let me quote from the speech of the Minister for Finance on 1 February at column 375 of Volume 303 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this budget is designed to create the conditions under which the private sector can move ahead and take over as a prime generator of economic growth and employment.  One of the most important ways in which a Government can set this process in train is by so tailoring the taxes which business has to bear as to ensure that the spirit of enterprise and expansion is positively encouraged.</P>
    <P>The budget provisions very generously create that sort of climate and, if one compares the provisions of this budget with last year's budget, the enticement, if that is the correct word, for the private sector has probably never been as positive or as constructive as it is now.  Added to that is an economy which is, according to a great many commentators, in very good shape.  We have a rising population, a population rising faster than at any time since pre-1841.  We have an economy which is beginning to come out of a major recession, slowly but nevertheless much quicker than any of its counterparts in the EEC.  And we have a Government turning its attention, its hopes <Col N="1168" /> and aspirations to what it describes as the private sector, not that the private sector should become very wealthy but that the private sector will fulfil the objectives we all have for it, providing full employment for all our population. Whether that full employment is described as being an unemployment level of somewhere in the region of 3 or 4 per cent or indeed full employment in the straight arithmetical sense, it implies a figure of job creation that has never previously been achieved by any combination of public or private sector enterprise in our economy since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>That is why I seriously worry at the correctness of the strategy and assumptions made by the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in Government. I have no doubts about the clarity with which they were made.  I have no doubt about the way in which they are presented.  That is clear and explicit but I have a lot of doubts about whether the ship they are now proposing to sail can in fact carry all the passengers that were promised board and passage last June.  As a socialist and a member of the Labour Party and someone who was reared in a business family I accept the private sector on its own terms.  I accept that when somebody says he believes in private enterprise he means what he says, that he means &ldquo;private&rdquo; and &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo;.  I accept that if such a person's motivation to be in business is in order to create wealth and they are committed to private enterprise that such a person means for himself, his family or share-holders. The Government are being somewhat dishonest, either objectively or consciously&mdash;I genuinely think it is a more objective dishonesty rather than any cynicism on their part&mdash;if they expect the private sector to create jobs for the sake of creating jobs or if they say they expect the private sector, availing of all the incentives that have been provided for it in this and previous budgets, are going to consciously plough back that money with the explicit purpose of creating more employment.</P>
    <P>There were a lot of aspirations at <Col N="1169" /> the end of the budget speech and we had a lot of aspirations, hopes and desires by Deputy Fox that this would happen but there is very little evidence, economic or otherwise, to suggest that it will and that is where my worry begins.  It is a big worry.  This year we are borrowing, as a once-off operation according to the Minister for Finance, a massive amount of capital in order to finance a programme which was laid out in the manifesto.  We are borrowing that money to fund capital projects such as those announced to-day by the Minister for Health and to meet deficits in our current account in order to create the environment of enterprise to make the cash and capital available so that the economy can take off and reach some level of self-generating growth.</P>
    <P>The economy at the moment, if one takes the analysis of the Minister for Finance in his speech, has come through a recession which was unprecedented in terms of ferocity since that experience between 1929 and 1932 and out of which the western world did not truly come until the beginning of the Second World War.  Our economy is now growing faster than any other economy in the EEC.  Inflation, from November to November of last year, was about 11 or 12 per cent and there is every justification to think that it should be down to 7 per cent by April or May this year.  The rapid rise in unemployment figures which was seen as a result of the international recession of 1973-74 has been stopped and stemmed even though the population continues to grow.  As far as we can gather consumer demand is picking up substantially in the Irish economy.  The Government are borrowing a lot of money at a time when the economy is beginning to flex its muscles and exercise its own domestic demand for capital and cash.  They are justifying that borrowing, that figure of 13 per cent, by saying that the National Coalition cannot argue with that because they borrowed more at one stage and spent it in a way that was not even as productive as the Government are proposing to spend it.  One cannot make such comparisons.  The National Coalition borrowed money at a time when virtually nobody else was borrowing <Col N="1170" /> money, when the private sector, performing to its own logical set of rules and criteria, decided that it was neither wise nor profitable to invest money, that it was neither wise nor profitable to look after unemployment, that it was neither wise nor profitable to worry about the national objective and whether the rising tide was going to carry all boats.</P>
    <P>The private sector, is now and will always be concerned about its own boat.  During the period of the recession it kept its money where it could control it and did not invest it.  I have seen it argued by a number of people that if the borrowing was not made then by the National Coalition Government a lot of money would have left permanently or would not have had any outlet to be utilised.  What is the effect of making this extra cash available at a time when demand is rising?  This extra cash is being spread in buckshot fashion across the country in one shape or another, in tax allowances, the abolition of car tax and rates and the effective reduction in the price of drink and cigarettes because no additional excise duty has been put on those commodities. There have been a number of projections and one rightly says that it is going to be initially inflationary in its impact because industry, and the consumer sector to a certain extent, is already going at a fairly rapid level and is pretty much at full stretch.  I would like to see those detailed figures for myself but assuming that statement is right a lot of this cash will be spread out in all directions, some of it on imports, as has been argued before, and therefore this borrowed money will not have the effect of providing a base or a threshold whereby we will get this self-generating growth that the budget speech looks for.</P>
    <P>This buckshot approach of scattering money in all directions in the hope that some of it might stick and create some kind of employment, is being adopted with borrowed money in the main on the full public notice that it can only last for one year and on condition that there is wage restraint of 5 per cent.  We have not heard the end of these wage negotiations either because the Minister, as I understood <Col N="1171" /> him to say in his speech, would be in order in coming back here in October and stating that while the country badly needed a national pay agreement, that level was reached not at the 5 per cent that he and his colleagues wanted but at 8 per cent now being finalised.  He will then tell us that he gave us fair notice in this budget that any excess above the 5 per cent would have to be taken back in some shape or other.  It would be unwise for anybody who feels that the discussions on either taxation or on wage levels are over because the Minister has given himself the perfect out in his speech.  We have a situation where the money is being scattered all around the place but largely in the direction of consumers or in massive incentives to private industry to spend or to invest.  In order to do that there is wage restraint on behalf of, largely speaking, the PAYE sector.  They are being asked to restrain their legitimate demands for a share in this increase of growth in order that the economy might grow, in order that more jobs might be provided and in order that there would be additional employment for their friends or colleagues or their own children.  I cannot see in that speech any hard correlation between the offer extended to the trade union movement and the suggestion if they restrained their demands jobs would be specifically provided in the private sector.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the commitment in the public service.  I like the distinction between the public service and the public sector.  There are jobs being created in the public service which are being paid for out of the taxpayer's money.  Those jobs, while they provide an absolutely essential service, are in classic terms wealth consuming rather than wealth producing.  There is no guarantee to ensure that the money now being borrowed and made available to the public sector will be positively invested with the objective of providing extra employment.  There is a fair assumption that, if the private sector performs according to the norms by which it is expected to perform, not laid down by left-wing politicians like myself or academic economists like the Minister for Economic <Col N="1172" /> Planning and Development, but by the bankers who lend them the money, there will be increased employment. There is not much use in the managing director of a private firm going into a banker and saying he is interested in employment and that is why he is adopting a particular line.  Banks lend money specifically to get returns on it. There is no guarantee that there will be extra employment.  There is no guarantee in the budget that the benefits of even increased productivity in the form of extra profits will come back to the employers in some shape or form.</P>
    <P>The private sector is the new engine that will pull us into the 21st century or certainly pull us into some form of full employment for everybody.  It was essential to get out of the way of that engine any kind of encumbrance that might slow it in its tracks or would reduce its speed or effectiveness.  The major one was wealth tax.  It was argued that that had to be removed. The Fianna Fáil Party in Opposition made a long and sustained attack on the wealth tax.  There are criticisms which could be made against it.  It could be argued, for example, that it was not half as effective as estate duty, which in terms of actual revenue collection was certainly far more successful.  An argument put up before the 1973 election, and largely accepted by all the parties, was that estate duty should be abolished. Wealth tax was proposed in its place.</P>
    <P>A lot of people who argue against wealth tax, not necessarily in the House but certainly people of the original profession of the Minister for Health&mdash;the accountancy profession&mdash; argue that wealth tax is counterproductive. When these arguments are advanced they make a lot of sense.  If there are arguments against wealth tax or any other form of taxation they can certainly be made in the terms of the efficiency with which the tax can either be levied or collected and the administrative complications which the levying of such tax produces.  I welcome any proposals or changes in such a tax that would make it more efficient.  I do not think you can introduce a tax of that nature in one year <Col N="1173" /> and iron out all the difficulties in advance.  Any taxation specialist would accept that.</P>
    <P>That was not the objection of the Taoiseach to wealth tax.  The Taoiseach was far more fundamental and philosophical about it.  In his speech on the budget motion on 2 February 1978, Volume 303 of the Official Report, column 507, he stated with regard to wealth tax:</P>
    <P>The tax is difficult and expensive to administer but that is not a basic argument against it.  At a time when we are seeking to encourage investment can we really encourage and advocate a tax which takes away the purpose of that investment? Can anybody seriously defend a tax which encourages a person to take his capital out of the country or, if he does keep it here, encourages him to invest, not in productive assets like a farm, factory, hotel or business giving employment, but in a personal residence and its contents....</P>
    <P>The argument of the people who were in favour of abolishing wealth tax and who have now had their way is that we are a small country in the process of development and that if we saddle ourselves with wealth tax at this stage we will not get off the ground.  The argument is that we should all throw in our efforts together, make the cake as quickly and as big as possible and when it is completed then reallocate it, having reached the stage of completing the process of economic development.</P>
    <P>That is an essentially false economic argument.  I do not believe that option is now open to either this society or any other society similar to ours and at a similar level of development.  I accept that the primary task confronting this community is the creation of wealth.  I reject rather traditionalist attitudes on either side of the House which would suggest that the redistribution of existing wealth would satisfy the aspirations of even 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the population let alone the majority of the population.  The wealth is not here.  The potential to create the wealth is here and in many cases the resources to create the <Col N="1174" /> wealth are here.  The actual process of wealth creation has not taken place sufficiently to enable us to effect the kind of redistribution of wealth which was seen as possible in the 1920s and 1930s in the developed economies of Western Europe, underpinning the theoretical argument of Marx and Engels and the socialist leaders of the 1920s when they saw massive wealth in large industrial and imperial countries like Britain, Germany and France alongside enormous industrial poverty.</P>
    <P>It was quite possible in those countries to get a massive shift of resources so that their basic standard of living was significantly increased and still leave the structure of wealth owner-ship largely intact.  It is an extra-ordinary thing that the people in the Tory Party seldom refer to this.  Perhaps the reason is that, despite the attacks of the welfare state on their position of privilege and power, the figures for the ownership of wealth in Britain are even more scandalous than they are here and the effect of wealth tax and their extraordinary high levels of surtax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say the effect of their capital taxes.  They had capital taxation for a long time before we attempted to introduce it.  The effect of their capital taxation and the effect of their very high surtax levels&mdash;much higher than anything we have ever had here&mdash;still have not resulted in changing their structure of wealth owner-ship. Minor shifts in wealth, because the economies were basically so wealthy at the outset, could still produce an incredible improvement in the standard of living of the people.  That option of redistribution of wealth is not open to us.  Anybody who argues that is being naïve, and to that extent infantile left wing comment that suggests you can do such an operation in our society is being doctrinaire and naïve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who argues that the private sector can create wealth in the fashion in which it has been created in other economies, such as in France, Germany and Britain in the past, if one takes off all of the restraints on the <Col N="1175" /> private sector, is being equally naïve, doctrinaire and simplistic.  History has changed.  The days are gone when private enterprise or the private sector generally could make a quick buck, in a manufacturing or processing sense, as distinct from speculation.  So have the days when somebody could employ labour at cheap rates in factories without proper sanitation and without the constraints and conditions imposed by all the social legislation built up over the years by previous administrations, commencing with Fianna Fáil in the thirties.  The consolidation of the gains made by the trade union and labour movements throughout that period ensure that there is no easy, back lane road to rapid wealth creation in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Just as the wealth was not created in the past to enable us effect the kind of redistribution about which we are speaking the options open for its creation&mdash;in the way in which it was created in the past in other countries &mdash;no longer exist.  One of the most frequent arguments advanced by private industrialists, people concerned with producing wealth in the classic economic sense, is in regard to the cost of labour.  They will argue that the package of social legislation introduced by the last administration has, if anything, had a more detrimental effect on employment in some sectors than the actual cost of wages, that even the action taken recently by the Minister for Social Welfare in reducing the cost of the stamp to the employee&mdash; making it more attractive to work than heretofore because of the contrast between social welfare payments and wages&mdash;will not overcome the deterrent effects of much of the legislation introduced by my colleague, the former Minister for Labour, such as that relating to unfair dismissals and so on.</P>
    <P>The naïve assumption implicit in the budget speech that if one clears the tracks, gets everything out of the way and lets the private sector get on with it, it will suddenly take off, is very naïve unless it is said also that we will reduce the standard of sanitation in our factories and of safety regulations and that we will reduce all of <Col N="1176" /> the costs falling on the private sector. Why start with the taxation ones?  Why not take the whole package away? Anybody who is in employment in industry or processing and who has to deal with these kinds of restraints knows just how real they are.  There-fore, in ideological terms, on both sides of the House, we are being very naïve if we think that somehow merely by juggling taxes we can create the climate in which the private sector can take off.  It would be marvellous if we could.  It would get us all out of a hole in the sense that we are faced with this massive demand and growth in population.</P>
    <P>Objectively the situation has changed fundamentally.  There are arguments to suggest that the level of profitability within small and major companies, as a percentage, has been declining gradually, that many large companies are turning over massive amounts of capital for very little return, certainly one our grandfathers would have thought ludicrous.  Therefore, the profitability of much of the investment has been reduced.  What does all that mean? Bluntly it means that the Government consciously, in a doctrinaire fashion, have backed the wrong horse.  I am rather amused to hear speaker after speaker from the Fianna Fáil benches maintain that they are pragmatists and then continue to deliver eulogies in favour of the private sector and say they are ideologists.  There is nothing wrong with being an ideologist, with having a clear set of values or attitudes. Fianna Fáil got rid of some of the encumbrances.  Undoubtedly from an industrialist's point of view there were encumbrances attached to the wealth tax.  I think it was Deputy Fox who said that the industrialist would be fair and kind to Fianna Fáil, would remember them and, instead of spending the money in a consumer-like fashion would say: &ldquo;We had better remember what Deputy Fox said in the Dáil; we will create three or four more jobs; we will not buy new cars&rdquo;. I do not believe people are in business to perform in that way.  This Government have fallen into the trap of the narrow-based economic thinking of academics.  As the late Seán Lemass said, academics in Government are not <Col N="1177" /> a great recipe for success.</P>

      <P>I was being very polite. Anybody who suggests that somebody operates like some form of economic siphon, in the latter part of the 20th century, is being very naïve.  Without boring the House I believe that our attitude to work and to work-effort in this country, for whatever reason is totally different from that of Victorian Britain or northern Germany.  Even if we wanted to, our families will not let us work as hard as did our grandfathers; there are demands for availability to wife, family and so on.  The kind of workload people took on in the Victorian age, when they built the kind of wealth subsequently redistributed, has changed totally.  I believe that the consequences of that change will be that, at a certain stage of personal achievement within the private sector, people who have been given all of this incentive will say: &ldquo;I have achieved all I want out of this enterprise or business; I am not going to achieve any more; I am going to spend more time with my family&rdquo;.  This engine which is supposed to be hauling us all into a level of full employment, will suddenly come to a stop because the engine drivers are going to say: &ldquo;We are knocking off.  We have travelled as far as we want to&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The base on which so much of this incentive has been centred is, in itself, very narrow, it has not been spread; nobody has been given the task of ensuring that if one fellow gets tired somebody else will step into his shoes. If one wants to plan any economy one has to control all of its elements and not let one ride totally free. Rather, in return for wage restraint or money lending, which is what the industrial sector was being asked to do, they should be given some form of equity participation, some form of say in how the increased profits resulting from such wage restraints would be reinvested.  The biggest problem facing our economy is not the 8 per cent increase in wages for the industrial sector.  That can be carried without any difficulty whatsoever with the exception of old, traditional industries <Col N="1178" /> which are now in difficulty.  Indeed, the newer ones set up in the last 15 years can easily carry 8 per cent and, in some cases, possibly 10 per cent or 12 per cent.  If I was a worker in one of those industries and was asked to lend the balance between 8 per cent and that to which I was really entitled&mdash;the administration will look after you, will respond to the aspirations at the end of the Minister for Finance's speech; the nice, woolly rhetoric we all tend to use at the end of speeches&mdash;I would be bound to admit that there was nothing there for me.  There is no commitment, no hard and fast guarantee.  I should like to see a commitment that if profitability went beyond a certain level, with capital being made available as a result, if industry availed of all the tax incentives for depreciation and so on given in the budget, the workers would have some say in how that money would be invested.  At the moment they have no say and there is no proposal to give them a say.  So, without even that constraint, where the directors of a firm can say they have made so much money, people are at the mercy of the aspirations of people in the private sector as to what they want to do with the money.</P>
    <P>Many of them may put the money into some activity which in turn will generate some employment.  They may buy houses in the country, they may go back to the towns from whence they came and create some local employment there, but is this economic planning?  Is this the kind of way in which the massive borrowings set out in the budget are to be used?  I do not believe it is.  I believe this was aimed at having the buckshot effect of spreading this money in all directions and hoping against hope that some of it will land.</P>
    <P>The structure of that argument is obvious and there is no point in my filling it in.  What kind of alternatives do we have?  How would I do it if I had some say in the allocation of the resources?  I accept much of what the Minister has said about the economy, about the needs and the demands, but I would be much more worried about the future than he appears to be&mdash; about the constraints that are likely <Col N="1179" /> to occur in the next ten to 20 years when 50 per cent of our population will not yet have reached the age of 50 because they are now less than 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>One of the major constraints, and it is obvious, is in relation to energy, whether it be energy for food processing, for agricultural or industrial development, or simply for ordinary transport.  The budget debate so far has made no distinction in regard to the utilisation of energy and the purposes for which it is used.  I will not quarrel with the political attractiveness of the package, but the combination of the abolition of car tax which made private transport cheaper and the directing of the massive capital resources away from the public housing sector to the private sector, which in the main means private sector estates in the suburbs with lower standards of building construction which the private sector can get away with, means that the energy consumption implication of those two decisions is potentially large.</P>
    <P>In replies to questions to the Ministers involved it is clear that not only do they not have any way of measuring what the implications of those two measures might be but they are not even aware that they should be measured.  It is far too easy to say that they are irresponsible, because our awareness of the needs to conserve energy is a fairly recent thing in both sides of the House.  However, we have had a surfeit of advice on energy conservation in the last three years and I would have thought that the implications for somebody nominally charged with responsibility for economic planning and development would have been recognised and some attempt made to counter them.</P>
    <P>For instance, what will happen if, because of the failure or apparent failure of the Sadat move, there is another Middle East war?  What will happen to Western Europe and to this country if suddenly we get caught with another oil price hoist?  We are told we have 93 days, three days in excess of what the EEC require.  Part of that depends on access to the Bantry Bay <Col N="1180" /> terminal and further questions no doubt will give us details as to what rights of access the Government have to that in an emergency.  Then there is the matter of energy sharing and so forth, but at the end of the day some form of rationing must take place. On that basis we could be in a position where our industry would become very vulnerable and our workforce will find it impossible to get to work.</P>
    <P>That constraint in regard to energy would have weighed highly with me if I had been where the Minister for Finance has been in the last couple of months.  The way I would have dealt with that kind of constraint, to meet short-term objectives of environmental improvement and job creation, would have been to provide a miserable £38 million for CIE in order to implement their electrification of suburban lines in the Dublin area.  This Government and the previous Government have had that for consideration since April last but no decision has been made and all the indications are that a decision will come later rather than sooner.  Yet the benefits in that one area could be quite substantial in the short term and in the long term.</P>
    <P>Another area we have been crying about in terms of a massive resource yet to be exploited is our fishery industry, whether it is to be a 50-mile limit or some compromise alternative that will come from Brussels.  Everybody knows we do not have the full capacity to exploit this resource, and yet when I asked the Minister for Fisheries a question, recognising the gap between our ability to exploit the resource and its enormous potential richness, whether the Minister would consider establishing a State fleet&mdash;he could buy one cheaply at the moment because fishing fleets are becoming redundant in other EEC countries&mdash;the Minister replied that a State fleet would stifle individual initiative and enterprise. When I asked him if he was implying that there was no room for individual initiative and enterprise within the State sector he appealed to the Chair for help and the question was ruled out of order: I was delving into sociology.</P>
    <P>The Government have committed <Col N="1181" /> themselves in a one-off shot to borrowing 13 per cent of GNP, scattering it to the private sector, cutting off possible areas of investment in the public sector as distinct from the public service. I will define exactly what I mean. I am referring to those areas which, with public capital, can create wealth in their own right, bodies like NET, BIM, Bord na Móna, the sugar company and so on.  I make that distinction between the public sector and the public service for the purposes of debate. The Government have scattered, on their own admission, a very large sum of money which they certainly cannot borrow next year, on what they recognise as a gamble in order to take us along the road towards full employment. They have made very specific tax write-offs, concessions and offerings to a large range of people.  The only people to be taxed are the farmers, and I do not propose to go into that area.  The tax in that area has been very light and the farmers have not complained much.  Indeed their representatives had difficulty in complaining to the extent that they did.  Deputy Bruton knows far more about these matters and I will leave it to him.</P>
    <P>We borrow that kind of money and hitch it to one engine, private enterprise. The driver, relative to the rest of the population, relative to the thousands of people who are less than 25 years of age, is very small in comparison to the other people on that train.  The model which the Government think such an individual is does not exist.  The change in humanity in the last 20 or 30 years, in the expectations people have for themselves, that children have for their parents, that wives have for their husbands, do not make it possible for someone to work in the maniac fashion put forward by the Government.  If someone has achieved a level of personal wealth, he should move over and relax.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that the public sector will not really get any money, and the capital budget programme shows that.  There is an extra-ordinary bias towards the private sector and away from the public sector.  Having taken this risk and having put all our eggs in the basket of <Col N="1182" /> the private sector, the Minister, in an undoctrinaire, non-ideological fashion, says:</P>
    <P>It is only right that profits should recover from the set-back experienced during the recession.  But the community can justifiably expect that increased profits will be used in productive investment and jobcreation. Socially irresponsible waste and conspicuous consumption have no part in our economic strategy, any more than unproductive speculation.</P>
    <P>Something extraordinary happened to Fianna Fáil in their four years in Opposition because they certainly did not hold that view when they were previously in office.  Perhaps members of the party would explain what change has been made and what will be done to banks which lend money for unproductive speculation.  If such banks get into trouble having loaned money for unproductive speculation, will they bail them out?  If they come up with a solution, I hope they will start in my constituency where there are a number of eyesore sites largely because banks loaned money for socially unproductive speculation.</P>
    <P>Referring to the private sector the Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>They must plough rising profits back into their businesses and raise investment and output.  And it is imperative that they develop also a keen sense of responsibility in relation to the overriding need to create more jobs and reduce unemployment. In the coming years private sector investment decisions should always be directed at increasing employment to the maximum extent consistent with market conditions.</P>
    <P>Nobody would seriously argue with that aspiration, but it is only an aspiration. There was an opportunity in this budget to stitch some of that aspiration into some of the tax proposals made. I do not profess to be either an economist or an accountant, but assuming that the technical professional arguments can be overcome, I would believe the Minister when he says that their approach is a pragmatic approach which is not dictated by ideological dogma and that if there is <Col N="1183" /> an adequate response by either sector they shall take appropriate action in the interest of the whole community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  If it is not pragmatic, if it is not dictated by ideological dogma and if there is not an adequate response, what can they do?  Can they take the car tax back, put rates back on houses, or reintroduce the wealth tax?  Supposing the private sector does not perform to the narrow economic model, but performs to a much narrower set of criteria, supposing all the rules of economic theory are torn up by people saying, despite the incentives given &ldquo;I do not wish to make any more money&rdquo;, what can one do?  The Government have committed themselves to a direction and it is not possible to reverse that direction.  I can see no assurance that the private sector will do the sort of things the Government wishes, although it would be very nice if they did.  If that assurance were there many of us could stop worrying about it and worry about other things that confront our society.</P>
      <P>The Government have taken an enormous risk.  There is nothing wrong with that provided people are told in advance about the risk.  In the light of this debate&mdash;and in more detail when the Finance Bill comes before the House&mdash;one could reasonably ask &ldquo;Is the risk justified&rdquo;?  I have no moral or religious stand against gambling, but I do not like people gambling with my money.  That, in effect, is what this Government are doing with their budget proposals.  They are gambling on wage restraint: people who lend their money to the private sector and do not take it out in the form of wage increases are supposed to receive some sort of benefit at the end of the day, with consequent benefit for the rest of the community.  There is nothing in the Minister's speech or in the logic of the Government's action so far to suggest that the package that has been proposed and offered to the private sector will deliver on his aspirations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that extent this country has taken <Col N="1184" /> a narrow, doctrinaire right wing turn through a party that prided themselves on a sense of reality and considered themselves to be very pragmatic.  If one reads the comments in <i>The Economist</i> and in <i>The Financial Times</i> in the years 1970 to 1973, when Edward  took over in Britain, at a time before we knew high inflation in the western world, one will see that the arguments in favour of letting businesses take off after six years of Labour Party Government were made with the same kind of strength and authority as the arguments made by people coming up to this budget.  The then Chancellor in Britain brought in two extraordinary give-away budgets at that time.  At the end of the day the level of investment in the productive areas of the British economy was less than it was at the beginning, because the private sector performed as a private sector should perform&mdash;it looked after number one.</P>
    <P>The mistake in this budget is that Fianna Fáil do not believe the private sector when they say that the private sector is private.  They are hoping it will do something that it was not set up to do, that it does not want to do and shows no inclination of wanting to do.  It has not done so in the past and to expect it to do so in the future is to be naïve and doctrinaire at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to have been in the House and to listen to the contribution made by Deputy Quinn.  His contribution was entirely constructive.  I do not agree with his general approach to the budget, but I recognise that Deputy Quinn has attacked head on the budget and the thinking behind the budget.  The Deputy has set out to make what is probably the only valid argument that can be made against the budget, that is, that it is over-reliant on private enterprise.  The Deputy's arguments in that regard are worthy of consideration. I will make a few brief comments by way of reply to the Deputy without entering into an involved debate on the respective merits of private enterprise and the reliance of the budget on private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> The Deputy was unduly dismissive of the part that the Minister for Finance and the budget are allocating to the public sector.  He made a very valid distinction between the public service and the public sector.  Without being unfair to the Deputy one could say that he made a plea for greater reliance on the public sector's job creation and job generation capacity to an even greater extent than was made by the Minister for Finance. However, Deputy Quinn and other Deputies will find that in the budget tables there is the very substantial capital figure of £350 million being allocated to the State companies. Admittedly, included in that is £60 million for telephone capital development but it must be said that the investment by the State in public sector enterprise for 1978 is substantial.  Undoubtedly, therefore, the Minister has placed a very great deal of reliance on the response he hopes to get from the private sector.  He has offered considerable incentives to that sector in the hope of getting from them the response that is required but he has also made a considerable investment in the public sector.  Perhaps it is only natural that this factor is being overlooked in the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn said he was not satisfied that all the money being released into the economy would produce the results the Minister for Finance hoped. I am paraphrasing the Deputy but I think he will agree that I am giving a fair summing up of what he said. I recall the late Mr. Seán Lemass, whom the Deputy has quoted with approval, on one occasion summing up our economic dilemma by saying that he would dearly love to be managing the sort of economy in which there was a great deal of money pressing for investment opportunity, where instead of trying to beat money out of different places we would have a pressure of investment funds seeking outlets.  To some extent that answers Deputy Quinn's argument regarding the releasing of greater financial resources and the removing of the various restraints and restrictions and their finding suitable investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass did not <Col N="1186" /> borrow the money.  That is the kernel of my argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn was saying that he was not satisfied that the releasing of floods of finances would in itself generate activity in jobs.  I do not agree.  If funds are flowing freely into an economy they will find productive outlets.</P>
      <P>I shall leave the fairly broad ground travelled by Deputy Quinn.  To some extent it is an esoteric argument at this stage.  The Deputy painted a fairly attractive picture of a private enterprise person refusing, because of his lifestyle, to accept incentives offered to him.  That argument can be turned very easily on its head.  Is it much more likely that a private entrepreneur who is offered incentives will go after the fruits of those incentives than to a greater extent than will an executive in a nationalised industry? Is the Deputy suggesting that the executive in a nationalised industry has not his own lifestyle, that he does not play his golf or that he is much more concerned with the attractiveness of his lifestyle than with pursuing these goals?  If we are to set two groups of executives against each other, my money, in the circumstances painted by Deputy Quinn, would have to be on the private entrepreneur as distinct from the executive of a nationalised industry.</P>
      <P>The story of nationalised industry has not been all that successful, particularly in Great Britain.  I do not think that any reasonably-minded socialist could claim that British Steel or British Rail, for instance, have been all that successful given the resources that have been poured into them.  By and large most of our State enterprises have given us a good return.  I am happy to note the very substantial capital investment that the Minister for Finance this year is putting into our State industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of general reply to the argument put forward by Deputy Quinn I should like to remind the Deputy that when the Minister for Finance uses the word &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; he is indicating that he is not tied totally either to private enterprise or to the public <Col N="1187" /> sector, that he is not hung up ideologically on either system.  As of now he wants to give incentives to the private sector because he regards that sector to be the one in which incentives are needed and as being the area from which the thrust can come.  All our history in Fianna Fáil is that where a public enterprise or a State enterprise can do the job we will give them the job to do and the resources with which to do it.  There is not one State enterprise company in that book that can come forward with any proposal to produce jobs or create employment who will not be given the capital they need.  We are not shutting off the flow of investment into State companies.  They are being given more capital this year than ever before.</P>
    <P>These are just some thoughts provoked by the very thoughtful contribution from Deputy Quinn.  I agree that it is a valid argument&mdash;perhaps it should be the central argument in this debate&mdash;as to whether in a modern context private enterprise can deliver.</P>
    <P>The budget is providing for attractive incentives to the private sector. We shall await the outcome of the offering of those incentives.  The Minister for Finance and the Government are prepared to take other action if the course on which we have embarked is not successful.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto stressed that the real threat to our future lay in our economic difficulties and pointed out that failure to find work for our people could, in particular, revive the old evil of a stagnant economy compelling thousands of our people to emigrate.  That was the sort of situation which confronted Fianna Fáil in the sixties but which the Fianna Fáil Government of the day succeeded in overcoming.  We were returned to office in June last on a clear mandate from the people to get the economy moving.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper on national development identified the Government's main economic targets for 1978. It spelt out those targets as a reduction of 20,000 in the number of unemployed, <Col N="1188" /> a fall in the rate of inflation to 7 per cent and a growth rate of 7 per cent.  This year's budget is, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, the first for a number of years which has been set in the context of a formal and positive commitment to medium-term planning and is directed primarily to stimulating economic activity, generating productive investment and creating employment.  With those objectives before him, the Minister for Finance's main strategy had to be economic.  The main thrust of the resources at his disposal had to be in the direction of economic activity, productive investment and job creation.</P>
    <P>No matter how urgent the tackling of economic problems may be, no Fianna Fáil Government is prepared to ignore, even temporarily, the legitimate claims of that section of the community who must of necessity rely primarily upon the Government for the protection of their standards of living.  We believe that the ultimate purpose of all economic development must be social in the broadest sense, namely the improvement of the living standards and the quality of life for the people as a whole.  Even though in framing this year's budget the primary preoccupation of the Government was economic, nevertheless we were not prepared to leave aside completely and ignore the legitimate claims of the deprived and under-privileged sections of our community.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the social welfare provisions of the budget have been generally welcomed.  There have been some complaints to the effect that the increases provided are insufficient and one can understand and instinctively sympathise with those complaints.  We are all familiar with cases of hardship in our community, cases for which we would like to do more, and in that sense the budgetary provision for social welfare in any year never has been and never will be regarded as adequate.  Some of the criticism of specific aspects of the social welfare provisions this year has ignored their overall effect and impact. For that reason I should like to summarise the main improvements included <Col N="1189" /> in the budgetary provisions and in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In our election manifesto we undertook to maintain the living standards of social welfare recipients by regular adjustment of the level of payments at least in line with the cost of living. In this budget we have done more than that.  An increase of between 3 and 4 per cent would have met the manifesto requirement in maintaining the real value of the rates as at October 1977.  In fact, we have provided for an increase of 10 per cent across the board.  That increase of 10 per cent is based on the Government's recognition of the fact that 1978 will be a year of growth.  It is only fair that in a year of growth the social welfare classes should share in that growth to the same extent as any other class.  That is why we have not confined ourselves to the 3 per cent or 4 per cent which the manifesto dictated.  Instead we have provided a 10 per cent increase in all rates.  That increase will, because of the significant reduction in the rate of inflation, give social welfare recipients their greatest real increase in income for many years. I want to emphasise the term &ldquo;real increase&rdquo; in that regard.  After allowing for the likely increase in the CPI during 1978, the real increase should be over 6 per cent and that compares with a real increase of 1 per cent or less for 1977 and 1976. I want to emphasise that I am talking of a 10 per cent monetary increase which, in the terms of 1978, will be equivalent to a real increase of 6 per cent for the social welfare classes.</P>
    <P>There has also been some criticism of the absence of provision for a further increase next October.  I admit that the idea of twice yearly increases has a certain superficial attraction but I must point out very clearly that in the past two years, in which we had April and October increases, the increases in October were not really for the purpose of improving the position of the social welfare classes.  They were necessary to keep pace with raging inflation and that is why we had to have bi-yearly increases in 1976 and 1977.  In effect, they did not increase in a real way the welfare of the recipients.  They merely kept pace <Col N="1190" /> with inflation.  This year, as I think everybody will agree, inflation is on the way down and the increase of 10 per cent in April will be equivalent to a real increase of 6 per cent for the year as a whole.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increases in rates of benefit we are making a number of other significant improvements in this budget.  We promised in the manifesto to work towards the elimination of discrimination against women.  In keeping with that promise, single women and widows will have from October access to unemployment assistance on the same terms that now apply to men. That means that the requirement of having to have a dependant or a certain minimum number of contributions in respect of insurable employment will be removed.  There has been some criticism of the fact that this change will not be made until October.  Anybody who knows anything about the situation will realise that it could not be done sooner than that because there are very substantial numbers involved. We anticipate something in the region of 50,000 applicants for unemployment benefit as a result of this change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, unemployment assistance.  All these applications must be processed and the earliest date at which that could be done with reasonable administrative efficiency is 1 October.  We will start the process as soon as the Bill dealing with social welfare is passed in order to make the operation as smooth as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my relatively short period in office as Minister for Social Welfare, I have come across a number of petty restrictions which are not of general application but where they apply they can cause severe hardship in individual cases.  Most of these have come to my attention through correspondence from Deputies dealing with particular cases.  In the case of old age pensioners, there is an existing residence test which requires a person to have lived in the State for at least 15 years, of which five years must have been after the age of 50.  That may not appear to be a very onerous test and this is so in the vast majority of cases. <Col N="1191" /> However, cases arise where Irish nationals who have been living abroad for a number of years and who return to Ireland late in life cannot immediately qualify for pensions because of this requirement.  Its removal will be a welcome change for those involved.</P>
    <P>We are also easing the same type of residence requirement for widows' non-contributory pension and for allowances payable to deserted wives, unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and single women.  The free electricity scheme was introduced in 1967 by a Fianna Fáil Government to ensure that pensioners living alone or with dependants would have a reasonable standard of heating and a modest degree of comfort.  I am satisfied that scheme was of considerable help to a large number of old people, but Deputies know from their experience that a fair number of old people living alone, because of the remoteness of where they live, cannot avail of that concession.  So, we are introducing a scheme of allowances for bottled gas which will be equivalent to the free electricity allowance.  There has been a fair amount of debate and discussion by Deputies from time to time on the free fuel schemes which operate in certain areas.  There is fairly widespread agreement, I think that this type of scheme is not very satisfactory.  So, I am setting up a working party to go into this whole matter and look at the situation of old persons from the heating point of view generally, taking into account this scheme, the electricity scheme, the free fuel schemes and the supplementary allowance scheme, and see if a better, more composite type of scheme can be introduced.</P>
    <P>The maternity grant has been doubled and the death grant under the social insurance scheme has been raised to £50.  These are small matters but they are important to a limited section of the community.  We are making two important changes in the provisions relating to children.  At present where a deserted wife dies and the father of the children does not resume responsibility for them nothing can be done.  The only outlet, as it were, is for the children to be put into an institution.  We are providing that <Col N="1192" /> an allowance at the orphan pension rate will be paid to a relative or some other suitable person who will take charge of the children and therefore avoid the necessity to send them to an institution.</P>
    <P>The other change proposed relates to children of broken marriages.  At present where the children live with their mother the father cannot claim them as dependants for purposes of an increase in benefits even though he is supporting them when working.  That deficiency will be remedied as and from April next.  In the case of a broken marriage the mother or father will be able to claim for the children in that context.  I think the House will agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, as a social welfare dependant.  I think the House will agree both of these are desirable changes.  They are not of major impact but affect a number of people.  They both arise out of this tragedy of either a broken marriage or a deserted wife. These situations are on the increase, a disturbing feature of modern society and this is something of which I, as Minister for Social Welfare, must take increasing cognisance.  If there is anything I or the House could do to mitigate the incidence of broken marriages and deserted wives I am sure it would be done, but pending the capacity to do anything of that kind we should take whatever action is open to us to alleviate the affects on the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are already aware that as from 1 April next an old age pensioner living alone, fortunate enough to have a telephone, will have the annual rental fully paid for that telephone.  I think that has been widely welcomed. It is of restricted application but it will be of very considerable benefit to quite a number of old persons.  We know that one of the troubles afflicting old persons living alone is this feeling of loneliness and isolation.  I think we must give increasing attention to the problems of loneliness in so far as the old are concerned and see if we can devise by community action or otherwise, ways of mitigating this feeling of <Col N="1193" /> loneliness and isolation.  The new subsidy will be of assistance to a number of old people.</P>
    <P>The total cost of these social welfare measures, including the corresponding increases in allowances under the Health Acts will be £38 million in 1978 and £55 million in a full year. When you add that to the existing services total expenditure on social welfare services will be running at an annual rate of £610 million.  Deputies will see that the amount provided in the budget and in the Estimate for Social Welfare is not inconsiderable.</P>
    <P>I might avail of the opportunity to mention three other matters in the social welfare field which are in process of planning and action in my Department. There is the introduction next year of a fully pay-related social insurance contribution which I think will be welcome for the general improvement it will bring in the social insurance situation.  It will also be of particular assistance to lower paid workers.  Allied to that is the matter of insurance for the self-employed.  We recently published a Green Paper on this issue and the amount of interest there is in this matter throughout the community came as quite a surprise to me.</P>
    <P>There is also the very major question of the national income-related pension scheme.  Again, we have published a Green Paper and sought the views of the different sections that might be involved with a view to examining a scheme of that sort.</P>
    <P>On the health side, the manifesto made clear that the aim of Fianna Fáil policy would be to secure the highest possible standards of physical and mental health for the community as a whole.  Despite the priority which had to be afforded by the Government to economic recovery in this year's budgetary allocations we have not neglected to make very substantial provision for health.  The estimates provide a total allocation in 1977/78 of £357 million for capital and non-capital services against £312 million last year.  This morning, I released details of our capital expenditure programme for 1978.  The total of that programme is £20.5 million which is a very substantial allocation.  That allocation <Col N="1194" /> will enable all the major projects on hand to go ahead rapidly.  At the same time it will enable us to make a considerable number of important new starts in 1978 which are being set out in a table which will be available to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The provision also includes a substantial job creation element in line with the Government's concentration on job creation.  In 1978 in the health services alone 2,400 extra jobs will be created at all levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 2,400 new jobs in 1978, which is a reasonable contribution by the health services to the overall job creation programme.  Those jobs will be at all levels of the services and will include consultants, public health nurses and other categories.  In addition to the creation of jobs and employment this will have the satisfactory effect of improving our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of Fianna Fáil in health is a first-class one.  I would like to recall briefly to the House some of the provisions of previous Fianna Fáil Governments which I suggest are important milestones in the history of the evolution of our health services. As far back as 1947 we introduced the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act which was really the start of the modern system of financing our health services whereby the health services were taken away from the local rates and transferred to the central authority. In 1945 we had the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanitoria) Act which set about tackling the scourge of tuberculosis, a disease which was then rampant here.  We had also in 1945 the Mental Treatment Act, a very comprehensive measure dealing with all aspects of the care and treatment of the mentally ill, including revising in a most radical way the procedures for the admission to and retention in hospitals.  There was the Health Act of 1947 which made provision for free hospital treatment for infectious diseases.  The Health Act of 1953 introduced further significant changes. Eligibility for health services was greatly extended and assessed not on <Col N="1195" /> the basis of individual means testing but on a person's membership of several broadly defined classes.  That Act also provided for a development of a comprehensive rehabilitation service. These are some of the milestones in the Fianna Fáil history of building up step by step a modern health service for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>We initiated too the policy of providing modern, well-equipped hospital units for the aged who require such care, and community or welfare homes for persons who are no longer able to live in the community even with the aid of the supportive services.  We eliminated the dispensary system and introduced the Choice of Doctor Scheme.  While there are now a number of modern homes for the mentally handicapped because of the hospital building programmes of the 1960s and early 1970s, there is still a serious shortage of places.  The 1978 building programme recognises that shortage and provides for new projects involving the provision of 1,320 day and residential places for the mentally handicapped over the next few years.  I do not think that a party with a tradition of concern for the disadvantaged in our society, such as Fianna Fáil are, can be accused of being either uncaring or conservative in their approach. Some of the examples of positive steps which we will be taking during 1978 will be absolutely in line with the progressive approach of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government in health matters. The 10 per cent increase which applies to social welfare classes will of course also apply to health benefits.</P>
    <P>One matter which has caused a fair amount of anxiety and dissatisfaction in recent years is the constant care allowance where the mentally handicapped are concerned.  The primary purpose of those allowances is to provide for the domiciliary care of handicapped children, and the amount payable at present in respect of an eligible child is £25 per month.  That amount has not been increased since the scheme was introduced in 1973. This year from 1 April we are increasing it from £25 to £35 per month, and from now on it will be applicable to <Col N="1196" /> every eligible child in the family, the restriction in that regard being removed.</P>
    <P>Another matter in relation to the parents of handicapped children which has been of some concern is the need for a domiciliary counselling service. Many families faced with the discovery that their infant is handicapped do not know where to turn for advice and assistance, and that is particularly so in the case of mentally handicapped children.  It is necessary that we create a domiciliary service for such families so that during a handicapped child's early years, in the period before he can be taken to a day or residential centre, the parents will be given advice and guidance in regard to his care and development.  We are providing funds this year to start building up a service of that sort. Some Deputies may know that we are having a seminar on the mentally handicapped generally on next Thursday and we will be discussing there the best way of going about building up that type of domiciliary counselling service.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies are also concerned about the position of adult handicapped persons who if given a helping hand can be restored and introduced to a working life.  We all agree that we owe it to these handicapped persons to help them towards a life as similar as possible to that of the more fortunate among us.  To do this we must have adequate and effective measures for their vocational training. This year I hope, out of the funds placed at my disposal in the Estimates, to provide about 600 additional places for trainees in handicap workshops where these people will get the training they need.  Deputies will agree that the results of that in both humanitarian and economic terms will be quite substantial.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for accepting that fostering is a very desirable alternative to institutional care, and I will be giving special attention to this area with a view to improving existing arrangements.  As a practical and immediate step the boarding-out allowance will be increased from £9 to £11 from 1 April <Col N="1197" /> next.  I intend during the year to give as much priority as possible to the development of the community care services, especially domiciliary services for the aged and other disadvantaged groups.  I am very conscious of the vital role which voluntary organisations play in promoting and providing services for groups of the population who are in special need of help.  The development and maintenance of this voluntary sector is important not only from the point of view of the provision of the services but also because of the involvement of so many people and the nature of the activity involved, which represent a significant and desirable community effort.</P>
    <P>There is a wide range of need which these voluntary organisations can meet. For example, the provision of home help services, the making of arrangements for pre-school play groups, support for battered wives and increased financial assistance throughout this area will give us an excellent return either from the organisations already providing services or in facilitating the development of further voluntary groups and voluntary activities.  From the resources placed at my disposal I will be able again to find considerable additional funds in 1978 for all these purposes.</P>
    <P>We will also proceed with many worth-while projects in the area of child care services: neighbourhood youth projects, the commissioning of new units for deprived children in need of care, the establishment of hostels for severely emotionally disturbed boys and girls, and a psychiatric unit for children and adolescents.  Increased financial assistance will also be made available for extra accommodation for homeless boys and to provide additional facilities to cater for the children of travelling families in need of special support.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies are aware also of the need to deal with the problem which exists in the case of battered wives.  In the latter part of 1977, I had discussions with a number of organisations concerned with this very acute problem.  Health Boards already support the provision of social services for battered wives and their children, but it is quite clear that there is a <Col N="1198" /> very special need for short-term accommodation for those who find themselves in intolerable and unbearable situations.  Already we have made some additional finance available to Women's Aid, which is one of the organisations concerned with battered wives in the Dublin area.  We intend to make additional improvements during the coming year.</P>
    <P>A number of institutions which cater for special groups such as the deaf, the blind, and children suffering from multiple handicaps have been facing difficulties.  In some instances, the available accommodation in these institutions is very far from satisfactory. In the capital programme this year, the £20½ million to which I referred, we are providing money to remedy that situation as quickly as possible.  I will also be providing additional funds to look after the running costs of these centres.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the main thrust of the budget is economic, and had to be economic.  Let us all fully understand it is the underprivileged and deprived who are most vitally concerned with the success of our economic plan.  Occasionally that is overlooked.  The greater our success in achieving our economic targets, the greater is the prospect of realising further development of all our social services.  In periods of recession the well-off and the rich can usually make out all right, can usually look after themselves.  It is the poor and the underprivileged who suffer most when the economic climate is unfavourable. They have a very real interest in the successful outcome of the Government's policies for economic growth.</P>
    <P>The budget for 1978 has endeavoured to strike a reasonable balance between economic policies on the one hand and the provision of adequate funds for social development on the other. I think it has succeeded.  In Government, Fianna Fáil have never forgotten the less well-off sections of the community, and have constantly pursued the aim of raising the level of social services available to them within the constraints of available resources.  On this occasion Fianna Fáil have not deviated from this principle.  They <Col N="1199" /> have not this year, and they will not at any stage in the future.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is the poor, the under-privileged and the deprived who have the greatest interest in ensuring that our economic plans are successful, because then we will have the resources to improve their lot constantly and continuously. It is the Fianna Fáil philosophy to do that.  As the resources become available, we make them available to those who need them. As I said earlier, we recognise, and it is our philosophy and our belief, that all economic activities, all economic plans, programmes and policies must ultimately have that basic social purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told this budget and the whole economic policy of the Government are based on a gamble.  It was described with what must inevitably be called exaggeration by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development as the biggest gamble in the nation's history. It is right for those of us on these benches to question whether it is a good gamble, and whether the Government know if it is a good gamble. In doing so, we are not saying it is not appropriate for a Government in certain circumstances to take gambles. Nor are we saying it is inappropriate in all circumstances for a Government to borrow on the scale this Government are proposing to borrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question we must ask now is: is the package of measures they are putting together at the moment to use the money they are borrowing a good and justifiable gamble?  The Government's own lack of clarity as to the wisdom of their gamble was well illustrated when the Minister for Economic Planning and Development was interviewed shortly after the publication of his White Paper.  He was asked what would happen if the gamble failed.  His answer was very vague indeed.  He suggested we would be a little worse off; we would not have money we would otherwise have.  If as he said it was the biggest gamble in the nation's history surely he should have been able to answer with greater clarity, greater frankness and greater <Col N="1200" /> forthrightness what would happen it the gamble failed.</P>
    <P>Although we have a Government who are allegedly committed to planning, to projections ahead about what will happen as a result of actions taken now, we have not been told about this gamble what the stakes are, what the odds are, or when the race will be over and we will know whether our horse has won or lost.  Neither of those three questions has been answered.  Any punter would insist on knowing the answer to those three questions before parting with his money.</P>
    <P>The Government's gamble on this occasion is more like backing both horses in a two-horse race and the only person who is likely to win is the bookie.  I say this because I believe the gamble, the economic policy on which the borrowing is based, is defective in a number of important respects. First, the programme of expenditure of the money is not thought out. Secondly, there are five basic weaknesses in the proposals put forward which I will identify.  I can best illustrate the lack of clear thought and foresight in the Government's economic policy by quoting from the White Paper, paragraph 1.8, page 11:</P>
    <P>The measures already carried through and the further action to be provided for in the 1978 budget will complete the first phase of implementing the Government's development programme.  The second phase will build on the recovery set in train by these measures.  During this phase the emphasis will gradually shift from existing policies to maintain progress at a high level towards a third phase.  This third phase will involve new policies for structural changes in the Irish economy&mdash;thus setting the scene for sustained and long-term economic and social development.</P>
    <P>By admitting that the third phase is the phase in which the structural changes will take place in our economy, the Government are admitting they are prepared to spend money now on an economy which they realise needs structural changes before making those structural changes.  If a businessman were approaching the same problem, <Col N="1201" /> if he bought a firm which needed structural changes, would his approach be that of the Government's?  Would it be the approach of borrowing first to spend money on the existing structure as it stood and of putting back to the third phase&mdash;which may be at some indefinite time in the future&mdash;the decision to make the necessary structural changes?  Would he do what I believe the Government should do, namely, before borrowing to identify the structural changes that have to be made, to make them and then borrow to finance the expansion of a modernised and structurally improved economy? By their own admission the Government have got their priorities wrong.  They are prepared to spend now and then make the changes necessary later.  Quite clearly that is not the way a sensible person would go about his business.</P>
    <P>There are five basic weaknesses in the economic strategy being adopted by the Government and I propose not just to identify the weaknesses but also to suggest alternative strategies to those being adopted.  First, we have an illthought-out industrial policy.  Secondly, we have a very critical misunderstanding of the nature of the task of job creation in an open competitive economy such as ours.  Thirdly, we have an improvident and short-term taxation policy.  Fourthly, we have the failure to provide adequate tools for economic planning and for proper control by Parliament of the implementation of the plan and its targets and of public spending.  Fifthly, we have an uncertain policy in relation to agriculture, our major industry.</P>
    <P>I can best illustrate the uncertainty and lack of clarity of the Government's industrial policy by quoting from their White Paper.  Paragraph 4 (7) states:</P>
    <P>Priority will be given to improving employment in those areas of the country which suffered relatively worse during the recession.  Plans for physical location of industry in the period 1977-80 reflects both this priority and the Government's concern that industrial development strategy should provide for an even spread of development throughout <Col N="1202" /> the country.</P>
    <P>It is quite impossible, logically and practically, to give priority to areas where the need is most felt and also at the same time to have an even spread.  You cannot do both at once. Either you have an even spread or you give priority.  Clearly the Government have not made up their mind what they will do and their statement in paragraph 4 regarding their industrial strategy is completely meaningless and reflects their lack of any thought on the matter.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Government to make a decision where the priorities should be, and setting up a consortium which they are proposing to do&mdash;which is nothing more than a very large talking shop and which will involve taking the chief executives of the major industrial and State enterprise bodies away from their desks where they can make real decisions in order that they may get involved in long discussions on macro-economic ideas&mdash;will not solve this dilemma.  It is the Government's job to decide if priority should be given on an even basis throughout the economy or whether it should be given to those areas of greatest unemployment. Clearly the Government have not, and apparently will not, make up their mind on that issue.  I should like to make my position quite clear.  I believe priority should be given to the areas of highest unemployment, to those groups upon whom unemployment bears most heavily at the moment.  I challenge the Government to state their priorities equally clearly and to get away from this vague attempt to have it both ways, to back both horses in a two-horse race.</P>
    <P>There is a basic misunderstanding on the part of the Government of the role of a Government in job creation in an open economy.  In an economy like ours job creation on a real and lasting basis can take place only if it takes the form of producing goods and services that other countries are prepared to buy.  The type of job we should try to create is one that will be self-sustaining, that will sustain itself by its own produce, by selling the goods or services it produces.</P>
    <P>What kind of jobs are the Government <Col N="1203" /> creating?  What is their policy on job creation?  Is it one that can survive on a self-sustaining basis in an open economy, competing with other economies?  It is not.  The job creation programme of the Government in terms of the budget and what they have done already has consisted in creating 2,000 public service jobs, paid for by the taxpayer, that are not independently self-sustaining.  They are creating 2,100 building jobs, again paid for by the taxpayer, which by their nature are temporary and certainly not self-sustaining.  There are also 5,000 proposed jobs for youth which, again, are not self-sustaining and which must be paid for by the taxpayer.  In many cases these latter jobs are merely glorified training courses.</P>
    <P>I calculate that every such job created on a non-self-sustaining basis within the public service require the income tax paid by three people outside the public service in order to maintain it.  I make this calculation on the basis that on average people pay about 25 per cent of their income in income tax and, assuming that the salaries of those in the public service are equal to those outside it and public servants pay a tax of 25 per cent themselves, this leaves 75 per cent of the salaries to be paid for by the Exchequer.  For that amount to be paid requires the income tax of three people in outside employment is needed in order to sustain each public service job.</P>
    <P>This policy which is being adopted by the Government under the guise of job creation is creating an undesirable shift in resources from the directly productive sector of the economy, from the sector that is exporting and that which has to face competition from outside, to the public sector whose contribution at best is indirect so far as production and exports are concerned.  I am not saying that the public sector does not contribute.  It does in many cases but apart from State companies such as Bord na Móna its contribution is indirect.  We are taking from the directly productive sector in order to create jobs in the indirectly productive public sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> I favour action in the public sector to create jobs but not the kind of action taken by the Government.  I favour action on the part of the commercial companies in the public sector. I should much prefer to see an expansion of jobs in Bord na Móna, which must stand the full wind of competition and which can export their products, than creating 2,000 jobs in the public service.</P>
    <P>There is wrong emphasis in the form of the job creation that is going on, one that is not appropriate to our economy.  I know the theory on which it is based&mdash;I am sure the hand of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is to be seen here&mdash;the traditional Keynesian view of economic problems, that if you have underemployed resources the way to solve the problem is to boost aggregate demand.</P>
    <P>The theory is that by the Government spending more than they are taking in they will boost aggregate demand, thus increasing demand for goods and services and creating employment.  That theory certainly applies on a world scale.  If America, Britain and Germany get together and decide to boost aggregate demand that can have the effect of raising employment in the capitalist world.  But it certainly does not apply within a small open economy for the simple reason that, if this Government spend more than they take in, the results of that spending will not necessarily be felt in terms of increased demand for Irish goods and services.  It will probably be felt in increased demand for imports.  The proper approach and the proper economic theory to the solution of our economic problems is not a macro-Keynesian approach, which is the approach adopted by the Government, but rather a micro-economic sectoral approach which looks at the particular problems in individual sectors to see where we are uncompetitive and lacking in productivity, where we can improve, and spend money not in a global way across the board, as the Government are doing, but in the particular sectors where need for Government help can be identified.</P>
    <P>I propose now to identify where I believe the Government should spend <Col N="1205" /> money.  There are two basic areas in which action should be taken and, hopefully, can still be taken.  First is in the area of promoting new product ideas.  We have a habit of getting foreign enterprises which have their own productive ideas already developed to come in here with their ideas and set up their factories here.  Insufficient attention is paid to developing new product ideas from our own technology.  Secondly, on a micro-economic basis, we have to look at the weakness, the lack of competitiveness and the lack of productivity in our economy and indeed in our own public sector.  An inefficient public service can indirectly affect exports just as much as an inefficient industrial sector because it can and does raise costs for the sector directly involved in production.</P>
    <P>To deal first with the idea of creating new product ideas, obviously new product ideas result initially from research.  But research agencies are not able to put these ideas on the market. We do not see An Foras Talúntais or the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards setting up companies. What they do is rely on entrepreneurs who may be reading their publications, picking up ideas and prepared to implement them.  Most entrepreneurs are not technologists and in many cases would probably not understand the kind of language used in research publications, and so there is therefore a gap between the development of new research ideas by technologists and their implementation in the private sector by entrepreneurs who want to make money.  In Northern Ireland that gap has been effectively bridged by the establishment of the Agricultural Trust which takes over ideas and implements them on a commercial basis.  Once they are established as going concerns the Agricultural Trust sells off the enterprises, the patents or the ideas to a private company prepared to continue the enterprise and give employment.  We need something like that, not just for agriculture but for the whole range of agricultural processing and for industry also.</P>
    <P>We also need more Government help in the form of research and development. <Col N="1206" /> It is much more difficult now for new small industries to develop new ideas because of the EEC proposal in regard to product liability. Under this proposal, if someone is injured by a product the person who markets the product will be absolutely liable, regardless of fault, to compensate for the consequences to that person of consuming the product.  This gives big companies a much greater advantage over small companies because they are likely to have research and development departments and be able to afford to take the risk of marketing new products without being afraid of the consequences.  Clearly there is a role for the Government in helping small firms to develop and we need a much more active approach on the part of the IIRS, on the part of the ACC and the Agricultural Institute in this area by helping small struggling firms with ideas to develop those ideas on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>In this context, we need special concentration on food processing.  There is an unfortunate belief that, because we produce the goods, Ireland is the best place on economic grounds to process those goods.  In actual fact the best place for processing a product may be in the country of consumption.  It will not be sufficient for us, therefore, to sit back and hope that the natural evolution of economic forces will mean agricultural processing will take place here because we produce the food.  If you want to produce tinned food products you have to import the tins at great expense, fill them up and reexport them.  If we are to have effective food processing we must have our own canning plants.  We must have our own plants to produce the various packages required for processed foods.  This is not an agricultural industry.  It is a heavy technological industry.  It is in that area we should see action by the Government and not in the creation of 2,000 more jobs in the civil service, 2,000 more jobs in the construction industry, so many more nurses and consultants, and so on.  The Government should be tackling the basic problems which, to my mind, the Government are avoiding and, on their own admission, avoiding because they have relegated this kind of problem to what <Col N="1207" /> is described as the third phase, the never-never phase in their economic policy.</P>
    <P>We need a tax incentive where the entrepreneur who sets up a new manufacturing industry and thereby creates employment is concerned.  The relief could be complete in some cases provided the manufacturer employs a sufficient number of people.  We have to recognise the disincentive that exists for people with ideas to leave a permanent pensionable post in the public service or some large corporation and go out on their own to set up an industry and try to make money when they have no pension cover and, if they fail, they have no job.  To induce that person to leave the public sector calls for some considerable attraction. Money in the private sector is not being made by the person engaged in manufacture.  It is being made by those engaged in speculation on the property market or in import agencies.  They are the people who get rich quick. We must create a greater incentive for the manufacturer.  That is why I believe an indiscriminate tax cut across the board for everyone is wrong.  The tax cut should be selective and it should be given to those who are prepared to contribute directly to the creation of employment.  It should be a relief on the personal tax of a person setting up a new enterprise and producing some product which has not been produced before.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it could be related to the use of a patent for the first time.  Such a tax exemption would not conflict with EEC Regulations because it would not be confined to the manufactured products being exported.  It would be available to everybody wishing to set up here.  It is more justified to be giving entire tax free status to an entrepreneur who is engaged in manufacturing and creating jobs than giving tax-free status to artists.  The person we need to encourage is the man who creates jobs.  If we are to have tax-free people in this economy the manufacturer on his personal tax is the man who should be tax free and not the artist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> Thought should be given to giving a tax incentive to corporate diversification. The trouble is that many large companies who have resources of finance, accountants, analysts and so forth, which could be used in setting up new enterprises are far too comfortable producing their existing product.  It is only when their market may decline, as in the case of a cigarette company, that they are forced to turn to other products to see if they can diversify and develop.  We can get new product ideas going in our economy through existing manufacturing companies getting into new areas of endeavour.  We should consider the possibility of some increment off tax on companies who adopt new lines of production to their existing ones as long as the new lines are things not previously produced in this economy.  This should be done regardless of whether the products are for export.</P>
    <P>The advantage of a tax cut of that sort is that it will not be availed of, no money will be spent at all, unless the production takes place.  Unless the production takes place there will be no income.  It is not like a grant that is paid out with a hope for the best. Under the scheme I suggest a payout only takes place if production and jobs ensue.  For instance, there is tremendous scope in our fishing industry for large companies already established to get involved in buying boats and ensuring that fish are properly processed in a sort of vertically integrated enterprise. Such a company could ensure that the boats are at sea at the time by employing two crews rather than the present system of skipper-owned boats.  Under that system only one crew is involved and the boat is only at sea for about one-third of the time. Under a corporately developed fishing industry there is a possibility of having two crews operating the boats which could be at sea for greater periods resulting in greater productivity on the capital investment involved.</P>
    <P>Another way we get new product ideas to the fore in our economy is by earlier promotion of young executives and younger people in industry. Promotion should be based on performance rather than seniority necessarily. <Col N="1209" /> I do not believe the Government can, in any sense, intervene and force private companies to do this because they will do it if they think it is best for themselves, but the Government can and should set an example.  In the public service we should abandon the present procedure whereby in most cases promotion is made on the basis of seniority and not on the basis of performance.  If the public sector set an example in that area it is one that would be followed in the private sector.  Younger executives with better ideas would be brought to the fore. We would then have a situation like they have in America where the president of a company is often a man in his mid-thirties.  They are a more successful economy in many ways than we are and we should ask ourselves if this is one of the reasons why.</P>
    <P>I also feel that there is a need to look at our tax code to see if it is giving adequate incentive to labour-incentive industry.  There has been an amount of lip service and some practical service given in this area, but it still makes more sense under the present tax code for á man to invest in a machine than to invest in employing an extra man or woman.  He can get IDA capital grants, the money straight into his fist, from the IDA if he invests in a machine but, more important, under corporation tax he can get entire free depreciation and the cost of plant or buildings can be written off right away for tax purposes.  The day he buys a machine it can be written off for tax purposes even though the full benefit from it may not ensue for ten or 15 years.  If, on the other hand, he invests in a job as against a machine he cannot write the full cost of the job off in the first year.  He can only claim the salary paid to the man he has employed over the ten-year period, as and when he pays the salary.  Instead of getting the full ten-year cost of a newly-created job in the first year, as he could with a machine, he will have to wait ten years and get it in terms of claims for his income tax in each of those ten years on the basis of the expenses involved in employing that extra man.</P>
    <P>We have an employment incentive <Col N="1210" /> scheme involved which is supposed to help labour-intensive industries and was introduced by the previous Government but it is only a partial subsidy and it is probably considered by most people to be a temporary scheme.  If a person is creating a new job he is not looking to what he will get this year in terms of this scheme, he is looking ten years ahead.  If he employs a man, particularly with all the safeguards that now exist in relation to unfair dismissals and so on, he wants to be sure that he will have the money to pay him not just now but ten years hence.  Our present tax code does not provide an adequate incentive for people to employ men rather than purchasing a machine.  If a man is employed the employer must subtract income tax and social insurance from his salary but no income tax or social insurance has to be paid by a machine.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with three areas where I feel the Government could do something to get rid of inefficiencies in our existing social and economic structure.  I should like to identify the areas which need action now but which the Government have by their own admission, relegated to the third phase of their economic programme having spent the money first with which they could make the changes.  Firstly, there is room for elimination of inefficiencies in the public sector and, secondly, for a proper analysis of the relative productivity of different industrial sectors in this economy by comparison with other economies and taking action to remedy that.  Thirdly, a detailed analysis should be carried out of the employment register and job-creating action taken on the basis of identified areas of unemployment rather than on the global basis that is now being adopted by the Government.  In relation to eliminating inefficiencies in the public sector, I have already mentioned the abandonment of seniority in favour of promotion on the basis of performance but there is room for competition between semi-State bodies who may be engaged in similar areas. As long as those bodies are engaged in directly productive activity there is no reason why they should not compete <Col N="1211" /> with one another.  For instance, the Government's decision to say that SFADCo must be brought in under the IDA because SFADCo is competing in a similar area with the IDA is a bad one because we are likely to have better performance from SFADCo and the IDA if they are allowed to continue to compete and their relative performance is open to comparison.  In that way if SFADCo does better than the IDA the finger can be pointed at the IDA.  If, however, the IDA take over the functions of SFADCo there will be no basis on which the performance of the IDA can be compared.</P>
    <P>There is room for competition within the public sector as long as it is pro-ductively related competition.  I also believe that where the Government provide a service to the community there should be a much greater consumer choice on the part of the public in relation to the use of those services. Wherever possible there should be an avoidance of the creation of State monopolies because State monopolies in the production of services almost inevitably lead to inefficiencies.</P>

      <P>As I said, I am merely citing details to illustrate general points, not for its own sake.  I can assure the Chair that I will not get involved in detailed discussion of individual aspects of the economy for any other reason than to illustrate points of general application.  The idea of an RTE monopoly in broadcasting is undesirable.  The idea of giving education grants to colleges rather than to students is undesirable.  All the grants should be given to students so that they can shop around.  There could be consumer choice and competition between educational institutions rather than the present situation where if a student wants to do a particular course he has only one choice as to where he can go.  There is also room for greater use of subcontractors in the public sector in relation to Post Offices services, drainage and other such areas.  These are some of the areas where there could be an improvement in competitiveness and efficiency in the public sector by following up those three basic ideas.  That is all I wish to say about this matter.</P>
      <P>I would now like to turn to the area of improving industrial productivity. Page 16 of the White Paper states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's economic policy as reflected in the budget, by their own admission, is based on the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the mistake the Deputy is making. We are not dealing with economic policy, which has been mentioned in passing.  We are dealing with financial policy, taxation policy and the budget in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget is designed to affect the economy.  The Government are spending money in order to reflate the economy.  That is general economic policy.  It is nonsensical to say that one can discuss the budget and not discuss economic policy.  In paragraph <Col N="1213" /> 24 of the White Paper the Government stated that &ldquo;the latest estimates show that the level of productivity in Ireland for 1974 compares unfavourably with other small Community countries.  For instance, it is less than half that of Belgium, Luxem-bourg, Denmark and the Netherlands.&rdquo; I believe it is very undesirable that we should have an admission that in the first place the latest figures we have about comparative industrial productivity in the country are as old as 1974 and, secondly, that the Government have not immediately acted to set up a committee to look into individual sectors of the economy and say: &ldquo;Where are we less productive than competing economies?  What matters are involved in industry here which make it less productive than competing in other countries?&rdquo;  Something should be done immediately to get up to date figures and to act accordingly.</P>
      <P>As the budget policy is directed to the relief of employment and the creation of jobs we need much more information about where the unemployed are&mdash;a proper analysis of the number unemployed.  We are told we have 107,000 unemployed and that there are many more unemployed in the country whose lack of employment is not recorded in that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But we have not had a strategy based on a detailed analysis of the live register. I believe we should before spending money on a job creation programme ask ourselves several questions. Where are the unemployed? How many of them are sole breadwinners for large families?  How many of them are school leavers?  How many of them are trainable and if so to what level?  How many of them would be prepared to move from one area of the country to another if a job was offered to them?  How many of them are genuinely seeking employment or are merely unemployable?  Is there room for incentives to encourage people who are unemployed by giving them a little more in their unemployment benefit over and above what they are getting to go and take a training course?  Is there a case for allowing people who are unemployed and who become employed through their own efforts, going <Col N="1214" /> out and finding a job in directly productive employment, to allow them to retain for some time in addition to their salary some of the money they were getting in unemployment benefit in order to get away from the suggestion that it is more attractive for some people not to work than to work? If those people were allowed to retain in addition to their salary or wages some of the unemployment benefit they were previously getting after having got a job through their own efforts, we would get over that situation.</P>
    <P>The Government instead of analysing the unemployment register and finding out those details are adopting a global unemployment creation programme.  Their endeavour is to create X thousand new jobs regardless of whether or not those jobs are designed to meet the needs of the unemployed.  Nobody can tell me that creating jobs for hospital consultants is directly helping somebody who is signing on in Werburgh Street Employment Exchange to find a job. There are no consultants signing on in Werburg Street, and yet the creation of this sort of job is included in the figure which is put forward by the Government as its record in tackling the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The danger of the Government's global approach is that the jobs in that sort of programme will not necessarily be provided where the unemployed are but in sectors for which the unemployed are untrained, because we have not got the information about their training levels, or perhaps the new jobs will be provided for people who already have jobs and are merely moving from one job to another or who do not really need jobs but are prepared to take them because they are offered to them at an attractive salary which makes it a little bit better than staying at home and looking after their families.</P>
    <P>I believe that proceeding with this sort of job creation programme before one has done proper research into the existing level of unemployment, where the unemployed are and what sort of people they are, is putting the cart before the horse and is not getting the <Col N="1215" /> best return for the money being spent by the Government.</P>
    <P>Another weakness in the economic strategy is that it is based on improvident tax policy.  They are giving across the board concessions unrelated to direct increases in productivity or job creation.  They are&mdash;this is more worrying on a long term basis&mdash;narrowing the tax base.  They have abolished three taxes: rates on domestic dwellings, wealth tax and car tax.  They are borrowing to do this.  When the Government borrow ultimately that money has to be repaid by the taxpayers.  The Government are creating a situation where a smaller group of taxes will have to repay borrowings which are being used to abolish other taxes.  I believe in the economic theory that it is far better to have a larger number of taxes at a low rate than to have a few taxes at a high rate, which I believe will be the consequence of the Government's policy of abolishing some taxes and borrowing to do it.  If there are a small number of taxes at a high rate there is more likely to be injustices and distortions in the proper distribution of production within the economy than if there were a larger number of taxes at a low rate raising the same amount of money.</P>
    <P>The idea that, to get into office, one must promise to abolish a tax will mean that ultimately we will be left with only one tax, income tax.  All the other taxes will be abolished because to get back into office each time the parties will have to promise to abolish yet another one.  If there is only one tax paying for everything it will be at a very high rate which will create a great deal of injustice.  Regardless of the merits of the individual taxes the idea of borrowing to abolish taxes of that sort rather than reducing the rate of all taxes across the board is the wrong economic approach.</P>
    <P>We need also to look very hard at the way the Government are providing for an adequate review of the economic plan they are putting forward and also for a review of public spending, in particular by the Dáil.  We are told that the White Paper is a plan, that it is a record of Government decisions. <Col N="1216" /> It is no such thing.  It is only a Green Paper; it is not a White Paper at all because it contains only decisions that have been taken already and a certain series of vague hopes and forecasts.  To be a real plan that document would need to contain specific targets, especially in relation to Government expenditure and taxation and, most importantly, a proper system for the review of the achievement of those targets particularly by this House.  The paper does not provide for those sorts of systems of review.  The absence of the provision in the White Paper, in the Government's economic plan generally, for setting up a Committee of this House to review the achievements of the targets set out in that plan is perhaps its greatest weakness of all, because public representatives, of all people, should be involved in the review of the plan.</P>
    <P>I welcome the budget's commitment to a thorough-going assessment of public expenditure priorities.  However, is this just reassuring rhetoric or does it mean something?  Who will carry out the review?  It seems that the people who will carry it out will be the civil service itself, the people by whom the money is already being spent.  It is somewhat like asking somebody to be the judge in his own case.  The problem is that because of the competition between ministries for success and for more money, for better promotion prospects, and because of the competition between experts who obviously want more money spent in their own fields, there is always within the public service a pressure for greater expenditure rather than for any thorough-going review of it,  which is something the Government say and, I believe, sincerely want.</P>
    <P>If the Government are to get the sort of assessment they want they need to look outside the existing public service for the means by which this review will take place.  I would suggest three things: the setting up of a public expenditure commission; secondly, stronger local government; and, thirdly and most importantly, stronger Dáil control over spending. We need a public expenditure commission like the National Prices Commission <Col N="1217" /> which would hire consultants, review all Government spending and publish reports of its findings in relation to individual Departments.  It should consist of people entirely independent. I do not think the National Economic and Social Council is enough because that body has too many jobs to do and contains too many vested interests to carry out the type of review necessary.  Neither do I think the Departments of Finance and of the Public Service are enough because they are not independent and their activities are not public.  They are only private bodies advising the Minister rather than one publishing independent reports regardless of what the Minister might think.  Therefore, I would suggest a public expenditure commission like the National Prices Commission as a means of developing this area.  We also need to delegate more functions to local government so long as local government raises the money itself for what it is spending.  If people are raising the money themselves to pay at a local level for what they are spending they will be more responsible.  The abolition of rates affords an opportunity for this to be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to come now to what I believe to be the most important thing that can be done about public spending. I am sure the Chair will find that everything I am saying in this context is entirely relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, as long as the Deputy is dealing with expenditure, that is relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair might excuse my trepidation.  There is a tremendous case for much stronger Dáil control of the way in which money is spent.  In 1977 the Government spent £1,958 million.  This money was spent with the approval, in theory, of the Dáil.  That was on current services. They spent a further £418 million on capital services.  Yet last year the Dáil devoted only 3.2 per cent of its 563 hours sitting, or 18 hours of the whole year, to reviewing expenditure of £19,000 million on current services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> This situation is getting worse because in 1969 approximately 29 per cent of the time was devoted to reviewing Estimates.  Of the £1,670 million provided in the original current Estimates last year only £30 million was debated in this House.  The rest was passed without any discussion&mdash;the money debated was the money for which the Minister of State now in the House is responsible, the Board of Works. There was a further £300 million in Supplementary Estimates.  These were discussed, but at very short notice, in a debate which consisted of an average of half an hour for each Estimate, even though the Estimate might have consisted of some £40 million or £50 million.  If that was a private company spending that sort of money, if we were members of the board of directors responsible for that sort of spending&mdash;as we are, as elected representatives of this House&mdash;would we be satisfied with that sort of review of public spending?</P>
    <P>Indeed the Appropriation Bill, which gives statutory effect to the Estimates was not discussed at all in this House which is apparently a tradition.  It was only discussed in the Seanad, and there in 1978.  In other words, the Bill authorising the expenditure was not discussed in the Dáil at all.  It was discussed in the Seanad in 1978 when every single penny it was approving had been spent already.  Could any way of dealing with finance be more senseless than that?  I am not blaming the present Government for that.  I am as much responsible for it as any other Member of the House, indeed perhaps more responsible having been a member of the Government for four years. It should be pointed out very clearly as an area greatly in need of reform if we are serious, as the Minister says, about a reassessment of public spending. I believe that the way in which we deal with Estimates in this House is in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution.  Article 17.1.1º says:</P>
    <P>As soon as possible after the presentation to Dáil Éireann under Article 28 of this Constitution of the Estimates of receipts and the Estimates of expenditure of the State for any financial year, Dáil <Col N="1219" /> Éireann shall consider such Estimates.</P>
    <P>That is quite specific&mdash;&ldquo;Dáil Éireann shall consider such Estimates.&rdquo;  Yet the vast majority of those Estimates last year were not considered until the very end of the year and then passed without any discussion at all.  Therefore I do not believe that the provisions of the Constitution in this respect are being abided by at all.  The answer to this would be to amend Standing Orders to allow Estimates to be considered, not in the year in which the money is being spent but in the preceding year.  In other words, the Estimates for 1979 should be considered during 1978 so that the Dáil will have a say in the way in which the money will be spent, that it will be able to talk to the Minister responsible before he has spent the money and persuade him how it believes he should spend it.  An opportunity should be given for a Committee Stage type debate on Estimates during which individual subheads could be discussed, and amendments tabled if necessary. That is the way Estimates are discussed in every country in the world except here and in Britain.  It is foolish to think we can control expenditure if the only opportunity given to us to discuss money is after it has been spent.  Another point is that Estimates should be presented in an improved form.  Rather than giving us information about what is proposed for this year we should be told about the possible consequences in a period of five years in a way similar to the planned programming budget system in the US.</P>
    <P>I will briefly deal with agricultural policy.  The white paper in this respect is rather pessimistic, putting the annual growth rate at 5.7 per cent. The Coalition green paper put the rate at 6 per cent.  I do not agree this scaling down is justified on the facts. The Government have not made any statement of their intention in relation to marketing.  We have been promised a Grain Marketing Board, a Potato Marketing Board and a Co-ordinating body for agricultural marketing.  None of these has happened.  We are asking <Col N="1220" /> farmers to invest in the industry at a time when farm taxation policy creates uncertainty.  We are told that the £60 PLV threshold multiplier system will be retained &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo;. Quite clearly the Government will revise the thresholds downwards.  If farmers are to invest they must know now what their tax status will be in the next five to ten years.  The Government should tell them now what their long-term taxation programme will be.  If a farmer knows that he will be in the tax net in three years he will make a certain set of decisions, but if he does not know he will make other decisions.  If he opts for the multiplier system this year he will be stuck with it even though it may be doubled next year.  However, I will deal with many such points on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Thought should be given to encouraging, through the tax code, the increasing of stock numbers on farms rather than have the present system which over-emphasises fixed investment in buildings, cement yards and so on.  That is not of any benefit unless you have the stock numbers.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Bruton one would wonder if Fianna Fáil had been in Government uninter-ruptedly for 20 years or whether at any stage he had handed over the reins to a National Coalition.  How could we have looked seriously at the unemployment situation without knowing exactly the type of jobs we need and the type of people unemployed?  One of the biggest mistakes made by the Coalition during their years in office was their failure to have a census of the population.  It would have been worth more than the £1¾ million it would have cost because we would have now some idea of the problems we have to face and we would have knowledge of possible solutions.  I have a fair idea that some of the jobs we are creating are not suitable for the type of people who are unemployed, and that goes back not only to the lack of census figures but to the educational system.  People turned out by schools today are not suitable for the jobs being created, and this in turn goes back to the academic-orientated educational system.  The lack of a <Col N="1221" /> census was a mistake for which we are trying to make up lost ground.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Bruton admit that the processing of our agricultural produce could not be done effectively in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said there are many aspects of agricultural processing which, because of economies of scale, could not be done effectively here.  I totally disagree with that type of thinking and with what lies behind it.  We can look at the brand marks of the world and of Europe in particular with its 250 million consumers, and we have to consider the multinationals.  I have a different outlook from that of Deputy Bruton.  I believe that we can produce and process quality foods equal to that of any world product.  We do not need economy-scaled production lines here: we can do it in small units when the people realise that we can specialise in one aspect of agriculture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget has been widely acclaimed.  It is an unfortunate aspect of Irish life today that we do not see the budget in its true sense as an instrument of Government policy to shape the future of the economy for the 12 months ahead, we are inclined to look at it in terms of &ldquo;what it can do for me.&rdquo;  This budget has been acclaimed by everyone as expansionary. <Col N="1222" /> It is well designed to achieve its stated objectives.  It has looked after most sectors but unfortunately it has done nothing for the plight of the Opposition who have not yet re-recovered from the frustration that we saw on their faces as they sat in stunned silence on budget day.</P>
    <P>There was mixed reaction to the various aspects of the budget.  Deputy Bruton was on the side of private enterprise to a large extent, but his partner in opposition doubted the wisdom of backing private enterprise to the extent this Government have backed it.  The budget has been described as a calculated risk.  Life in general is a gamble.  Every decision made involves a certain amount of risk.  As long as the risk is taken with the right strategy behind it I am prepared to go along with it.  The situation here demanded that a risk be taken.  I go along with the risk as long as everybody understands the type of risk necessary to attempt to solve our twin problems of high unemployment and inflation.  The Minister made a very sane and correct approach in his budget to solving the problems of the nation.  There are no winners or losers yet, and they will not be known until this time next year, until we see whether the challenge thrown out to the private sector and to every person in Ireland will be responded to.  This is a once-off operation which has been described as a priming of the engine. We have 12 months in which to see if the budget will work.  What options did we have?  We could have reduced public expenditure, making our unemployment problem worse.  We could have increased taxation reducing further the incentive to work and to invest.  We had the option of not doing anything.  A case was made that we need not have done anything, that the economy was coming out of a recession and that we had a 5 per cent growth rate.  That would have been a very poor and dismal approach to our problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the businessman's approach.  Running a business is similar to running a country. A business has a chairman and a board of directors who consider <Col N="1223" /> policies coming up before them for decision.  In this case the policies were put before the people prior to the general election in the Fianna Fáil manifesto which is better known as the political bible of the day.  The people gave unqualified approval to the policies.  The Minister for Finance in his budget is implementing the wishes of the people in relation to the direction which the economy should take over the next four or five years.  Had the Minister taken another direction he would have been failing in his duty to the people.  Last summer the people turned their backs on the half-baked socialism that was being applied here. They saw that it was getting them nowhere, that stagnation was the order of the day, and they wanted courageous leadership to take on our problems. They gave their unqualified approval to the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  On budget day the Minister for Finance further implemented the promises that had been made in the election manifesto.</P>
    <P>There is a stark comparison between the manifesto and the 14-point plan of our predecessors.  We implemented more in the last six months than they implemented in 4½ years.  One action is worth a million promises.  The budget was a full implementation of the policy document which received the unqualified approval of the people. In his budget the Minister for Finance restored the incentive to work and the incentive to invest and produce.  I expressed my views on the direction the Irish economy had taken over the last three or four years.  Some members of the Opposition agreed with my views but because of their alliance with the Labour Party they were unable or unwilling to change their direction.  It was only when they made some slight change in that direction with their budget last year that things began to look up.  The incentive to work and to invest had disappeared and the uncertainty with which the farmers were faced slowed production.  By slashing personal taxation the Minister restored the incentive to work.  The wealth tax had created a disincentive to develop businesses and farms and I am sure Deputy Bruton agrees with <Col N="1224" /> the abolition of this tax.  Wealth tax was never introduced in England although they are much nearer to being a social welfare state than we could ever hope to be.  They in their wisdom saw at the last minute that it was not advisable, yet, for ideological reasons the Coalition Government introduced it here amid sustained opposition from Fianna Fáil.  I am sure it came as no surprise to anybody that Fianna Fáil in their first budget abolished wealth tax thus restoring the incentive to develop businesses.  A man will not be taxed now on the effort that he might put into developing either his farm or his business during his whole lifetime.  We are still a private enterprise society by and large.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, say that no money left the country either as a result of or prior to the introduction of wealth tax.  He must know that millions of pounds left the country, not after the introduction of that legislation but prior to its introduction. He must know that accountants worked day and night in their efforts to find havens for money. Having regard to the type of economy we have I am prepared to accept the statement of the Central Bank that they could find no trace of such happenings, but Deputy Ryan is not so naïve as to believe that huge sums of money were not removed from the country.  This money left the country at a time when it was needed most for development.  We have a different approach.  We believe in creating incentives and in giving recognition to enterprise and effort.  Our predecessors seemed to have been of the opinion&mdash; and with tragic consequences&mdash;that it was easier to catch flies with vinegar rather than with honey.  We believe in using honey.</P>
    <P>The reliefs in respect of indexing capital gains and restructures are justifiable and badly needed.  The situation in this regard was a disincentive both to the farming and to the business communities.  I cannot envisage anyone in public life attempting to defend speculation in any form but if the end result of a tax that has been introduced is the prevention of development <Col N="1225" /> of business or of leaving a man wondering whether he should transfer his business, such tax should not be part of our taxation system.</P>
    <P>The change in corporation tax should give the necessary impetus to anyone who is willing to avail of the opportunities.  It is a realistic start and I trust it will be taken up.  It is a concession that should pay for itself.</P>
    <P>I concur fully with the sentiments expressed by the Minister in relation to the special place of the small industry. The small industry of today is the large industry of tomorrow. Very many of our large industries had humble beginnings but they developed to the extent that they could take their place in the economies of the world. The small industry will continue to contribute more than its fair share to the job-creation programme.  I have witnessed in my own county the importance of the small industry down through the years.  If we had a situation in which there was a small industry in every town and village processing what was produced locally, we could say that we had the real vision of a future Ireland.  These are the types of industries that make such a big impact on the economy of rural Ireland.  The occasion of this budget is the first time that the small industry has been given officially its rightful recognition.  Profits from the small industry are the only source of reinvestment for the small industrialist. Consequently, in raising to £25,000 the tax free limit for the small industrialist, the Minister is taking a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In many cases small industries are the product of local brains, of local entrepreneurs.  These are the industries that come best through a recession or through other difficult times.  The small industrialist has invested his money and his time and is prepared to work long hours to keep his business viable. These are the type of people we want to see becoming more involved in industry. They are the people who have confidence in themselves and who do not accept the myth that is perpetrated in parts of the country regarding Irish people not having the ability nor the enterprise to solve their problems. <Col N="1226" /> However, that instinct of confidence was to a large extent killed in the people.  If we have done nothing more during the past eight months than to restore their confidence, our efforts have been worth while.  People are happy now going about their daily work.  It is time that the investment plans that were left lying on the bottom shelves in managers offices were taken out and activated.  We are now a nation on the move.  We are on the road to solving our problems and are not looking abroad to anybody else to solve them for us.  The world does not owe us a living.  Apart from the ability shown by Irish people at home, many of those who have gone abroad have also shown their ability to reach the top of the ladder.  With Fianna Fáil's return to office confidence has been restored in the people.</P>
    <P>We have never said that we could solve all the nation's problems in one year or indeed during one term of Government, but we said that we could make a good start.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the handling by the Minister for Fisheries, of negotiations on a Common Fisheries Policy in Brussels on January 30th and 31st last, which has involved the abandonment of this country's case for a 50 mile exclusive limit.</P>
      <P>I have here a document which purports to be the draft resolution of the Council of Ministers concerning the introduction of fishing plans within the EEC.  If this document is to be given credence it means that we as a nation have abandoned our claim to a 50-mile exclusive limit.  I should like the Minister to verify that this is the document.  It sets out the objectives of the Community's fishing plans and there is a total of 16.  The Minister may contradict me as I go along on the validity of this document.  It is a draft resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to mention some of the points in this draft resolution. We are told in paragraph 3 that fishing plans may not discriminate as between fishermen of the member states of the Community or affect their rights of access.  There appear to be a number of points in the same document contradicting paragraph 3.  The latter part of the first paragraph refers to the employment of the natural geographical advantages in catch possibilities within a few hours' steaming time from home ports so as to favour balanced development in line with progressive improvement of fish stocks.  I fail to see the meaning of these contradictory statements in one document.  There is clearly a contradiction.  In the first place we are told there cannot be any discrimination between member states and then we are told that people will enjoy a natural geographical advantage and that they will have catch possibilities within a few hours' steaming time from home ports.  The vagueness <Col N="1228" /> of that statement is quite extraordinary; it can only be described as woolly and has no relevance whatsoever. How can one define &ldquo;a few hours' steaming time&rdquo; from a home port? It could be five miles and it could be 25 miles depending on the definition &ldquo;a few&rdquo;.  How can we agree even on an interim basis to any such statement?</P>
      <P>Paragraph 6 states that fishing plans shall take into account that vessels which due to their limited range of operation can only exercise their activities close to the coast should have priority in coastal areas.  This seems to be a direct contradiction of paragraph 3 which provides that there may not be any discrimination of any kind.</P>
      <P>There is a further contradiction in paragraph 7.  It is provided that the activities of other categories of vessels must be harmoniously introduced into the global fishing activity of all vessels operating in the area and in particular undue concentration of long-range vessels in areas closest to the coast should be prevented.  I do not see how this can be done because of the statement in paragraph 3 that there may not be discrimination.  How can we deny right of access?</P>
      <P>This document would appear to set out to confuse us so that we do not know what is going on.  I have spoken to fishermen and they have not the slightest idea what it means or what is proposed.  I understand that the Government are at present drawing up plans, but nobody seems to have the slightest idea how those plans will affect our fishermen.  It seems likely that our own fishermen will be excluded from large areas of Irish waters. It is a most extraordinary plan.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 12 states:</P>
      <P>Fishing plans may clearly identify vessel categories, fishing periods, types of gear, number of boats, species to be fished and other relevant data while ensuring that there is sufficient flexibility, for example, to enable replacement of vessels and to ensure right of passage, it being understood that fishing plans may be tailored to suit different circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> All this adds up to confusion and contradiction. We as a party oppose any such plan. It cannot be for the benefit of the Irish fishing industry.  Clearly, it will give certain countries within the EEC, notably France and Holland, the right to fish within six miles of our shores.  They seem to be protected under this draft resolution by the 1964 London Convention, which gives them certain historical rights.  I do not see how the Minister can deny for one minute that he has collapsed on the matter of the 50-mile exclusive limit and is now settling for a six-mile limit while he allows this document to be implemented even on an interim basis, if it is ever accepted.  We are asking this House to see that it is not accepted.  It is not what the fishing industry wants, it is not what the National Coalition Government were set to achieve, and it is not what Fianna Fáil promised before the election. It reneges on any promise made before the 1977 election.</P>
    <P>We are asking that the Minister should go back to Brussels, refute this document and renegotiate on the basis of a 50-mile exclusive limit.  That is what we were promised and that is what we expect to get.  There are numerous quotations on the record of the House from a variety of Fianna Fáil speakers during that last Dáil session giving their support to a 50-mile exclusive limit and promising that once in power they would renegotiate the terms of the Treaty of Accession to ensure that such a limit would be obtained.  This document will allow foreign fishermen to come within six miles of our shores.  We have very vivid memories of what these people did when they were allowed to within six miles of our shores: our fisheries have not yet recovered from the damage.  We have no reason to believe that they will not do the same thing again, given the chance.  The likelihood is that they will perform exactly the same acts of plunder and poaching and that there will not be any fish left for any Irish fishermen within a short space of time.</P>
    <P>In October 1976 the Coalition Government got an agreement at The Hague which gave the Irish fishing <Col N="1230" /> industry an outstanding chance to expand.  These negotiations were conducted by Deputy FitzGerald, who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs. We gained considerable ground, principally the commitment from fellow members to the fact that the Irish fishing industry was a special case and was to be considered separately from all other members, including Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Fisheries has let our case slide.  We are now in the unhappy position that, where we had high hopes of a 50-mile exclusive fishery zone, we are now settling for six miles.  Under the conditions of that agreement drawn up by the Council of Ministers we were also to be given the right to double our catch of fish between 1976 and 1979.  Again, I fear the present Minister for Fisheries has collapsed on this issue.  On the basis of recent figures published by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara the amount of fish we shall be allowed to catch in 1978 falls drastically short of what we were promised in The Hague Agreement of October 1976.  At that time we were promised that we would be allowed double our catch. Our catch, according to Bord Iascaigh Mhara figures, in 1976 was 80,663 tons&mdash;I shall be kinder to the present Minister &mdash;on the basis of the previous year's figures, 75,188 tons, our catch for 1978 should be somewhere between 125,000 tons and 135,000 tons.  I should like the Minister to explain how he has agreed to a catch of a mere 96,000 tons.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the figures for 1976 our catch for 1977 should have been 108,000 tons, for 1978, 135,000 tons and for 1979, 162,000.  But from the information available to us for the first half of 1977 it appears that not alone have we not increased our catch as promised but it has actually dropped. So, we cannot look forward to reaching the target which we had set ourselves in October 1976.  Due to vast overfishing, our fishermen have not been able to get the quantities promised. Under the Minister's present proposals it is obvious that those figures, rather than double, will fall far short and we are deeply concerned that this should not be allowed to <Col N="1231" /> continue.  We take exception to the fact that our quotas for herring for 1978 have been reduced, not increased according to the promise or plan in 1976.  Our catch of herring in 1975 was 28,000 tons whereas the catch which we were told we would be allowed in 1978 is 22,000 tons.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter.  We were supposed to be in a position where we would double our catch but we are now in a position where there is a drastic fall.  The excuse will be made that we shall increase our catch in other sectors.  The only alternative fish to be caught are of very low quality and fetch an inferior price.  The two species most likely to come into the reckoning in this regard are blue whiting and sprats neither of which fetches an even reasonably good price on the market and they produce a very poor return for the fishermen.  We regard the dropping of the Irish fishermen's demand for an increase in their herring quota as being detrimental to our fishing industry.  I believe the Minister has to tackle the job of going back and making sure that we get our due share of the fish that really sell well.  No fish sells better at present than herring. Unfortunately, we have no vast stocks of cod which could be compared to herring.  We have the herring and should be allowed to catch them and should not be fobbed off with some inferior species.</P>
    <P>Repeatedly in previous debates prior to their coming into office, Fianna Fáil speakers told us that on no account would they settle for quotas, that they wanted Irish fishermen to catch as much as they could within the 50-mile limit.  However, since the present Minister for Fisheries took over the emphasis has been more and more on a dilution of that promise or principle. We have gone from exclusive zone to special zone, to preferential zone and latterly there has been talk of a Community solution to the problem.  This all adds up to dilution of the original promise.  The word &ldquo;quota&rdquo; has crept in more and more.  We are now told that the draft resolution with which we were recently presented will be based on fishing plans which in turn will be based on quotas and licences. <Col N="1232" /> Our experience of quotas and licences has been anything but happy.  In the past, quotas have been an excuse for wholesale deception by foreigners.  We have no reason to think that in future there will be a change for the better. The North Eastern Atlantic Fishing Commission found out this to their cost: countries took what they wanted. They were granted a certain quota and when they found their fleets had fished this quota within three or six months they merely continued to fish.  I have no doubt that the French, the Dutch and the others, when they have fished their quotas off our coast&mdash;if they are allowed to do so and we intend to see that they are not&mdash;in three or six months will continue and nobody will stop them.  The reason they will continue is that it will be a political decision and we shall be quite powerless because their attitude, as always, will be just to ride roughshod over smaller nations.  That is what they have done off our coast for the past ten or 15 years; that is what they will continue to do; that is what they have done in recent times.</P>
    <P>To emphasise my point I shall quote a figure which makes very vivid reading and gives a very good reason why we should never agree to a quota system where these people are involved. In 1976 in zone 6A which is off the north west coast of Donegal the Dutch were allocated a quota of 7,600 tons of herring.  This is stated in Leaflet 84 produced by the Minister's Department.  However, according to Leaflet 88 issued by the same Department last year the Dutch actually caught 21,039 tons of herring in that area.  How could we ever expect those people to confine themselves to a quota? There they trebled their allocation because they had fished their quota within a matter of months. They had no intention of stopping at that point.</P>
    <P>The whole system of quotas and licences is open to abuse.  We have only to look towards our fishing system and at salmon licence escapades in recent years.  People are fishing for salmon without licences.  They are supposed to have them, but they get away without them.  They have been doing so for years and doing it openly. <Col N="1233" /> Even some people who have licences are abusing them wholesale.  From my observation of activities off the coast I have found Irish fishermen to be more honest and law-abiding than foreigners to whom we are going to grant licences and quotas.  To think that these people will ever honour these quotas is to put one's head in the sand like an ostrich.</P>
    <P>We have learned from recent talks of the very entrenched position taken up by the British.  It is ironic that two years ago, in negotiations when we got agreement to be treated as a special case, the British were indifferent about their fishery limits. Now the wheel has turned full circle and the British are holding out for a better deal than obviously we are going to get under this draft resolution or, interim agreement as it is called.  At that time the emphasis in Britain was on the long-distance fleet.  They fished in Icelandic, Russian and Norwegian waters and the main catch was that highly valued fish, cod.  They caught vast quantities of it, but suddenly with the imposition of 200-mile limits internationally the British fleet was shut out.  Far from concentrating their efforts on their long-distance fleet activities they have now recognised that their future lies close to their own shores.  The biggest confidence trick that has been pulled in the Brussels negotiations in recent years was pulled by the British on the Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Lenihan, when they took him by the hand and said &ldquo;Let us go together and negotiate, because in unity there is strength&rdquo;.  Little did our naïve Minister for Fisheries know that he was being led to the slaughter. They have somersaulted us; while we have settled for less they are demanding more, despite the fact that in the 1976 agreement we were the ones to be treated as a special case. Britain are now being treated as a special case and, like a spoiled child sitting in a corner, it looks as if they are going to get their way.</P>
    <P>If the British Minister, Mr. Silkin, had not dug in his heels in Brussels two weeks ago we would not be talking about a fishing limit here this evening.  We would be talking about a <Col N="1234" /> permanent common fisheries policy. The Minister may be thankful yet that Mr. Silkin has kept his options open because by all accounts the Minister for Fisheries has thrown away the whole game.  The British even up to a year ago were prepared to settle for a 12-mile exclusive limit with preferential treatment up to 50 miles. We at that time were holding out for a 50-mile exclusive limit.  I do not pretend that we were going to be hardline in that matter.  We always said, as we say today, that we did not necessarily want everything inside the 50-mile exclusive limit.  We were quite fair and we said we would catch what we could and if there were excess fish we would allow in our partners from the EEC to take what was there to be taken, in the interests of conservation. We never dug in our heels to the extent that we were going to act the dog in the manger and exclude everybody else.  We would even take what excess fish were there on our terms. That is still our stand, but the British wanted only a 12-mile exclusive limit and they were willing to take the easy way from there up to 50 miles.</P>
    <P>Once the British long-distance fleet collapsed and once they were hunted out of Icelandic, Norwegian and Russian waters their attitude changed. They have been scrapping and breaking up their long-distance trawlers for the last year or so and have turned their attention to coastal fishery activities. What has that meant?  They have changed their strategy, and that is where our Minister for Fisheries is fooled up to his eyes.  They saw that we were going to get an excellent deal on the basis of the October 1976 agreement. They decided that they had better string along with us and thereby they might do a lot better than they had previously hoped.  This has happened to such an extent that not alone are we not going to get the 50 miles, but according to this document we are going to get only six miles.  The Minister for Fisheries has made a disastrous mistake in aligning our case with that of the British.  Events have proved this correct.  I only hope he can retrieve the situation to some extent before it is too late, and it is getting late.</P>
    <P>Our fishing industry must be allowed <Col N="1235" /> to expand at the rate promised in the 1976 agreement.  As I pointed out earlier, with the total catch allocated for 1978, which is far short of what we were promised, this cannot be done. We have to keep the foreigners&mdash;even though they be our fellow-members in the EEC&mdash;far away from our coasts. Their catching power is too great for the limited amount of fish available.  If they keep on catching it as they have been for years past a major expansion in our fishing industry is out of the question.  Many Irish fishing boat owners at the moment are in serious financial difficulties and are finding it exceedingly difficult to pay their way. I will quote figures from a reply to a question I put down to the Minister for Fisheries on Tuesday 31 January. I asked him the number of purchasers of boats who were in arrears in their repayments to BIM.  Summarised, the answer was that out of a total of 438 borrowers&mdash;that is people who were purchasing their boats&mdash;from BIM, 292 were in arrears.  He can hardly state that we have a healthy fishing industry when two-thirds of our fishermen are in arrears with repayments on their boats.</P>
    <P>How can we allow our total catch to be cut back when we were promised an expansion, when we were promised a doubling of it within three years? How can we allow the most valuable species of fish off our coasts to be denied to the Irish fishermen and replaced by fish which have a very poor market value, fish which are very difficult to catch because they are at great depths off the western coast? I refer to blue whiting.  That is what the Minister is being fobbed off with.  We are getting a cutback in our catch.  We are getting a reduction in the quantity of the most valuable species at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I realise there was a need for conservation of the herring stock.  The time has come for the Minister to ask the EEC to allow Irish fishermen to commence fishing for herring in all zones off the Irish coast.  Remember, we did not do the damage.  The Dutch did it.  Remember, the Irish fishing fleet, as presently constituted, are not capable of doing irreparable harm to <Col N="1236" /> the herring stocks off our coasts.  Their catching power is quite limited.  As we can see from the figures quoted, they are in serious financial trouble. They should be allowed back into the herring grounds to catch a reasonable amount of herring.  It is very difficult for people on the south coast to survive when the Celtic Sea is closed continuously and there are considerable quantities of herring there.  I do not believe any great damage would be done by allowing the Irish fishing fleet to fish in these waters for herring.</P>
    <P>Why should we not? The Dutch are doing it.  They have been fishing for herring in the Celtic Sea as long as the band has been ostensibly in existence. That is well known.  They have been fishing for herring under the guise of mackerel fishing.  This has been quite obvious.  They have been seen fishing in the area on a considerable scale.  I have seen them myself. There is no shortage of herring on the Dutch market, in processing concerns or on the open market.  They are as plentiful as ever.  We can be sure a sizeable quantity of that herring is coming from waters which are banned to Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a few points on which the Minister promised recently to take action, but he has not done so.  I should like to pinpoint the damage being done to our white fishing industry, that is the demersal end of it, by the Spaniards.  Under the 1964 London Convention the Spaniards have certain rights up to 12 miles off our coasts, and six miles in certain cases, but I am told legally any rights they had were superseded by the 200-mile limit brought in by the Maritime Jurisdiction Act last year. They are being granted licences by the EEC.  At the moment I am told something like 107 boats from Spain are being allowed to fish off our coasts. I am aware that only 68 of those boats can fish at any one time.  When one drops out another comes in and 68 large Spanish boats are licensed to fish.</P>
    <P>The Spanish fleet has increased out of all proportion in numbers and in the size of the boats.  Gone are the days when they had small wooden 50 foot boats.  Now they have 120 or 130 <Col N="1237" /> foot steel hull boats capable of catching a fantastic quantity.  They are doing a lot of harm.  They have been caught repeatedly in the past 12 or 15 months off our coasts.  There have been up to 20 convictions in regard to boats fishing without a licence although they have been allocated 68 licences.  It is time they were told to get out of EEC waters completely.  Obviously they are making a play to set up a catch record for their proposed entry into the EEC. I do not see why our fishermen should have to suffer while these people are carrying on as they are at present.</P>
    <P>On 1 December in answer to a parliamentary question the Minister promised to introduce legislation in January to increase fines for fishery offences to a realistic level.  January has come and gone and there is no new legislation increasing those fines. It is imperative that this legislation should be brought in immediately, especially in view of a recent High Court decision.  A number of people, including Bulgarians and Spaniards, were caught and had their gear confiscated, but now they will be allowed to retain it because of that High Court decision.  It now appears that any boat caught in Irish waters recently can only be fined a maximum of £100. There was the added penalty that gear, sometimes worth hundreds of thousands of pounds could be confiscated. It is imperative that we introduce realistic fines in the order of £50,000 or £100,000 for illegal fishing within our limits.</P>
    <P>To return to the essence of the motion, we feel the Minister has gone soft on the 50-mile exclusive limit. Every statement emanating from Brussels over the past seven months has shown he has weakened beyond all comprehension.  We take exception to this because, in Government, we put up such a stern fight to win a foothold for Ireland which was lost in 1970 and 1972, lost in 1970 when the six members of the EEC drew up a common fisheries policy biased against all belief in their own favour.  In 1972 when the Treaty of Accession was being negotiated, the Fianna Fáil Government made no attempt to right the wrong which had been done.  They accepted the eventuality that by 1982 <Col N="1238" /> our fellow EEC members could fish right up to our shores.  We retrieved that situation through the negotiating ability of our then Foreign Minister. Deputy FitzGerald.  The Minister has lost that ground.  He has let it slip away and we are now back where we started. We are in exactly the same position as we were in 1964.  The Dutch and the French, the people who did all the damage to our fisheries are entitled to come within six miles of our shores if we are to believe this draft resolution we received from the Council of Ministers meeting.</P>
    <P>That has been one of the biggest letdowns an Irish politician has ever given to the people of this country. We can ill afford it when we should be expanding in such a high job intensive industry as the fishing industry. It is so sad and so drastic that the Minister should tear up these proposals and say: &ldquo;Interim agreement or not, we are not having it&rdquo; and stick out for what was originally promised, what we originally fought for and what we were on the point of attaining&mdash;a 50-mile exclusive limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say the Government demand for an exclusive coastal band for 50 miles has not been withdrawn or watered down.  It is still there and will remain until an acceptable agreement is reached on a revised EEC Common Fisheries Policy.  It has been and will be Government policy that an adequate coastal band reserved to Irish fishermen is essential for the conservation of stocks and also to ensure the expansion of the Irish fishing industry, the special need for which has been accepted by the Community on social and economic grounds.  Most member states are of course adamantly opposed to the idea of any coastal state having completely exclusive rights and this has been the principal factor in blocking the completion of a new common fisheries policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past year or so stopgap measures, mainly for herring, have been adopted which, while better than a free-for-all, have been unsatisfactory. I should point out however that the measure closing the west of Ireland <Col N="1239" /> herring fishery last year for which the Minister secured the agreement of the Council of Ministers was very successful and helped considerably to improve herring fishing in the area in the latter part of the year.  Our fishermen fully accept the value of that closure and have advocated a similar closure this year.</P>
    <P>At recent Council meetings it was evident that there was no prospect of early agreement for a revised common fisheries policy.  Accordingly in order to safeguard our fish stocks the Minister proposed as an interim solution&mdash;and I stress the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo;&mdash;that a fishing plan arrangement be introduced for the remainder of this year.  The Opposition can hardly criticise the Minister for asking for such plans seeing that the former Government invited member States to submit fishing plans last year.</P>
    <P>There appears to be confusion among some of our fishermen as to what the plans mean.  The main effect of such plans would be that boats fishing in our waters would be licensed and the fishing efforts of boats of the member States other than Ireland reduced substantially in the coastal areas of our waters.  While there was no agreement on the package of interim measures proposed at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers, it was agreed that this fishing plan system would be introduced in our waters as soon as possible.  Officials of the Department have since attended a meeting of representatives of other member states and the Commission to discuss the early introduction of fishing plans.</P>

      <P>Further meetings will be held in the near future.  Officers of the Department will be available for consultation with Irish fishery interests while the scheme is being worked out. Before passing from the last Council meeting, the Minister again stated our position&mdash;that we would not agree to substantive agreements <Col N="1240" /> with third countries until the internal arrangements had first been settled.</P>
      <P>The Community are now faced with a situation where there are no agreed Community measures, even stopgap ones, in operation.  This is a very serious situation and it was to avoid such a situation that the Minister tried to get agreement on interim measures for 1978.  Unfortunately agreement of all nine member States was not forthcoming for the interim measures suggested by the Commission.  It is now a matter for national governments to introduce fish conservation measures in respect of the waters under their control.  Of course such measures will have to be non-discriminatory and the approval of the Commission will have to be sought for their introduction in accordance with The Hague Agreement. The Minister already made an order continuing the ban on herring fishing in the Mourne Sea and Celtic Sea and a comprehensive package of other technical and control measures is being considered urgently in the Department.  The Minister already held discussions with fishermen's representatives on the measures under consideration.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, let me emphasise that the fishing plan system is purely an interim measure for the present year. It is not designed to replace the exclusive coastal band which the Minister is seeking but could be a useful adjunct to it in the final arrangement.</P>
      <P>All of us appreciate that the fishing industry is essential to the economy.  I come from a county that depends largely on that industry for employment. There are many things we would wish to be done but we realise they cannot be done.  I have confidence that our Minister will negotiate an agreement for Irish fishermen that will be to the benefit of the fishermen and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister inherited a situation that was not satisfactory but he has fought a case for the Irish fishermen and I am convinced he will obtain an agreement for them that will be to their advantage.  In order to secure the fishing industry, to make it a long-term profitable enterprise, we must <Col N="1241" /> give serious consideration to conservation of the fish stocks.  Unless we keep this matter uppermost in our minds, in time the seas will become barren. Everyone appreciates this.  The fishermen realise that reasonable conservation measures will safeguard their livelihood.  I am convinced that the Minister will win for Irish fishermen the right to fish the seas around our coast for an acceptable distance in order that we may secure the maximum benefit.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party supports this motion, particularly because we are gravely concerned that at present the country is in a state of abysmal unawareness as to what the Minister and the Government are doing in these negotiations. There have been so many statements based on the generalities of negotiations and so many conflicting kites have been flown in the past few months that at this stage the people of the country, Members of this House and the fishermen themselves do not know what to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that in the near future we will have a package of interim measures.  The Minister says they will be temporary, somewhat experimental, and dependent on a number of factors. We know what these generally are&mdash; they have been spelled out.  We do not know if the measures will become permanent.  We do not know whether any definition has been given to the various rather wonderful 19th century terms used in these documents such as &ldquo;a few hours steaming&rdquo;, whatever that might mean.  I have visions of Commissioner Gundelach and the Minister for Fisheries steaming out of Dublin on a Board of Works dredger trying to measure the distance in terms of hours. It is in that kind of &ldquo;Hughie Green&mdash;Opportunity Knocks&rdquo; situation the Government are carrying out the present fishery negotiations.  It all boils down to one major, but simple, fact.  The politicians here&mdash;and I include both sides in this, but particularly the Fianna Fáil Party, and the Commission in terms of its responsibility, including Commissioner Gundelach and some of his senior staff&mdash;have been persistently, consistently, <Col N="1242" /> and quite outrageously dishonest with our fishermen.  Indeed, our fishermen were used as a sprat to catch votes in the general election last June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a great regard for Deputy Garret FitzGerald as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I believe he would have got a coherent package at the end of the day because he has a better capacity and a greater ability in negotiating than the majority, if not all, the Members of this House. With him negotiating we would at least have known where we stood.  It is no disrespect to the present Minister to suggest Deputy Garret FitzGerald as Minister for Foreign Affairs would have got a better package.  However, I do not believe Deputy Garret FitzGerald, or Deputy Haughey, who shed copious tears out in Howth over the fishermen and their plight, or Deputy Lenihan, or any public official would have got a 50-mile exclusive fishery limit and that is where the fundamental deception was fostered in the first instance, tragically for Irish fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be honest about it now.  Irish fishermen saw themselves, I suppose, as being in a negotiating position. They were filled with zeal and concern for their economic livelihood. They had the sympathy and the understanding of the House.  But what appeared initially to be a negotiating position deteriorated into a political football.  Deputy Lenihan, Minister for Fisheries may point the finger across the floor at Deputy Garret FitzGerald, but that football was kicked into touch <Col N="1243" /> during the general election, by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It happened out in Dún Laoghaire.  We are about the sixth most important, or least important, port in terms of catch.  I remember, whether it was in local pubs or just talking to local fishermen, you would swear that Deputy David Andrews and Deputy Martin O'Donoghue&mdash;one a Minister of State and the other a &ldquo;Minister for&rdquo;&mdash;lay awake at night and never got a wink of sleep worrying over a 50-mile limit. They were going to pace it out to the Kish Bank to measure the distance so preoccupied were they about it.  They conned the fishermen: &ldquo;Put us back and we will get it.  The Coalition do not know what they are talking about. Mark Clinton is Minister for Agriculture and Garret FitzGerald talks too much.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies, yes.  In fact, during that time the Ministers and staffs of both the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries were, from my observations, in a much more effective and stronger position than this Government find themselves in today. Had Deputy Lenihan gone to Brussels shortly after his appointment as Minister and said: &ldquo;Look, there is no way I can get a 50-mile limit and it simply is not on and I will settle for the best possible deal&rdquo;, then he would not be the laughing stock he is, as I have found as a member of the Council of Europe.  I was in Paris only this morning, yesterday evening as well, and the Irish are a joke, an absolute joke.  Hughie Green on &ldquo;Opportunity Knocks&rdquo; would not find it easier to get a laugh.</P>
      <P>I believe the position has now been pre-empted by continually telling the fishermen: &ldquo;Do not worry.  We will get a little bit now and we will carry it through and we will have our staff work out a better position.  We fixed up the quotas all right, a little bit of herring here and a little bit there. Everything will be all right.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy for our fishermen <Col N="1244" /> fluttering back and forth like butterflies between here and Brussels, knowing not what the Minister is up to.  And the Minister's left hand does not know what his right hand is doing. The public servants, as is their wont, wisely keep their mouths shut and let the politicians get on with it.</P>
    <P>These things have to be said, harshly and crudely, because, if one examines the documentation which has come out in recent weeks, it is the kind of documentation which nobody would put the smallest permissible bet on. It contains no definite assurances.  It makes no mention of what we clearly need, namely, a planned development of our fishing industry over the next five to ten-year period.  That is definitely something that should be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had his portfolio now for close on eight months.  People talk about a general election in another four years.  The next general election will be over within four years. I doubt very much if this Fianna Fáil Cabinet have discussed this matter of our fishing industry at all.  There is urgent need to finalise the attitude of the Cabinet.  There is urgent need for going to the Commission with rational and reasonable proposals.  A few moments ago we had the unfortunate Fianna Fáil backbencher from Donegal standing up here and reading out a speech prepared obviously for the Minister in which he said the Irish Government's position has not been abandoned.  It is almost reminiscent of the Treaty Debates in this House.  We were fighting the British from the day we signed the Treaty and we continued to fight them even after the six north-eastern counties were gone. Likewise, for the most part the Commissioners and colleagues of the Minister on the Ministerial Council have probably written him off and we will probably have to settle for what is going to be second best.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that at present there are no agreed Community measures.  There should be.  The failure to bring about agreement over the past seven months has been detrimental to the industry. It is unfortunate that Irish fishermen in the <Col N="1245" /> present atrocious weather have to resort to marching on Leinster House, for whatever good that will do them. They cannot kick out the Minister for at least another three years, much as they might wish to do so.  In fact, they are doing the most democratic thing they can do, coming to Leinster House and making their views known. The Minister should clarify the Government's negotiating position.  I do not think the Minister will lose one whit of public respect if he tells the House that a certain thing is on, something else is not on or that we are likely to get something else.  The fishermen would at least thank him for knowing where they stand and it is time they knew where they stood.</P>
    <P>If the Minister did that we could get off the kind of arguments we have been having here which are somewhat reminiscent of the situation we had on ground rents.  Ground rents were to be abolished over-night without compensation or any concern about the Constitution but we know what happened. Now we are back to the 50-mile zone.  The 50-mile zone is there but it is not there.  It is like Santa Claus, he will bring it next Christmas but by next Christmas we all hope that the unfortunate child will have reached the age when he no longer believes in Santa Claus. That is the way the 50-mile argument stands at present.  Quite a few of my constituents are fishermen who operate from Dún Laoghaire and I told them during the last election campaign that I did not believe the National Coalition would get an exclusive 50-mile zone.  I told them that it was my belief that if we had that zone not many of them would go out that far but that was not to say that we should not try to have it. I told them that something more modest and reasonable was on because I do not believe in codding people.  I suggested to them that if they wished to vote for David Andrews or Professor O'Donoghue they could and they did just that with the result that I nearly lost my seat.  That was how it worked out because of the Fianna Fáil statements in relation to fisheries.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to speak to members of the British Labour Party and they <Col N="1246" /> told me that it was their view that the 50-mile limit was never on and, indeed, some of the more perceptive backbenchers of the Minister's party, for instance, Deputy Killilea and others, thought the way the Minister continued to negotiate in a sea of promises was the greatest lark of all times.  Those promises have been shown up to be no more than fishing plans with a mesh containing a hole about one mile wide through which every European fishing trawler can</P>
    <P>The final outcome will be a lot less than what the politicians and the fishermen propagated in terms of our steam without having to worry. policy.  Even within the limitations of a much reduced settlement, and Fianna Fáil are notorious in terms of principle, almost as bad about fishing as they are about Northern Ireland&mdash;one minute they want withdrawal, another minute they want federalism and another minute they want power sharing &mdash;there is an opportunity within that context for the fishermen of Dún Laoghaire and the rest of the country to expand and develop.  We all know from replies to Dáil questions of the number of fishermen in arreas with BIM loans and that is an indication of the uncertainty that is entering into the industry now.</P>
    <P>There is no need for fishermen to fear for their livelihoods and to fear for the planned development of the industry.  The Department and BIM can then settle down and instead of flying Brussels' kites, and the Minister wasting taxpayers' money hopping back and forth to meetings, can plan the development of the industry within whatever limitations we finish up with.  There is no shortage of capital now, apparently, because the Government are borrowing to the limit of 13 per cent of GNP.  There is no reason why a fraction of that money cannot be put into the development of this industry.  I urge that negotiations be brought to a close as quickly as possible.  There is no point in passing motions of no confidence in the Minister because he has a solid majority of 20 Deputies behind him, but there is a point in passing this resolution because it would be the finality of the horror we had before the last election.  We <Col N="1247" /> did not just have Private Members' time devoted to this issue, we even had Private Members' Bills introduced. Those Bills were eloquently packaged and proposed by Minister Haughey and the other maritime Deputies.  Not many of them are likely to speak in this debate because they would run a mile from what was their policy in this regard.  In the interests of political honesty here and the sanity and future prospects of the fishing industry and so that we might give hope and proper responsible concern to the fishermen who will march on this House on Thursday we should clear the decks and clarify our policy.  The Minister has a golden opportunity of doing that now and not by saying that there are no problems because grave problems exist.  I am convinced from the negotiations that have gone on, the most tortuous negotiations in the history of the Irish State in respect of the numbers employed and the economic strength of the industry, that we can bring a final settlement about that will last until 1988.</P>
    <P>The Minister owes it to the House to do this and not treat us to some political horseplay.  I have no doubt that the House will go home at least having cleansed itself of some of the utter rubbish which we have perpetrated on Irish fishermen in the past few years&mdash;failure to face up to the realities of the situation, the prospects we have and conning people into expecting something, from a flow of ludicrous rhetoric, 90 per cent of which came from the Fianna Fáil Party, a situation which the Minister is now trying desperately to wriggle out of.  Although he is probably the greatest operator of all in that regard he is not adroit enough to wriggle out of that tragic situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult, as I am sure many other people do, to sort out the total confusion which now appears to have developed in the sad saga of the negotiations of our fisheries case.  I have already said in other places&mdash;it is worth saying it again in the House&mdash;that I believe the Minister's counterparts in Europe, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and the <Col N="1248" /> general public have watched mesmerised since he was appointed to office, the Minister adopting different positions, moving sideways, horizontally, vertically and any other way he could as if he had some master plan at the back of it all.  I believe that much of the reason for the woolly draft agreement, which is self-contradictory, now being produced in Brussels, is everybody has become convinced that this man has some grand objective, some final solution at the back of it all or he could not have been adopting the sort of contradictory attitude and the different promises for different occasions, different meetings and different bodies, that he has been adopting.</P>
      <P>They do not realise that this is the Minister in the tradition of his previous portfolios who is quite happy to play with the ball as day follows day. He is not even concerned with week following week or month following month. As day follows day he will react in a manner that allows him to get off the hook in the easiest way and allows the thing to be put off for another 24 hours.  It is as a result of this type of approach with no final objective in mind beyond staying in the job, keeping things quiet and letting it all roll along that we have now arrived at a situation where the Irish Fishermen's Organisation have admitted to being in total confusion with regard to what the Minister has in mind.  His colleagues in Brussels have produced a draft agreement which appears to provide for a fishing plan and on the other hand appears to say that nothing can be done which discriminates against the member states.  The document appears to be self-contradictory. The only thing that is evident from it is that there will be no opportunity for a realistic coastal band of any sort if that agreement is adopted and adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister explained to the people, in the course of a radio interview, that as far as he is concerned Ireland's case for a 50-mile limit is still on the table.  I am not sure what table it is on or where the table is.  If the Minister is going to agree to the sort of grand agreement&mdash;he threw in <Col N="1249" /> afterwards, when he was pressed a little bit by the interviewer about it, that it was only a temporary thing but was better than having no agreement at all&mdash;and keep Ireland's 50-mile case on the table he might as well put it in the waste-paper basket.  The time when he managed to be convinced by his colleagues in Europe that he should go along with his self-contraditory document, was the time, if not a lot earlier, that Ireland's case went off the table and was confined to the scrapheap.  It is becoming very apparent to the public that that is the position and that our case for an exclusive coastal zone now is forgotten.</P>
    <P>The contradictory sort of approach adopted by the Minister is in sharp contrast to the clear and categorical utterances given by his colleagues when in Opposition.  I recall the promises made by the present Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Health and Social Welfare with regard to what their party would do when Fianna Fáil returned to power.  The Minister who ended up with responsibility for fisheries did not have to get involved in making any of those promises because he was not then in this House.  He did not make as categorical a promise in the other House.  This allows him a little more leeway for wriggling off the hook. This is one of the few things he appears to be adept at.</P>
    <P>The categorical promise made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs when in Opposition was that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power they would immediately seek to renegotiate the entire terms of the Treaty of Accession for Ireland as a member of the Community because the Treaty of Accession, which their party had negotiated in the first place, had provided such a bad deal for Ireland as far as fisheries were concerned.  He held up the iron hand in the velvet glove and said that they would renegotiate this treaty in such a way that if the Community did not agree to a better deal for Irish fisheries they would have to consider getting out altogether.</P>
    <P>I have not heard that from the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his colleague since they became Ministers. We have listened to a drastic watering <Col N="1250" /> down from the very successful approach adopted by the previous Government in seeking to introduce conservation measures and fighting to bring about a situation where there would be a realistic coastal zone introduced for Ireland, a situation where, with a lot of difficulty and a lot of negotiating skill, the then Irish team insisted on separating Ireland's case from the case of any other country except Greenland.  They said they wanted the Irish case treated separately because it deserved separate consideration.  They admitted the weakness which existed in the Treaty of Accession negotiated by the people now in Government but pointed out the validity in equity and justice of Ireland's case.  Because of the size of our fishing industry at the time, its scope for development, its potential, the fact that it contributes a greater percentage of our GNP than does the fishing industry of any other country except Greenland, is sufficient justification in itself.  We had reached a situation in which the Community had acknowledged that Ireland had a special case.  They had conceded that Ireland should be allowed to expand its catches dramatically over a threeyear period, with agreement to carry out a further investment in and development of the industry, in which there would be a special Community contribution towards the cost of our naval fisheries protection patrols, in which there was acknowledgment by the Community of our special case.</P>
    <P>On leaving office the previous Government made the situation clear to the new occupants, the new negotiators, the difficulty and danger for us if we were to align ourselves with the case being made with any other country. What did the Minister do?  Having managed to enrage Irish fishermen because of a botched-up attempt to hand over the entire control of herring fishing in the Irish Sea to the Isle of Man Government&mdash;so that he would not have the bother of having to look after it any more&mdash;he then turned around and went out of his way to tie up our case with that of Britain, a situation in which we had been 18 months earlier and from which we spent a year extricating ourselves.  In one weekend <Col N="1251" /> trip to London there were photographs of the British and Irish Ministers together with English housewives, banners broadcast throughout the media, the Ministers shaking hands with each other congratulating themselves that their cases were at one.  There were interviews with the Ministers as to whether this was to be indicative of further co-operation in other fields between the two Governments, with long promises of future development and co-operation.  As we had pointed out, within a month the Minister was scrambling in a dreadfully inept way here in the House to point out that the Irish case was materially different from that of Britain and that if any statement of his had given any impression to the contrary it was wrong, that Ireland and Britain's cases in so far as exclusive zones were concerned were not at one and would be negotiated separately.</P>
    <P>As justification for the document being discussed the Minister now points to the fact that there is, as he claims, a substantially increased catch allocation being made available to us.  The question must be asked: is even the previous commitment of the Community being honoured in the allocation the Minister says he has so successfully fought for and negotiated now? On the basis of the 75,000 tonnes caught in 1975, in respect of which there was to be negotiated over a three-year period a doubling of the catch, either two-thirds of that figure, or three-quarters for the coming year would be a fair way of assessing what would be our allocation for that year. We should have allocated to us this year somewhere between 125,000 and 130,000 tonnes.  What do we find? The Minister has returned from Brussels, triumphant as usual, to announce that he has negotiated to secure an allocation of 96,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned about any other member state.  If the Minister had not been concerned about <Col N="1252" /> other member states we would not be in the negotiating mess we are in today.  If the Minister had not got us tied up with the British case over the last few months he would not have found himself eventually in the same boat as the Germans, French and Dutch.  That is the situation into which the Minister has managed to get our fishing industry today.  I am not concerned about the allocation of any other country.  I am concerned at the fact that we were to double our catch quota, from 75,000 tonnes to 150,000 tonnes over three years.  On that basis, taking the less favourable percentage of two-thirds rather than three-quarters, we should have a 125,000 tonnes quota allocated to us this year. We have got 96,000 tonnes, which is a reduction of approximately 20,000 tonnes on that negotiated by the previous Government.  Yet the Minister maintains that, on the basis of that allocation being made available to us, we should be prepared to agree to the adoption of this temporary measure. Of course, he pointed out in his radio interview that this would be a temporary measure only.  We all know that temporary agreements have a great habit of remaining with us.  In the schoolyard of practically every national school in the country there are a lot of temporary arrangements called prefabs.  In my involvement in educational matters I have often said that pre-fabs, like the poor, will always be with us.  I am afraid that any temporary arrangement or agreement brought about in the fisheries field would turn out to be of a nature so permanent as to long outlive the present Minister or indeed any of his successors. The approach adopted by the Minister in most recent negotiations&mdash; and I believe he has now got us into a situation in which he has sold out our negotiating position, sold out any real prospects we had of securing a realistic agreement&mdash;augurs badly for the future when one contemplates what may happen at a time when the Treaty of Accession for Spain or any other country with a developed fishing industry may be brought about.  If the Minister adopts the sort of attitude he has demonstrated over the last few months I cannot see, in the negotiating <Col N="1253" /> of the treaty for any other applicant country, that the Minister would be in a sufficiently strong negotiating position, or indeed sufficiently respected by his European colleagues, to protect our interests in that regard. We are all aware that Spain has been regarded for a long time as a country with a traditional fishing right in Irish <Col N="1254" /> waters.  That right was re-established on foot of the London Convention in 1964.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a)  The number of married women with income from employment assessable to income tax under PAYE is estimated at approximately 70,000.  The number of married women with other assessable income is estimated at approximately 30,000.</P>
      <P>(b)  Not available.</P>
      <P>(c)  In the current year 1977-78 the married personal allowance added to the working wife's allowance is equal to twice the single allowance.  If there-fore married couples, where both spouses are earning, were given two separate single allowances instead of the allowances mentioned there would be no extra cost.  Under the budget proposals the position in 1978-79 will be that the personal allowance of a married couple, both earning, will exceed twice the single allowance by £230.</P>
      <P>What may be in mind is that a wife with earnings or other income of her own should be given the benefit of having the lower rates of tax applied to her income as if she were a single person.  The cost of this to the Exchequer would be about £20 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  The cost quoted under (c) would be in respect of a concession confined to those married women who have earnings or other income in their own <Col N="1130" /> right.  If however instead of the grant of a working wife's allowance confined to cases where a wife is earning, the tax system were framed so that the total income of all married couples were to be treated as received jointly and assessed equally on both spouses as single persons the net cost would be some £60 million in the tax year 1977-78.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the considerable <Col N="1137" /> losses being experienced by sheep farmers in western Ireland as a result of sheep being dipped too late in the year, he will consider an earlier date for the commencement of dipping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's contention about losses due to late sheep dipping.  The purpose of statutory sheep dipping as prescribed under the Sheep Dipping Order, 1965, is to control and ultimately eradicate sheep scab.  It has been established that the mite which causes scab does not generally become active until the late autumn or winter months and experience here and in other countries has shown that the only way to control the disease is to have all sheep dipped at that time.  The order accordingly provides that dipping must be carried out between 15 September and 31 January or during such period within those dates as may be prescribed by the local authority to be the dipping period for sheep within its functional area.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the dipping requirement can be met without risk to sheep flocks and it is not intended, therefore, to fix an earlier date for the commencement of dipping.</P>
