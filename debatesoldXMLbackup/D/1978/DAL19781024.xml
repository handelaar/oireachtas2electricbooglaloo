      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will quantify his statement, that job-targets in 1978 would be a few thousand short, made to a student meeting in UCD on 18 October 1978; and if he is correctly reported as attributing the failure to achieve Government job targets to high redundancy in industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the official measurement of employment is based on a mid-April estimate so that a firm estimate of the employment increase by end 1978 cannot be made until the mid-April 1979 figures are available.  However, taking the trend in industrial employment combined with the impact of the Government's special job creation programme, the 1978 target could be exceeded if the present rate of redundancy diminishes. If, however, redundancies continue at their present level for the remainder of the year, there could be a shortfall in the range 2,000-3,000 from the 1978 target of 20,000.  This possible outturn suggests that gross employment increases in 1978 will be in the region of 35,000.</P>
      <P>It is correct that, in the address referred to, I identified the continuing high incidence of redundancy as a major factor contributing to the expected shortfall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate which set of redundancy figures he was referring to in his remarks to the student body in UCD? To my knowledge there are not any official figures for redundancies for this period.  The likelihood would appear to be, with the continued outlook for growth in industry, that redundancies are falling this year as compared with last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="909" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot refer to any statistics because, as I have indicated, these figures will not emerge until the end of April and there would be no point in talking about figures as of last April. However, the qualified redundancy figures are expected to be of the order of about 10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be a fair description of the Taoiseach's statement to the student body, admittedly in political circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a full house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wonder that the Taoiseach had a full house with the fairy tales he was telling them.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it is a fair description of his remarks there that they were an example of buck passing? Would it not have been fairer if in deference to his young hearers he had identified that arm of Government policy which has been responsible for not meeting the targets set out in the manifesto, an admission made recently by his colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no such admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know first of all whether the source of the information the Taoiseach has given the House is the Central Statistics Office, which alone is responsible for authoritative and unbiased figures of this kind, and, secondly, whether he could indicate the reasons for redundancies being so much higher than the Government had expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons.  First of all, I wish to point out that the CSO is one of the sources to which I would apply for information&mdash;there are other sources as well. There are the Government services, for example, the Department of Economic <Col N="910" /> Planning and Development.  There are many reasons to which one could attribute redundancies.  For example, there is the high incidence of strikes and the uncertain wage demands&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach is not blaming industrial relations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The high incidence of strikes is one of the reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Deputy B. Desmond rose</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for the Taoiseach to answer questions?  The Deputies can ask questions afterwards.  I have been saying that because there is a high incidence of strikes, and I do not think anybody can deny that there is, and because of certain apprehensions felt in some industries, some industries have not expanded as they would otherwise have done, and indeed there are some industries which have either closed or withdrawn from the scene, and these are included in a combination of many factors which contribute to the number of redundancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not answered my question whether the figures have come from the CSO or not. I suggest he was evading the matter when he said in his reply that he had asked the CSO for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to say that the CSO cannot give me firm figures until the April statistics have been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>They are political figures then, because the redundancy figures are available in the Department of Labour on a monthly basis.  Would it not have been better for all concerned if we could have been given the official figure on redundancies supplied publicly rather than the figures available for last December?  At the meeting the Taoiseach appeared to be attributing to the figures that were not publicly available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Col N="911" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to quantify these figures and I could not quantify the figures on which the redundancies are based, viz. on qualified redundancy figures alone.  The Deputy is aware that there are some redundancies of people who are not qualified for redundancy payments.  I cannot go further than I have done in the answer. answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the projected figure he has given of 10,000 qualified redundancies would indicate there will be something like 12,000 notified redundancies and that this figure will be twice that indicated by his fellow Minister when he projected not more than 5,000 redundancies in 1978?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the high level of strikes.  Is he telling the House that the figure for man days lost through strikes this year is much greater than last year?  That is what the Minister for Labour told me in a written reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach still striking to the statement in the manifesto that there would be a 20,000 reduction in unemployment, plus 5,000 in 1977?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree, seeing that the Government's policy with regard to job creation will fail, that it is in the national interest for him to review the approach he set out in June 1977 and utilise the full resources of the nation by bringing the public sector into the job creation area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his recent statement at UCD, in which he referred to excessive wage increases, indicates a changed attitude on the Government's part to the usefulness of a national wage agreement as a national collective bargaining instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The usefulness or otherwise of national wage agreements depends on the extent to which they contribute to economic growth, price stability and full employment: and that must be assessed in the circumstances of each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same venue, perhaps later in his speech when he had dealt with the failure to reach unemployment targets, the Taoiseach referred to excessive wage increases and I should like the Taoiseach to indicate to the House if this implies a criticism of the usefulness of the present national agreements in bringing about the kind of results he mentioned in his reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, as the Leader of the Government responsible for introducing the concept of national pay agreements, I am very much committed to their continuance. There have been some instances where the spirit, if not the letter, of the national pay agreement has been breached in recent times.  I hope that the national pay agreement will hold and that such agreements <Col N="913" /> will continue as a feature of our industrial relations in the future.  I want to assure the Deputy that that is my hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that an accident and trauma unit will be provided at James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  The question of the provision of a maternity unit at the hospital has to be considered in conjunction with the overall need for maternity beds in Dublin.  It is difficult at this stage to estimate this need with accuracy in view of the fluctuation in birth trends in Dublin in recent years and the absence of up-to-date demographic data. The birth figures are being closely monitored but until a definite trend <Col N="917" /> emerges it will not be possible to decide on future maternity bed requirements and where these should be provided.</P>
    <P>I propose that my Department will shortly initiate discussions with the board of the James Connolly Memorial Hospital regarding the future development of the hospital including the number of beds and the services and specialties to be provided at the hospital. The position regarding the provision of a maternity unit and an accident unit will also be further considered during these discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the area in which this hospital is being developed is one which will shortly be as large as the city of Cork?  In view of that will he not accept, arising from his statement last week that the provision of maternity services is one of the first line services, that for this to be a full general hospital there is a great need for a maternity unit to be based there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a situation for which there is a simple answer.  It all depends on the services provided in other hospitals, and the extent to which they are used and, therefore, the need which will or will not arise in Blanchardstown.</P>

They have had to transfer patients to the annex on the Whitworth Road within hours of delivery because of the demand for beds and overcrowding.  Would the Minister not agree, therefore, that there is a real need for a new maternity unit to be attached to one of the Dublin hospitals to cater for the increased need?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultants in health board hospitals received the standard increases under the employer-trade union national agreements for the period in question which were 2 per cent from 1 November 1977 and 8 per cent from 1 March 1978.  They also received an increase ranging from 15 to 17 per cent with effect from 1 April 1977 following the implementation of an arbitration award made under the local authority and health service arbitration scheme. This claim for an increase in salary was made in 1974.  Consultants in voluntary hospitals received comparable increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Increases in pay for health service staff above the standard pay increases provided for in employer-trade union national agreements are negotiated under the conciliation and arbitration procedures of the Labour Court and the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board.  As such increases are decided on after arbitration and under the terms of the relevant provisions of the employer-trade union national agreements the question of a norm for pay increases in the health services does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy the exact figure.  There was an increase of 2 per cent in November 1977 and one of 8 per cent from 1 March 1978.  These figures are in accordance with the national wage agreement.  Then there was an arbitration award based on a claim submitted in 1974 of between 15 and 17 per cent which came into operation on 1 April 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether this, for the various reasons given, is likely to be accepted as a general settlement or are there special circumstances in relation to consultants which would not apply to the nurses or other workers in health board employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too clear about the point the Deputy is trying to make.  There are two different elements involved in my answer.  One is the normal national pay agreement increases, 2 per cent and 8 per cent.  In addition to that a claim was lodged in 1974 which was finally settled at arbitration and came into being on 1 April 1977, that is the 15 to 17 per cent.  Side by side with that the nurses had a separate claim which went to arbitration and was agreed, which gave phased increases of <Col N="921" /> between 15 and 17 per cent.  That arbitration award has just been made and is now effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the grounds for the statement quoted by the Deputy.  The proposals, which I have announced recently, extend free hospital maintenance to the entire population.  I consider however that some equitable <Col N="930" /> balance must be maintained between services which are available without charge to everybody and those for which payment must be made at the point of use by some sections of the community.  In adopting this approach, I believe that I am not at variance with advanced thinking in other countries on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that the report to which I have referred points out, at page 76, that the medical profession have begun already to press for universal compulsory insurance and that they are likely to intensify their insistence not only because this trend is observable already on a worldwide scale but for other reasons also which concern emigration?  The reference was to the Irish medical profession.  Therefore, what the Minister is proposing is a regression from what is observable in most advanced western European countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to answer that question under a number of headings.  First, the number of beds, as the Deputy probably knows, is being increased very substantially all the time. We have a major building programme of beds for acute general hospital services under way.  Secondly, in so far as there may in any particular area be a shortage of beds, it will be a matter for the medical staff of the hospital to decide their priorities.  The extension of cover for hospital services will not affect that priority decision-making of the hospital in any way.  Finally, it will be part of the new order of things to encourage more people who can afford to do so to go to private accommodation and thereby relieve the public ward situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The categories of persons who have eligibility for the general medical services scheme are adult persons unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants, together with the dependants of such persons.  For purposes of deciding whether any individual is in one of these categories, the chief executive officers of the health boards have adopted simple financial guidelines which are applied uniformly throughout the country.  I am not aware of the need for any further clarification or simplification of the criteria or procedures which are used.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may have in mind the classes of persons who can claim limited eligibility for health services.  I have recently announced that it is my intention to change the conditions which govern limited eligibility with effect from April 1979.

      <P>The question of providing health services free of charge to all sections of the community has been examined by my Department.  I do not think that the considerable cost involved in this extension of entitlement to services would be justified by the need for such a development.</P>
      <P>It has been decided to extend to the entire population, with effect from April 1979 the major services which are now available to persons with limited eligibility.  The services being made available to persons in the upper income group include: (a) the full range of hospital in-patient services at public ward level, free of charge except for the charges to be made by hospital consultants; (b) subsidies towards the cost of private or semi-private accommodation; (c) specialist diagnostic and treatment services on an out-patient basis in public hospitals, subject to the patients being responsible for payments to the consultants concerned; (d) refund of part of the cost of prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that one of the best arguments in favour of the extension of the health service to the entire population is, as the Minister said in his reply to Question No. 21, that where there is a means test, it eventually comes to the stage where it is impossible to exercise it in a just way, because there are unavoidable anomalies in the number and kind of people who become eligible?  The eight categories is a typical example of the impossibility of implementing the scheme.</P>

    <Title>European Monetary System: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Conclusions of the Presidency presented by the Taoiseach to the Dáil on 18 July 1978 following the meeting of the European Council in Bremen, and, in particular, the conclusions on closer monetary co-operation.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall not appear to be entering the lecture theatre. Our concern on this side is fundamentally that the terms of entry for Ireland to the European Monetary System will be such that we can sustain membership without being forced to devalue, possibly over a period of time more than once, with all the implications of this in terms not alone of the relationship with our partners but also in terms of the problems that would be created by the re-importation of inflation here.  Indeed, we have had bitter experience of the effects of such a devaluation and of its impact on inflation between the spring of 1975 and the autumn of 1976 when the £ was devalued by 25 per cent, a devaluation very much beyond anything appropriate in the case of the Irish £, something which made it very difficult to get inflation down as could and should have been the case on the basis of its happening domestically.</P>
      <P>I pointed out the last day&mdash;I do not intend to go over the ground again&mdash;that the McDougall Report indicates the order of magnitude for a Community budget in a monetary union, seven to ten times the present level, and from this and other figures in the report&mdash;a report for which the Minister for Economic Planning and Development was jointly responsible&mdash;we can deduce the scale of transfers necessary for the country in a monetary union and we can deduce they would be of the order of £600 million a year or almost five times what the Government has sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out at this stage, and submit to the House, that a commitment to maintain the parity of our currency with others and to pursue the necessary policies towards this end is a monetary union and that is what we are being <Col N="984" /> asked to embark upon, but only to the extent that the Government propose to enter without accepting this commitment and to enter with the idea of devaluing from time to time, only in those circumstances and to that extent, could this be described as other than a monetary union or could its effects on us be different from the effects of a monetary union. As I presume it is not the intention of the Government to pursue such a policy this, therefore, faces us with a situation which is precisely the equivalent of a monetary union in the strictest sense of the word and, in these circumstances, we must be concerned that the terms we secure are such as will enable us to maintain our commitment and will not involve us subsequently in devaluing our currency with all that that would entail.</P>
    <P>I submit the Minister's own calculations as a member of the study group preparing the report indicated the scale of the Community budget, the scale of transfers necessary in the case of this monetary system which, from the point of view of our joining with the intention of remaining in it and, if not, allowing our currency to devalue from time to time, is the precise equivalent of a monetary union.  I would ask the Minister in particular to explain to the House how, in his view, the proposed system will not have the effect that it is widely described in the financial Press and elsewhere as being likely to have&mdash;that is, the effect of forcing us to appreciate our currency, which is the system, and to raise our costs while not, it is being suggested in the media, putting the Germans, for example, under equivalent pressure to meet us half way.</P>
    <P>It would appear from what has been said in an informed Press comment, and we have not had this contradicted, and I would like to have it clearly contradicted here if it is incorrect, that the system now proposed is one which would have the effect of strengthening Germany's already overwhelming economic power <i>vis-á-vis</i> countries like our own because it is one in which Germany would not be under equivalent pressure to meet us half way since the pressure would come on the weaker currencies to move up and not on the stronger currencies to move down.  If we are misinformed on this and <Col N="985" /> if, in fact, the system will operate differently from what has been stated in the Press, then the House is entitled to know that.  We do need some assurance that the effect of membership will not be inimical to our interests and will not put us in a position of weakening our economy over a period of time.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, and arising from these two issues I have raised about the scale of transfers appropriate to <i>de facto</i> monetary union of this kind and from the criticisms of the system I have just mentioned in relation to its lack of impact on Germany and its strong impact on weaker economies, I would like to ask the Minister to give the House an assurance in his reply that the terms on which we shall enter, negotiated by his Government, will not impose deflationary pressures that will knock us off course in reducing the numbers out of work which, I would remind the House, is the Government's commitment, a commitment out of which they are now trying to wriggle by inventing figures about new jobs, figures which have no statistical basis whatever.  The answer to this question is crucial.  The country will not accept that through ineffective negotiation by the Government we will be walked into a situation in which the reduction of unemployment, promised by the Government, could not be achieved and the Government would then weakly give as its alibi the economic and monetary system into which it would have propelled us on terms that endanger our economic future.  The House is entitled even at this early stage, and before the main debate, to a straight assurance that our membership of the economic and monetary system on the terms this Fianna Fáil Government will negotiate will not impede the achievement of the Government's task in reducing unemployment. This debate will have been worthwhile, I think, if it secures a straight answer to that question.  It will have been largely pointless if it does not.</P>
    <P>In this connection I want to correct one figure in my speech last week based on incomplete data in regard to September unemployment.  The decline in the live register over the 18 months to <Col N="986" /> December next if the underlying trends from June 1977 to September 1978 are maintained will be, I reckon, 16,500 and not 14,500.  I had not the full data when I gave the figures.  What this suggests is, if this trend continues for the next three months and becomes neither better nor worse, that there will be a shortfall of just over one-third on the Government's target which, I remind the House, is not a target expressed in increased jobs &mdash;something which cannot be checked until months and, in some circumstances, years after the event&mdash;but is a commitment to reduce the numbers out of work.  The commitment was to reduce these numbers by 5,000 in the second half of last year and by a further 20,000 this year, that is, by 25,000 in their first 18 months in office.  The test of the Government's policy will be how far they have gone towards that.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, even if the live register does not at its absolute level precisely reflect the numbers out of work, we know from the EEC labour survey that the difference in the numbers out of work measured more accurately by that survey than the live register is not in absolute terms very great and the live register is an accurate indicator of the trend.  It is possible from it at least to deduce, to within a few thousand or so, by how much the numbers out of work have fallen and it is that measure which has to be used for the purpose of testing the Government's performance.  That measure is the only reliable one because there are no figures from the Central Statistics Office for jobs for the whole economy during this year, nor are there figures for any sector of the economy for actual employment since last March, except for the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>The only reliable figures which we have and which are not, as in the case of manufacturing, six months out of date and, in the case of total employment, 18 months out of date, are live register figures.  All others are political estimates, whether it is the Minister for Economic Planning and Development saying that there was an increase of 11,000 in employment to last April which, as the Taoiseach pointed out, will not be known until next April when, perhaps, <Col N="987" /> the Minister hopes this last figure will be forgotten; or whether it is the Taoiseach's figure of 35,000 new jobs to be created in the 12 months to next April, which is the sheerest invention, as anyone who has anything to do with these figures knows.  I would suggest the Taoiseach should avoid involving himself with phoney figures by purporting to explain unexpectedly high levels of redundancies by saying that some industries have not expanded because of uncertainties due to industrial relations. That kind of explanation is not to the Taoiseach's credit.  If it is true that some industries have not expanded, that has not created redundancies; redundancies arise where industries contract.  Even the Government's mishandling of industrial relations cannot turn the failure on the Government's part to create new jobs into redundancies.</P>
    <P>As we speak today, it is disturbing that the UK seems even less likely to join than it did last week.  The possibility of the severance of the link with sterling in circumstances and at a time not of our choosing and not necessarily beneficial to us now seems greater than ever.  As I said in Rome eight days ago, this kind of situation can lead to a temporary destabilisation of the currency situation, which the EMS is meant to stabilise. This could come about through flows of hot money in the expectation of currency changes.  The danger, to which I referred last week, has now evidently become a reality and whatever short-term benefits the Government may secure through this windfall of investment in Irish Government stocks could disappear very quickly in ten weeks' time and the shock effect of a profit-taking withdrawal of large funds could be very great in these circumstances.  In view of the events of the past couple of days, the House is entitled to know from the Government what steps they propose to take to deal with this temporarily destabilising situation.</P>
    <P>It looks now as if the next debate may take place under the shadow of an imminent separation of these two currencies which have been linked for so long.  The implications of this may need to be more fully discussed at that time than they <Col N="988" /> have been in this debate, including the implications for the relationship of this State with Northern Ireland in both the short and medium terms.  In the meantime, I would urge the Government to do two things.  First, I urge the Government to amend their negotiating hand and to use the MacDougall Report to the full to secure transfers on a scale that will enable us to remain in the economic and monetary system without damage to our economic growth and without damage to the plan to reduce unemployment.  I assume that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will not, in his reply, attempt to devalue this document as a source of powerful argument in favour of our position.  He should not be over-modest about it because he happened to participate in its compilation. Secondly, I would urge the Government to present to the Dáil before the next debate, which, as far as one can judge, must take place between the 20 November and 5 December, to present an adequate White Paper&mdash;whatever colour the cover may be&mdash;with all the necessary factual material in quantitative terms, which we have not had at all so far except in the MacDougall Report, including the text of the submissions made by the Government to Brussels, so that the House may make an informed judgment on the situation as it is at that time and so that the House may at that stage give the Government the kind of support they may very much need in going to the summit to negotiate the final package.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my gratitude to Deputy Michael O'Leary, who is due next to speak, because of his agreement to allow me to speak before him.  I explained to him that I had the obligation to be present tomorrow morning in the European Parliament for the purpose of voting on the annual budget of the European Community. Unless there are not less than 100 members of the Parliament present tomorrow and voting for an increase in the Community budget in such areas as the Regional and Social Fund, there would be a danger that these funds, in which Ireland has a particular interest, would not be increased, as all sides of <Col N="989" /> this House and every genuine person in the European Parliament desires that they should be.  I am most grateful to Deputy O'Leary for his readiness to cede the floor to me at this stage.  I will not be using the full time allotted to me because I must catch a plane.</P>

      <P>The European Parliament has a very good record of being generous towards the less privileged regions like Ireland.  Were it not for the consistent support which the European Parliament has given to the Regional and Social Funds, bad and all as they are today they would be a great deal worse.  Therefore I feel more than a casual obligation to go to the European Parliament to add the weight of my vote for an increase in those funds in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of this debate which could easily distort our long-term interest in relation to Europe is the emphasis which has been put upon the necessity for a new and very significant transfer of resources in order to enable this country to enter the EMS without ill effects.  Of course, it is very proper to argue for an addition, but we should not for one moment suggest or allow anybody else to suggest or infer that there is not a need, if there were never an EMS, for a much more radical and generous transfer of resources from the better-off regions of the Community to ourselves than has applied in the past.  While not wanting to minimise the significance of what is now proposed in a new scheme of monetary stability in Europe, I want to make this observation: In Ireland over the past few <Col N="990" /> weeks there has been much ado about little.  We are not entering a copper-fastened system which will last forever and any person who believes that is believing in an unreality.</P>

      <P>No.  With all due respect, he has made it clear that there are a multitude of variables and that economic life, by reason of its linkage to natural forces and to the varying ambitions of man, can never be permanent. So it is that we find ourselves faced with a situation which is really trying to compensate for the instability which has grown into the international monetary system during the past five or six years.  I contrast today the indecent haste with which the present Fianna Fáil administration is endeavouring to excite the people about the new proposals in Europe and their decades of neglect in international monetary matters when they were previously in power.  The International Monetary Fund was established as a consequence of the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944.  That was an agreement to provide not merely regional but global monetary stability.  It was not until 1957, 13 years after the International Monetary Fund was established, that Ireland took steps to obtain membership, and that was not under the Fianna Fáil administration but under an inter-party administration when my predecessor, Mr. Gerard Sweetman, took the initiative to seek membership of the International Monetary Fund and of the World Bank for Ireland.  But this was in keeping with Fianna Fáil's inactivity in international monetary matters.  The Bank for International Settlements was established in 1929.  The then Government, a Fine Gael Government, applied for membership.  Membership was withheld at that stage because Ireland did not have a Central Bank; it had a Currency Commission and it was urged that Ireland should re-apply when she had a true central bank system.  Again, although Fianna Fáil was to enjoy power for some 16 of the following years, they did nothing about joining the Bank for International Settlements, and <Col N="991" /> it was not until my predecessor, again a man of my own party like Gerard Sweetman, Patrick McGilligan was Minister for Finance, that Ireland applied for and obtained membership in the Bank for International Settlements in October of 1950.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not for the first time entering a system of international monetary discipline that has the objective of establishing monetary stability. There were two previous efforts where Fianna Fáil showed lethargy and indifference or indeed a preference, and I believe it was a preference for holding on to the apron strings of sterling.  In 1972 we joined the European &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; where the disciplines are not as rigid as those now proposed and within a very short time Ireland, together with Britain, Italy and France, found herself unable to observe the disciplines of the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; although it is important to remember that was at a time of much greater monetary stability than that which now exists in the world.  One would have thought that the Fianna Fáil Party with all its professions about political and economic independence would have taken some practical steps over its many years of office to make it possible for this country to sever the link with sterling. We found on entering office in 1973 that no administrative steps whatsoever had been taken to enable this country, if circumstances justified it, to sever the link with sterling.  The sane economic policies which we followed would, if they had been continued, have left this country in a much healthier state now than it is and would have enabled us to enter the European Monetary System without all the risks that are now existing and would have made it much easier now to consider the possibility of discontínuíng the pound for pound relationship with sterling.  But no administrative arrangements had been <Col N="992" /> made to facilitate breaking the sterling link although the Government knew well that the pace of banking activities and the extent of international commerce had quickened immensely and it was also apparent that the Bretton Woods system was not going to last for ever.  In the light of all that our predecessors did nothing to make it possible for this country to sever the link with sterling even if, as happened, sterling got into a very distressful state.  We had to take the steps when in office of setting up very complex administrative arrangements to make it possible for this country to break the link with sterling without disturbing the ordinary pattern of trade and financial operations which ought to exist in an open trading situation.  Their former tardiness and neglect in this field contrasts very ironically with the excitement that they are endeavouring to generate in recent weeks as a result of the Bremen Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the operations which will be necessary if Ireland is to break the pound for pound relationship with sterling is to provide the Central Bank of Ireland with power to control exchanges between Britain and Ireland.  I find it odd that when Oireachtas Éireann was previously asked to confer power on the Central Bank in relation to exchange control everybody was very careful indeed to avoid conferring on the Central Bank power to control any exchanges which might take place between the pound sterling and a revalued or a devalued Irish pound.  It is, I suppose, a reflection of changing attitudes that it was regarded as something that dare not be mentioned at that time but apparently it is now quite possible to discuss that possibility without generating panic. Indeed it had been our ambition, had we been returned to office in 1977, to introduce such legislation, and to introduce it at a time when it would not appear that it was likely to be immediately used.  All the popular image of financiers is that they are very conservative and stable people who never make a decision without a lot of careful thought but the reality is that they are very volatile, very fickle and very emotional.  There is always the danger that if a country seeks to introduce exchange <Col N="993" /> control it will set off a panic reaction.  Now that there is euphoria in some financial circles about the value of the Irish pound and money is rushing into the country I think the Government should very seriously consider taking urgent action to confer upon the Central Bank of Ireland the necessary powers to control any exchanges which may arise in future between the Irish pound and pound sterling.</P>
    <P>It would have been preferable if this legislation had been introduced at a quieter period but better late than never and certainly better now than before irreparable harm is done to the Irish economy as I believe may be done if certain developments take place over the next six to 12 months.  Of course the present movement is attributable to speculation and speculation involves at all times both the possibility of gain and the risk of loss, but governments have a very clear obligation to their people to prevent loss to the economy as a result of speculation.</P>
    <P>The Government should act and act very quickly to ensure that money which is now flowing in cannot flow out if certain developments take place which might make it possible for those speculators to make a very quick gain. The reality is that while it may now appear to be very attractive and very beneficial to have this involuntary flow of money into the country it will not be of any benefit to us if it flows out just as quickly with a considerable gain being enjoyed by the people who push the money both ways to make a quick artificial profit.  That, unfortunately, is the real experience in international finance.  I have been at many an international financial gathering where Ministers for Finance and Governors of Central Banks and their solemn advisers after many months of negotiations formed decisions with the hope of creating stability in the international flow of money.  All their efforts were rendered useless within a matter of hours by people with surplus money simply lifting telephones and switching hundreds of <Col N="994" /> millions of currency from one denomination to another.  We must not forget that we now live in a world of very speedy communications.  When the exchanges in Frankfurt, Paris and London are closed they are open in New York.  When they are closed in New York they are open in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere.  There is never a minute of the day when it is not possible for hundreds of millions of dollars, francs, pounds, Deutschmarks, lira and yen to change hands at a profit or loss as the case may be.  No matter what rules may be laid down within the European Community for management of currency transfers&mdash;as best the institutions of the Community can manage it&mdash;so long as we maintain an open market in currency, and this is a natural and essential ally of an open market in trade, international rules or any national controls on their own will not be able to control the very volatile world of international finance.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the <i>raison d'etre</i> for the suggestion of an EMS primarily arises out of a desire on the part of any of our partners for the creation of a zone of monetary stability within the European Community.  The reality is somewhat different.  There are now hundreds of millions of surplus dollars sloshing around the exchanges of the world, dollars that are depreciating in value for a number of reasons, many of which have to do with American domestic politics.  There is a fear on the part of the controllers of Deutschmarks and Swiss francs that there may be a massive switch from the depreciating American dollars to Deutschmarks and Swiss francs with damaging consequences to the German and Swiss economies and causing a further upset within the Community.</P>
    <P>A proposal has come forward now that I believe is basically as simple as this, namely, that our German colleagues in the Community, with sympathetic understanding from the French, want to cool the Deutschmark and the best way to cool the highly priced currencies of the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; is to set up a system in which the cooling water of the currencies will be sterling, the Irish pound and the Italian lira.  I do not disagree <Col N="995" /> with the thinking behind the proposal.  Those who are making the proposal are making it with an intention of reaping considerable benefits for themselves but they have a very clear obligation to make a contribution to those who will have to provide the cooling water for the system.  Therefore, I support entirely the Government's insistence&mdash;I trust it is insistence&mdash;that there should be a very significant contribution from the hard currency countries of the Community towards the less developed regions.  I share with my leader the view that the amount the Government have sought is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance explained the matter on the grounds that we could not ask for more because of political and tactical realities but he did not spell out the realities for us.  They should be spelled out clearly not only to us but also to the German people.  Germany is one of the principal beneficiaries of the European Community.  There has been an undesirable trend on the part of all countries, ourselves included, to consider that the only benefit obtained from the EEC is that which is set out in the pages of the annual budget.  That is not so.  Since the creation of the Community Germany has enjoyed open markets beyond her boundaries that would never have been available to her if the Community had not been created.  That has conferred immeasurable benefits on the German economy.  Therefore, it is necessary that there should be a process of education&mdash;not merely applied as the Government have considered they ought to apply it to the trade unions here&mdash;on the part of the Community to persuade the people of Europe that they have a common interest.  It should be made clear to those who consider that they are making sacrifices for the impoverished regions that when they are asked for a little more they have a lot to gain by such a transfer of resources.  A number of people, including my colleague Deputy Bruton who made an excellent speech, have drawn attention to the political difficulties that exist in a democracy when explaining a matter such as this.  We know all about it.  We <Col N="996" /> paid the price of inadequate communications. Nevertheless this process must continue if democracy is to survive.</P>
    <P>Government is about governing people. It is not a mere recital of phoney economics; we have had quite an amount of phoney economics in this country in the past two years.  I believe one of the reasons the Government are showing such an interest in the EMS and endeavouring to stimulate debate about it is because they know they are running out of clichés.  They know they have lost a moral authority.  They entered into office with an economic policy and programme that said to the people of Ireland: &ldquo;Look, there is no problem&rdquo;&mdash;<i>pas de problème</i>, as Deputy Lenihan might say&mdash;&ldquo;just put us back and money without limit and without effort is yours&rdquo;.  They offered the people bribes which the people took, and they threw money at people which people never sought.  A Government who do that have lost all moral authority to turn around and say to the people whom they tempted deliberately that they were wicked to have succumbed to the temptation. That is the essence of the boring speeches of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. Week in and week out, they tell the people that they were wicked to have succumbed to the temptation they, Fianna Fáil, put before them quite deliberately. The people believed what Fianna Fáil told them.  Why, for instance, did they instruct the employers to depart from the guideline of a 5 per cent wage increase that the Government had laid down?  That is what they did.</P>
    <P>I use the phrase &ldquo;phoney economics&rdquo;. Some people may think it too severe but I do not think it is.  We can talk also about phoney mathematics when we have the Minister for Economic Planning and Development saying that five equals five, plus three plus two.  When political and economic policy is based on such phoney ideas&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;is it any wonder that it collapses?  Having been found out, is it <Col N="997" /> any wonder that the Government jump at the EMS so that when the corrections come to be applied they can be blamed on the EMS and not on their misleading of the people.  The people of Ireland are no more wicked or virtuous than they have ever been.  A Government that deliberately mislead people have no moral authority to call on people today or tomorrow to make sacrifices.</P>
      <P>We are a debt overwhelmed country. The Government who have ruled us for the past 18 months have shown themselves incapable or unwilling to apply the brake necessary to prevent that debt increasing.  Now they want the EMS to carry the odium of painful adjustment of economic policies.  This is not new.  In world finances there are many cases of developing countries who have engaged in unwise economic and financial policies knowing that the day and hour of reckoning would come, and they let it come and then transferred the odium of correction to the International Monetary Fund.  We now see an Irish Government glad that the Bremen Conference discussed the European monetary system before we had to resort to the IMF, and delighted to pass the odium of the correction process to the EMS.  The reality is that the corrections that will be necessary in Ireland will be attributable not to any new monetary system but to the mistakes made over the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is quite a bit of unjustified euphoria in this country and elsewhere about the value of our currency.  Some of it is persuading investors from abroad to switch money into Irish Government stocks and is related to the GNP forecast this year.  It does not matter which forecast you take; Ireland's GNP this year is quite impressive, taken in isolation or in comparison with the GNP of other European countries.  The GNP is a dangerous figment of economic well-being. Between 2 and 3 per cent of the Irish GNP this year is not adding significantly to the product of this country to enable it to maintain production in the years to come.  Quite a significant figure of the GNP of any country at any time includes consumption, waste and destruction, elements which do not provide the means by which further <Col N="998" /> wealth can be created or with which existing wealth can be remunerated.  Irish growth rate this year contains a dangerous element of passing consumption which cannot be repeated without enormous borrowing.  Therefore, those who are looking upon the GNP of Ireland this year as indicating a healthy economy are making a very foolish mistake indeed.</P>
    <P>The value of a currency is not determined by any individual nation state or by any international formula.  The value of a currency is determined by the market-place, and the market looks closely at inflation rates.  Our inflation rate is now above that of our nearest neighbour and main trading partner, Britain, and both inflation rates are moving ahead of the European league.  We have not yet seen the end result of the inflation injected into the Irish economy as an inevitable consequence of the extravagant policies engaged in by this Government over the last 18 months. We need another year before we can see the full consequences of that inflation.  I believe at the end of it we will find the inflation rate in Ireland up to 3 per cent above that in Britain and well ahead of the inflation rate in other countries.</P>
    <P>Another factor which international financiers bear in mind in evaluating a currency is the rate of Government borrowing. We have a rate of Government borrowing of 13 per cent of GNP, which is more than twice that of anybody else in Europe and between three and four times higher than that of the well-run economies there.  It is a rate which contains its own dangers.  It was made possible this year only because of the careful expenditure and financial policies of ourselves when we were in Government. We handed over some hundreds of millions of pounds to our successors.  Sadly, they have used it to finance foolish policies.</P>
    <P>Another factor to be borne in mind in relation to the evaluation of a currency is the degree, extent and significance of industrial disputes.  As an inevitable consequence of a philosophy of Government which indicated to the people that all the controls were off, we are now suffering a rash of very dangerous industrial <Col N="999" /> disputes.  I believe that we are only at the beginning of the inflationary spiral that these are setting off.  Quite a number of possible claimants are standing back waiting for the pacemakers to set the pace and the rate, and then they will all come clamouring in.  If they do not get what they then consider their rights we will have further industrial troubles.  Therefore, again we have an element which would lead to a devaluation of the Irish £ against the £ sterling and other European currencies and not something which would enhance it.</P>
    <P>We see also a disimprovement in trade with a frightfully dangerous increase in imports.  If the increase was attributable in the main to investment it would be justifiable so long as the investment was of a nature which could produce goods to compensate for a temporary distortion in trade, but this year, unlike what has happened for many years past, the main growth in imports is attributable to consumer goods, which is unacceptable under a regime which boasted that, given the reins of power, they would reduce the importation of consumer goods and correct Ireland's balance of trade to the extent of 3 per cent by persuading people to switch out of imported to native-produced consumer goods.  Combined with this increase in importations of unnecessary consumer goods we also find a very worrying fall-off in the rate of increase in exports.</P>
    <P>Therefore, all the indicators in relation to the value of a currency are operating red, running negative, as far as Ireland is concerned.  There have been a certain amount of euphoric and unjustifiable assumptions that if we were to sever the £ for £ link with sterling the Irish £ would be re-valued against sterling.  It is possible. Artificially it might happen within the European Monetary System, but if it does happen then the re-adjustment which would become necessary in relation to the underlying realities would be appalling.  Therefore, it is time to cool the situation.  There has been much too much about little.  The Government should first acknowledge and then everybody should understand that the <Col N="1000" /> value of a currency cannot be determined artificially and certainly cannot be permanently fixed by any international body.  The Bretton Woods Agreement endeavoured to do that and succeeded quite well for nearly 30 years, but eventually the realities of economic laws came into play.  They have been playing very harshly and unevenly in recent years.  I believe they will do so for some years to come.</P>
    <P>There are a few questions I would like to pose to the Minister.  I do not criticise the Government too severely for not being more specific in the opening speeches in the debate, but there has been further chaos on the European monetary front since this debate opened last week.  I hope that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will tell us more about what is happening.  As the Government are encouraging the people to think about this matter and to debate it they ought to ensure that it is a sensible and balanced debate.  That is possible only if they give the full facts.  We are talking of the possibility of a European Monetary System operated by preferably nine member states of the EEC, possibly by only seven or maybe eight, depending on whether we go in. The possibility is opened of Switzerland, Austria and Sweden joining.  What thought is being given to the relations of Spain, Greece and Portugal with an EMS?</P>
    <P>We know that the Swiss currency is so attractive that even when the Swiss authorities impose a negative interest rate on investments in Switzerland people still invest their money in Switzerland because the capital gain is so enormous. We will already have in the European basket of currencies, if the EMS is set up, a very strong Deutschmark and other healthy European currencies.  The question arises &ldquo;Could we really also suffer the addition of a currency that is as strong as the Swiss franc or indeed the currencies of Austria and Sweden?&rdquo; Both Austria and Sweden survived the recession with less difficulties than many other currencies but they are now experiencing some temporary difficulties. However, comparatively speaking, their currencies are strong.</P>
    <P>One never wishes to close the door <Col N="1001" /> against the possibility of additional currencies joining.  But, if the system is to be set up and Ireland is to be a participant, we need to guard against the possibility of any new currency coming in which could multiply the difficulties with which this country might be faced.  Some years ago there was a proposal from Switzerland that she should join the existing &ldquo;Snake&rdquo;.  At that time France was within the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; and it is of significance to us that she took steps to avoid Switzerland joining the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; then because she very wisely saw that to bring in Switzerland would widen the gap between the currencies within the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; and, therefore, multiply rather than ease the difficulties.  Switzerland might well seek to join the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; for the same reasons that Germany is seeking to create this EMS, in order to cool the situation as far as Switzerland is concerned.</P>
    <P>Currencies can deviate from any norm that is fixed, whether it is by a national Government or by international arrangement, for two main reasons.  The first reason is because of deviations in the individual policies of countries operating a currency system.  Either by domestic stimulation or domestic deflation a currency can have its value changed; and if you are in a system which relates that currency to the norm obviously the value of the currency can deviate from that norm as a result of domestic policies.  Secondly, it can alter by reason of speculation against it due to factors over which a particular country has no control.  Quite an amount of the devaluation which occurred in sterling in recent years was attributable to speculation against sterling which had no relationship to economic or financial realities.  As I mentioned earlier, the financial world is very speculative, an emotional world which scares very easily and which can become euphoric just as easily.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in any EMS operated by members of a Community who accept that they have a common obligation to one another there should be a different set of disciplines applied, depending on the cause of deviation of a currency from the norm.  If deviation is attributable to domestic causes then the <Col N="1002" /> obligation to correct ought to lie on those who of their own volition took the steps which caused the deviation.  If the cause be attributable to speculation over which a member country has no control the Community should have an obligation to protect the country from the speculation against its currency which arose outside its control.</P>
    <P>I have not yet observed that there is a readiness to operate any different regimes.  Perhaps this is assumed in the process of consultations which may take place before or after an adjustment but, very clearly, it is very necessary that there should be different treatment in different circumstances.  I say this in the light of my own humble experience.  I found that some of the stronger economies of Europe were, in the course of the international recession, inclined to adopt a high and mighty attitude of economic purity, all too ready to chastise those who had got into economic and financial difficulties, even though those difficulties were beyond the control of those in trouble.  We want to ensure, therefore, that in any new regime there will be an acceptance that there will not be punishment if the original difficulties arose due to causes outside the control of a member state.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the new system which worries me.  Obviously any system of international monetary arrangements involves discipline, which means that a member has to observe a code of rules.  For many years past there has been a desire on the part of some of the member countries of the EEC to enforce their particular policies and their economic remedies on other countries. When we were in office there was a proposal that no significant new industrial enterprise could be established in any member country without, first of all, being cleared through the central office in Brussels.  The effect of that would have been that the European Community would probably have maintained inefficiency in the wealthy countries of the Community, the traditional industrial areas, and discouraged the establishment of new, modern industries in the peripheral areas like Ireland.  I am glad to say that we succeeded in defeating that proposal, although it took <Col N="1003" /> us the best part of a year to do it.</P>
    <P>I fear that in the new arrangements there may be an effort made to resurrect such a proposal, to give to the centre a power of control over what might happen throughout the whole Community and that that control might well operate, as it has traditionally operated in huge economic regions, to the benefit of the centre and to the disadvantage of the peripheral regions.  If there is to be discipline in a European monetary system&mdash;the Government have been loud in their warnings about the disciplines which are to apply to Ireland if she becomes a member of the system&mdash;there must be equally stringent disciplines applicable to the hard currency countries, the countries which have massive resources and a much greater capacity to withstand difficulties. If a code of conduct is to apply to countries whose currencies are devaluing then a similar rigid and enforceable code must also apply to countries whose currencies are revalued.  If Germany, for instance, is experiencing a substantial increase in the value of the Deutschemark because of its own internal economic performance in such a way as to lead to a deviation of the Deutschemark from the set norm, then the Community will want to be in a position to oblige Germany to reflate to reduce the value of its currency and also afford its weaker fellow members of the Community an opportunity to trade with it and to export to it.  If the new system does not have a balance of obligations on all countries, irrespective of their wealth or their poverty, then the system will collapse. The Minister for Finance in his speech raised the possibility that the system might not endure, although it was contained in a casual phrase in which he said that, &ldquo;if the system lasts&rdquo; then certain things might happen.  He is right to raise that &ldquo;if&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ireland can gain more than she can lose by joining the European Monetary System if the Community respects the obligation to transfer resources to enable us to meet the challenges which the new system will impose.  It would be preferable that we should all start in the new system at the <Col N="1004" /> same time.  The trouble is that developing countries like Ireland, Italy and parts of Britain start off considerably handicapped. If the system is going to operate successfully and with equity, the handicapped countries ought to be brought up to the same point on the starting line and be helped along in the race.  That requires a dramatic increase in the contribution which Ireland receives from the EEC.  So far, there is no indication that the other countries are prepared to make that transfer.  There is nothing in the 1979 EEC budget for EMS&mdash;I shall be speaking along these lines tomorrow morning in Luxembourg, God willing&mdash;and we cannot blame them for that because the European budget for 1979 was prepared before the Bremen Conference.  Before it is ultimately passed there will have to be radical increases in the draft budget.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ireland should become involved in the new system, the conditions being right.  We cannot look at a comparison between things as they now are and as they may be in a European Monetary System.  The present situation will not exist once the European Monetary System is established, whether there are seven, eight or nine countries in it.  The worst of all worlds would be for us and Britain to be outside the system and the other seven member states within it.  On the other hand, we cannot go into it without accepting certain obligations.  However, if we stay outside it the obligations and burdens will be just as great, possibly much greater.</P>
    <P>For 13 years we stood back from membership of the International Monetary Fund because we were afraid of it.  We went in eventually and got nothing but benefit out of it.  We stood back for eight years after we were capable of being members of the International Bank of Settlements.  We eventually went in and got benefit out of it.  If we go into this system we can get benefit out of it but we would be right to insist before going in that we are brought as near as possible to the starting line with the rest.  It is also essential that we be given sufficient resources from the Community to maintain our momentum to keep up with the others.  A mere <Col N="1005" /> grant of money for a short period or a loan will not be sufficient. We will have to be given fuel to keep us going and that will require a great deal more than the Government have sought.  I cannot accept that, for political or tactical reasons, they should ask for only a little unless, having got it, they propose to ask for more.  That is not a dignified thing to do.  I believe we ought to have asked for a great deal more in order to draw attention to the enormity of our problem.  What is £650 million in relation to our national budget for one year or our borrowing requirement for one year?  The regional fund is now only 1 per cent to 1½ per cent of our investment in regional development.  All we got in the past was a pittance.  The sum of £650 million would not even correct the balance of what ought to have been paid to us in the past.  The Government have started off badly by looking for so little.  We can correct these things. The main consideration must be that as we fulfil our role in Europe, the role must benefit Ireland and not harm it.  I believe we can do this by associating ourselves with the new system.  We must insist that the terms are right.  If they are right at the beginning, we go in and keep them right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent the House is in the dark in relation to the facts at the centre of this debate.  The Opposition could not be said to be in possession of the factual data upon which the Government are basing their case.  One suspects that the Government are in the dark in respect of the outcome of the negotiations.  Not everyone in the Government accepts this to be the case. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has said that the Government anticipated the possibility of the question being raised, that is, the question of the new monetary system, as early as the Copenhagen Summit in April.  He maintains that the Government had already commenced work on the pros and cons from an Irish vantage point.  He stated that he is satisfied that the implications for Ireland had been adequately put forward and attention drawn to the arrangements that would be necessary to give a satisfactory basis for our participation.  That is the <Col N="1006" /> Minister for Economic Planning and Development and he, of course, is an especial instance.  Nobody would suggest that he is the average in this Cabinet.  It is not surprising to find him being foremost in succumbing to the temptation of suggesting the proposed European Monetary System as the scapegoat for actions that would fall necessary by the Government because of their past expenditure.  It is interesting that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, on the announcement of the recent credit restrictions by the Central Bank, said they were necessary because of impending arrangements for the monetary system.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development&mdash;and I am sorry he is not here to receive the compliment&mdash;could be fairly described as the &ldquo;Platypus of public life&rdquo;.  His role in public affairs could be likened to that Australian aquatic egg-laying mammal.  The platypus is a creature known only on the Australian Continent which has a beak, lays eggs, is aquatic and has a tail like an ordinary mammal.  It is neither one thing nor the other.  The position of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development could be said to be neither politician nor economist.  It is interesting that he is the one who, from now on, hangs all the unpleasant consequences of Government actions on the inevitability of the European Monetary System; that he is the one to maintain that the Government are not in the dark in relation to the proposals and have been diligently preparing for the possibility of its occurrence since the Copenhagen summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to be brief in my contribution because we on this side of the House are not in full possession of the negotiating material.  It is fair to say that there is a good deal of uncertainty in relation to the composition of the final monetary package.  The communiqué issued after the Bremen meeting, which is the immediate material being discussed in this debate, provided the minimum of information.  Nothing that has happened since the communiqué upsets the conclusion that there is a famine of reliable information on what is proposed, the implications of what is proposed, and what is being prepared.  One could not make <Col N="1007" /> the same remark about the speculation on what may happen, but there is a paucity of reliable information.</P>
    <P>Apparently everyone, even the British Premier and the Chancellor of the Exchequer after their recent meeting in Bonn, and the anxiety they had about the impact any new system might have on the British economy&mdash;that anxiety which drew them to Bonn&mdash;while they are as one in saying that a European monetary system of greater or lesser rigidity will come into existence by next January they are themselves uncertain about the composition of it, whether the final package will veer in the direction of a parity grid system or a basket of currencies. The only relevant question we may ask at this time here should relate to the kind of criteria that should govern the Irish estimate of the proposals before us.  What criteria should govern the Irish approach on the proposals as we know them so far?  What should be the general guideline directing the actions of our negotiations?</P>
    <P>The first assurance that must be demanded must be that the finally agreed system shall not contain a deflationary bias which would undercut our commitment to faster economic growth.  That is the most important assurance our negotiators must seek in the weeks ahead.  The second assurance which must be reflected in whatever structure is finally agreed is that the weaker currencies must not be forced to fall out of the system as they fell out of the previous &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; arrangement. While a system may be devised in time for 1 January or in time for the European Council meeting in December, we must be convinced that arrangement will prove durable and that the weaker economies will not be forced out of the new monetary arrangement with adverse consequences for their economies in coming out at that time.  We must avoid a recurrence of the events which led to the withdrawal of the weaker economies in the previous &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; experiment in 1973.</P>
    <P>The third assurance required by our negotiators is that adequate action will be agreed on by way of resource transfers to assist the weaker economies <Col N="1008" /> such as our own which have long-term structural problems to be overcome.  The long-term problems most commonly are associated with the high level of unemployment observable in the economy over many years.  Those structural problems exist in our economy quite apart from additional problems associated with the recent recession.</P>
    <P>In speaking of this necessary third assurance that our negotiators must seek the point must be made that the figure of £650 million, which is apparently the sum sought by the Government, appears to be inadequate if one takes into account the underdeveloped state of our economy by contrast with the levels of development reached by our more advanced continental neighbours.  In any bargaining situation&mdash;and possibly very accurately it can be said of a bargaining situation in the EEC&mdash;what one demands initially and what one eventually settles for may not be closely related.  It is a new experience for members of the present Government, but members of the previous administration who had EEC business relating to their departmental work will be aware that bargaining in the EEC context is usually downward from the initial figure.  On the great question at the heart of these proposals which must be resolved one way or the other and which has great implications for good or ill for our economy, namely, the amount of resource transfers demanded, the point must be made in this debate that the Government, by setting down an initial outline figure have effectively tied the hands of our negotiators and limited the possibility of seeking a higher figure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the practical realities which determined the Government's approach.  One does not know whether he is referring to practical realities that have an EEC background or home realities.  Perhaps he could not have been referring to home realities because obviously our development needs far exceed the figure sought of £650 million over a five-year period.  The Minister has said that his request has met with, as he puts it, a heartening response, but there is no evidence from the Minister's lips that the heartening response has been translated into any <Col N="1009" /> even informal agreement at this stage even on the figure we maintain is inadequate of £650 million over five years.</P>
    <P>It cannot be over-emphasised that if a deflationary bias for our economy, which could be implicit in these proposals, is to be avoided we need a capital resource to enable us to adjust in the initial period and thereafter to ensure that the capital side of our programme will not be diminished.  We are not looking for loans or reasonable credit but a once-and-for-all transfer of resources to enable us to withstand what may be a very strong deflationary bias in these proposals.</P>
    <P>I am not entering into the controversy about whether the Government declared before now for or against any event, whether members permitted the impression to go abroad that somehow the Government here were committed in principle, as they put it, to an EMS. There was no refutation of the many press stories to the effect that the Irish Government were extraordinarily enthusiastic about the introduction of the EMS.</P>
    <P>I recall reading in one foreign financial paper a column to the effect that perhaps the Irish had weakened their negotiating hand for acquiring an adequate transfer of resources by declaring in advance their enthusiasm for the entire principle of the new monetary system.  I am not entering the controversy as to whether that is true or false, but the impression went abroad that we were, and it was not officially denied.  Before these events result in the setting up of a new monetary system, perhaps the sham stance of independence adopted by the Government will be shown up and their bluff will be called.  Looking at the events of last week, it can be said that the prospect of British involvement at this stage does not appear as imminent as it appeared before that.</P>
    <P>I do not take any satisfaction in referring to the Government's bluff of sham independence.  I do not take any satisfaction in describing their actions in that fashion.  We might have had greater independence of action if, facing the prospect of a new monetary system, the <Col N="1010" /> Government had not taken the easy way out of dealing with our economic difficulties, if they had not taken the manifesto way of dealing with our endemic economic difficulties.  They took the manifesto way, the easy way, the primrose way, with the result that our negotiators are left with a weaker negotiating hand than they would have had if more sensible policies had been pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an approach of the Government which I find hard to understand, that is, their apparent preference for what is known as the parity grid system and their apparent lack of enthusiasm for the basket of currencies approach advocated by Britain for some time.  The question of resource transfers is central and most important because we will depend on the size of the resource transfers to countervail the deflationary bias which may reside at the heart of these proposals.  We will depend on a large transfer of resources to counteract that deflationary element in the final package.</P>
    <P>Related to the size of the resource transfers is the character of the monetary package which may be finally agreed upon.  All along, the British have sought something under the general heading of a basket of currencies and an attempt is now being made to get a wedding or a compromise between the parity grid system and the basket of currencies approach.  While this might appear to be a very technical question and one which, I suppose, can be understood in the end by only very few people, it is important that those taking part in this discussion should understand that quite fundamental differences of opinion exist about the machinery of the new system and that these polarities of opinion are represented by those who advocate a parity grid system and those who advocate a basket of currencies approach.</P>
    <P>The differences are fundamental and which mixture of either approach is adopted finally has grave implications for the weaker currencies and the weaker economies.  It has grave implications for us.  It is difficult to understand how our Government by their silence, if not by their support, appear to have left the entire argument for a basket of currencies <Col N="1011" /> approach to the British so far. The joint visit of the British Prime Minister and Chancellor to the German Chancellor in Bonn last week has not in any way removed these differences of opinion.</P>
    <P>What is at issue is both these views. Both sides recognise that, in this imperfect world, there will be enough fluctuations in the underlying economic realities to make real economic stability difficult to obtain.  Both accept it is desirable.  The differences reside in the possibility of what will happen when the new system, once adopted, comes under pressure.  Whichever approach is adopted, at the point when the new arrangement comes under pressure, different results will ensue.</P>
    <P>Under the parity grid aspect of the deal, any two currencies which got out of line with one another would have to be bought and sold by their respective Governments or Central Banks to bring them back into line.  Under the basket clause, one of those currencies could be identified as being more out of line than the other, when measured against all the rest, and the country concerned would be more responsible for taking corrective action.  Let us take an example of how this would work out between the strong and the weak.  Let us take the instance of the Deutschmark going up against the Italian lira and the lira going down against the Deutschmark and, measured in the new basket of currencies system, the Deutschmark has gone up more than the lira has gone down.  In that case, it would be up to the Germans to change their economic policy to get back into line.  Of course, the Germans would like to resist that type of obligation.</P>
    <P>The point has been made in public by the German negotiators that they fear their currency would be the odd man out more often than not and, therefore, they would be forced to intervene repeatedly. Fundamentally, the German view of monetary co-operation is that the Deutschmark sets the standard of virtue and other people should align to the Deutschmark.  If the others try and fail to maintain the standard of virtue set by the Deutschmark, and the Germans prove reluctant to meet them half way, <Col N="1012" /> nothing but trouble can ensue for the weaker partners.</P>
    <P>The difference in implications between the two systems is such that one would have expected our Government before now to have given strong and consistent support to the British attempt to get an arrangement based on the basket of currencies approach which shares the obligation between the country in surplus and the country in deficit.</P>
    <P>This is an instance of the Irish and British interests coinciding.  That cannot be said of the two countries' attitudes on the common agricultural policy: there our views conflict.  But the parity grid system would appear to lay the onus for corrective action&mdash;if the final system adopted veers in favour of the parity grid&mdash;on the weaker party, such as ourselves.  It would seem to tend towards the serving of deflationary medicine to the weaker party, and therefore disadvantageous results for the future of our economy would flow from the adoption of the parity grid system as distinct from the currency basket approach. After Bremen it seemed that only the British were opting for the currency basket.  Although there is no evidence for it.  I hope our negotiators will come round strongly to the British position.  The British interests seem to coincide with ours on this matter if not on others.</P>
    <P>However, the impression created by our silence, by our agreement in principle in respect of which particular bias was involved in the final package, is that we favoured the parity grid.  That impression needs to be corrected.  There is a difference in the application of these two systems.  The currency basket would appear to spread the burden of corrective action where necessary between the surplus countries and the weaker economies.  The German idea of the parity grid, the more rigid system, would appear to leave the necessary deflationary action solely to the country in balance of payments problems.  It does not take much imagination to conclude that the likelihood is that a country such as this would find itself in balance of payments difficulties, and the impression has gone abroad, irrespective of our <Col N="1013" /> final approach, that we have been indifferent as to which element should be uppermost in what will finally be agreed. The difference in application is vital for our economy.</P>
    <P>The adequacy in resource transfer is central from our national viewpoint because without it, it has been argued and I agree with the argument, the result of the new monetary package for us could be deflationary.  It could accentuate our present economic difficulties. The imposition on us now of a deflationary policy would not be appropriate in the light of current Irish economic circumstances, and from our domestic viewpoint the crucial question is whether the Irish Government can win sufficient European aid to offset the deflationary tide implicit in the proposal, without the aid of adequate resource transfer.  The demand that is being made by our negotiators for £650 million in five years is not an adequate price for our participation in the system.</P>
    <P>There are many unanswered questions about the final shape of this package.  It is not my intention to prolong the discussion at this point, but I should like to point out that initially we sought too little by way of resource transfer.  Our entry to the system is being sought on the cheap, and even in relation to the question of resource transfer the House is in the dark as to how the £650 million has been calculated.  What were the criteria that went into the calculation of this sum in a five-year period?</P>
    <P>The system proposed, if implemented, can fairly be described as the first step towards eventual monetary union, the objective set down some time ago for the Community.  Progress along the path to full monetary union without countervailing Community action by way of adequate resource transfer, without a properly functioning regional policy with adequate funds, will result for us in the movement of capital from here to more profitable sectors of investment in Europe.  It is predictable that Irish capital would move to business sectors in Germany and France.  We know the old economic law that labour follows capital.  Therefore it is vital for this <Col N="1014" /> country to obtain adequate resource transfer because its absence will denude this country of capital and investment.</P>
    <P>So far in our experience of Community membership we have had great difficulty in forcing the Community to agree to a transfer resource to weaker areas.  We have had very little success. We know the regional policy has been inadequate.  Indeed the only sector of our national life which has done well here has been agriculture.  The industrial population have little to thank the Community for.  They will have less to thank the Community for in the future unless our negotiators at this important point succeed in getting adequate resource transfer.  The country which has done better than anyone else in terms of EEC membership is Germany.  The enlarged market has been ideal for German industries. It has ensured that the major benefits have flowed to Germany.</P>
    <P>Therefore, confining the debate to the advantages coming from the Community to us is to misunderstand the nature of the Community.  At any rate, it is of vital national interest that the Government will mend their negotiating hand in respect of the resource transfer demand.  The experience in Community bargaining has been that you bargain downwards from the initial bargaining figure, and this Government have not helped us by starting with a figure of £650 million.  To be told by the Minister for Finance that that figure is based on practical realities makes one wonder which planet he now inhabits.  The figure cannot relate to economic underdevelopment here, to the development needs that exist in our economy.  We have been forced in the area of regional policy, because of a lack of commitment in the Community, to agree to an adequate resource transfer and to use the social fund <i>in lieu</i> of an adequate regional policy.  That is an interesting comment and it is interesting to note that such has been the failure of the regional policy that we have been forced in our negotiations to rely on the social fund to do the job of the regional fund.  It should be remembered that after agriculture the fund that has given us most money has been the social fund but, because of the way that fund is constituted, we have not <Col N="1015" /> been able to use the moneys from that fund in a more direct way to assist unemployment here.</P>
    <P>The rules governing the fund limit its payment and, of course, it is a relatively small fund which must be spread over the Community.  I was concerned with that fund for four years and during that time we quadrupled the moneys we received from it.  In our initial demands our negotiators always started from a high position and we were always assisted by the level of need in our community. We did not have to rely on any mendacious claims because our underdevelopment was there for everybody to see.  We sought the establishment of a new Community instrument to be called an employment fund.  However, the limitations there are involved in the Treaty but for all its limitations we did well out of the social fund over the last four years because it is subject to so many limitations and the overall constraints imposed by the level of finances available in the fund.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting if the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, or any other Government speaker, could tell us what relationship is implied in the request for the £650 million sought over a five-year period with the other amounts sought by us from such areas as the social fund, the regional fund and the agricultural fund.  It should be remembered that even though we succeeded in quadrupling social fund resources from Brussels between 1973 and 1977 to be used in the retraining of unemployed that money was matched with a corresponding payment from our own resources.  That is a condition of Community investment here.</P>
    <P>In this necessary preliminary debate too much attention has been focused on British non-involvement in the proposed monetary system.  I agree that that possibility is more likely this week than it was last week but even assuming British involvement in the new system the real difficulty would emerge for us subsequently if Britain found the going hard and decided to leave the EMS.  Then there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth, a major dislocation in our economy and pretence as to our so-called <Col N="1016" /> independent position would be exposed.</P>
    <P>One must deplore the way these major decisions in respect of the EMS were arrived at by Germany and France alone.  In respect of this decision we can say that it was the two-tier Community of Germany and France that made the real decision and told their partners afterwards.  I do not know if the Government made any protest about this way of reaching a decision in the Community.  If they did the House was not told.  I have already warned against the Government explaining their necessary actions on the domestic front in the light of a necessity that arises from the EMS option.  The Government in their management of the economy are engaged in a classic stop-go phase.  I was disappointed that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development used the recent control on credit by the Central Bank as an excuse for the Government ending their expansionist phase since the budget and hung that need on the requirement of EMS membership.  I hope other members of the Government do not succumb to the use of the EMS as a scapegoat in the months ahead because the seeds of the Government's own stop-go policies lie in their previous expenditure actions.</P>
    <P>The Government have had 18 months of experience of bargaining with their partners in the Community and an indication of their woeful over-estimation of the effect of certain Community instruments is contained in the recent remarks of the Taoiseach on youth unemployment. The Taoiseach told us of a pending agreement which might be reached at a meeting of Social and Labour Affairs Ministers, a group I am familiar with.  I know a good deal of the background of social policy in the area of youth unemployment and that does not encourage me to think that anything sufficiently adequate is in prospect to deal with the problem.  I agree with the Taoiseach that this is a major problem and that a recent survey showed that though people under 25 constitute 30 per cent of the workforce they number 40 per cent of the unemployed.  He told us that he stressed at the Bremen meeting the need to speed up special measures to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> The Taoiseach also explained at the start of this debate that the European Council under the German presidency has asked the Council of Labour and Social Affairs for special measures to combat youth unemployment within the framework of the European Social Fund.  At the June meeting of that council there was a deadlock on measures, but even if that deadlock were resolved the amount of money at the disposal of the Council of Labour and Social Affairs and of Labour Ministers to make a significant breakthrough by way of work schemes to combat youth unemployment is totally inadequate.  It illustrates the mentality of overestimating the effects of certain Community aspirations. If that is the cast of mind of the Taoiseach, who presumably has good advisers in these matters one can only worry if that similar cast of mind, overestimating, exists among the other negotiators negotiating these matters. One wonders how much the habit of overestimating goes along with the estimate of £650 million as an adequate capital resource.  The Minister for Finance in talking about the capital resource made the point that that figure anticipated that there would be a significant expansion of separate grant and loan mechanisms and instanced the regional fund, the FEOGA guidelines and the social fund.  From my experience in dealing with the Community I would say that this confidence is probably misplaced.</P>
    <P>In the event of a break with sterling it cannot be anticipated with any confidence that the Irish £ would be revalued.  In the event of a break with sterling, either a change in the parity relationship in the event of Britain joining the EMS, or in the larger and more serious eventuality of a break with sterling in the event of Britain not joining the EMS or breaking away from the new arrangement soon afterwards, our home manufacturers would face severe difficulty in maintaining their export markets and an adverse effect on employment and output would follow. Our dependence on Britain has been lessening since our accession to the EEC, but our exports to Britain still accounted <Col N="1018" /> for £1.2 billion last year, because almost half of our exports go to Britain.  The Minister is not facing up to the real difficulties involved in a break with sterling by saying that the bulk of our agricultural exports are to Britain and since they are determined by the CAP, <i>ergo</i> the problem goes away.  That would be to oversimplify the repercussions on our economy.</P>
    <P>There are a great many unknown factors which make it difficult to confront the real issues at this point in the negotiations.  I hope that as soon as possible the Government will publish their assessment of the situation, the options they see before us and that they will attach to any such publication the kind of negotiation documents put forward by our officials on which apparently the £650 million is based.  These documents will only show our economic situation. In publishing them the Government will not be showing their hand.  Such information is necessary to facilitate enlightened national debate on this issue and such debate is in the interests of the people.  It may be said that this debate need only concern a few central bankers, senior civil servants and the Government of the day, but the implications of EMS will affect wage and salary earners and every facet of life will be influenced by what may finally be decided in this EMS arrangement.</P>
    <P>No more than veiled references have been made in this debate to the kind of disciplines that may be required.  The implications of joining the EMS should be analysed, as joining the EMS could possibly mean less flexibility in the management of home economic affairs, greater fiscal restraint on the Government and greater scrutiny of the cost component in national production.  It could also mean the necessity of an incomes policy, whether voluntary or statutory. Although these implications are at the heart of these proposals they are not yet publicly acknowledged.  It is high time that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development published these implications and explored the consequences of them with the employers and trade unions.  In relation to the resources transfer, besides information on the extent of it we will require to understand its <Col N="1019" /> implications for our economy, information on how it will be applied, over what period and its relationship with the other funds.  It is worrying that there is an assumption on the part of the Government that there will be a significant expansion of separate existing grant and loan mechanisms, as mentioned by the Minister for Finance.  This a very much misplaced confidence on the part of the Government in view of our past experiences of Community membership. The Minister expects the Community's Economic Policy Committee to have on 20 November the final report of the body examining, under the heading of concurrent studies, how the work on the possible resource transfer is proceeding at Community level at present.  He explained that oral reports have been submitted so far, but we all know that oral reports have very little status at Council of Minister's meetings.  It is disquieting to learn that only reports of this kind have been submitted so far.  We have been told that in the Irish papers submitted so far there is the conclusion that substantial additional transfers would be necessary for infrastructural and industrial development.  In this regard the figure mentioned throughout the debate was £650 million.  We have said that is inadequate, but it would be interesting to hear the basis on which the figure has been calculated.  Apart from the categorising of the Minister for Finance of the effect of our request so far as one that indicated a heartening response, there is very little evidence from Community sources that the heartening response will be translated into reality.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that in some German quarters in the Community there is the impression that the transfer resources which will come our way finally will be solely in the guise of credit transfer.  Therefore, it must be emphasised that we are not looking for loans or for credit facilities in this matter but that literally what we are seeking is an adequate transfer of resources.  We must ensure in our negotiations that the design of the final system will not entail an excessively deflationary bias in the conduct of present economic policy.  It is essential that the system be such that <Col N="1020" /> there will not be the necessity of imposing measures to slow our rate of economic growth.  We must ensure that the expansion of our economy will continue to be based on our own efforts and we must not agree on anything that would make investment here less attractive. Consequently, any system to be agreed must not be one that would interfere with the high level of expenditure and it must not rest too heavily on our balance of payments deficit.  It is necessary in developing a country that the balance of payments deficit be utilised. That situation must be understood by our partners if we are to take part in any eventual scheme, because it is as important a condition of our membership as is the size of a transfer of resources.</P>
    <P>Monetary union is the aim of this monetary system agreement.  The EMS is a preliminary but a significant step in the direction of eventual monetary union, but if that monetary union is achieved without clearcut agreement on resource transfer to this economy, the result would be the flight of capital from here.  Nobody should be under the illusion that because there has been an inflow of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money from Britain in recent weeks, such a trend will continue. Speculators are never reluctant to make quick money and that consideration is what is represented in this recent inflow. The tide can turn as rapidly the other way.</P>
    <P>Monetary union will entail a free capital movement between member states.  Capital will go to attractive investment areas and labour will follow. Therefore, we need an adequate resource transfer, a regional fund instrument as a necessary counteracting power to the natural tendency in a monetary union situation towards capital movement.  I trust that our negotiators will seek in their discussions to get early agreement at concurrent studies level.  So far we have had oral reports, but the Government should require formal agreement in principle to such resource transfer.  If they fail to get this agreement they cannot say in the conduct of the negotiations here that they are guided only by the net advantage that would accrue to us in the new system.  We require a durable and effective scheme that will <Col N="1021" /> ensure that employment here will not suffer as a result of our participation in the monetary system.  We must avoid a recurrence of what happened on the last occasion on which there was an experiment in the area of aligning currencies. To this extent we must ensure that there is a fair shouldering of the burden between countries in surplus and the weaker economies; but that fair distribution of obligation will not occur if the Germans, who are the chief exponents of this union, have their way.  We have a common interest in this regard with our British friends.  Corrective action will remain in the hands of countries that are in surplus rather than those who are experiencing balance-of-payments difficulties.</P>
    <P>This debate concerns every citizen because implicit in all of these arrangements is the closest scrutiny of our economy plight.  Today the Taoiseach indicated that the Government continue to support national wage agreements. Although during the past few days he had attacked what he referred to as excessive wage increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am concluding on the basis that whatever may be the outcome of the packet to be decided on, whatever may be the success or otherwise of our real economy, the situation cannot give great encouragement to anybody who examines it.  There is burgeoning discontent in the public service in regard to what those concerned consider to be a very rigid interpretation of the conditions of the national wage agreement.  Such a situation cannot assist the preservation of that industrial peace about which the Taoiseach has expressed concern so frequently in recent times.  What happens in the real economy, therefore, is of great significance to what transpires in these negotiations.  The figures show that in the home economy our inflation rate is moving upwards.  After the recent round of price increases sanctioned by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and <Col N="1022" /> Energy there is no doubt that at about the time the Taoiseach will be coming back to the House in November with whatever final proposals there may be in relation to the EMS, the inflation figure will be close on 9 per cent.  If the Government proceed with the pruning of expenditure and on the course on which they have committed themselves so far, namely, that their borrowing requirements next year will be cut by the expedient of phasing out food subsidies, by taxing children's allowances or by increasing indirect taxation, one may speak without distortion of a return to a two figure inflation rate next year.</P>
      <P>There are many facts which will not leave anyone very complacent about our economic performance next year&mdash;a fall in our exports, failure to reach employment targets, rising inflation, the possibility of further industrial disputes and a great deal of discontent throughout the public sector on what they see as a special national agreement to which they are committed.  These facts cannot assist us but they should be uppermost in the minds of our negotiators in seeking adequate transfers of resources, and the implications of what may be entailed in these negotiations on the incomes front should be teased out without delay in discussions between the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the social partners.  As recent figures show, the terms of trade are moving against us and growth is falling from this year to the next.  What is happening in the real economy obviously will to some extent affect our negotiating stand in these discussions.</P>
      <P>In our experience so far, the EEC have not lived up to our expectations or to the expectations of those who favoured our entry.  We should not exaggerate the effect of certain Community instruments as this Government appear to be doing and we should not succumb to the temptation of making the EMS the scapegoat for certain actions which the Government find necessary at this time because of their management of the economy since the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first debate we have had on this subject.  I hope the Government will very soon produce their assessment of the options before us, the assessment to <Col N="1023" /> include the possibility of British nonadherence, of the more real possibility of British departure from EMS once set up and what final figure our negotiators will settle for when it comes to resource transfer.</P>

      <P>I will not make a long contribution.  In the year 1826 we linked ourselves with sterling.  Since the establishment of the State we had a very voluminous report prior to the establishment of the Currency Commission in 1927.  We then had the Central Bank Act which was preceded by a long debate in the Oireachtas.  The Central Bank is charged with the safeguarding of the integrity of the currency.  We are now being told that we are going to join the European Monetary System in less than three month's time without any wide public debate and without any report from expert institutions.  For instance, the Central Bank should be speaking out in an authorative fashion on the whole question of our monetary link and the consequences of our joining the EMS.  To date this has not happened.</P>
      <P>The social and economic research centre have not had time to produce anything.  The suggested system based on the European unit of account is being duly weighed between the strong and the weak currencies.  Basically it will be dominated by the hard currency&mdash;the Deutschmark.  I share the concern expressed by Deputy M. O'Leary that it is the heavy hand of Germany that will dictate the whole question of monetary, economic and fiscal policies of the weaker currency States.  To that extent we are surrendering to outside forces in respect of the management of our economy.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the Government have come out with such a simple solution, that we are going to join the EMS. In last week's <i>The Sunday Times</i> and <i>The Observer</i> I read that the British Cabinet are split on the pros and the cons of entering.  Mr. Adam Raphael on the front page of <i>The Observer</i> said:</P>
      <P>Already a detailed briefing paper has been circulated to all backbenchers and union leaders making a number of damaging criticisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> At least the British have a working paper on which to come out for or against.  We have no such document and it is to our disadvantage that such a document has not been forthcoming to date.  In <i>The Sunday Times</i> editorial I read one aspect of this affair which is very important. I share the basic principle of monetary union but it is only a concept which is feasible for Ireland if it suits her and it can only do that if we join with a strong currency position, and that is not the position at the moment.  I quote from that editorial:</P>
    <P>If the Prime Minister does win the battle against inflation this winter, then one of the many rewards would be that every month would better fit us to join the European monetary club.</P>
    <P>That is the attitude in England and that is the correct attitude.  Yet, we who have a high inflation rate, an extremely high budgetary deficit which is unsustainable in the long run&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The last sentence says that &ldquo;there is no way in which it&rdquo;&mdash;the choice&mdash;&ldquo;will ever be a comfortable one&rdquo;.  I am not saying that the choice will ever be comfortable but I am saying that there should be options open to the Government.  They have not taken the options.  They have not taken a negotiating position of strength.  They have surrendered to the big powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is entitled to know about the paper dealing with our £650 million claim.  The Irish members of the European economic Policy Committee submitted our claim for £650 million over five years.  The Taoiseach said that gross output per head in Ireland is 60 per cent of the average Community.  We are the least well off country in the Community. <Col N="1025" /> How are we going to correct this imbalance? It will be corrected only by a massive commitment to the underdeveloped part of this country&mdash;a proper regional policy.</P>
    <P>In the Twelfth Report, Developments in the European Communities, Chapter 12, Regional Policy, it states:</P>
    <P>12.1  During the visit of President Jenkins to Dublin in February the Taoiseach, Mr. J. Lynch, TD, stressed that, because of the absence of a regional policy, other Community policies are applied without due regard to the differences between central and peripheral regions.</P>
    <P>That is a terrible admission by the Taoiseach in the context of the present negotiations.  There is no commitment from the EEC in relation to a regional policy so far as this country is concerned. I could not accept the figure of £650 million over five years which is only an average of approximately £120 million a year.  We do not know if this will be by way of loan or of a resource transfer of a permanent non-repayable nature.  That has not been spelled out. Some papers said it will be a loan.  A sum of £650 million over a period of five years is not adequate to redress any imbalance. Our economy is not sufficiently strong to go into the European Monetary System under the terms now proposed.  We will suffer heavily because of our weak currency position.</P>
    <P>There remains a number of unanswered questions which I will put briefly to the Minister: the sterling position and the British intention perhaps not to partake; the consequences for Ireland in relation to our trading position, the undeveloped state of our foreign exchange markets and the lack of sophistication of our monetary mechanisms to control capital and current flows inwards and outwards.  These are all points which have not been answered.  I am satisfied that present arrangements are inadequate and not sufficiently sophisticated to deal with the many complicated problems that can arise in relation to capital transfer and transfer of currencies in general.  What interim measures will be taken pending <Col N="1026" /> the establishment of a permanent monetary system?  Already there are grave uncertainties in the money markets <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish and English pounds.  The hot money that has flowed into the country is of little use; it can be taken out again.  How will these be controlled in the interim period pending the implementation of a scheme?  I have not heard from the Taoiseach or from any Fianna Fáil spokesman how these interim measures will be established.</P>
    <P>There are the pressures on the Irish Government.  It is apparent from the system that if a country's balance of payments goes out of order&mdash;as ours has done not merely occasionally but frequently, leaving us with a chronic balance of payments deficit&mdash;or if its budgetary position is so unfavourable as to lead it into negotiating large-scale foreign loans&mdash;our loan position now is approximately 13 per cent of gross national product, which is the same as it was at the height of the oil crisis in 1975&mdash;it will be forced by the rules of the game to take serious deflationary measures.  That does not suit an economy like ours in its present state of development.  But the decision will not be one of our Government; it will be made for them in Brussels.  The Government will say then &ldquo;We have to do it&rdquo;.  The Government are rushing to hand over control to Brussels because the policies set out in their pre-election manifesto and pursued in government have been detrimental to the sound, long-term development of an industrial base here.</P>
    <P>There will be a re-emergence of double figure inflation within the next year because of consumer spending and a continued serious balance of payments situation.  The attitude adopted by the Government is one of surrendering the reins to Brussels because they cannot control the economy.  Therefore the control of inflation and deflation will be passed over to Brussels.  The Government have not bargained sufficiently to retain independent control because they have not got a strong currency on which to base that control.  That arose because the cost of the last general election was so enormous and damaging to the long term interests of this country.  They are unable to stand up and say &ldquo;We will <Col N="1027" /> control our own affairs&rdquo;.  Instead, we are going in as a weak currency and that is not the way to enter into any monetary agreement.</P>
    <P>What of the position concerning currency exchange values.  What will be the variables?  Will it be 2¼ per cent, 2½ per cent, or at what stage must action be taken to correct imbalances?  These are questions which have not been answered fully.  They will cause grave inconvenience and be costly to traders, especially those operating between fluctuating currencies.  I do not know that any explanation has been forthcoming from any State agency or spokesman on this matter, with the exception of the Taoiseach stating the case in his speech.</P>
    <P>What about the position of the national wage agreements?  At present inflation in Germany is approximately 2 per cent.  That may rise to 3 per cent in the coming year.  At present our inflation rate is 8 per cent, but it would appear that it will revert to a double figure in the next year.  If it does, and we decide to enter the system, we will be told by Bonn, Brussels or some other financial institution that we cannot have that kind of inflation, that we will have to take deflationary action.  Our economy is out of control through the Government's mishandling and strategy on economic development.  The national wage agreements could cause serious social unrest.</P>
    <P>This currency system will affect not only bankers; it will affect everybody down to the pensioner receiving a pension from abroad.  If our pound inflates then the value of a foreign pension will deflate similarly.  That is not a good thing.  Obviously such people must be conscientiously protected by any Government in power.</P>
    <P>The whole strategy has been one of undue haste, one that has not established a strong position for the Irish currency, has not established a strong negotiating base which would allow us reap benefits. The £650 million has not been justified to this House.  When the White Paper is produced it will be vitally important that all information be made available to this House, including submissions made by members of the Irish team on the Community's Economic Policy Committee <Col N="1028" /> and the arguments backing such submissions. Only then can we have a proper and full discussion on this system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to this debate with a series of mixed reactions.  We have had an extraordinary variety of contributions, many of them not particularly relevant to the debate itself.  There were varieties of content.  To do them all justice would call for a much longer reply than I could manage within the time at my disposal.</P>
      <P>With the indulgence of the Chair I propose to deal first with a number of points made outside the debate, but since other speakers were allowed make them I trust I can reply.  I propose then to move on and to deal with some of the more technical or detailed points that arose and, finally, home-in on what I might call questions of political economy which are at the heart of the whole question of an European monetary system.</P>
      <P>We had the whole question of what I called on previous occasions the rewriting of history taking place.  Again we were treated to the arguments that in effect all would have been well if only the Fianna Fáil Government had pursued the wise courses of action on which the Coalition Government had embarked. Indeed, we had one speaker claiming that had they been followed he would have been able to recommend unhesitatingly that we join the European Monetary System but that, given the adverse effect of Fianna Fáil on the economy, he could not be sure any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was this marvellous performance which we might reasonably have enjoyed had we continued on the Coalition's course of action?  First we were treated to references about the rapid growth in exports that was taking place. Then there was pointed out the slowing down in the real volume of export growth in 1977, as against 1976, and again this year as against those two earlier years.  Does anybody seriously want to argue that one could sustain a growth in export volume of 27 per cent which was the order of magnitude in 1976?  Of course not.  The reason firms were able to expand their exports so <Col N="1029" /> rapidly then was that they had vast amounts of idle capacity on their hands because they were suffering from the worst ravages of the recession in 1975.  I hope no one on the other side wants to make a serious argument that we should have tried to embark on a sustained programme of export growth of that order.  Indeed, on other days they adopt the opposite tack of accusing us of setting far too ambitious targets for the performance of the economy: 7 per cent growth rates and so on are outside our grasp even though 7 per cent growth rates only require an export volume of perhaps 10 to 12 per cent a year, the sort of increase which, in fact, is taking place in 1978.  We should, I think, try to get rid of that red herring and that particular attempt at the rewriting of history and expose it for what it is, a sham argument.</P>
    <P>There is one other factor which contributed to this rapid recovery in exports in 1976-1977.  That was the fact that the value of the £ fell very rapidly during those years.  Are we seriously now going to have an argument that what we should do is embark on another round of deflation and severe inflation.  Funnily enough, this may not be as idle a question as I originally thought.  I assumed we would have no difficulty in getting up and saying this was clearly absurd and irrelevant and that, at the very least, the Coalition had learned from the horrors and the excesses of that period and, whatever else they might wish to do, they would not wish to repeat their folly. But, no.  Like the Bourbons of old, they forget nothing because they have learned nothing.  They know nothing.</P>
    <P>One of the threads running through this discussion of the proposed European Monetary System is that we should not be worried about trying to reduce the inflation rate too rapidly.  Indeed, the esteemed Leader of the Opposition twice referred outside the House to what he described as the almost neurotic obsession of the Germans with reducing inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why there was this rapid export growth was the appallingly rapid fall in the value of the £.  I, for one, want to make it quite clear that I do not wish to subscribe to that sort of policy for developing the economy.  In fact, we want to pursue the opposite line and get rid of inflation as quickly as we possibly can and, if the proposed system offers an opportunity for our doing so, then it deserves to be examined on its merits on that basis.</P>
      <P>Now the combined effect of spare capacity and the rapid devaluation of the £ produced a once-for-all boost to exports in 1976 of a totally temporary nature.  There could not have been any prospect of any sustained growth in the economy by simply carrying on that type of policy.  The clearest example of the sort of performance to which a continuation of Coalition policy would have condemned us is in the area of employment, a subject which has been dragged in here a few times.  I am quite happy to take it up because, although there may be some references to some shortfall in the overall growth of employment this year, we are talking nonetheless of a year in which there has been a very rapid growth in employment, the most rapid growth in any year in the past 30 years, the most substantial achievement in this field we have seen during any post-war normal period of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What could we reasonably have expected had Coalition policies been pursued? A nil growth in employment.  We can, I think, reasonably say that because, quite clearly, there would not have been the special Government job creation programme of 20,000 jobs this year.  The Coalition would have been relying on the continuation of their policies, perhaps as embellished in the famous, or notorious, Green Paper published in the Autumn of 1976 which talked in glowing terms about the marvellous growth in employment alleged <Col N="1031" /> to occur in the years 1977-1980. How was this marvellous growth to occur? By an incredible use of statistics. We were going to get a massive growth in industrial employment, something over 4 per cent a year with an 8 per cent growth in industrial output.  How? Because there was going to be an incredibly low rate of productivity increase, something of the order of 3½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I have never once heard any speaker on the opposite side try to justify that appalling low figure, a figure which defied any analysis based on our previous experience, which ran in the face of any reasonable expectation they could have had with the changes around them in the economy and which certainly would have been totally useless if there was to be any serious attempt of catching up on the levels of output and productivity prevailing in the other member states of the EEC.  There was, in fact, no basis for it.  I can positively say that.  If anyone wants to put forward a basis for it he is free to contradict me, but I assert there was no basis for it and we must, therefore, treat it with the contempt it deserves and substitute a more appropriate figure and, when we do so, we arrive at the conclusions that there would have been in fact a nil growth in employment during 1977-1978 and, perhaps, next year also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the industrial sector of the order of 6 per cent plus but we were at least thinking in terms of 5½ to 6 per cent productivity growth.  We were not thinking in terms of an incredibly low figure, lower than that experienced in the previous years. The inference I draw from behaviour this year is not that we were overambitious in the targets we set but that, if anything, we were not ambitious enough and we must now go forward at an even faster rate.  However, if we were to believe the remarks coming from the opposite side of the House, we would be advised that we should cut back and not have attempted any of these excesses, <Col N="1032" /> according to the Opposition, but according to us the minimum necessary to make any serious impact on the appalling employment problem facing the country.  In effect, what the Opposition were saying was that we were wrong to try to do anything to provide work for the thousands pouring out of school joining the many thousands already on the dole queues.</P>
      <P>If I were to chase all the red herrings I should be here all night.  Deputy Bruton and Deputy Horgan talked about the workers being expected to bear the brunt of any sacrifices that have to be made. There is, of course, no suggestion of any such sacrifices having to be made.  The growth in living standards for those at work is rising, not more slowly than we envisaged but more rapidly, and our problem is that the gain in living standards for those already fortunate enough to have jobs is even greater than we would wish and, more importantly, than the economy can sustain and, if these trends continue, we will make it that much more difficult for ourselves as a community to provide employment opportunities for our young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer it.  I want to make the point again slowly and carefully because I will be returning to this theme of taking the lead from London.  The essence of the basket system is that it can produce an easier situation for any currency which is a large component of the total.  We can simplify the example by taking a currency which is very large in relation to the overall basket, say it accounts for 50 per cent of the total value of the European basket.  If that currency were to devalue by 2 per cent&mdash;I will use two as a convenient round number&mdash;approaching the limit of the permissible margin, the average value of the European unit would, of course, fall by 1 per cent because a 2 per cent drop on this half of the unit, combined, let us suppose, with no change on the other half, <Col N="1034" /> would produce an overall fall of 1 per cent and, therefore, this larger currency would have to intervene in support of the currency only to the extent of 1 per cent, rather than 2 per cent.  If I were operating the German or the French or the British economy I could see certain advantages in the basket system.</P>
      <P>If one takes the Irish currency and puts it into the European basket, where it has an impact of the order of 1 per cent, then it does not matter from that point of view whether one is running a parity grid or basket system.  The effect that our weighting can have on the basket is almost nil.  If the value of our currency drops by 2 per cent and we account for only 1 per cent of the European basket as a whole, we are still left with 1.98 per cent of an adjustment to make, almost 2 per cent.  There is no benefit to us worth talking about from the use of a basket as against the parity grid system for calculating the point at which one has to intervene to support one's currency.</P>

      <P>That had been my own impression, though I did think it might be useful to have it said by the Government at the beginning.  If we were to remain linked at parity with sterling within the system, instead of floating <i>visà-vis</i> sterling, would the argument still apply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  We have to discuss the whole question of whether Britain goes in or stays out.  I was going to make a second point which may, perhaps, deal with it.  So much for the weighting of the Irish currency in its own right.  Then one has to face up to the question of what the merits and demerits are of the basket approach as against the parity grid if any currency, sterling or otherwise, were to go in and then go out.  The operation of the basket system would become virtually impossible were currencies to move out after moving in.  Certainly it would be much more difficult to try to operate any form of European Monetary System in those circumstances, yet it is fair to say that one could not preclude in advance any country from exercising the option to withdraw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> Looking at it in those terms, if we had to contemplate the possibility that sterling might enter and then withdraw at some date, it would be much more difficult for us if we were operating a basket system.  I emphasise that we are contemplating possibilities; we are not talking about probabilities.  The balance of argument favours, from our view-point, some form of parity grid system.</P>
    <P>As the House is probably aware, there is what is now known as the &ldquo;Belgian compromise&rdquo;, a modified version of the parity grid system, which would go some of the way towards meeting the only other argument of relevance in this context in favour of the basket approach, which is that it would shift some of the responsibility for intervention onto other currencies and would not impose the whole weight of it onto the one particular currency which might be devaluing. The Belgian compromise sometimes known as &ldquo;the snake in a basket&rdquo; or &ldquo;rattlesnake&rdquo;, could provide a reasonable solution to that problem. Therefore, I do not see any reason in Irish circumstances why we should march out campaigning strongly in favour of the basket system.  By all means let the British do so.  Their interests in this matter are not necessarily ours.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point, which agrees with our own assessment on that.  Does this imply that we would necessarily be floating <i>vis-a-vis</i> sterling and does it imply that if we remain linked in the system to sterling that argument would not operate?</P>

      <P>The correct reply for me to offer is to point out that there has been no final Government decision on these matters since no final decision to join has been taken.  In looking at the implications of joining the system, which we have done, the view I would express is that we would not particularly favour floating against sterling if both were members of the system.  It does not appear to offer many advantages, whereas it does offer some of the disadvantages of introducing some floating currency relationship between Britain and Ireland and between two parts of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of the possible effect of participation in the EMS on exchange control.  As I understand the position, at present exchange controls apply to a very limited area only, that is, to some capital transactions by Irish residents with non-residents in the United Kingdom.  No exchange control restrictions are applied to current transactions with any country and transactions generally with the United Kingdom or non-resident investment here.  So participation in the EMS of itself is unlikely to alter the situation substantially, unless of course it is also decided to break the link with sterling.  In the event, as the Minister for Finance mentioned in his speech, the question of exchange control between the two countries would arise. Indeed, he indicated that he would introduce the necessary enabling legislation in any event so that the arrangements would be easily put in train were they to become necessary at any future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have dealt with the basket and the question of what might or might not be required by way of exchange control.  I want to deal now with a general point about the operation of monetary policy in a small economy because there is the implied notion running through many of the contributions that we in Ireland enjoyed a very great degree of freedom and ability to operate a monetary policy of our own and that we would in some sense be sacrificing that freedom by joining the EMS.  This is not the case at all. If one is linked to the currency of another member country, as we have been on a one to one parity with sterling, then on the whole one tends to suffer or enjoy the same inflation rate or something similar to it.  In particular one enjoys only very restricted ability to operate a separate credit policy of one's own.  To that extent therefore, in contemplating membership of the EMS, we are not contemplating any major surrender of sovereignty or flexibility in this area.  In effect the nature of the choice for us is the choice between one degree <Col N="1039" /> of restriction or limitation and another.  I will come back to that point later on.</P>
    <P>Moving on to some of the more general points that were raised it might be relevant to note that, although much of the discussion centred on the notion that the proposed monetary system would be likely to produce a convergence of inflation rates among member states, it is important, if we are going to tease out some of the issues, to note that inflation rates are not the only reason why exchange rates alter for currencies. There will continue to be a number of reasons why exchange rates could still change and some of these may be relevant when trying to assess the circumstances of the Irish economy as against that of Britain or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention four reasons why exchange rates might alter even in the absence of inflation.  I am sorry for the lecture here, but I think it is necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The first reason would arise in any case where a country was enjoying an inflow of capital, because to the extent that this inflow of capital is taking place the demand for the country's currency is increased and therefore the exchange rate will tend to rise.</P>
      <P>The second case is the logical ultimate consequence of the first.  If there is an inflow of foreign capital into a country for investment purposes, at some later date there will be presumably be an outflow of profits and dividends from such investment and that outflow would have the effect of weakening the exchange rate in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third and more complex case arises where there are differences in the rates of growth in output and productivity between two member states.  There are a variety of combinations here.  I will simply reduce them to the two extremes. If on the one hand the higher growth in output is used largely for consumer spending one would expect some additional volume of imports to be sucked in as a consequence of that higher consumer <Col N="1040" /> spending.  The smaller the economy the more likely it is that that import content will be large.  In those circumstances a sustained high growth rate in output and consumer spending would tend to be accompanied by a weakening of the exchange rate.  In contrast if this high output growth and high productivity growth is the product of a rapid growth in exports, then the generation of an export surplus will tend to strengthen the demand for the country's currency and to that extent would put it in a position where it will either find its exchange rate rising against others countries' or alternatively it will find itself coming back to the first case, which is that it will have funds available for investment in overseas locations.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason why exchange rates continue to fluctuate would be in cases where the currency of any one country was used for financing international trade.  This is often referred to as the reserve currency role.  This clearly does not apply to the currencies of small countries such as Ireland but it can be relevant for larger states.  Indeed, we know that in the past sterling enjoyed this role of a reserve currency.  For so long as the currency is being demanded for reserve purposes its exchange rate will tend to rise because that is the only way people in other countries can acquire currency.  But if circumstances ever change and the currency loses its attractions as a reserve unit, then the exchange rate will weaken for so long as people wish to rid themselves of the now unwanted currency.  That sort of movement from a strong to a weak reserve currency role is one which appears to have been experienced by sterling in recent decades.</P>
    <P>These references to the possible reasons why exchange rates can change are relevant when assessing the question of the value of the Irish £ in the event of a break with sterling.  We can reasonably claim that we enjoy a strong inflow of capital, one of the positive factors in an exchange rate.  We can also claim that we enjoy high rates of growth in productivity and output and, perhaps more importantly, we would appear to enjoy prospects of sustaining this more rapid growth during future years irrespective <Col N="1041" /> of the precise merits of the policies pursued by different parties.  I think it would be recognised that even under a Coalition Government we should be capable of achieving a better performance than is being recorded in the UK.  Those are two very positive reasons why one could argue for a stronger exchange rate for the Irish £.  Of course we recognise that on the contra-side we do not enjoy the benefits that North Sea oil has conferred on Britain but then we are not encumbered with the financial tombstones of an extinct empire.</P>
    <P>In addition, the exchange rate will continue to be influenced by relative inflation rates.  I do not think it would be sensible to seek to establish the likely trend of inflation for many years in the future.  Nevertheless, taking our relative inflation performance into account along with the underlying factors to which I have referred such as investment flows and rates of productivity growth, there is no reason to expect that the Irish £ cannot enjoy a strong position with respect to sterling.  Certainly there can be no basis for the alarmist and pessimistic suggestions by Deputy Kelly of an Irish £ being worth only 70p in Holyhead in the event of a break.  With equal plausibility, one could construct a case for the opposite conclusion.</P>
    <P>Having set down that framework which may be useful for future reference if required, I want to move to the question of the amount of financial support that the Irish Government should seek during the transitional arrangements. Here Deputy FitzGerald made great play of references in the MacDougall Report.  I wish to thank him for the complimentary references he made; indeed, I was quite pleased with my own participation in it.  Unfortunately I have to say that I cannot compliment the Deputy on his use of the report for reasons that I will elaborate.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with that matter I wish to note, in case anyone thinks I am conceding the point, that my contribution to the MacDougall Report was as part of an academic discussion, not a political matter.  Deputy FitzGerald referred to just one of the possible packages that were put forward in that report whereas <Col N="1042" /> we stated that all of these matters call for explicit political decisions in the final analysis.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>Economic analysis can give an analytical framework and point to techniques that may best match the objectives and circumstances in question. Only the political system however can, in the last analysis, prescribe what should be done.</P>
    <P>I wish to note that there is a clear distinction between discussing matters in a purely academic context and plumping for a specific course of action which I would call a political decision.  However, I do not need that defence on this occasion. I am simply making that point for future reference.</P>
    <P>I should also like to note for future reference that the fact that a person signs a report as part of a unanimous group does not mean that he prefers the format that is laid down.  In the normal course of events in any well behaved group there is an element of compromise in order to arrive at a form of words to which all members can subscribe.  Again, I do not need to fall back on that defence on this occasion but it might be useful at some future date.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the two crucial points where the Deputy was wrong and where his references were unhelpful. First, there was what I would describe as the failure to distinguish between the necessary and sufficient conditions for a montary union.  The second point on which I take issue with the Deputy was the failure to distinguish between a monetary union on the one hand and the proposed EMS on the other hand.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first point, the MacDougall Report to which the Deputy referred said that in the opinion of members &ldquo;a budget of perhaps ten times the present level would support a monetary union&rdquo;.  This is a statement of what the group regarded as sufficient. Whether that amount of budgetary expenditure would be necessary for a monetary union is a totally different question and the distinction is an important one.  For instance, I could say that a sum of £50,000 would be sufficient to buy a house and no doubt there would <Col N="1043" /> be very few who would disagree. Therefore, as a group we would be able to sign a report with that statement, but whether a sum of £50,000 is necessary to buy a house is totally different question. Obviously it would depend on the type of house and its precise location.</P>
    <P>Since the MacDougall group were not studying monetary union but were engaged on a study of budgetary issues&mdash;on the role of public finance in European integration&mdash;there was no need for us to spend any time seeking to establish the necessary conditions, including the necessary levels of budgetary expenditure, that were appropriate for a monetary union.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy looks at the report he will find a number of calculations, including some in the appendices, which set out the various mechanisms that might operate to support weaker member states.  If they are to be applied to Ireland they quite clearly <Col N="1045" /> do not require a Community budget even remotely approaching ten times its present size.  Even if they are to be extended to include Italy they do not require a budget ten times its present size. Whether they are extended to include the UK is a separate question which can be dealt with on its merits.</P>
      <P>An issue even more serious is the Opposition's failure to distinguish references to a monetary union from references to the proposed arrangement for the proposed monetary system.  This is a vital distinction.  The crucial difference is that in a monetary union there would be no question of any subsequent change in any exchange rate and each member state would be operating a common Community monetary and credit policy.  The proposed EMS is not such a monetary union.  It even specifically envisages that future movements in exchange rates would not be ruled out, although naturally it is hoped that these will be as few as possible and of limited extent.  Nonetheless, it is clearly envisaged that exchange rate changes could occur and, much more importantly, that member states would continue to have a primary responsibility for the operation for their own monetary policies.  In those circumstances, where the two crucial characteristics of a monetary union are not present, it is irrelevant, confusing, misleading and unhelpful to have references to the possible conditions of a monetary union transposed into illustrations of necessary conditions for the proposed European Monetary System.  I have laid as much emphasis as I can on those remarks because the references did attract a certain amount of attention.  Because they are so wrong and irrelevant to this debate, I hope we will have no further mention of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go on to the level of aid that is appropriate and that we should seek in these circumstances.  We have proposed a figure of £650 million spread over a five-year period.  The thinking behind our approach can be summarised.  We recognised that the switch over to an effective EMS would produce a deflationary impact on the Irish economy.  Whether that deflationary impact <Col N="1046" /> leads to a slowing down in the real growth rate in the economy or whether it takes the beneficial form of reducing price inflation will depend partly on our own behaviour here and partly on the economic environment within the European Community.  Naturally, the purpose that we wish to promote, the objective we wish to see achieved, is that this deflationary impact will take the form of lowering our price inflation.  We want deflation in the full technical sense of the term.  Let us get down our rate of price increase as rapidly as possible.  We do not want any harmful effects on the real growth rate of our economy and on our performance with respect to output and productivity.  For these reasons we seek a certain level of financial aid.</P>
    <P>We can distinguish two main reasons why we want an inflow of funds during this transitional period of EMS.  The first would be an inflow of funds for capital investment.  That inflow of investment would enable us to build up our output capacity and to improve our rate of growth and productivity.  That is why we have specifically channelled our requests for aid to requests that would take the form of supporting additional investment. We are not seeking any current budget transfers of the type referred to in the MacDougall Report.  That might be necessary or relevant in the context of a complete monetary union.  We do not see those circumstances as arising, and even if we were to attempt to argue them we would be laughed at, and rightly, by the other member states.  They might say &ldquo;It is a good try on but totally irrelevant&rdquo;. They would take us either for a lot of characters with hard necks or people who could not distinguish the relevant characteristics of the circumstances before us.</P>

      <P>Grants.  We are looking for straightforward inflows of funds to be used exclusively for investment purposes.  Part of the longer term effects of this would be to help to accelerate our real rate of growth in output and productivity.  The second reason for that aid is its shorter term effect of <Col N="1047" /> the beneficial impact on our balance of payments.  During this period of accelerating our growth rate we will continue to sustain balance of payments deficits.  A substantial part of the balance of payments deficits which we are incurring will be covered already by inflows of private capital such as are already taking place.  Therefore, from the balance of payments point of view there would not appear to be any justification for seeking very large financial transfers of the orders of magnitude that could be deduced from the MacDougall Report. On both grounds, whether from the viewpoint of stability to finance our balance of payments position or in terms of aiding our ability to increase our growth rate, the figures put forward by the Government are of the appropriate order of magnitude.  They represent sums of the order of 1.5 per cent of our GNP which is the kind of stimulus that can be translated into a real boost to the economy.</P>
      <P>The Opposition spent much of their time arguing that the stimulus which we injected this year was too great and that it could not be translated into extra output and productivity and therefore would have to result in the sucking in of more imports.</P>

      <P>We have formed the view as to the kind of stimulus that could be translated into a <Col N="1048" /> real contribution to higher output and productivity, and that is the basis on which we have formulated our requests. They do have some relationship to the kind of investment programmes that we feel are necessary and also to our likely balance of payments position.  They are much more relevant and apposite than the utterly irrelevant and inappropriate figures which could be dragged out of the MacDougall Report.  I hope, if it is not too immodest of me, that I could be allowed to be the best judge of that.  If Deputy FitzGerald is complimenting me on the excellence of the report&mdash;which I hope will continue to be used in many future debates on the development of the Community budget and so on&mdash;surely it is unrealistic to assume that I would be so incompetent, misguided or foolish as to ignore everything I have done before and adopt a totally different stance which would not have a basis.  That is relevant in one context but that context is not the discussion of the proposed EMS.</P>
      <P>I have produced arguments why the circumstances of the EMS are different and I am now introducing the basis on which one can assess the scale of the financial aid appropriate to our conditions over the next few years.  Those are the two main reasons.  We can do it by reference to our balance of payments financing position and the size of the stimulus to investment which would be needed over these few years.  If those conditions were met it would be feasible not merely to sustain the growth rate of the economy but, hopefully, to improve it.  That would be the basis on which one would be able to bring about the most rapid growth of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I want to digress for a few moments to take up the point that we were accused of seeking with the EMS to look around for some sort of alibi before we changed direction and before we started introducing all sorts of harsh and draconian measures seeking some sort of cut-back in living standards and so forth on the part of the workers.  I have been saying that the actual deflationary impact of the EMS, whether that takes the beneficial form of reducing inflation or whether it takes the harmful effect of reducing our real growth in output, <Col N="1049" /> depends partly on the European environment and partly on our own behaviour.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the European environment. If we were to get a sufficient degree of financial support so that we did not have to worry about our balance of payments position and that we could sustain a rapid rate of growth in investment, then what we were doing domestically in terms of our domestic costs and prices would become critically important.  That is the context in which the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and I have been starting to draw attention to the crucial need to ensure that income increases over the next three years are related to the real capacity of the economy to bear them and will not simply trigger off another wave of inflationary excess.  That issue will need to be discussed in greater detail over the coming weeks.  I have to make it quite clear that it would be utterly unrealistic and unreasonable to approach our partners in the Community and ask them to help us in our development efforts if we were not willing to help ourselves by pursuing sensible courses of action which will produce faster increases in living standards than any mythical increases produced by rapid monetary rises that would soon be swallowed up in another wave of inflation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to move on to some of the more general attitudes about our approach to the situation.  I was struck very forcibly by the extraordinary emphasis in following the British line in all of these discussions.  I do not wish to be misunderstood.  I will not adopt a wrap the green flag around me boys attitude, an anti-British obscurantist approach. I believe there is a sensible course of action which avoids that extreme but also avoids the extraordinary <Col N="1050" /> slavish mentality which was displayed by some of the speakers from the other side of the House.  When Deputy John Kelly gave us his amusing and entertaining exercise in leprechaun economics he did not realise the bitter, ironic truth of the attitude he portrayed.  He was the epitomy of the stage Irishman, good for a laugh, good for a fine flow of words, an amusing personality, witty.  But when it came to any of the real issues, when it came to the heart of the matter, when it came to the question of what we must do and how we would do it, not a word, not a suggestion that any Irishman or any Irish Government were capable of using their freedom and capable of deciding independently what was best for the Irish people.  We got, instead of that, the cap in hand approach, touching the forelock deferentially and saying &ldquo;Whatever the lords and masters in London decide&rdquo;. That is the pathetic spectacle we got from a party who claim to be descended from Sinn Féin.  They had nothing better to offer the Irish people than an abject policy of remaining tied to Mother England's apron strings.</P>
    <P>That may seem a harsh verdict on the Fine Gael approach, but I have to say that I saw no suggestion in any of their remarks that any credit was to be given to the Taoiseach for having taken the initiative, after Chancellor Schmidt and President Giscard d'Estaing had put forward the proposal, in defining our position and for spelling out the nature of the action and the form of the proposals that would be needed in our view to produce a satisfactory system. There was no word about that.  There was plenty of praise for the British Minister, but stony silence for the Taoiseach.  We were told that if Jim Callaghan led a delegation to Bonn, the Taoiseach should do the same.  Why? We were also told that if they hang back and display a negative attitude towards the system we should do the same. Why?  Where are the conditions that are comparable?  We do not share the British position on the common agricultural policy.  We do not have their approach to some of the discussions on financial transfers.  We are not in the same situation regarding capital inflows or the growth of our economy.  With <Col N="1051" /> regard to the general question of monetary policy we have not operated the centre of a financial empire for centuries and then had that empire vanish around our ears and lived with the aftermath of it.  Those are not problems for us.</P>

      <P>No.  I do not wish to be misunderstood here.  Those are matters which are the legitimate concern of the British Government.  Their circumstances, their history and their characteristics are matters to be dealt with by the British Government.  I am trying to suggest that, while our circumstances, our needs and our aspirations in some instances may be similar to the British, there are many instances where they are different.  Surely it is right that we should exercise our independence. That is exactly what we have done.  I did not hear a single word from the other side of the House which suggested that we were right to have gone off from the word go, pursued our position and adopted our attitudes to any of the questions.</P>

      <P>Tairgím: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill to amend the 1937 Constitution has three distinct purposes, each of which aims to secure the rights of children.  The first and immediate purpose is to ensure that adoptions are safeguarded and made constitutionally secure.  The other purposes come within the broader ambit of children's rights, towards which we, the legislators, should be addressing our minds as we approach 1979, the year of the child.  These other purposes are the removal of discrimination against illegitimate children and the extension of the category of children who can be legally adopted.</P>
      <P>Legislation on adoption belongs to this present century.  It was enacted in most countries between the two world wars to cater for the great masses of homeless children who were the victims of these clashes between great powers. England and Wales produced adoption legislation in 1926, Northern Ireland in 1929, but despite pressure since the late forties from our adoption societies, it was late 1952 before a Bill was enacted here to legalise adoption.  It is true to say that there was a certain reluctance and opposition to the legislation and there were reservations to the Bill that was enacted.  There were fears that it would deprive parents of their rights and the Act reflected some of the fears that were prevalent and attempted to safeguard the rights of parents.  There was great preoccupation with the rights of parents during those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1971, Father James Good, speaking with considerable authority and experience on the subject of adoption, criticised the provisions of the 1952 Act for not being sufficiently child-centred. Adoption, he said, was not for the purposes of providing children for childless <Col N="1053" /> marriages, it was not for the purpose of relieving parents of their responsibilities, nor for saving the State expense, but to provide homes and families for homeless and familyless children.</P>
    <P>Father Good was correct.  This must be the prime purpose of adoption legislation and the amending Acts of 1974 and 1976 reflected this thinking and sought to provide that the child's welfare be placed first in cases of custody disputes. Indeed, such thinking had also been reflected in section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which sought to ensure that the child's welfare be of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt now, however, that these legislative measures, with their emphasis on the rights of the child, are constitutionally valid and there is doubt on constitutional grounds also as to the legal validity of adoption orders made by the Adoption Board since it was established in 1952.</P>
    <P>With regard to adoption orders, since the famous McL case decided by the Supreme Court in June 1976, adoptive parents have lived in a state of great anxiety and they have freely expressed their anxiety to all our political parties.  It is in response to representations from the Adoptive Parents' Association as well as from the many caring organisations who concern themselves with the welfare of children and also because the Government have not acted, that the Labour Party have put forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the McL case a five year old adoption order was quashed by the Supreme Court because the Adoption Board had made a mistake in administrative procedure.  It had not fully informed the natural mother of the consequences of her consent to adoption and of her right to withdraw that consent up to the time of the making of the adoption order.  In this McL case the natural parents had since married and, as the order was defective, the child was legitimated and he and his natural parents formed a family with all the rights and privileges which Article 41 of the Irish Constitution affords families based on marriage.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Supreme Court to quash the adoption order in this case was disturbing to all adoptive parents <Col N="1054" /> because such a case though rare, could recur.  They also felt that the board could have made further administrative errors in any of the 23,721 cases since 1952. Most disturbing of all, however, was the fear raised by the McL case that the whole system of adoption might be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The case made by counsel for the natural parents in the McL case was that the Adoption Board, in considering a case and deciding whether or not to make an adoption order, were exercising powers of an unlimited judicial nature and were therefore trespassing a field which the Constitution reserved to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Article 37 of the Constitution permits the exercise of functions and powers of a limited judicial nature by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law, notwithstanding that such person or such body of persons is not a judge or a court, but the point argued was that the making of an adoption order, which would affect the whole future of the child whose adoption was being considered, could not be considered as exercising limited functions and powers.</P>
    <P>The McL case was decided on the validity of the individual order and the judges, quite deliberately, I think, did not go on to consider the constitutional issues which were raised at that time.  Following the McL case, the Government enacted the Adoption Bill of 1976 as an emergency measure to deal with the fears that had been raised making the child's welfare of paramount consideration, but still the constitutional issue remained unclear and the doubt persisted in the minds of adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>In their great anxiety to have the matter clarified, the Adoptive Parents' Association commissioned an opinion from two eminent barristers, Messrs. Barrington and Condon.  Their opinion, given on 8 March 1977, sustains the fears that existed with regard to the unlimited nature of the functions and powers of the Adoption Board, and also with regard to the constitutional validity of the provisions of the 1974 and 1976 Adoption Acts, which placed the child's welfare first.</P>
    <P>The legal opinion at that time was that the first problem&mdash;the unlimited nature <Col N="1055" /> of the functions and powers of the Adoption Board&mdash;could only be solved by writing adoption into the Constitution. Our amendment to Article 37 of the Constitution is an amendment, along the lines suggested by this opinion of March 1977, by the addition of the following sentence:</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board established under the Adoption Acts 1952-1976 shall be deemed in considering adoptions and in making or deciding not to make adoption orders to be exercising limited functions and powers.</P>
    <P>This is an urgent and appropriate amendment.  It is now nineteen and a half months since that legal opinion was given which I think made Government action imperative.  It is unbelievable that no action has been taken by the Government in that time.  The Government have been in power for 15 of those nineteen and a half months and must be held primarily responsible for the lack of action in that area and for the unnecessary pain and suffering caused to 25,000 families who were concerned in the intervening years and who adopted children between the coming into operation of the original Adoption Act and the present day.  It is indefensible that legislation of this nature should give pride of place to many other pieces of legislation that we have.  At present we have a Bill before the House in regard to capital gains tax.  That Bill must be passed but surely it is a reflection on the priorities of the Government that such Bills take preference over a Bill to alleviate  human suffering such as a Bill to suffering the Constitution and ease the sufering of people involved in regard to adoption.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 of our Bill amend articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution by deleting the words &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; and &ldquo;imprescriptible&rdquo; as they apply to family rights and parents rights respectively. These amendments remove doubt as to whether Irish adoption laws, to the extent that they make the welfare of the child the paramount consideration in adoption matters, contravene Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution which have been interpreted as giving priority to <Col N="1056" /> parental rights over children's rights.  In fact, legal opinion exists that notwithstanding the 1976 Adoption Act a court might feel obliged to quash an adoption order and return a child to its natural parents&mdash;provided they have married&mdash;regardless of the welfare of that child.  One could recall in the sense of a statement such as this a statement made by the Chief Justice in the McL case when he warned: &ldquo;One must not allow compassion to confuse or permit sympathy to conceal fundamental rights&rdquo;.  Such a decision could be taken and we can well imagine its traumatic effects.  Our amendment places beyond doubt the validity of the 1974 and 1976 Adoption Acts and it eliminates the danger of such a decision.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that the courts have decided that a family in this State under Article 41 of the Constitution means a family based on marriage and does not include a family comprised of unmarried parents and their children. This results in discrimination against illegitimate children and it is the elimination of this discrimination that we propose as the second purpose of this Bill.  Deletion of the words &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; and &ldquo;imprescriptible&rdquo; as they apply to the rights of parents and the inclusion which we propose of the words &ldquo;equality of rights under the law shall not be denied to any child on the basis of status at birth or parentage&rdquo;, would remove the present legal discrimination against the illegitimate child.</P>
    <P>We believe this reform is very urgent. It has already been carried out in a large number of countries such as New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland. Its practical effect would be to give children born out of wedlock the same right of succession under the 1965 Succession Act as children born within marriage, provided paternity is established. At present a child born out of wedlock has no rights of succession whatever in this country to the property of its natural father and only a very limited right to succeed to the property of its mother&mdash;the right only exists where the mother has no legitimate issue.  It is a disgusting and shameful law which penalises and victimises innocent <Col N="1057" /> children with some vague notion, apparently, of discouraging adultery and fornication.</P>
    <P>The association, Cherish, which is very well equipped to speak on this subject in welcoming this Bill says it is totally unacceptable that some children of a nation are discriminated against by virtue of the marital status of their parents. They say that this discrimination has the effect of prohibiting a child from succeeding to the estate of his father or fraternal relatives and brings into question his right of inheritance to the estate of his mother.  They add that nothing but the total abolition of the status of illegitimacy is acceptable.  They welcome this Bill.  They are people who are affected by it and people whom we seek to help by putting forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Council for Social Welfare held in Dublin in 1976 in a submission on children born out of wedlock stated:</P>
    <P>We are concerned with the rights of all children and that they should be treated equally.  We regard it as unchristian that children born out of wedlock should, as a result of the actions of their parents be victimised by legal distinctions between them and children born to married parents. Consequently, we wish to urge that the legal disabilities imposed on these children should be removed.</P>
    <P>They recommend that there be no distinction between children before the law and that children born out of wedlock be given rights of succession.</P>
    <P>The Irish Council of Civil Liberties which is deeply concerned with rights of children in a report on children's rights under the Constitution deplores the concept of illegitimacy as &ldquo;one of the law's most shameful creations&rdquo; using as it does innocent children as tools and recommends that a clause be added to the Constitution forbidding discrimination between different classes of children based only on difference in the marital status of their parents.  The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1978 will have the effect of alleviating the disgust of all these groups of people in regard to the present situation.  It will <Col N="1058" /> bring to an end the discrimination that exists between legitimate and illegitimate children.  It is a reform that is long overdue and we commend its purpose to the House.</P>
    <P>The third purpose of the Bill is to extend the facility and benefit of adoption to a wider category of children than orphans and illegitimate children.  At present children of married persons, whether abandoned or however illtreated, do not qualify for adoption.  This is so because of the rights and duties married parents are given under Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution of 1937 which are described as inalienable or imprescriptible or both.  The amendments in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill proposing that those words be deleted would overcome this difficulty.</P>
    <P>As the Constitution stands, married persons cannot divest themselves of their rights and duties in respect of their children, even those parents who seriously neglect and ill-treat their children, who have no interest in the welfare of their children, and who are not fitted for the care of children.  Even in their case the Constitution still insists on preserving rights which they may have abused over and over.  This appears to me to be a ludicrous situation.  Children of such parents need help.  They are worse than homeless.  They are entitled to benefit from the warmth and security which could be theirs, and which would be theirs, in an adoptive home but for this cruel constitutional barrier which still exists.  Many of them are condemned to spend their lives in institutions, and that is indefensible.  I submit each day a constitutional amendment is delayed, and a subsequent referendum is delayed, will result in deprivation and perhaps irreparable damage to other young lives. The matter is urgent.  In their statement in 1976 the Council for Social Welfare said:</P>
    <P>5.5.  It is most destructive experience for a child to be abandoned by his parents.  When a child is abandoned, whether by married parents or by single parents, or where they do not make reasonable effort to provide a secure home environment for him, then the interests of the child demand that an equivalent home environment <Col N="1059" /> should be created for him with, or even in extreme cases without, the consent of the parents.</P>
    <P>5.6.  We are aware that children can be left in care until they are of an age to enter employment and earn wages, at which stage their parents reestablish contact with them.  We have known of such children returning then to live with their parents and suffering morally and physically as a consequence. The law offers no protection to these children against either their exploitation or their removal from the jurisdiction by their parents.</P>
    <P>5.7.  Children should no longer be seen as objects of the law but rather as subjects with rights, and this concept of children's rights should be embodied in the law.  In any conflict situation the child's welfare should be paramount.</P>
    <P>5.8.  When for any reason, parents are unable or unwilling to fulfil their obligations towards their children, the State as the ultimate authority must intervene to protect the rights of those children.</P>
    <P>In her submission to the newsletter &ldquo;Children First&rdquo; Anna Lee the coordinator of Cherish said:</P>
    <P>We would consider it a matter of utmost urgency that discrimination against children by reason of their parentage alone should be prohibited. There is no possible justification for allowing the present legal discrimination between different classes of children based only on differences in marital status of their parents to continue.</P>
    <P>She was referring to the concept of illegitimacy and the discrimination against illegitimate children.  She went on to say:</P>
    <P>Adoption should be made available to all children regardless of legal status where it might be seen to serve their best interests.  Thus, the adoption of legitimate children with living parents should be made possible so that they may be offered a secure and stable family life if their biological parents are unable or unwilling to provide such a life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> Very many authoritive sources agree on this issue.  It is in response to the submissions of all these people that we have broadened the concept of our Bill to provide for the two other purposes I have mentioned: the ending of discrimination against illegitimate children and the broadening of the category of children who may be adopted.</P>
    <P>It is important to add that this Bill will not in any way undermine the family because Clause 3 of Part II states quite clearly:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the family as the social unit best fitted to provide the continuity of care essential to the upbringing of a child.  Where, however, the welfare of the child requires it, whether by reason of the death of the parents, or by reason of their unwillingness, neglect or inability to discharge their parental duties, the State shall supply the place of the parents by appropriate means, which may include the enactment of laws providing for the transfer of parental rights to substitute parents.</P>
    <P>We acknowledge the family as the social unit best fitted to provide the continuity of care essential to the upbringing of the child.</P>
    <P>There is at present a shortage of children for the number of prospective adoptive parents eager to provide the security, warmth and comfort of an intimate caring family relationship in full adoption.  At the same time, a considerable number of children are condemned to institutions or the lesser security of fosterage, excellent though fosterage is in many instances.</P>
    <P>The present situation is ludicrous.  It is ridiculous.  It can be resolved by the passage of this Bill.  The Bill is not narrow. It is well rounded.  It secures the rights of children as well as alleviating the immediate problems.  It is an appropriate measure as we approach International Children's Year.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to protect and vindicate the rights of children.  In the 15 months they have been in office they have been totally negligent in that area.  It is also the duty of the Government to allay the fears of the adoptive parents throughout this State.  By accepting this Bill, with its <Col N="1061" /> framework for reform in the two areas of adoption and illegitimacy, they will be bringing to an end a great deal of human suffering in this country.  They will also be clearing the way for further legislative reform in the area of child welfare without fear of constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally support the Bill which was so effectively and comprehensively introduced by my colleague Deputy Mrs. Desmond.  I want to give an assurance to the House and to the Minister on a number of items in our approach to this Bill.  We want a constructive debate.  As a political party we are completely open to a response.  In no way do we regard our Bill as being an entirely definitive instrument on the totality of the subject.  We know there is great sensitivity needed in the drafting of any such legislation.</P>
      <P>Indeed, a week ago in his response to a query as to why there is not a Government Bill before the House on this matter, the Taoiseach said there are major difficulties.  We accept that there are considerable difficulties.  We know this as a political party and from the various representations we have received, some as far back as ten years ago.  I have been here for ten years and Deputy Eileen Desmond has been in one or other of the Houses for longer.  In our day to day work during that time we have come face to face with the disabilities and the inadequacies of the legislation in existence, with the positive discrimination of existing legislation in relation to adoption, the social and legal rights of illegitimate children and other matters.</P>
      <P>I want to stress the appalling reflection on our parliamentary system of the extent to which the Labour Party have access to the body of constitutional opinion on this matter.  It is negligible.  We know there is a great deal of sympathy on this issue, on the lack of humanity and sensitivity, and we in this party are open to conviction as to the views of the Minister, the Attorney-General and the constitutional draftsmen on this Bill and on its shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental purpose of the debate is to try to light a fire under the <Col N="1062" /> subject after so many years of sporadic public discussion, to try to make some progress in regard to the need for constitutional reform in this area and to remedy the situation as rapidly as possible. There is nothing more discouraging to people, be they members of my own family who are involved in adoption or social workers not only here but in England who make constant inquiries as to the precise limitations in this area in regard to existing relationships between adoptive parents and their children or in relation to our socially outrageous discrimination in regard to illegitimate children and their rights of succession.  It is outrageously discouraging that we should allow this situation to continue without providing clarification.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that we do not approach this debate even from a Labour Party political point of view. Our basic aim is to see to what extent we can make progress.  We have difficulties even in that because at this moment we do not know the mind of the Government in relation to this issue.  There have been numerous speeches, or half speeches, with great deference to the Minister and the Taoiseach and to my constituency colleague, Deputy Andrews, on this matter of illegitimacy. After nearly two years of experience of a clear-cut constitutional opinion, it is about time we got down to work to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>There are only 22 sitting days left before Christmas.  Even if we started tomorrow on a Bill to amend the Constitution, we would be doing extraordinarily well to have it through by Christmas.  When we come back at the end of January we will be involved up to our tonsils in the budget debate and this Bill will slide into oblivion until the middle of next year, when the Government will be able to advance the argument that the European and local elections will be held and that we could not possibly have a referendum on the Constitution. Therefore I would strongly impress on the Minister the concern of this party that we should not allow things to drift until the end of next year.</P>
    <P>We come to the problem of a referendum on a Constitution amendment.  I do not know to what extent this has been <Col N="1063" /> discussed at Cabinet level, but I now ask the Government to make provision for an early Constitution referendum, if necessary in conjunction with the European elections.  There is not a councillor in the country who would shed a tear if the local elections were not held next year&mdash;they could be postponed for a year by a simple Government order. Now that the rates have been abolished there is very little power left in the hands of local councils.  Therefore, it should not be beyond the wit of the Government to bring forward a referendum on a constitutional amendment in respect of which I have no doubt 95 per cent of the Irish people would vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the appalling situation that nobody seems to know the precise form such a constitutional amendment would take.  The Government apparently have two distinct views and we have never had a clear-cut opinion from the Law Reform Commission. It is not good enough that after 15 months of government we should be faced with a situation where an opposition party have to put this matter on the table.  Other constitutional matters such as the question of bail fade into insignificance by comparison with this area, and I would ask the Government to allow for the referendum to be held simultaneously with the European elections.</P>
    <P>If it is not politic for the Government to postpone the local elections for another year and if we have to have three ballot papers on the one day I have no doubt that such is the overwhelming national opinion on this issue, an opinion that something must be done rapidly&mdash;the precise parameters of the framework of the amendment are still somewhat clouded&mdash;that people would vote in the European elections, the local election and simultaneously give a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the necessary dual amendments of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is a way ahead and an opportunity open to the Government on this.  I am aware of the comments the Minister has made on this issue here and to outside  organisations.  I know that by and large he is in agreement with us that the country needs the necessary amendments <Col N="1064" /> to the Constitution.  There is no need for me to mention the vast amount of material available to Members on this issue.  When I was in Opposition in 1971-72 I wrote an article to <i>The Irish Times</i> on the question of adoption and I was confident then that something would be done, but in the four years we were in Office we did not do much about it.  During that period we got a very solid kick in the rump by virtue of court proceedings and constitutional opinion. Therefore, there are no political kudos to be gained on this issue.  Before the politicians become discredited on this issue&mdash;there are a number of serious constitutional issues on which we are almost totally discredited be it adoption, divorce or family planning&mdash;we should ensure that adoption does not enter into that litany of necessary social legislative change on which we have failed miserably.</P>
    <P>We have received representations on this issue from at least 20 organisations and many individuals, and they all deserve better of us.  I earnestly plead with the Minister, on behalf of adopted children and those who will be adopted and enjoy the blessing, the warmth and love of family life, such as we have been fortunate enough to enjoy, to help bestow that blessing on many more children.  We should do it for those who are the subject of adoption orders and, in particular, we should eliminate the unchristian, anti-social, viciously discriminatory status in our society in relation to illegitimacy which has been a blot on Irish nationhood, nationality and citizenship for decades.</P>
    <P>We should grasp this opportunity, and it is within the competence of the Minister to do so.  I can assure the Minister that we are open to suggestions on this matter.  The Taoiseach, in his initial response, made some criticisms across the House, but we are prepared to listen to those and any criticisms the Minister may make.  We are prepared to make this an all-Party matter, and if the Minister wants an all-Party Committee to frame an agreed piece of legislation on adoption we would be agreeable.  We would nominate our Members overnight to such a committee.  I implore the Minister to deal with this matter urgently <Col N="1065" /> and ensure that before the year is out we can say that we passed a piece of legislation which redounds to the credit and public responsibility of the Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the normal procedure in the course of a debate of this nature was that speakers were called from the different sides of the House.  I thought we would have had the benefit of the Minister's views on the Bill at this stage of the proceedings.  I do not know whether the fact that the Minister has not spoken so far is an indication of the attitude of the Government on this matter or whether he has not spoken because he does not have any of his troops behind him in support. The fact that he has not spoken is a cause for concern to those who are genuinely interested, on a non-party basis, in dealing with the troubled situation relative to our adoption laws.  The recent history is well known.  From the McL decision in 1976 we had a state of crisis here in regard to our adoption laws.  That was followed by the 1976 Adoption Act, an emergency measure which attempted to allay the fears of the adoptive parents and adopted children. At the time it was indicated by the Government that that was not the last word on the matter.  Shortly afterwards the Government indicated that, having taken advice, a referendum was necessary to ensure that in any adoption situation the interests of the child should prevail.  That view was confirmed by the then Minister for Justice who, in March 1977, indicated that the preparation of proposals was at an advanced stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the change of Government questions were put to the Taoiseach in regard to this matter and in October 1977 he indicated that the possibility of an amendment to the Constitution to deal with certain aspects of the law on adoption was under consideration.  In December 1977, in response to questions I put to the Minister for Justice, he indicated that that was his view and that he would not make any further statement. We are now in October 1978 but we have not had any action from the Government in this area or, indeed, in any area relative to the field of law reform.  I make that statement more in <Col N="1066" /> sorrow than in anger because I feel that the Minister and the Government must be aware of the real crisis in the field of adoption which presented itself following the 1976 decision.  They must be aware of the insecurity of adoptive parents and of adopted children.  They must be aware that prospective adoptive parents are to some extent affected in their decision as to whether to adopt because of the present state of our adoption law.</P>
    <P>Looking further to the future, we have to consider the situation of the prospective adoptive children.  Is there any discussion on the need to change the present situation to bring it up to date to secure the adoptive parents and the adopted children, and if so why is action not being taken?  The Government must accept the considered opinion produced by various organisations and legal gentlemen, and if they do not accept the finer points of these opinions, surely they must accept the basis on which it was found necessary to seek these opinions and the basis on which these opinions were given.</P>
    <P>The present problem means that changes are necessary.  Nothing is being done to provide these changes, and in this regard I compliment Deputy Mrs. Desmond of the Labour Party for bringing the matter to a head by placing this Bill before the House.  On behalf of my party I accept this Bill in principle.  I also accept that there are points in detail which one could take issue with, but these could be sorted out in committee. The adoption problem has been put on the floor of this House by Deputy Mrs. Desmond, and on behalf of Fine Gael I approve this Bill in principle.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts the underlying need for change there are two options open to him.  We either accept this Bill in principle and agrees to the Second Stage, reserving the right to put down amendments in Committee, or he gives a clear and positive undertaking without using the words &ldquo;within a reasonable time&rdquo; or some such formula which I distrust, that he will within a specified time limit circulate a Bill to deal with this problem.  If the Minister were prepared to do that I, and I am sure Deputy Mrs. Desmond, would feel that she had achieved her mission, that she had caused the <Col N="1067" /> problem to be dealt with if not in the terms in which she present her Bill.</P>
    <P>Legislation in recent years, for instance the Guardianship of Infants Acts, 1964, and more recent adoption Acts, have caught up with the public and social attitude of the day that our legislation should be more child centred and not as envisaged at the time of the 1937 Constitution, dealing with, dealing solely with the rights of parents.  Although I would not classify myself as a constitutional lawyer, I feel that to constitutionally secure the adoption orders made since 1953 of which there are about 23,000 it is necessary to change the Constitution.  The Taoiseach at the opening of this session indicated that he had some doubt on this point.  If there is some doubt among lawyers, and there is a clear view strongly expressed by very eminent counsel that there is no doubt that a referendum is necessary to change the Constitution so as to provide the necessary constitutional framework to carry out adoption orders, the Minister should consider that it is doubt that we are trying to allay here.  In case adoptive parents and adopted children feel greater insecurity as a result of this type of debate I must point out that the McL case was an isolated case and the circumstnces which arose in that case are very rare.</P>
    <P>There is a certain element of insecurity and even if the problem is tacked by producing a new Bill which does not amend the Constitution there is a possibility that the sense of insecurity will continue.  I would urge the Minister to either accept this Bill and put down amendments at Committee Stage or to give the undertaking I referred to and produce a Bill to amend the Constitution or else a Bill which would be made absolutely constitutionally secure.  The only way to produce such security would be to amend the Constitution or to submit a Bill under Article 27 for approval by the people.  The result of doing this would have a considerable psychological effect in that the matter would then be beyond all doubt.  Unless this is done either in Deputy Mrs. Desmond's Bill or by way of a Bill from the Minister some doubt will remain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> The situation of the child today is that we are beginning to accept that a child has civil and human rights, the child is not just considered as being part of the family.  This type of thinking is an advance on that which obtained when the 1937 Constitution was drafted.  The 1937 Constitution laid considerable emphasis on the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the family and the rights of the parent in regard to education, custody and so on.  There seems to be an omission in the 1937 Constitution in that the child is not considered as an individual human being.  Public opinion today is that the child should be considered to have individual civil and human rights, and this is why the Constitution and the thinking behind it should be brought up to date.  In dealing with this Bill we are looking at a suggestion that, first of all, orders made by the Adoption Board should be constitutionally secure.  I am not entirely happy with the drafting of the Bill for a number of reasons.  For instance if one refers to the Adoption Board established under the Adoption Acts from 1952 to 1976 and incorporates this in the Constitution there might be difficulty if there was an adoption Act in 1980, and there might be a difficulty if in the future we wished to establish some other type of board to deal with this problem, but this is purely a drafting point and does not take from the fundamental principle that I fully agree with, that adoption orders should be absolutely constitutionally secure.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals also with the question of illegitimacy and provides that in effect the stigma of illegitimacy on a child born out of wedlock is to be removed totally.  Is there anybody who can take issue with this concept?  The manner in which this part of the Bill is drafted might give rise to question but presumably that is a matter for referral to the parliamentary draftsman for assistance. One cannot expect a Deputy in Opposition to be up to date with the techniques of parliamentary draftsmanship but the fundamental principle is contained in the Bill.  Can anybody argue that an innocent child born into this world should carry any stigma or <Col N="1069" /> can any argument be raised against such an innocent child having full rights of citizenship, rights of property and of succession as in the case in respect of any other child?  In regard to that aspect of the Bill it is clear again that there can be no objection.</P>
    <P>The third major aspect of the Bill relates to the question of the adoption of legitimate children.  Under the present law this is quite limited and relates only to orphans or to an unusual type of situation where a child's natural parents marry subsequently and afterwards wish to have the child adopted.  As the law stands the child would have been rendered legitimate by the marriage but this indicates how confined is the whole question of the adoption of legitimate children.  Obviously, there is no question of the State, of the Adoption Board or of anybody else being empowered to take children from one family and place them in the care of another family for reasons that are frivolous.  It is obvious that in the thinking behind this Bill there is no question that for any reason, financial or otherwise such a change should be made.  But if there were to be such a change I would not apologise for emphasising the necessity for very strong safeguards from the point of view of protecting the family, from the point of view of protecting natural parents and of ensuring that the substantial onus of proof was totally in favour of the natural parents in this type of situation.</P>
    <P>However, at this stage we are discussing the Bill which deals with an amendment to the Constitution.  We are not dealing with an adoption Bill as such. We are in the situation that daily the lives of children are being affected in a most serious way to the extent that their prospects of adoption are being impaired by the present uncertain situation.  I believe there is consent on all sides of the House that change is necessary.  In that situation I would urge the Minister, not on a party basis but in the interest of humanity, in the interest of adoptive parents and of adopted children both now and in the future, that action must be taken.  This action can be taken in either of two ways&mdash;to support the Bill in principle or to give a clear and specific <Col N="1070" /> undertaking that with a specified time which, in the light of my remarks, must be very short, to bring in a Bill to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I assure the House that so far as the Government are concerned there is no disagreement with the proposition that adoption orders made properly according to law should be safe from the danger of being declared to be invalid.  For the rest, the ground covered by Deputy Desmond's Bill is very difficult and, indeed, very delicate.  I understand the concern that has prompted the Bill and I congratulate Deputy Eileen Desmond on her initiative in introducing it.  Also, I thank Deputy Barry Desmond and Deputy O'Keeffe for their contributions.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if there appears to have been some delay on my part in reaching conclusions on what needs to be done but changes in this area are of such fundamental importance to the lives of a great number of people that every possible care must be taken to ensure that steps taken will solve the problems they are intended to solve and that in the process those steps do not create other serious problems.  I assure the Deputies that this matter has been analysed carefully both in my Department and by the Attorney General and I am now in the process of consulting my colleagues in the Government.  I am hopeful that decisions will be taken by the Government in this area in the very near future. Regarding the request made by Deputy O'Keeffe and bearing in mind the number of sitting days remaining in this session, I am confident of having legislation before the House before the session concludes.</P>
      <P>As matters stand I cannot say whether, for example, having regard to the analysis I have mentioned, the provision on the lines of section 1 of the Bill will be accepted by the Government as being necessary.  In any case, the text of that section appears to be in need of at least one important amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combined effect of section 2 and the Schedule could be very far-reaching indeed, and its application in particular cases might have effects quite different <Col N="1071" /> from what very many people would consider to be right or even tolerable.  In the circumstances therefore I must oppose this Bill.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to assure the House that I will do everything in my power to expedite the formulation of the Government's proposals in this area, and I am confident that I will have the necessary legislation to deal with the matter in the House this session.</P>

      <P>I would prefer to leave that area alone until such time as the Government Bill will be before the House.  I am aware of the problems that exist in this area.  As I said, I propose to consult the Cabinet in the very near future&mdash;I hope Deputy O'Keeffe will forgive me for using that phrase&mdash;and when they have made a final decision, then, and not before, will I be prepared to disclose what is in the Bill.  That has <Col N="1072" /> been the normal practice since I have been in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be controversial; I am trying to have this discussion as non-political party as possible, but when the Minister stands up and indicates in a very general way that he will introduce a Bill before the Christmas recess, and if we are to accept his word on that, which we do, it is reasonable to know precisely what he is undertaking to do.  Is he undertaking to deal with the first aspect of the Bill with regard to adoption orders or is he giving us an undertaking that he will introduce before Christmas a Bill that will deal with the present adoption order situation, the rights of illegitimate children under the law and the consideration of the extension of eligibility for adoption? As I said I am not trying to be controversial but in my view it is reasonable that the Minister's undertaking could end this discussion only if he gives us a clear statement of intent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has chosen his words very carefully&mdash;&ldquo;The real fears of parents&rdquo;.  This Bill wants to go further than that.  As Deputy Cluskey said there is also the provision of the extension of eligibility for adoption and the question of the rights of the illegitimate child.  I congratulate Deputy E. Desmond on introducing this Bill.  I agree with the points raised by her and I support the case she made, and Deputy O'Keeffe's submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience in this area goes back a very long time.  It always puzzles me how we got the reputation of being the wild Irish, impetuous and moving forward without giving any great thought to what we are doing, because my first experience in this area was in 1948, exactly 30 years ago.  The proposal of an Adoption Bill at that time <Col N="1073" /> was turned down.  The subsequent Government introduced an Adoption Bill in the fifties and we have been having discussions on this very tangled, delicate and intricate problem&mdash;I have no illusions about that&mdash;ever since.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see this new development of the child orientated type of legislation appearing.  It is something I hoped would develop for a very long time.  Another matter in which I have been engaged for at least 20 or 25 years concerns the right of the individual child&mdash;this occurs also in the question of corporal punishment&mdash;and whether any individual can be subjected to assault by another individual.  All through the years we have given parents particular rights not only in relation to adoption but also in relation to this other matter, which I am not going to pursue.</P>
    <P>A case has been made for saying that because a child is an individual and a personality in his own right, it is illegal to touch a child.  The Labour Party's Bill, which proposes to change the Constitution, is very urgent.  Unfortunately it affects a minority&mdash;25,000 people and the children involved&mdash;and through the years we have not paid very much attention to the rights of minorities.  I am glad to hear the Minister is going to take some measures to deal with the anomalies arising out of the making of the adoption orders.  Even that will be a welcome advance, but I hope he will go further, in order to give some security to the parents who have children and, much more important, security to the children who have been taken into families and given the advantage of the stability and security of a loving relationship between the parents and children of the adoptive home.</P>
    <P>This is really the kernel of this whole question of the child and the child's position in this situation, we must not, at the same time, forget the dilemma of the young girl&mdash;usually young girl&mdash;who has had the child, who is the natural mother of the child, and the difficulties she has experienced in the past to a much greater extent.  We have become very much more understanding of this problem in the last 15 or 20 years.  We had the introduction by the previous Government of the support for the unmarried <Col N="1074" /> mother, which was an advance, a progressive and radical step in its own way in our kind of society.  Obviously there are overtones in relation to the recognition of illegitimacy which are much less intense than they were.  The fact that the girl at least had some kind of support from the State, was recognised as being somebody who had a social problem, and that the community got together to try and help her deal with that social problem in hard financial terms was an advance.  But it still leaves the girl with her emotional problem.</P>
    <P>That is the aspect of this about which there is considerable difference of opinion&mdash;the parental rights, parental rights whether it is an unmarried mother or parents who neglect their children, the right of the natural parents, the emotional difficulty of a girl who is having a baby and who is under what must be the intolerable pressure of the ordeal of facing society.  Unfortunately we are still censorial about this kind of thing happening in society, more now in rural areas than in urban ones, where it can be concealed to some extent.  We are still censorial about it.  The girl then has the physical problem of her job or occupation&mdash;possibly she has parental disapproval&mdash;and all these other practical problems she faces which tend to make her feel that the correct decision to take is to get rid of the child at all costs to a loving home.  There are, of course, plenty of loving homes with adoptive parents. Superficially at any rate it is the easy and the obvious thing to do.</P>
    <P>In my experience&mdash;and naturally as a doctor one comes up against this kind of thing relatively frequently&mdash;it is remarkable how difficult it is for the girl at the time.  All the arguments are in favour of a good, stable home, a loving relationship, assured prospects of education, protected upbringing, the dilemma of trying to do the best thing for the child, the difficulty of making a decision, a hard-headed, cool decision in the midst of the business of the delivery and all the rest associated with it, even for the married mother, and then deciding what is best for the child.</P>
    <P>Superficially what is best for the child is to have it taken into adoption.  But it is <Col N="1075" /> remarkable how difficult it can be, in some cases, for a girl to make up her mind about whether she should put the child into adoption.  You are then faced with the question of how long should she be given&mdash;a peremptory sort of word to use&mdash;but how long should she take or should she be permitted by the State to wonder about this very serious problem. In some cases when it comes to giving away the child she simply cannot be separated from it.  Therefore the State has to decide&mdash;this I imagine will be one of the Minister's problems&mdash;we have to decide at what stage do we intervene in accordance with part 2.  Do we, the State, intervene and, while acknowledging the family as the social unit, try to take a decision that the girl cannot, for one reason or another, in our view, bring up the child?  If I were faced with this problem I would imagine that would be a decision I would not like to have to take.  Obviously that is something we shall have to think about and on which we will have to come to some decision: should the girl be allowed to keep the child for six months or a year?  In order to come to terms with their problem, if one does allow that space of time, one then comes over to another side of it&mdash;the side I would see as a psychologist or psychiatrist&mdash;the problem of the psycho-dynamics of personality formation and the parental relationship.</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult problem about which nobody is very sure&mdash;the importance of the parent or the surrogate parent at the time of the birth and for the first six months or year, or five, ten or fifteen years.  It is interesting to recall that, at a certain stage, they used to take the child away from the mother for a period after the birth of the child.  They then changed their minds completely and they decided that under no circumstances, for emotional reasons in respect of the child, should the child be taken away from the mother at all after birth because it might damage the child. Therefore, if that can happen in the first 48 hours or three or four days of a child's life try and extrapolate that to a situation in which the adoption period is delayed six months, or a year, or longer: what damage is done to the child's personality, <Col N="1076" /> how long should the mother be given and how do you protect the rights of the child in that sort of situation?  One comes up against the conflict there, which Deputy Desmond recognised, and with which she tried to deal in her own submission&mdash;the inalienable right of the parent and then the prior rights of the child which we are trying to establish under this Bill.</P>
    <P>To some extent I have some sympathy with the Minister because I feel that there is this great conflict.  Because part of my job for some years was the care of youngsters who were put into institutions and who, for that reason, grew up with total emotional deprivation and in that way ended up as various forms of sociopaths and psychopaths of one kind or another I am afraid I would tend to lean over towards the prior rights of the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to thank you and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the adjournment what to me is a very important matter indeed.  I want to emphasise that I am raising this matter not because I am a member of the visiting committee, and any opinions I give here will be my own and not those of the visiting committee or anyone else. The idea of military custody in the first instance is repugnant to me.  I believe it is also repugnant to our people, that ordinary civilian prisoners should be held in military custody at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was introduced here and approved by the House before my time.  I understand it was in 1972 that either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;came in here and got the approval of the House for the transfer of prisoners from Mountjoy to military custody on the Curragh.  There had been a riot in Mountjoy and serious damage had been done to a large section of the prison and it was necessary as a temporary measure to transfer some prisoners to military custody.  It was a new procedure and it affected only a certain type of prisoner. They were those prisoners who claimed <Col N="1077" /> some sort of political motivation.  No one anticipated&mdash;I was a public representative even though I was not in this House&mdash;that this would become a permanent feature of our prison system. Certainly I did not expect that it would.  I believe that the holding of civilian prisoners in military custody is unique in western democracies and so the situation here is unique.</P>
    <P>When a defendant is convicted of an offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment by our courts he is then placed in the custody and under the care of the Minister for Justice.  Civilian prisoners transferred to military custody cease to be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and he has no say in the day-to-day workings of the military prison in which they are held.  This is most unsatisfactory.  I doubt if it is satisfactory from the point of view of either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence.  It is unsatisfactory from the point of view of those who have to look after these prisoners.  They did not join the defence forces to become prison warders.  They joined for the specific purpose of defending our country from an aggressor or to help the United Nations, or some other body, in peace keeping operations.  Those who have engaged in this work have done an excellent job and we can rightly be proud of their achievements at home and abroad.  It was never their intention in joining the army to become prison warders but, as good army men always do, they obey orders and do what they are told.  They do not want to be any part of the prison warder system.  They do not say that because they are disciplined and obey orders.  They neither crib nor criticise.</P>
    <P>The prison on the Curragh is not a suitable building for long-term prisoners. It is small.  The cells are not the kind in which a prisoner should be expected to spend five, six, seven or ten years.  The function of a prison is to rehabilitate. Rehabilitation is impossible in the Curragh detention centre because the buildings are so unsatisfactory.  Originally every prisoner there claimed political motivation in the crimes he committed.  Now only three or four out <Col N="1078" /> of a possible 27 or 28 prisoners claim to have any political motivation.  The majority are ordinary run-of-the-mill criminals who were convicted in our courts and who should be under the control of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>There are fewer than 30 prisoners in the Curragh at the moment.  It is not easy to provide the kind of facilities in the Curragh essential to the rehabilitation of long-term prisoners.  Rehabilitation could more easily be carried out in the larger prisons at the disposal of the Minister.  I do not claim to know a great deal about the facilities available in other prisons but I am led to believe that there is ample accommodation in our ordinary civilian prisons for these prisoners in the Curragh.  The reason for their incarceration there no longer exists.  A new prison has been built in Dublin and I believe there is space available in Portlaoise where these prisoners could very easily be accommodated.  I believe that the present inmates of the Curragh prison have been transferred there from other prisons because they were giving particular trouble to the authorities.  This is not as it should be, and the Minister should examine the matter.</P>
    <P>The facilities necessary for the rehabilitation of long-term prisoners are not provided at the Curragh.  I agree that there have been some improvements.  I understand that the Minister is trying to provide more equipment in the gymnasium used by the prisoners.  The exercise space is too small for the 30 prisoners there, taking into account that the prisoners would be living in a confined area for a long time.  Most of them are long-term prisoners.  We have been told by people who know better than I that there are psychiatric problems. Some of the prisoners had these problems before they arrived, but I would not be surprised to learn that prisoners develop these problems within a very short time of their arrival.</P>
    <P>The time has now come for the State to provide civilian accommodation in civilian prisons equipped with proper facilities and staffed by trained prison personnel There may have been an excuse for detention in military custody, but we must now realise that it is not truly democratic to hold normal civilian <Col N="1079" /> prisoners in military custody.  The facilities at the Curragh are not up to the standard which I as an ordinary individual feel is necessary for the rehabilitation of people serving sentences of eight or ten years.</P>
    <P>There are problems for people wishing to visit their relatives at the Curragh. These problems concern the location and do not arise because of the staff there.  I understand that the Prisoners' Rights Association run a bus from Cork, stopping at Portlaoise, the Curragh and Dublin.  The Curragh is a small prison and it is said that the visiting facilities are adequate for the small number of prisoners.  I understand that the governor and staff of the prison facilitate visitors coming from Cork by extending the normal entitlement, which is half an hour, to an hour.  Visits are allowed between 10 a.m. and noon and between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. but visitors frequently find difficulty in getting transport from the Curragh.  It is not a suitable location. The relatives of prisoners should have a regular transport service to and from the place where prisoners are held.  They should have the facilities which are available in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and, to a lesser extent, Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>I am not making a party political point.  I put this case to the former Government during debates on the Estimate for the Department of Defence and I asked that the military prison be closed.  I was a member of a visiting committee which unanimously decided to ask that the prison be closed. I have been consistent in this matter.  I did not speak about reports until they were published.  They are now public property, and I ask the Minister in the name of humanity to give these prisoners the same rights as other civilian prisoners.</P>
    <P>During a television interview on this matter I was asked why people should not be held in military custody.  I asked the interviewer what he would say if all prisons were closed down and the prisoners were transferred to military camps.  I do not think anyone would accept that.  I ask the Minister to give an undertaking that the civilian prison at the Curragh will be closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prisons Act, 1972, as extended by the Prisons Acts of 1974 and 1977, empowers the Minister for Justice to transfer prisoners from civilian prisons to military custody and vice versa.  The present Act is effective until May 1980.</P>
      <P>I accept that approval for this military prison, as he calls it, at the Curragh was given before Deputy Bermingham became a Member of the House, but I would remind the Deputy that my predecessor extended that Act in 1974 and in May 1977.  Deputy Bermingham and his colleagues supported the then Minister in seeing to it, even as late as May 1977, that this military prison would be with us until 1980.</P>
      <P>Firstly I would like to publicly thank the Army for coming to the aid of the civil authorities to help out in the chronic situation with regard to prison facilities which has been allowed to develop over the years.</P>
      <P>The need for military custody arose following a riot in Mountjoy Prison on the nights of 18 and 19 May 1972 when very serious damage was caused to the prison.  At that time it was found necessary to remove 180 prisoners and, as the other civil prisons could not then accommodate all of them, the Minister for Defence agreed to accommodate up to 40 of them in the military detention barracks at the Curragh Camp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputy Bermingham was not here at the time, but if he has any free time at some stage he would do well to read the Dáil debates of that time.  From the commencement of the operation of the Act transfers to military custody have been arranged to isolate from the civil prison system persons requiring a high degree of security or persons who promoted or actively engaged in seriously disruptive activities. There were 27 persons in military custody on 4 October 1978 and most of them were considered unsuitable for detention in the civil prisons because of their past disruptive record and their known capacity to foment disruption. None of us would want to see this particular military prison in the Curragh continued.  None of us want that.  Indeed, none of us would be proud of it.  In helping us, the Army are often held up to <Col N="1081" /> ridicule by those whose aim it is to cause disruption within the prison service from the outside.</P>
    <P>There is a need to isolate a small number of dangerous and disruptive prisoners from the civil prisons lest they disrupt the running of the prisons and possibly give rise to riots such as the one I have already described.  This is likely to continue for some time.  However, if they are to be dealt with within the civil prison system the only practical thing to do is to provide a special purpose-built, high-security prison.  The intention had been to build such a prison within the perimeter walls of Portlaoise Prison, but because of the security situation there since the transfer of the subversive prisoners there in November 1973, this plan was shelved.  Unfortunately no effort whatsoever was made by the Government of the day&mdash;and I am not saying that for any political reason&mdash;to provide the necessary secure civil prison that would, if something had been done about it then, be in operation now and there would be no need for the military prison in the Curragh.  It is my intention to proceed as rapidly as possible with the planning of such a secure prison to cater for the type of prisoner now being catered for in the Curragh.  I would like to assure the Deputy and the House that this is a matter of high priority.</P>
    <P>With regard to military custody and hospitalisation it is the practice, when subversive prisoners in Portlaoise require hospitalisation, to transfer them to the general military hospital in the Curragh for the simple reason that ordinary civilian hospitals are reluctant to treat them because of the disruption which would result from the attendant security measures.  However, even if the hospitals were willing to treat them it would be extremely difficult to ensure an acceptably safe level of security.  I say therefore quire deliberately that it might be necessary to continue military custody to cater for subversive prisoners requiring hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>Indeed, when this Bill was introduced by my predecessor, Senator Cooney in May 1977, he said that there was a continuing need to separate from the civil <Col N="1082" /> prison system prisoners who promoted or actively engaged in serious disruptive activities.  He said this was necessary in order to maintain relative calm and peace in the civil prisons and so enable rehabilitative work to continue without hindrance.  He was referring in particular to prisoners who had shown clearly that they are prepared to foment disruption in the civil prisons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>He was referring to the subversive prisoners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he described them as Prisoners' Rights Organisation persons.  He stated that the long-term solution to this problem was to build a high security prison unit for this small group of prisoners but plans for this unit, as I said, have not materialised.  As far as I was concerned and as far as my party were concerned we publicly stated then that we were not opposing this Bill, but at that time I questioned the need for the measure in view of the existence of what was then known as the new security prison at the Curragh.  I am on record in this House in May 1977 as suggesting to my predecessor that perhaps this new high security prison at the Curragh could be operated under civilian control.  Unfortunately since this was a high security prison we were not allowed to see it.  Nobody knew anything about it.  We now find that it is not a high security prison.  It is not a security prison.  It is a bit of a shambles, to say the very least of it.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there are difficulties in the Curragh.  I assure the Deputy and the House that there is no room in Portlaoise for these prisoners.  There is no prison in Dublin that could accommodate them because of the type of security that is required.  I say to the Deputy and to the House, with all honesty and sincerity, that until such time as the new high security unit which it had been hoped would be built within the perimeter walls of Portlaoise is provided I see little hope of closing down the Curragh prison, much as I would want to.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 October, 1978.</P>

This review inevitably encompasses all grades of staff required, including auxiliaries, and it includes the question of the development of specialist dental services, including orthodontics. The creation of a post of orthodontist under the Midland Health Board was deferred pending further progress with that review.</P>
      <P>Oral surgery services are available in Ballinasloe as well as in Dublin for patients from the Laois-Offaly area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a vacancy for one permanent <Col N="950" /> whole-time dental surgeon in Laois/Offaly. This post was advertised by the Local Appointments Commission on 27 September 1978, with a closing date for receiving completed application forms on 16 November 1978.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are claims before the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board for a review of grading structures and for additional renumeration for dental officers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state, in respect of the Midland Health Board area, the location of an operating theatre for dental treatment and anaesthetic facilities; the number of hopital beds for dental patients in the area; if he is aware that anaesthetic facilities are inadequate at Portlaoise hospital, and non-existent at Tullamore; and if he considers this state of affairs to be satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Facilities for dental treatment under general anaesthetic are available in Mullingar and Portlaoise general hospitals and in the district hospital in Athlone. The facilities in Portlaoise are not entirely satisfactory but the development of a second operating theatre which is currently under construction will enable improvements to be made.  Patients from the Tullamore area requiring treatment under general anaesthetic are currently treated in Athlone or Ballinasloe.  I understand that a new health centre which is under construction in Tullamore will incorporate facilities for providing treatment under general anaesthesia.  Accordingly, I expect that the position should improve substantially in the near future.</P>
      <P>There are no hospital beds for in-patient dental treatment in the Midland Health Board area.  This is a reflection of the very small number of patients who require such treatment and for whom special arrangements are made by the board on an individual basis.</P>

      <P>I am aware that considerable delays are being experienced by eligible persons in obtaining dental treatment in Laois-Offaly, in common with other areas throughout the country.  The options available to improve the situation generally are currently the subject of an in-depth review of the public dental service.</P>
      <P>I understand that patients in St. Fintan's hospital who are in need of dental treatment are attended by a visiting dentist while patients in other hospitals are treated by the board's dental staff in the nearest dental clinic or, where necessary, within the hospital.</P>
      <P>Eligible persons with medical conditions relevant to their dental treatment are treated by the board's dental staff or are referred to specialist dental practitioners upon consultant medical advice, where necessary.</P>
      <P>There are no special arrangements for the treatment of the mentally and physically handicapped who are, however, regarded as a priority group by the board.</P>
      <P>There are no in-patient dental facilities in the Midland Health Board area in view of the small number of patients requiring such treatment, for whom individual arrangements are made by the board.</P>

      <P>Fluoride concentrations in piped water supplies are monitored by a combination of colorimetric tests carried out daily and distillation tests, carried out at intervals not exceeding four weeks.</P>
      <P>Difficulty was experienced in obtaining fluoride acid in early 1976 and adequate supplies of acid were not available for water supplies fluoridated in Laois-Offaly until the middle of that year.  The distillation test results made available to my Department in respect of these supplies for the latter half of 1976 and for 1977 show that a reasonably satisfactory level of fluoridation was maintained. The number of results submitted to my Department in respect of 1978 is limited but those submitted show a reasonable level of fluoridation is being maintained.</P>
      <P>I have encouraged health boards to ensure, in consultation with the local authorities concerned, that other water supplies suitable for fluoridation are equipped as resources permit.  I understand that plans are being prepared to fluoridate water supplies to Edenderry.  I have no proposals before me for the fluoridation of other water supplies in the area.</P>

      <P>The provision of the transmitter network for RTE 2 is a big task and has had to be undertaken in phases. Technical considerations dictated that the main transmitting stations should be provided first.  This approach also has the advantage that service will be provided for the greatest possible number of viewers in the single channel area from the inauguration of RTE 2. For operational reasons provision has also been made to provide RTE 2 transposers from the outset at a number of low powered stations in Mayo, Clare, Kerry, Cork and Waterford.  The service will be available to 90 per cent of the population initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE say that detailed planning for the extension of RTE 2 to the remaining parts of the country will commence as <Col N="957" /> soon as possible.  Priority will be given in this phase to single channel areas where transposers have been provided for the first television service.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when it is intended to provide an automatic rural telephone exchange in the following places: Ballyheane, Castlebar; Islandeady, Castlebar; Glenisland, Castlebar; Killyvalley, Westport; Glenamoy, Ballina; Pohanny; Achill, Westport, County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>Telephone subscribers in the Islandeady and Glenisland areas already have automatic service from the Castlebar exchange.  Provision of separate automatic exchanges in these two places would not be warranted.  It is expected that Westport exchange, which also serves Killavally, will be converted to automatic working in 1980.</P>
      <P>There is neither a post office nor a telephone exchange in Pohanny.  Polranny may be the place the Deputy has in mind.  Polranny is served by Achill Sound exchange and it is expected that Achill Sound exchange will be converted to automatic working in 1980 assuming early completion of the legal formalities for acquisition of a site.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give a reliable forecast at this stage for conversion to automatic working of the manual exchanges at Ballyhean or Glenamoy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the amount of money expected to be paid out in 1978 for cattle headage payments; and the total amount that could be paid under EEC legislation for the headage scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that about £19 million will be paid during the current year <Col N="958" /> as compensatory allowances for livestock under the EEC directive relating to cattle headage payments schemes.  This amount covers part of the payments in respect of 1978 and balances of payments in respect of 1977, 1976 and 1975.  Because of this time span and the fact that rates of allowances have changed from year to year, it is not practicable to calculate what is the maximum amount that could be paid in any particular year.  However, the minimum allowance applicable from 1 January 1978 under the EEC directive is £12.20 per livestock unit and the maximum is £39.57.  Our current rates of allowances are £17 for each of the first eight livestock units and £12 for each of the next 22 units under the cattle headage payments scheme in severely handicapped areas and £17 for each of the first ten cows and £12 per cow for each of the next 18 cows under the beef cow scheme in the less disadvantaged areas.</P>

The cost has been computed in this instance by breaking down into weekly expenditure the total expenditure from the Prisons Vote and an estimate of relevant expenditure from other Votes in the period up to the end of August last and dividing the weekly expenditure by the daily average prison population during the period.  Expenditure on capital services has not been taken into account. On the foregoing basis, the answer to the question is £137 per week.  The estimated cost of a week's stay for a boy in Loughan House will depend on the number of boys committed there and cannot be estimated at present.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for the Environment if it is a fact that local authority engineers are working to rule, or going slow, arising out of a dispute with his Department; and if he appreciates the immediate disruptive effects this is having on the local services concerned, and on employment giving schemes; the steps he is taking to resolve the dispute at once; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>A claim for increased salaries for local authority engineers is at present being processed at conciliation level through the local authorities conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The most recent meeting of the conciliation committee consisting of representatives of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and representatives of the staff panel was on Friday, 20 October 1978.  Conciliation proceedings are confidential under the scheme and I do not wish to <Col N="967" /> comment further on the other matters at this stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will explain the very substantial difference between the amount of money shown in reply to Question No. 491 of 18 April 1978 and Question No. 405 of 25 April 1978 in relation to the amount of money required by each local authority for small dwelling acquisition for the year 1978.</P>

      <P>The estimated requirements of local authorities for house purchase loans in 1978, as shown in reply to Question No. 405 of 25 April 1978, were prepared by the authorities at the end of 1977 in the light of the expenditure they considered would arise as a result of the increase in the loan and income limits to £7,000 and £3,500 respectively, which were notified to them on 28 July 1977, and which had generated increased inflows of applications.</P>
      <P>During the first half of 1978 it became clear to most local authorities that, due mainly to the time lag between loan approval and payment, the amount originally sought would not be required and these authorities consequently reduced their estimates to those shown in column (1) of reply to Question No. 491 of 18 October 1978.</P>

These funds are augmented by grants from the Department of Education but no specific portion of the grant is earmarked for the employment of youth officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desired to point out that section 26 of the Local Government Act (No. 9 of 1955) amended section 2 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, (No. 39 of 1926) by, <i>inter alia</i>, the deletion of &ldquo;or technical&rdquo; in that paragraph.  Accordingly, it is not correct to say that section 2 (<i>b</i>) of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, states that all employees with technical qualifications must be employed in the officer grade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">

      <P>As the child in question is now over ten <Col N="980" /> years of age and resides less than three miles from the school, she is no longer eligible for free transport under the terms of the school.  The vehicle operating the service to Croghan national school is currently catering for a capacity complement and it is not therefore possible to offer this particular child fare-paying facilities in the current school year.</P>
