      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 3, 6 (resumed) and 7, in No. 7 Votes 40, 44, 37, 38, 47, 49 and 29.  I will intervene at 12 noon to make a statement on the European Council meeting on Monday and Tuesday of this week.</P>

      <P>When is it proposed to publish the White Paper and when is it proposed to have the EMS debate as promised?  I understand the Taoiseach is making a statement on the European Council meeting today.  But the time remaining after the normal time for the adjournment up to Christmas is quite short and we would need to know the Taoiseach's intentions with regard to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated publicly that there would be a debate on the EMS next week.  I am not in a position yet to indicate how long the Dáil is likely to sit. If there was an agreement that we should finish our sittings by the end of next week I would suggest that we have the adjournment debate in conjunction with the EMS debate, if there was a desire for an adjournment debate.  This matter could be arranged by the Whips. In that event, because of business that would have to be taken on Tuesday, possibly a start could be made on Wednesday morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the present position regarding our possible entry into the EMS?  It is very difficult at this stage to know what precisely the Government's attitude is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be making a statement on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but it is very pertinent to the question of whether we have a full scale debate next week before the Government have made up their mind as to whether we are going in. Will the Government again state that as they are still in a negotiating position it would inhibit discussion here and would inhibit the Taoiseach from being more forthcoming than one would wish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to answer the question from Deputy FitzGerald.  It is hoped to publish a paper as early as possible next week&mdash;I hope Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Combining the two debates is totally unacceptable and quite improper.  The debate on the EMS is an immensely important debate.  If despite all that has happened in Brussels there remains a possibility that we might enter at some stage, in the light of some modification of terms or without them, this must be discussed in the Dáil separately.  It would be inconceivable that Parliament would discuss this as part of an adjournment debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not possible to have it with the adjournment debate next week it would have to be debated during the week up to Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be the case, depending on the time table of the EMS debate.  We understood that the other White Paper on the economy was to be published on either 6 or 8 December.  What is the position about <Col N="947" /> that and when will the debate take place on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say exactly when it will be published.  The Deputy will appreciate that because of other pressures it was not possible to make the progress on the White Paper that we had intended, but it will certainly be published before Christmas.  That would not permit a debate on it before Christmas seeing that we could have two other major debates.  The Deputy will certainly have it before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if it is published before the adjournment of the Dáil the debate could be included in the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not want other things included in the adjournment debate.  He can not have everything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>During an adjournment debate surely the White Paper which was promised by the Government for early autumn would be a very desirable input into that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain if we can publish it in time for a debate next week or the week after.  I hope it will be published before Christmas, but whether it would be feasible to have a debate on it before Christmas is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disturbing that it was to be published in the autumn and it is in doubt even at the end of December. It is not clear why the EMS discussion should have caused that delay.  If through the failure of the Government to produce it in time it is not available for the adjournment debate, can I take it that we will have an option to debate the White Paper at the beginning of the next session and that we will not be told then that it is to be taken with the budget? This sweeping of everything under different carpets is not a satisfactory procedure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has had some experience of publishing White and Green Papers.  The Deputy will remember that we had to wait from year to year, and not just for a month or so, for the publication of a paper like this.  I am sure that the Deputy, appreciating the difficulties, will understand that we have some small problems but that there is no question but that the paper will be published before Christmas.</P>

      <P>The interruptions did not come from there.  Another question was asked before the Taoiseach was able to answer and that confused the issue. This is an important question which the Taoiseach was in the process of answering. I would be grateful if the Taoiseach would complete the answer in relation to having the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped to have the White Paper published before Christmas.  But, even if it is, it is unlikely that a debate will take place on it.  In that event the debate will have to take place in the new year.  I will consider then whether it will be possible to divorce the debate on the White Paper from the budget debate.  I will accommodate Deputies opposite to the fullest possible extent that time will permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach just happens to be in charge of the Order of Business.  It is possible to separate the two if the Taoiseach holds the White Paper debate before the budget.  Then, obviously, the budget cannot get confused with the White Paper.  That means that the Dáil would have to return a couple of days earlier than it would otherwise do.</P>

      <P>It would be helpful if the Ceann Comhairle occasionally looked in that direction because that is where the trouble is coming from.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable to say that the two can be divorced if we have the White Paper debate before the budget debate. Therefore, the only question is: will the Dáil, if necessary, meet a couple of days earlier to have the White Paper debate, which it is essential to have before we get mixed up in the budget?  The budget is a short term matter for one year whereas the White Paper relates to a period of years and should, if there is anything in it at all, deserve full and proper debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I wish to inform the House that my Party are opposed to section 10 and will oppose it all the way.  Since local government was first introduced there was a sort of partnership between the elected representatives and, in later years, between the county managers and the Custom House.  As a result, we found that local authority councils worked very well in the interests of the people whom they were elected to serve. Ministers for Local Government had a supervisory role in regard to the actions and business of local councils.  They had the power to remove members of councils from office if they refused to carry out their statutory functions.  The record shows that it was rarely necessary for a Minister to invoke that statutory power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for one famous occasion.</P>

    <Col N="953" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It happened more than once.  It was invariably invoked if the council did not strike sufficient rates to enable them to discharge their statutory functions in the year ahead.  The occasions on which it was found necessary since the foundation of the State for Minister to use their statutory powers to remove members of councils from office could be counted on the fingers of one hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole scene will be changed if section 10 becomes law.  It will spell the end of local government as we know it. The members of local authorities will become rubber stamps.  They will have no functions to perform.  They will simply be told by the Minister how much finance to raise for a specific year.  In telling them how much finance they can raise, he will be telling them what they can do and will be limiting their discretion and powers.  As a matter of fact, he may not even tell them what rate they can strike or what estimate they can agree upon.  In fact, he has not done that this year.  We find that the regulations provide that local authorities should strike a rate to provide finance for the following year between 23 November and 31 December.  That was the normal procedure with councils.  The preparation of a rate and of an estimate is a complicated business which usually takes the councils a couple of meetings to fulfil.  A number of councils have estimates committees which sit on occasions with the help of professional people such as county managers, county secretaries, county engineers and so on. We get some sort of an idea what will happen if section 10 becomes law.  In anticipation of section 10, we find that last year and this year the Minister for the Environment withheld from councils information about his intentions in regard to their estimates for the coming year until the very last minute.  We are in the dying days of 1978 and we find that no county council, as far as I know, have yet held an estimates meeting.  They have not done so because they have been instructed by the Minister for the Environment not to do so.  Cavan County Council had fixed their estimates meeting for the 19th of this month but I understand <Col N="954" /> they have postponed it until the New Year.  Though I cannot say with certainty that it has been postponed on the direction of the Minister, I understand that is so.  Up to the end of this year councils did not know the kind of programmes they will have, which schemes they will be putting into operation, how much money they will have to spend, how many men they will be able to employ and how many they will be forced to let go.</P>
    <P>That is a sample of the procedures that will be adopted by the Minister if the House is foolish enough to pass section 10.  That is bad enough, but we know that the Minister last year directed that local authority estimates would be confined to an increase of 11 per cent on the previous year, and the result is that many councils are very scarce of cash to carry out the programmes laid down for this year.  It is only shame and fear of public reaction that have prevented local authorities from dismissing workmen who were being kept on on overdrafts&mdash;nobody seems to know where the money is coming from but there seems to have been a direction: &ldquo;Do not let any men go until after Christmas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinary section.  The sidenote states: &ldquo;Power of limitation with regard to local authority finance&rdquo;, and subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by a direction given to a local authority in writing require the authority, in relation to a local financial year specified in the direction, to limit in such manner as is specified in the direction all or any one or more of the amounts required by section 9 (1) of the Act of 1955 to be shown in the authority's estimate of expenses for the local financial year so specified.</P>
    <P>It is noticeable that for the first time, as far as I know, the Minister for Finance is being introduced.  He is to monitor, and be seen to monitor and to have a statutory role in monitoring the activities of local authorities.  The Minister for the Environment is to be given power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to direct local authorities to limit the <Col N="955" /> amounts required under the 1955 Act. We all know that the Department of Finance are very far removed from the local scene, particularly in regard to such things as local improvement schemes and other requirements of small rural communities.</P>

      <P>(2) The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by a direction given in writing to a local authority which is a rating authority, and so given before the adoption by the authority of an estimate of expenses relating to the local financial year specified in the direction, require that as regards that local financial year&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the aggregate of the rates required by section 10 (4) (c) of the Act of 1955 to be determined by the authority shall be limited by reference to an amount or in such other manner as may be so specified,</P>
      <P>(b)  any rate which is so required to be determined shall not exceed a limit specified in the direction in relation thereto by reference to an amount or to such other matter as may be so specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is not tantamount to taking away all control from local authorities, I do not know what it is.  I know Deputy Callanan does not agree, but he will agree that if local authorities are not allowed to provide money they cannot have authority.  This was not spelled out in the portion of the Fianna Fáil manifesto which promised abolition of rates on private houses.  We know that a big <Col N="957" /> amount of finance is still being raised locally because farmers with valuations of more than £20 are still paying rates as well as owners of business premises. Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>In case the Minister gives a direction under this section the following provisions shall apply:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Paragraph (b) reads:</P>
      <P>in case the direction is a direction referred to in subsection (2) of this section,</P>
      <P>(i) the direction may authorise the authority, for the purpose of complying with the direction, to amend the demand of the commissioners of a town in relation to the local financial year specified in the direction and made under section 26 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1946,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the town commissioners are to be ignored totally.  In the old days if a local authority failed to provide a <Col N="958" /> proper estimate, the estimate that the Minister of the day considered adequate to enable them to discharge their statutory functions, an inspector was sent down to inquire into the situation and after an inquiry a decision would be taken as to whether to remove the authority from office.  But that will not happen any more.  Under this section the Minister will tell a county council what rate to strike and if they fail to strike that rate there will not be an inquiry as to whether they were right or wrong.  Consequently, they will not be removed from office but they will be ignored and treated with the greatest contempt because the rate that will become the rate for that year will be the one that the Minister told them to strike.  In these circumstances I do not know how any self-respecting person will be willing to serve on local authorities.  In the event of the Minister striking a rate, although the body who failed to strike the rate will be allowed continue in existence, their only function will be to talk but they will not be listened to.  I say this because paragraph (c) provides that:</P>
    <P>in case the direction is a direction referred to in subsection (1) of this section and, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, the requirement of that paragraph is not complied with by the authority, the adoption by the authority of an estimate of expenses for the local financial year so specified shall not be thereby invalidated but such estimate shall be construed as if for any amount therein contained which is not in accordance with the requirements of the direction there were substituted the maximum amount permissible having regard to the limit specified in the direction or in case more than one limit is so specified, the relevant limit so specified,</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of the same subsection provides that:</P>
    <P>(d) in case the direction is a direction referred to in the said subsection (2) and, notwithstanding the said paragraph (a), the requirement of that paragraph is not complied with by the <Col N="959" /> authority, the determination of the rate or rates to which the direction relates shall not be thereby invalidated but such determination shall have effect as if for the amount of such rate, or of the aggregate of such rates, or of each of such rates, as the case may require, there were substituted therefor an amount equal to the maximum amount permissible having regard to the limit specified in the direction, or in the case more than one limit is so specified, the relevant limit so specified.</P>
    <P>Those two paragraphs mean that a direction is given to the local authority, be it Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation or any other local authority as to what rate they are to strike, as to how much money they are to provide for all their services, non-statutory as well as statutory.  If the authority do not comply with that direction they will be totally ignored and the rate will be struck from the Custom House.  As I see it this is the end of local government as we know it but in addition it is treating with the utmost contempt those decent men and women who, in a voluntary capacity, offer their services to local communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that he is not imposing any limit on local authorities, that they have discretion in regard to spending the money he will give them. But this is the same as giving a man 50 pence and telling him to spend it either on a breakfast or on a tea.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The next part of the section that I am coming to constitutes the county manager, the tachograph, or as lorry-drivers call it, the spy in the cab. Section 10(3) (e) says:</P>
      <P>(e) it shall be the duty of the manager&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) before the adoption by the authority of an estimate of expenses relating to the local financial year specified in the direction, to prepare for the authority a statement indicating the effect of the direction in relation to such estimate,</P>
      <P>There is not going to be any talk between the county manager and his concillors as to what would be a reasonable amount to spend this year, what schemes to proceed with, what amenities are to be provided, how much will be spent on by-roads and secondary roads, how much is to be spent on house repairs and that sort of thing.  That is not going to be the sort of consultation or discussion that will take place between the manager and the authority.  No, the manager will introduce the estimates meeting&mdash;if they are foolish enough to hold one any more&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen, I have received a notification from the Minister for the Environment that this is what the rate in the £ cannot exceed this year&rdquo;. The Minister was cheeseparing a few minutes ago and saying that he will not be telling them what rate to strike and he will not strike the rate, but he will be very sure to say, &ldquo;This far shalt thou go and no further.  This is the rate which you cannot exceed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section continued:</P>
      <P>(ii) in case the direction is not complied with, as soon as may be to certify in writing to the Minister the extent by which any limit specified in the direction is exceeded, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will be step two.  The county manager will tell them what the Minister's direction is, the maximum rate that may be struck and if that is exceeded, <Col N="962" /> back to the Custom House again, he will report that the council have disobeyed the great man's order.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (iii) states:</P>
    <P>(iii) where the provisions of paragraph (d) of this subsection apply, as soon as may be to amend the relevant estimate of expenses adopted by the authority so as to make it consistent with the direction (which amendment the manager is hereby authorised to make).</P>
    <P>The one power that the local authority members had up to date was to strike the rate.  It had been drilled into them down the years that they were to strike the rate.  Here the manager strikes the rate on the direction of the Minister.  He is the agent, the local authority tachograph for the Minister.  The section concludes:</P>
    <P>(4) This section shall be deemed to have come into force on the 1st day of November, 1977.</P>
    <P>The Minister&mdash;although he was very slow to bring this Bill into the House and those responsible for processing Bills were very slow to put it on the Order Paper or seek or get time for it&mdash;is operating as if it was law.  In one way we should be glad that we did have the opportunity of seeing how this section will work when it becomes law, because we have had the benefit of the Minister for the last year confining the expenditure of local authorities in 1978 to an increase of 11 per cent on the previous year right across the board, without any individual attention or assessment.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion here yesterday on the effect of another section of this Bill which will freeze valuations of houses at a portion of their total valuation, having regard to the remission of rates to which the hereditaments are entitled. In the course of that discussion we pointed out to the Minister that this would work a great hardship on some local authority areas because they had reached saturation stage for building, there were no more building sites and any new building that would be coming in would be coming in outside the local authority concerned.  The result would <Col N="963" /> be a serious loss in revenue in certain local authority areas.  The Minister said, &ldquo;That will not happen because I will look at these right across the board and we will make special provision for certain cases.&rdquo;  We know the provision that he made last year.  He blanketed the 11 per cent ceiling right across the country from Passage West to Buncrana without any individual assessment or any look at all.  Of course he did not impose the 11 per cent.  No Minister for the Environment in control of local authorities acting freely on his own discretion would do such a thing.  The Minister for Finance imposed it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what amount will be imposed this year.  We did have from the Minister recently in this House that the consideration is to be a budgetary consideration. The test will be not what local authority A requires to carry out their functions reasonably.  The test will be what the national Exchequer can afford and that will be divided up on a percentage basis between all the local authorities without any regard to the special requirements of any of them. That was not the method adopted by the Minister's predecessors, the Ministers for Local Government, when they were seeing to it that the local authorities struck a rate sufficient to carry out their functions.  The question then was not, &ldquo;What is the capacity of the ratepayer to pay?&rdquo;  It was not what the capacity of the farmer, the local authority tenant or the occupier of a house to pay.  His approach then was: what was a reassonable amount to enable a local authority to carry out their duties and responsibilities during the year?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, out of the mouth of the Minister for the Environment, that will not be the test any longer.  It will be the budgetary considerations and it does not matter if the Government act in a stupid manner and spend money here and there on all sorts of irresponsible schemes to get themselves into power.  If it is necessary to cut back on expenditure to repay that we will have a blanket cutback over the whole country and local authorities will be left with one hand as long as the other with nothing in the kitty.  The Minister <Col N="964" /> may laugh and he may try to cover it up but we have not yet reached the end of 1978 and many local authorities are not in a position to keep on the men they have on their pay rolls.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We will have a look at that. Subsection (1) provides that the Minister for the Environment may give a direction to a local authority limiting the amount of money that a local authority may raise by rates for the ensuing year. The effect of that will be to take away from local authorities the power they have always enjoyed to raise a reasonable amount of money to carry out reasonable schemes in their areas. This is the first time, as far as I know, that the Minister for Finance has been written into a local authority Bill in regard to rates.  The effect of that will be to take away all authority, discretion and independence from local authorities. Another effect of it will be that the right sort of people will cease to offer themselves at elections for membership of local authorities.  The result of this is that the power of local authorities will deteriorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) goes on to give to the Minister for the Environment authority to give other directions to the local authorities in regard to rates and estimates and to spell that out in greater detail.  Subsection (3) states that in case the Minister gives a direction under this section it shall be the duty of the local authorities to comply with the direction. They cannot tease the matter out with the Minister and they cannot have any discussion about it.  Paragraph (b) goes on to state that in case the direction is one referred to in subsection (2) of the section certain things will happen. Paragraphs (c) and (d) alarm me because if a county council strike a rate which exceeds the permitted limit they will not be consulted why they did that. The Minister for the Environment will not send down an inspector to check up <Col N="966" /> on the local position and see if there are any exceptional circumstances which would justify a higher rate.  The rate they have struck will simply be ignored and the permitted limit will become the rate.</P>
    <P>This subsection is the worst part of this objectionable section because there is no consultation.  It is beyond me how we can have local government without consultation between the manager and the council and between the manager and the Custom House.  It is hard to know when the direction will come down.  It will probably be some time after the beginning of the year for which the finance is required.  Once that direction comes down that is the ceiling.  If the ceiling is exceeded the excess is ignored and the ceiling becomes the rate.  That is very objectionable.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out in detail the obligations which will be placed on county managers to instruct the county councils at the beginning of the estimates meetings: &ldquo;This is what you can do.  This is the maximum you can have&rdquo;.  If they exceed that amount the manager has to report them to the Minister for the Environment and he has to change the rate. If this is not an insulting section that will discourage all self-respecting citizens from offering themselves as members of local authorities I do not know what it is. The Minister obviously wants to retain those county councils as talking shops to allow them to be used for political purposes but their duties as self-respecting members of local authorities are gone. When this section is fully understood it will have a very bad effect on local government at a time when it should be extended rather than killed off.  This party will oppose the section tooth and nail.</P>

      <P>I have been a Member of this House for five years and I have never heard anyone, even a Minister, speak for more than 20 minutes at a <Col N="967" /> time on Committee Stage.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has gone through the sections very well and dealt with them in detail but I still do not know the policy of the other side of the House on this Bill.  They removed health charges from rates and started the removal of rates on houses. They would not vote against the complete removal of rates on houses because they say they agree with it.</P>
      <P>The question is who pays the piper.  I had certain views about taking health charges off the rates because I felt that local authorities would not have as much say.  I had the same reservations about the removal of rates but I was in a minority.  Both sides of the House want to remove rates and the Coalition started that removal by taking away a certain amount.  Then there were crocodile tears on this side of the House about people who still have to pay rates.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is concerned in this matter.  When money has to be provided by the Exchequer it is necessary to have an estimate of how much will be required.  The Minister for the Environment must now provide a large percentage of the money for running local authorities.  That is agreed by all. How is he to do it?  He must ask the Minister for Finance for a certain amount of money.  The only people now paying rates are businessmen or farmers with a valuation in excess of £50.  When the Minister is providing the money he must have some control.</P>

Deputy Fitzpatrick is an excellent speaker and a good friend of mine, but I like to be candid and practical in my speeches.  There must be some idea at the beginning of the year as to the amount of money which will be needed by the Department from the Exchequer.  Any Minister must fight his case within the Government to get money from the Minister for Finance, who must be involved in this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since both parties on this side of the House have been specifically asked what their policy is in this regard, I would point out that our primary function on Committee Stage is to ensure in so far as it is possible that good legislation is made.  We have other forums for publishing policy and my party's policies have been published.</P>
      <P>Despite the attempts by the Minister and the Minister of State, and implicitly in the interventon by Deputy Callanan, to talk about this Bill as abolishing rates on domestic dwellings, that is not what the Bill is about.  This Bill concerns the nature of local taxation in our society. The abolition of rates on domestic dwellings is already a fact.  The Bill goes far beyond the question of rates on any kind of property, whether agricultural land or domestic dwellings.  It is the concern with that which motivates us throughout the entire Bill and specifically on section 10, on which we may relevantly spend much time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Minister must have some controls on this, otherwise there would be a free-for-all. It is suggested that this Minister is in the same position as the Minister for Agriculture who must get money from the Minister for Finance and, therefore, there must be some explicit reference in the Bill to the Minister for Finance.  I am not aware that the Minister for Agriculture has throughout the country a structure of public representation of people who, in the context of agriculture, seek election once every few years, and get a specific mandate from the public, operate a structure of local government which effectively dates from 1894, and pre-dates the very antecedents of this House, a structure which is an older form of democracy here and initially undertook a far wider range of services than this House aspired to undertake when it came into existence in 1918 with the formation of the first Dáil and effectively in 1922 with independence.  Over the years we have seen the steady and <Col N="970" /> slow erosion of the reserved functions of local authority members as the drift of power has been from the local area to the centre for all sorts of reasons.  It is my considered view that a local authority member now effectively only has two residual powers that are his otherwise uniquely and this section proposes to take one of them away.  The two powers are the reserved function of striking the rate with all the sanctions that were implicit in it and the possibility of being abolished, as we know has happened in the past, but nevertheless it is a reserved function.  The other one which is not relevant to this question is the question of making the development plan.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there are not many members from the other side, unlike Deputy Callanan, whose presence is welcome but who are members of local authorities and who have been members of local authorities for many years and who have far greater experience than either myself or Deputy Fitzpatrick and who know very well what the implications of section 10 are.  They are noticeable by their absence today but they are the people who will be voting in favour of the abolition of this power. They are people who will come in here when the Division Bell eventually goes and they will vote for this and they know very well what the implications of it are. The question has been asked, and legitimately asked, if central Government takes on to itself a greater degree of responsibility for direct financing of local expenditure surely it is reasonable that central Government must have some kind of sanction on the amount of money that is raised.  That is the core of the argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with this but it is a fact of life now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of reasonable question anybody would ask. The provisions in this Bill would be somewhat acceptable if the members of local authorities were not public representatives.  If we were talking about the financing of local tourism where people are either appointed or nominated but who are certainly not elected, who <Col N="971" /> are certainly not accountable to the ballot box, then such a provision would be reasonable.  If we were talking about any such regional body whether it is a development association or any other structure like that which is there to assist the Minister at central Government level in the performance of his or her duties, then some kind of Ministerial sanction over the amount of money expended by such a body would be reasonable and indeed proper and subject to the right kind of democratic control which this House must exercise.  But that is not the case with local democracy and that is not the case with local government such as it remains here.  We are dealing, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said at the outset, with people who are specifically elected.</P>
      <P>We could go on at considerable length about that but I want to ask a number of questions first for clarification so that I fully understand the provisions and all the implications of the provisions of this Bill.  First of all, in the very first line of section 10 which would be line 29 it is stated that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by a ...and so on.  Why must that clause be drafted into the section?  There may be a very good reason for it.  I do not know. But my reading of it is that the reality of it will be that it will not be by the consent of the Minister for Finance once this clause is here.  It will be by the direction of some principal officer in the Department of Finance who has no understanding of the position of the local authority.  That is my first question and that clause occurs a number of times and I would welcome clarification from the Minister on that point.</P>
      <P>I would like clarification from the Minister on another point which I feel I may not properly be reading or which is open to two interpretations.  It is on page 16, subsection 3 (b).  In the case of a local authority which has a subsidiary local authority, in other words, a town commissioner, and a demand from a town commissioner comes in which is in excess of the percentage increase which would be agreed by the Minister, the draft legislation goes on to say in paragraph (c) at lines 25, 26 and 27;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> ...of the direction there were substituted the maximum amount permissible having regard to the limit specified in the direction or in case more than one limit is so specified, the relevant limit so specified.</P>
    <P>Is that drafted in such a clear way that it can only relate to a situation where a local authority has a subsidiary body within it or, alternatively, could it be interpreted in some other way at some future date by an official in either the Department of Finance or in the Department of the Environment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What exactly is the point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is, could that section be interpreted in other ways.  I am not sure that I fully understand the section myself.  As I understand it now, if the Minister for the Environment sets a limit for a local authority percentage increase the position is quite clear.  But if, say, in county Galway, Tuam Town Commissioners come in with a demand which would in itself be in excess of the percentage limit what would be the position there?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am relating one to the other but it is all in the same section. Does the direction of limits concern itself only with the overall amount that a local authority would strike?  In other words does it mean only the town commissioners plus Galway county council, or could it possibly be interpreted, in lines 26 and 27 where the Minister has power to specify a limit or limits, that he could actually specify certain amounts of a local authority's rate to be limited and not other parts?  In other words can the Minister intervene directly in the breakdown of the specific budget of a local authority?  Perhaps we should get answers to those questions first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, at the outset of his contribution if I remember correctly, said that a person or anyone would be mad to vote in favour of this section.  I think that is the expression he used.  Quite obviously he and his party are going to vote against this section.  What voting against this section in effect means is that there should be absolutely no limit on rates; there should be a free-for-all, the sky the limit and it should be open to any local authority to strike a rate at whatever level they decide.  What he is saying, in effect, is that he is satisfied that the domestic sector, community halls, schools, and farm outhouses have had their rates removed from them.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is satisfied with that, but he is not satisfied that some protection should be made available to those who will continue to pay rates. Farmers and business people should not have any protection.  We on this side of the House gave an undertaking on derating and fulfilled that undertaking. We also gave a definite undertaking that the remaining rate paying sector would not be asked to carry an extra burden as a result of that, and we are abiding by that as well.  Less than 12 months ago we spent many hours discussing the Agricultural (Rates Relief) Grant Bill and every Deputy of the Labour and the Fine Gael Parties spoke and voted against it.  At that time we were giving a lower subsidy to the farming side.  Fine Gael opposed it tooth and nail because we were increasing the rate on the farmer.  Today Deputy Fitzpatrick wishes to increase the rate as if the sky was the limit and less than 12 months ago did not want it increased.</P>

      <P>The Deputy advocates that local authorities should be allowed do as they wish, and he opposes the fact that I will set an upper limit.  I do not direct any local authority as to the rate they should strike; I just set an upper limit in relation to how far they can go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the 11 per cent, which was the limit set last year, 16 local authorities did not require to go as far as <Col N="974" /> that limit.  Some of these local authorities were in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, one in Castleblaney and one in Clones, which is not too far from where Deputy Fitzpatrick was born. Now we have Deputy Fitzpatrick telling us for one hour that there should be no upper limit, that it should be whatever a local authority decide.  I hope that Deputy Fitzpatrick's candidates in the local election next June, when canvassing in Clones and Castleblaney where the upper limit of 11 per cent was not required, will tell the people that the council did not strike a high enough rate last year.  I trust that the Fine Gael candidates will make it clear that there should be no limit in relation to the rate that the local authority can strike, and that they feel it is wrong of me as Minister for the Environment to set an upper limit.  If Deputy Fitzpatrick and his candidates fail to tell this to the people, I will ensure that Fianna Fáil candidates will remind the people of what has been said here this morning.</P>

It is the Government's right to do this through the Minister for Finance.  With the consent of the Minister for Finance the necessary direction will go out to each local authority. There is nothing unusual about the consent of the Minister for Finance being involved. When Deputy Quinn is here for a while he will notice that practically every Bill that goes through this House which involves money requires the consent of the Minister for Finance who is the keeper of the finances.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I will make a statement to the House on the outcome of the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.  The meeting has not as yet led, as it normally does, to comprehensive conclusions set out by the President of the Council but I have laid before both Houses the two documents which have been made public, the resolution on the European Monetary System and the terms of reference for the &ldquo;Committee of Wise Men&rdquo;.  The discussions on the EMS and on the action necessary to strengthen the economies of the less prosperous countries took up almost the full two days of discussion in the formal meeting and very little time remained to consider other matters with which we were to deal.  However, before dealing with the EMS, I will refer briefly to the discussions that did take place on other topics.</P>

      <Col N="977" /> We discussed the proposal made by the French President that &ldquo;Three Wise Men&rdquo; should be commissioned to report on certain problems.

The committee thus formed is comprised of Mr. Barend Biesheuvel, formerly Prime Minister of the Netherlands, whose period of office included the occasion of the Paris Summit of 1972; Mr. Edmund Dell who, up to the time of his recent resignation was trade secretary in the British Government, and M. Robert Marjolin, a former Vice-President of the European Commission, who earlier in his career was Secretary-General of the OEEC, the forerunner of the present OECD, and who has already headed a group which produced a valuable report on a possible path towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The mandate of the committee is:</P>
    <P>To consider the adjustments to the machinery and procedures of the Institutions which are required for the proper operation of the Communities on the basis of and in compliance with the Treaties, including their institutional arrangements, and for progress towards European Union.  It emphasises the interest it attaches to having available specific proposals in this connection which may be implemented swiftly and which take into account experience to date and the prospective enlargement to twelve. The European council requests the Committee to report back on its conclusions in October 1979.</P>
    <P>Since our accession, this country has consistently advocated the improvement of decision-making in the Community and has more recently stressed the need to bring about improvements in advance of the further enlargement of the Community. We have also, of course, been concerned to maintain the balance of the Treaties, to support the institutions established under them and to maintain the equality of status of all member states of the Community.  We could not accept a Community with two tiers in its institutional structure.  I believe that the <Col N="978" /> mandate which has been agreed contains satisfactory safeguards in these respects.</P>
    <P>We also considered the remuneration of members of the directly elected European Parliament and concluded that members elected next June should be paid the same salaries as those of members of the Parliament of the country they represent; that their salaries should be subject to national taxation in their own country; and that they should receive satisfactory allowances for such expenses as travelling, subsistence and support staff.  It will be for each member state, in relation to members holding the dual mandate, to decide whether they may retain both salaries.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion of the common agricultural policy of the Community, arising largely from discussion on transfers of resources, in the EMS context, although there was a separate paper from the Commission arising from an unofficial or informal mandate for reflection given to it by the Bremen meeting of the European Council.  The paper reiterated that the CAP was a cornerstone of the Community, reconfirmed the principles on which it is based and outlined its achievements over the years. It saw the CAP facing three main areas of difficulty at present&mdash;surpluses in some markets, regional income disparities within agriculture and monetary upheavals, and noted that a major part of agriculture expenditure results from the disposal of surpluses and the application of monetary compensatory amounts.</P>
    <P>It put forward certain guidelines for future action which it asked the European Council to endorse.  In fact, for lack of time, the meeting did not specifically discuss these guidelines and they were not endorsed: Indeed, no conclusions were reached on the Common Agriculture Policy.  I understand that the President of the Commission subsequently expressed the view that on the basis of the discussion that had occurred, he felt the Commission was free to put forward proposals based on the suggested guidelines in its proposals for the annual agricultural price-fixing package. If the Commission in fact follows this <Col N="979" /> course, the proposals will have to be considered by the Agricultural Council where the Minister for Agriculture can be relied upon to point out the deficiencies in the Commission's analysis and to ensure that this country's interests are served by whatever decisions are eventually taken.  The Commission paper will be fully considered at the next meeting of the European Council.</P>
    <P>There was also a cursory discussion, at the very end of a protracted meeting, of fisheries policy in the light of attitudes at, and the outcome of, the last Fisheries Council.  However, time did not permit of any progress and the subject goes back to the Fisheries Council for further attempts to resolve the differences that prevent agreed solutions.  However, the European Council expressed the wish that there should be an early resolution of the matter.</P>
    <P>The most important proposal discussed at the meeting was that for the creation in the Community of a zone of monetary stability by means of a European Monetary System.  I have described the main outlines of this proposal in this House before.  It may, however, be as well to outline again, now, the main features of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The proposals envisage a system modelled closely on the present &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; arrangement but with an additional role for the European Currency Unit which is now referred to as ECU.  The ECU will be a basket consisting, like the present European unit of account, of a specified amount of each of the Community currencies and the weights of the currencies in the basket will be subject to review.  Each currency will have a central or starting point expressed in terms of the ECU.  This central currency rate will be used to get an exchange rate against each other currency in the system.</P>
    <P>Participating central banks will intervene in the foreign exchange markets in order to maintain the currencies within an agreed margin of fluctuation. The normal margin will be 2¼ per cent as in the present &ldquo;Snake&rdquo;.  However, during a transitional period, there will be an option <Col N="980" /> of a wider margin of up to 6 per cent for currencies not in the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When two currencies reach the fluctuation limit against each other, an obligation to intervene will apply to the two central banks concerned.  Intervention will give rise to debit and credit balances which will have to be settled in due course by transfers of reserve assets between the central banks.</P>
    <P>The system will be under-pinned by expanded credit facilities.  The proposed new European Monetary Fund will not be set up for two years but, in the meantime, the expanded credit will be channelled through the existing Community short-term and medium-term schemes.  It has been agreed that a total amount of 25 billion ECU, or £17 billion, should be available from the start of the new system.</P>
    <P>Each central bank will deposit 20 per cent of its gold and 20 per cent of its dollar reserves.  In return it will receive a supply of ECUs which may be used in settlements between central banks arising out of intervention operations.  The deposits will be managed initially by the existing European Monetary Co-operation Fund.  Other European countries with particularly close economic and financial ties with the Community may participate in the EMS intervention arrangements, but these would not have access to the Community credit facilities.</P>
    <P>The aim of the system is to create within Europe a zone of monetary stability of the sort that exists in few countries in the world today.  We saw great advantages in the proposal and have taken an active part in formulating the mechanisms and procedures through which it would work.  Our attitude has been determined largely by the view that the scheme would advance the interests of the European Community and aid in its integration and cohesiveness.  These consequences would flow, in a smoothly working system, from the practice among the Nine of working more closely together on monetary matters and from the benefits to trade and transnational investment which would follow from the elimination of the disruptions caused by frequent and illogical changes in currency <Col N="981" /> parities brought about largely by speculation.  There would be the further advantage, for us, that adherence to the system, and its disciplines, could reduce our rates of inflation to a level more closely approximating to that of the most successful economies in Europe.</P>
    <P>However, we estimated that immediate and unconditional adherence to the system could cause problems for a number of reasons.  The first is that within the system it would not be unlikely that, over time, the value of the Irish currency would be higher than it would have been outside the system.  This would happen because the value would be fixed in relation to currencies whose values are likely to rise.  With a sensible incomes policy and increases in productivity of which I know this nation is capable, we could offset this obstacle, given time.</P>
    <P>The second problem arises from the comparatively under-developed state of the Irish economy and certain difficulties peculiar to it.  We have the lowest gross domestic product per head in the European Community.  The proportion of the population engaged in agriculture is over twice the Community average.  With more than 50 per cent of the population under 25 years of age, we have one of the youngest populations in Europe. This has advantages and disadvantages.</P>
    <P>Basically, in the present case, it means that the inflow of young persons to the labour force is approximately three times the average in the European Community, as a whole.  This problem is aggravated by the fact that the level of unemployment here is among the highest in the Community.  The inflow of young people can, therefore, accentuate the already serious difficulties in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The third problem is that a fully developed monetary union&mdash;towards which the new system is tending&mdash;would increase the gravitational pull on investment and labour of the central areas of the Community, and thus make more serious the difficulties which distance from the centre creates for trade and industry here.  This particular difficulty is increased greatly by the comparatively underdeveloped state of our social and productive infrastructure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> These difficulties would not be a decisive obstacle to our adherence to the system.  We have the capacity as a nation to increase our competitiveness and productivity.  We have a favourable attitude to investment and its benefits. Indeed, we have one of the highest investment ratios in the Community.  By exercising foresight and restraint, we can provide jobs for our young people who are our greatest asset.  And we can improve the efficiency of our roads, communications and other infrastructural facilities.</P>
    <P>During my visits last month to the French President, the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor I explained both our positive attitude to the monetary proposals and the difficulties which we anticipated in the transitional period should we decide to join the system.  I said that in our view the Irish people were politically and psychologically willing to join with their partners in Europe in the creation of a zone of monetary stability but that the difficulties I have mentioned would preclude their joining unless there was a significant transfer of resources.  The size of this transfer may, obviously, be the subject of debate and many different views can be taken.</P>
    <P>I notice, for example, that the Leader of the main Opposition party in his contribution to the debate on this subject on 19 October 1978, put his price&mdash;for full monetary union&mdash;at five times the level the Government had been seeking.  The Labour Party Leader said in this House on 30 November that we should accept what we were asking only if our European partners were to give it to us without conditions as to how it was to be spent, as between capital or current, or in any other way.  We were simply to be given the money&mdash;and that was that.</P>
    <P>I should like the House to consider the implications of these attitudes.  We are asking the countries of the Community, who, powerful as they are, have, themselves, substantial problems of unemployment and economic restructuring, to forego the use of resources which they raise from taxation in their own countries, and to pay over these resources to us.  In common sense, our case for this transfer must be well <Col N="983" /> founded and responsible&mdash;as I believe it is.  It should not be embroidered with fantasies or made look ridiculous by the addition of impossible conditions.</P>
    <P>During my discussions with the French, British and German leaders I received a great deal of understanding and support.  During the meeting in Brussels, each of the three leaders was at great pains again to emphasise his support and understanding of the Irish case. However, in the mechanisms and procedures of the Community that case became inseparably linked with other arguments and views, the net effect of which we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>The debate in Brussels continued over the greater part of the two days and nights.  It was concerned essentially with (1), the technical and monetary aspects of the new system; and (2), the measures necessary to aid the less prosperous countries.  Almost the entire first day was occupied by the former, and the measures in respect of the less prosperous states were not touched on until late on the second day.</P>
    <P>On both of these, a major issue was the extent to which the United Kingdom wished to participate in the new system. Essentially, they wished to be part of the management but not to take part in the exchange rate mechanism.  The conclusions as they emerged will enable the United Kingdom to join the system if they wish.</P>
    <P>On the monetary aspects, the first difficulty concerned the degree of obligation on a country to intervene in the money markets when the exchange rate of its currency is moving out of line with its central rate.  The British wished for compulsory intervention.  The Germans took the view that this could not be.  In the event, the decision was that when a currency crossed its threshold of divergence there would be a presumption that the authorities concerned would correct this situation.  If measures are not taken, on account of special circumstances, the reasons shall be given to the other authorities.</P>
    <P>A second difficulty concerned the division of the reserve fund of 25 billion ECUs as between medium and short <Col N="984" /> term credit for currency support.  This was resolved by the division of the fund into 14 billion ECUs for short-term monetary support and 11 billion ECUs for medium-term support.</P>
    <P>There are many other highly technical aspects of the system before the meeting.  Important as these are &mdash;indeed, they are vital to the proper functioning of the system&mdash;I will not detain the House with a description of them here.  The conclusions which emerged are adequately described in the document headed &ldquo;Resolution of the European Council of 5th December, 1978, on the establishment of the European Monetary System (EMS) and Related Matters&rdquo;, which I have included among the papers I am laying before the House.</P>
    <P>The major issue in so far as we were concerned was the question of resource transfers which is dealt with in Part B of that document.  Our position, for the reasons I have outlined, was that to participate successfully in the scheme and to counteract its adverse effect in a transitional period, we would require a resource transfer of approximately £130 million a year over five years on the assumption that the United Kingdom was within the system.</P>
    <P>This is a realistic figure.  It results from as objective an appraisal as we could make of the effects of the system.  I think that it is fair to say that during my discussions with the other leaders our case was, in the main, accepted, with some reservations as to the size and form of the resource transfers involved. This acceptance was confirmed and, indeed, reiterated many times during the Brussels meeting.  However, because of the relationship with what would happen if the Irish case were met and something similar done for other countries, the total consequences of support to the degree that we were seeking went beyond what members of the Council felt they could recommend.  In the event, the Council agreed that the European Investment Bank might make available for a period of five years loans of approximately £670 million a year to the less prosperous member states participating in the new system.  These loans would be subsidised to the extent of 3 per cent a <Col N="985" /> year, subject to a limitation of £670 million approximately on the total amount involved over the five-year period.</P>
    <P>Any less prosperous member country participating in the mechanisms would have the right of access to these facilities.  Member states not participating effectively and fully will not contribute to the financing of the scheme.  The United Kingdom will obviously be in that position.  Of the totals I have mentioned, Italy would be entitled to a maximum of two-thirds and Ireland, a maximum of one-third.</P>
    <P>The details of the scheme are not included in the resolution.  However, they would provide for a 15-year loan term, with a moratorium on principal repayments of three or five years.  The present value of a 3 per cent interest subsidy, with a three-year moratorium on capital repayments is equivalent to approximately 20 per cent of the value of the loan&mdash;discounting at 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, therefore, Ireland could draw on loans of up to £225 million a year, approximately, from the European Investment Bank.  If we did draw on these loans, they would be subsidised to the extent of approximately £45 million and this subsidy could be paid as a lump sum grant in the first year of the loan term.  Thus, if Ireland availed of the offer to the full and borrowed up to the limit I have mentioned, it would benefit from a resource transfer of approximately £45 million a year&mdash;which is the grant equivalent of a loan of £225 million.  This figure of £45 million a year for a period of five years corresponds to the estimate of £130 million a year which I mentioned as representing our estimate of the size of the resource transfer necessary to offset our entry into the scheme in the transitional years.</P>
    <P>Because of the disparity, I told the council that I could not at that stage indicate to them that I would recommend joining the scheme but that I would consider the matter further in consultation with my Government, particularly to see whether there could be any further basis on which I could contemplate a positive response.</P>
    <P>I said I would convey our decision in <Col N="986" /> a short time.  This process of consultation is continuing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the main issue dealt with by the Taoiseach, there are two earlier points on which I wish to comment briefly.  The first is a reference to the appointment of the &ldquo;Three Wise Men&rdquo; and their terms of reference.  I must admit to some concern in this regard, concern which I found shared widely in Europe on occasions on which I have had contact with prominent political leaders in the EEC.</P>
      <P>First, we had the Tindemans Report several years ago, attempting to do very much the same job.  This report of the Belgian Prime Minister was discussed by Foreign Ministers and more vaguely by Heads of Government, but it ran into the sands.  It is not clear what is the particular value of re-opening this matter now, but what is particularly a matter of concern is that the &ldquo;Three Wise Men&rdquo; have been appointed by the Heads of Government and not by the institutions of the Community. This would appear to constitute a further danger to these institutions in repeatedly intervening from outside the system because the Heads of Government are outside the system.  This appointment was decided by way of an inter-governmental meeting.  It was not a decision of the Community.  For it to have been a decision of the Community there would have had to be a proposal from the Commission on which the Heads of Government could have acted, but that was not the case.  It was a question of the imposition on the Community by the Heads of Government, acting inter-governmentally, of a procedure of review of its institutions, without consulting the institutions regarding their views, and without giving them the opportunity of suggesting how and by whom a review should be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The correct procedure that I would have expected our Government to follow would have been to propose that, if it were thought that a further review could be useful at this stage, the institutions should be asked to nominate someone, not necessarily one of their members, but somebody from outside such as from the Commission, the Court <Col N="987" /> of Justice or the Parliament.  That suggestion was made in some political circles with which I had contact and I regret that the European Council, instead of taking account of it, acted unilaterally and in a manner further to undermine the stature of the institutions of the Community to which this country has always attached importance, and rightly so in view of our relatively small size in the institutional structure.</P>
    <P>The other matter which the Taoiseach raised in the earlier part of his speech was the question of salaries of members of the European Parliament.  I have always thought that there would be disadvantages if the salaries paid in Ireland were to be at the level necessary to attract a German member of Parliament to joint the European Parliament.  Such salaries which would have been of the order of £25,000 per year would have been so disproportionate to salaries here in the public sector, and indeed even in most parts of the private sctor, that they might have given a wrong impression and might have had an adverse effect on the degree of participation in the elections and in the confidence of people in the value and the seriousness of the elections.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the task being undertaken by these Deputies is one of immense difficulty.  It involves travelling, sometimes twice a week, for about 35 weeks in the year to places that are relatively inaccessible from here in terms of transport.  This throws an enormous burden on the people concerned.  It is an exhausting activity and to remunerate it at the rate proposed now seems to be going to the opposite extreme.  I would have hoped&mdash;and this had been suggested in the papers&mdash;that an intermediate figure of a kind more appropriate to this country would have emerged, a figure which would have been close to if not at the level of the salary of a Minister here.  This would seem to be appropriate given the status of the people concerned and the kind of work they must carry out.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers of what is being done now is that not only is it likely that no one will stand in the election with any <Col N="988" /> prospect of success who is not already a member of this or, perhaps, of the other House&mdash;perhaps that was likely anyway&mdash;but that at the time of the next general election Deputies of this House, who will have carried the burden for several years of the dual mandate, will not consider themselves able financially and in terms of family responsibilities to lay down the burden of that dual mandate and to remain members of the European Parliament only but will consider it necessary to stand again for election to this House and to carry on a relationship which in its present form is unsatisfactory because Members cannot serve both Parliaments adequately.  If they are away for those very 35 weeks that the Dáil is meeting they cannot play an effective part in the life of the Dáil.  All of us can accept that in the transition period&mdash;the first three years&mdash;this would happen.  Indeed, it has happened up to this point.  But the fixing of the salaries at the level proposed would appear to ensure that this situation would continue permanently and that there would be great difficulty instead of there being a move over towards a system in which members of the European Parliament would remain members of, but would not stand for, the Dáil in most or all cases.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is regrettable that there has been a move to the opposite extreme than was proposed originally.  The Government should give some consideration to the question of making some arrangements nationally to modify the situation and, in order to prevent this salary arrangement being a blockage either to the entry into the European Parliament of anybody from outside or to anybody in this House leaving this House and remaining in the European Parliament to do a fulltime job.  I will leave that thought with the Taoiseach.  It is unfortunate that he was distracted by the much more immediate issue of the EMS thereby preventing adequate consideration at the European Council meeting of this salary question.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of the European Monetary System.  The Taoiseach's statement has gone only a small way to clarifying the appalling confusion created by the Government in <Col N="989" /> relation to the EMS debate.  Indeed, it has added further to the confusion because, apart from the Taoiseach contradicting himself between Brussels and Dublin and two of his Ministers contradicting him yesterday, he has now, at least in respect of one matter, contradicted them.  I do not know at what point this situation will come to an end and the Government will agree on what it is they were offered.  I had expected that by today they would have sorted themselves out and would have had one story to tell, but apparently we must wait further. This creates an impossible position for the House and for the country and it is of grave danger in a situation already fraught with uncertainty.  It is adding unnecessarily to the confusion.  The Government have a responsibility not to do that.  Yesterday there was not one person&mdash;member of the Government, civil servant, banker, economist, doctor, businessman or man in the street&mdash;who was not totally confused as to what it was that the Government had turned down.</P>
    <P>The source of confusion was initially the Taoiseach himself.  All four morning papers had very experienced political correspondents accompanying the Taoiseach to Brussels and they reported what he had said, aided in the case of one paper by a local correspondent to whose expertise I can testify.  All reported that the total package secured was £225 million in soft loans.  <i>The Irish Independent</i> stated &ldquo;the top offer was £225 million in low interest loans.&rdquo;<i>The Irish Press</i> said that &ldquo;the amount was reduced....  Ireland might end up with only £200 million in soft loans.&rdquo;<i>The Irish Times</i> said that &ldquo;The Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, is left with no option but to reject the £225 million package of aid.&rdquo;<i>The Cork Examiner</i> stated that &ldquo;the resource transfer offer amounted to only £225 million over five years in loans at subsidised interest rates.&rdquo;  It could not be clearer, and all four papers reported the same thing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach would seem to have spelled out the annual sum involved in this package, which he clearly indicated to them was a package for the five-year period.  He is quoted in the <i>Irish</i><Col N="990" /><i>Independent</i> as saying &ldquo;£45 million a year in loans too small.&rdquo;<i>The Irish Times</i> reports him as saying,  &ldquo;The total of the transfer available represented around £45 million a year.&rdquo;<i>The Irish Press</i> said that &ldquo;the amount offered to Ireland was a mere £45 million a year in loans over the next five years.&rdquo;  It could not be clearer.  All the papers got the message.  It was a total package of loans of £225 million over five years which&mdash;and you can arrive at this by dividing by five&mdash;is £45 million in loans each year.  That is what the Taoiseach told the Press on Monday night in Brussels. It is not credible that all these experienced correspondents got everything that was said wrong.  They could not have done that if they had been told what happened with minimal clarity. That was the first story that came through and it was confirmed by officials in Dublin.  The <i>Financial Times</i> yesterday reported from Dublin, &ldquo;Irish officials were bitter tonight&rdquo;&mdash;that was the night before last&mdash;&ldquo;The £225 million resources transfer offer was derisory.&rdquo; Whatever the Taoiseach said in Brussels he had conveyed to Dublin, and officials in Dublin gave the same story.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the accusation has been levelled by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development that the media have got it wrong throughout the whole period of negotiations and have got it wrong again now.  This accusation is wearing increasingly thin.  He had already produced this allegation against the journalist who, unknown to him, reported a meeting in Clontarf and was accused of reporting the Minister wrongly. Unfortunately for the Minister, on the day the Minister was trying to put it right the journalist gave a full account, based on his notes of what happened, and republished it in <i>The Irish Press.</i>  I think nobody was in doubt about the authenticity of what he said and the credibility of the journalist.</P>
    <P>Then we had the arrival of M. Chirac in Cork when the events of last Tuesday night were anticipated.  After evident pressure from Fianna Fáil&mdash;embarrassed because their awkward ally said in Cork what he never tires of saying in France, namely that he is against the existence <Col N="991" /> of the European Parliament and has accepted it reluctantly only because the Heads of Government have given it the green light and because he has no alternative, M. Chirac was then persuaded to accuse our corps of diplomatic correspondents of all getting it wrong.</P>
    <P>That does not work.  You cannot fool all the people all the time and you cannot get away with misleading the diplomatic correspondents and the political correspondents, all the time pretending it is all their fault.  At some stage the credibility disappears.  This Government have outrun their credibility in these matters.  All of us can be mis-reported on occasion by a journalist.  That is a hazard of politics and it is irritating when it happens.  It is a quite different matter when a Prime Minister addresses a group of correspondents who are specialists in their field who unanimously take note of what he says, report it and are then told that they have got it wrong and that they have misled themselves and the public.  In a democratic system that is unacceptable. The responsible press have a function to perform.  Of course they make mistakes, but they do their job well and the specialist correspondents do it extremely well.  Nobody is going to believe that in these circumstances they have all got it wrong on both occasions and only M. Chirac and the Taoiseach right.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach arrived back in Dublin he was interviewed on radio.  The interview was not broadcast until 6.30 p.m. last night.  In that interview he reiterated that there were only soft loans, no grants.  He said it several times.  He went on to say that the amount available to us was 200 million units of account a year.  That is £125 million approximately at the present value of the unit of account.  That was what he said when he arrived in Dublin.  It was growing. It started at £45 million a year in Brussels and in the course of this tiring two-and-a-half-hour flight it had grown to £125 million a year by the time the Taoiseach arrived in Dublin.  It doubled overnight when the Minister for Economic Planning and Development got his hands on it.  Lo and behold, at a <Col N="992" /> lunchtime interview we were told that the amount per annum in the way of loans was now £225 million.  The Minister went on then to explain what we had been offered.  Perhaps I should quote the Minister, because we come now to a different story from that of the Taoiseach.  The Minister said, &ldquo;We were offered basically a package of soft loans. On the amounts put forward this would mean that Ireland could borrow about £225 million a year for each of five years.&rdquo;  I shall come back to that &ldquo;could&rdquo; later.  &ldquo;There would be a strong subsidy element in the loan and that subsidy would be converted into a cash grant and paid to us each year.  The amount of the cash grant that would be paid would be £45 million each year. Thirdly, we were offered &ldquo;a five-year moratorium or time lag, if you like, before we would have to make any repayment of the amount which we would borrow, and of course that five-year holiday is also worth something. We have not put a precise value on it yet.&rdquo;  Those are the three essential elements.</P>
    <P>Let us note several points from this. First of all, we are told that this moratorium has a value which is going to be put on it.  We have not yet been told how you put a value on a moratorium.  I have consulted numerous experts on the matter who are unanimous that a moratorium of that kind does not have value and is not something on which you can put a value. If the Government think otherwise perhaps they would show the calculations by which they have arrived at a value which experts say you cannot put upon a moratorium.  The Minister says it is worth something but he does not say how much.  Note that he has first of all said that we could borrow £225 million a year, that we would be paid £45 million a year, and on top of that there was a moratorium which has not been quantified yet and which is therefore not included in the £45 million and is a five-year moratorium.</P>
    <P>What is the Taoiseach's story this morning?  It is different again.  There is no possibility of him sticking to the same story in any to speeches.  &ldquo;The details of the scheme are not included in the <Col N="993" /> resolutions: however, they would provide for a 15-year loan term with a moratorium on principal repayment of three or five years.&rdquo;  Now we are going down.  We moved up between Brussels and Dublin from £45 million a year to £125 million a year; next morning in Dublin it was £225 million a year in loans.  At that same time we were at peak.  We peaked at 1.30 p.m. yesterday. It was, not surprisingly, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who did it; he did a bit of peaking at election time also and we were at a disadvantage subsequently.  Yesterday at the peak when things were at their best it was £225 million with a five-year moratorium.  Now it is evaporating before our eyes.  It has gone down now to three or five years in the Taoiseach's speech.  Who is telling the truth?  What is the moratorium?  What are the terms? Can anybody is this House in the opposite benches know which it is?  Whom do you believe, the Taoiseach or the Minister?</P>

I would like to be told how it has a value.  The calculation is complex, but before we start trying to put a value on it, before we start examining how the Government have valued it, could we be told which it is?  Is it five years or three to five years?  How are we to know?  What is the point of having a debate if they get up and contradict each other until at the end of it we are no wiser than before?</P>

      <P>What is the point of having a statement from the Taoiseach if at the end of it we are no wiser and do not know whether to believe him or the Minister?  It did seem yesterday that the Minister knew better than the Taoiseach. The Minister and the Minister for Finance convinced a lot of people yesterday that the Taoiseach was quite wrong the night before and that they knew better, that they had the facts and that the Taoiseach really did not know much about what the whole thing was about. That certainly was the impression in Dublin yesterday as far as everybody in the streets and the fields of Ireland was concerned.  This morning perhaps the Taoiseach did not like that or perhaps he thought it was time for him to establish that he knew more than them.  So this morning he comes in and contradicts the Minister.</P>
      <P>First of all he makes it clear that the moratorium value as alleged to exist, which has not been explained to us, is included in the £45 million.  but the Minister said it was extra.  He said it had not been quantified yet; it was on top of the £45 million.  The Taoiseach says it is inclusive.  The Minister says it is for five years.  The Taoiseach says it is for three to five years.  Where are we left with this?  What is the point of having a statement of this kind if we are not to be given an authoritative and clear statement of what the position is?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach went on to make the following statement, which I am sure is not totally clear to everybody in this House: that the present value of a 3 per cent interest subsidy with a three year moratorium on capital repayments included, as we note from the calculations, is equivalent to approximately 20 per cent of the value of the loan discounting at 9 per cent.  Now, hands up, those who understand it.  Hands up.  Does anybody understand it?  I think one hand may go up and that is the hand of the man who probably drafted it, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  There is a difficulty. When we are faced with these flat contradictions I think I am entitled to inquire as to who is telling us the truth about it and what are the facts.  I would like the House to be given the details of how the £45 million is calculated, because that phrase I have just read out is not comprehensible to anybody, including myself.  It may be a defect on my part.  Perhaps my education did not extend to this type of figuring.  I do not understand it.  I do not understand how the value put on the moratorium is calculated.  I am willing to be convinced. I am always willing to learn.  If it can be shown it can be done, let it be done.  I asked five experts yesterday and they said that there was not any value.  I told them I thought they may be wrong.  The Government would hardly say it has a value if it has not.  I am not saying there is no value but I am saying that I have not found anybody yet who says it has a value.  Tell us what the value is and explain how a 3 per cent interest subsidy on £225 million a year accumulating over five years is turned into £45 million. Because, indeed, if it is just taken straight&mdash;but obviously it is much more complex than that&mdash;in the first year 3 per cent on the first £225 million is £6.75 million.  In the second year it is £13.5 million because we have two £225 millions and so on upwards, the figure in the last year being £34 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How one adds together five figures from £6.75 million up to £34 million, divide it by five and arrives at £45 million is a mystery.  It is a mystery to which there is probably an answer.  I am not saying there is not an answer.  I am saying that, on the face of it, the man in the street is a bit puzzled and is scratching his head as to where the rest of the money comes from.  To him it works out at £22 million.  We are told it is £45 million. Just show us the calculations, because I do think it is serious when we have issues like the stock markets involved <Col N="996" /> attempting to assess what this might mean in case the Government might decide finally, as the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said yesterday, to go in, although the Taoiseach last night told the press to the contrary, and worried that they have said more than they should have said with all the confusion during yesterday.</P>
    <P>People might believe the Ministers for Finance and for Economic Planning and Development at this stage.  They might believe them when they say that it is not so bad that we might not go in on these terms. People want to know what are the terms. We are entitled in this House, the public are entitled and the various financial experts are entitled to be told how the £45 million is arrived at.  Would the Taoiseach put in the Library of the House at once the calculations by which that is arrived at in terms comprehensible to those of us who can manage simple arithmetic but without algebra so that we can examine it this afternoon and see how the figures are arrived at? We are entitled to that.  I am not contesting that it is correct.  It seems to me so incredible that the Government would get that wrong as well as everything else that I am taking it on faith, but it is not clear to me how it is arrived at.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is not clear to me from the statement that was made in Brussels on this subject that the interpretation we get for the £45 million each year given by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is correct.  The statement is in the Council's official resolution and the relevant part is as follows: &ldquo;The European Council requests the Commission to submit a proposal to provide interest rate subsidies of 3 per cent for these loans.  The total cost of this measure divided into annual tranches of £134 million each over a period of five years shall not exceed £670 million.&rdquo;  It goes on to say that we get one-third of that, so that for us the total cost for Irish purposes of this measure, divided into annual tranches of £45 million each over a period of five years, shall not exceed £223 million.  That does not say that there will be a payment each year of that amount because, in fact, the <Col N="997" /> basis of the statement is that loans of &ldquo;up to&rdquo; £1,000 million European units of account per year will be given.  The Taoiseach in his speech says the European Investment Bank might make available for a period of five years loans of &ldquo;up to&rdquo; approximately £670 million a year.  First of all, there is no guarantee that</P>
    <P>First of all, there is no guarantee that the full amount will be provided and, secondly, while there is a reference to the annual tranches, the reference would appear to be to a maximum that it cannot exceed in any year&mdash;in our case £45 million&mdash;and the total in our case cannot exceed £223 million.</P>
    <P>If that is the case how are we sure that in the first year we will get £45 million and not £6.75 million, which is the interest subsidy due on the first tranche of the loan? Certainly it is not clear from the statement issued by the Council; and as already the Taoiseach has contradicted most of what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said, we cannot take as gospel from him that in fact we do get £45 million each year. Perhaps he has got that wrong too, as everything else has been got wrong by one or other Member of the Government.</P>
    <P>Could I ask how the wording of the Council resolution is interpreted?  To me, in a year when we have borrowed £225 million and with the interest subsidy at 3 per cent it is £6.75 million.  How do we get £45 million back in that year?  An alternative interpretation that seems to me to make more sense is that these are maxima&mdash;everything is &ldquo;up to&rdquo; a certain figure&mdash;and that we will get each year the possibility of borrowing £225 million, which we could borrow anyway from the European Community in some form, and that there will be an interest subsidy of 3 per cent which in no year shall exceed £45 million and which in total shall not exceed £223 million.</P>
    <P>That seems to be what the words means.  If there is a private guarantee that they mean more than that, and that in a year when the interest subsidy is £6.75 million we are, nevertheless, given £45 million with which to pay it, would the Taoiseach put in the Library of the House the document that says that, <Col N="998" /> because the Council's resolution does not say it?  If it is a private understanding that the meaning of the Council's statement is that each year we get £45 million even when there is only a £6.75 million interest subsidy, will the Taoiseach put in the Library of the House immediately the document in which they have got that private guarantee or offer which he then turned down?  It is not clear from what is here. Unfortunately, we cannot take this as gospel from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development because he has already been contradicted by the Taoiseach both on the inclusion of the value of the so-called moratorium in the £45 million and on there being a five year moratorium guaranteed at all.  So if two of the three points in the Minister's statement have already been contradicted by the Taoiseach, I think we need verification of the third.  That verification is not even given by the Taoiseach himself.  His speech does not seem to me to make this statement. What he says is that if we did draw these loans they would be subsidised to the extent of approximately £45 million and this subsidy could be paid as a lump sum grant in the first year of the loan term.  It is not clear that that means that the £45 million is paid from the start.  I will not dwell any further on it but I would like the document, in which this guarantee is set out, placed in the Library of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I want to know and I want the document that sets out that we get £45 million each year.  I am not clear that that is what people think in Brussels.  We want to be clear that at this point the European Commission, the Council secretariat and the Government, when they finally reach agreement among themselves, are talking about the same thing.  Perhaps they are, but nobody can know anything at this stage in view of the confusion they have created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> It is difficult to see how a situation could arise in which four quite different sets of information have been given, by the Taoiseach on three occasions and in between times by two of his Ministers. There was either a deliberate and dishonest attempt to play down the amount secured in the hope that the grossly inadequate terms actually offered would seem more attractive when they emerged the following day, an attempt which misfired because they played down the terms so much that they produced headlines such as: &ldquo;Aid sell out&rdquo;, &ldquo;We were conned&rdquo;, &ldquo;Giscard halts Irish gallop&rdquo;&mdash;a deliberate ploy to create a situation in which people would after lunchtime yesterday here the Minister for Economic Planning and Development on radio say, &ldquo;Good Heavens, it was better than we thought&rdquo;.  If it was not an attempt to achieve a psychological effect, which misfired, the only other explanation seems to be that the Taoiseach so misunderstood the terms he was offered that he misled himself and the press who were with him.  The result in any event was humiliating for Ireland.  We are the laughing stock of other countries.  The Government do not seem to know what was offered before turning it down.  We could hardly be in a worse bargaining position in which to recover credibility and to seek to secure better terms even at this late stage, as I believe was not inconceivable until this mess was made of it, in view of the German and French anxiety for our participation in the system.</P>
    <P>We ought to look further at the terms as they are now told to us, whether or not they stand up to inspection and checking in Brussels.  There are a number of facts we have to get clear. The fact of our getting the loan as such has no importance.  It just means that of our total borrowing during the next five years, which even if reduced to 8 per cent of GNP by 1980 as the Government have promised, would still be well in excess of £600 million in 1980 money terms.  Of this borrowing, which will not fall below £600 million in that period, £225 million will be available from the Community rather than from some <Col N="1000" /> other source.  We are talking of a straight substitution of one kind of borrowing for another.  It is not even a substitution because we have already had a Community loan.  It is no different from any Community loan in the ordinary way or a loan from anywhere else.  It does not help us to get the loan.  Our problem is that our borrowing is too high and, as the Government have agreed, has to be reduced to 10½ per cent next year and 8 per cent the following year, that is, the total borrowing, including whatever borrowing we get here.  It is irrelevant whether it is borrowed from Europe or elsewhere.  It is simply choosing to borrow from Europe because they are willing to give us some advantage in connection with the loan but it adds nothing to what is available to us to be able to borrow this money.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the moratorium or delay in payment has no value.  I am not arguing as to whether or not one can put a financial value on it.  I am told one cannot; the Government say one can, but there will be a document in the Dáil Library explaning it all to us after this debate.  I am saying that the delay in repayment has no value in connection with the loan for a different reason.  We get moratoria on virtually all our loans.  If we examine Table 8 in the Central Bank Autumn Bulletin we will discover that the following loans have moratoria of up to ten years in some cases.  The table does not go beyond nine years so I cannot establish from it exactly how long some of the moratoria are.  Let me mention them. There was the Ireland 7½ per cent stock, Ireland 9¾ per cent stock, 7 per cent sterling DM bonds, Ireland 6½ per cent Notes, 9 per cent Algemene Bank Nederland, Ireland 9½ per cent, Belgian Franc loan, 9 per cent Kuwaiti Dinar Notes, UAE Dirham Bonds, 10¼ per cent Dutch Guilder, 9¼ per cent DM Private Placement, Ireland 9½ per cent Dollar Notes, Ireland 8¼ per cent DM Bonds, EEC loan, 8½ per cent DM Bonds, 7½ per cent Swiss Francs, 6? per cent Swiss Francs and Ireland Japanese Yen.  Those are loans in recent times with moratoria.  The moratoria average 6½ years.  They range in two cases to over nine years.  I do not know how <Col N="1001" /> much over nine years because the table does not go beyond that.  None of them are less than three years.  The typical figure is 7 years and the average figure is 6½ years.</P>
    <P>The question is not whether the Government were very clever to get a moratorium but why it is only three or five years, when on the ordinary loans they are borrowing the moratorium is in fact up to twice that.  I want to know why the moratorium is so short.  As far as I can see all loans have moratoria at the present time.  I do not want to over-state anything.  I may have missed one but certainly I have given a sufficiently long list of loans, all of which are current and have moratoria of an average of 6½ years.  Why did the Government accept a moratorium much shorter than the moratoria they get on their other loans? Were they forced to accept a shorter moratorium because they were getting an interest subsidy?  I am glad to have trapped the Minister for Finance into this.  If the Government are claiming that there is a financial value on the moratorium I take it that it is less for three years or five years than for seven years.  We have lost something in accepting this moratorium.  By not getting the 6½ to 7 year typical figure the financial benefit which the Minister for Finance has just claimed exists was reduced.  How much have we lost by that to off-set against the £45 million?  I would like an answer to that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the document put in the Dáil Library to indicate how much of the value of the so-called £45 million consists of the moratorium, how it is calculated and what would have been the value if we had got a 6½ to 7 year moratorium, as the Government normally get on their loans, so that we will know how much the Government have lost by accepting a three to five year moratorium.  That information should be given to the House and to the country as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only relevant figure for us now is <Col N="1002" /> this alleged £45 million cash grant.  What is the basis for this?  How is it arrived at? Is it the case, as <i>The Irish Press</i> have reported this morning, that the European Commission have yet to produce a scheme, so that there is no proposal because obviously there cannot be a proposal for transfer of funds and there cannot be a transfer of funds until and unless the European Commission produce a proposal?  Then the Governments can decide what they like but when it comes to an actual decision to transfer their money it has to be done through a procedure proposed by the Commission, Parliament consulted and a decision by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Is there a Commission proposal or are we talking in the air about something that has not even been written down yet? <i>The Irish Press</i> suggests that there is no Commission proposal.  The Taoiseach did not tell us that.  The House is entitled to know that.  I was warned both before the European Council meeting and since that this was very likely to turn out to be the case.  I was sceptical about it but I was warned about it.  Is it the case that to benefit from this we would need to submit proposals to the European Investment Bank for infrastructural projects?  Is that how the money is to come or is it through another mechanism such as the Ortoli Facility? <i>The Irish Press</i> story today is that what is involved is that we can now borrow up to £225 million a year from the European Investment Bank.  The European Investment Bank, first of all, provide money only for infrastructural projects.  They will not provide money for industrial projects that might affect competition.</P>
    <P>The aid we need is for industry.  In order to survive the early strains of membership we need help for our vulnerable industries. I need not dwell on that because I raised it in the House last week.  Is it the case that the money must come from the European Investment Bank, must be for infrastructural projects and cannot be used to help industry? Why did not the Taoiseach tell us about that?  Is that part of the terms? If that is the case, how do we propose to submit projects which overnight will be <Col N="1003" /> over four times greater than the maximum we have ever been able to submit with success to the European Investment Bank?  The maximum we have ever received from that bank is £52.1 million. The bank do not lend money for any old thing, they lend it if a project is submitted. We in Government and this Government have been submitting projects to the European Investment Bank in an effort to get money from them.</P>
    <P>The money available to them is adequate because I remember discussing when I was a member of the Government whether there would be a need to expand the resources of the bank in order to cope with additional demands from outside the Community as well as inside it.  We were told that the situation was all right, that they could accept certain additional obligations in respect of certain outside countries without the bank's resources having to be increased. The money was there.  As far as I am aware there has never been any constraint on the total amount available, yet we have never succeeded in submitting projects for more than £52.1 million in one year.  How do we expect next year to find projects and submit them which overnight will attract £225 million?  Is it a necessary pre-condition of gaining this loan what we must have these projects accepted?  Is this story in <i>The Irish Press</i> correct?  Why did the Taoiseach not tell us the method by which this money was to come?  He told us virtually nothing about this, except to contradict his Minister on a couple of points.</P>
    <P>Is it clear that this sum would remain guaranteed with enlargement?  With other demands in the future on the European Investment Bank because of enlargement, is it guaranteed that this sum would take priority or would it be squeezed in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>The Council's official resolution as published in <i>The Irish Times</i> today states that the sum available to Italy and ourselves is up to £700 million a year and we would get one-third.  It is a maximum, not a guaranteed figure as suggested by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  What we have had here is totally unsatisfactory in what was said. <Col N="1004" /> As I said last week, there is no provision for replies.  The whole problem at present is that we need answers to questions.</P>
    <P>I had expected the Taoiseach this morning, even in his own interest, to clarify all these outstanding matters in explicit terms so that the House, the country, the financial sector, the industrial sector, farmers, trade unionists and others would be in a position to know what it is we were offered, where we stand and what it is the Government are now seeking to have topped up by a further offer.  We do not know that.  The Taoiseach did not really do credit to himself and certainly did not do credit to the House by not explaining these facts. We are not now talking of the negotiating position.  I am not asking him to say what measures he proposes to take in order to try to negotiate a better deal.  I suggest that that is what he should be doing.  At this stage we want to know what he was offered.  That is a matter of historical record.</P>
    <P>The fact that four contradictory accounts have been given&mdash;three by the Taoiseach and one by two of his Ministers&mdash;has left everybody in a state of complete confusion.  I believed that confusion would be cleared up this morning.  I thought the Government had made a mess of it up to that point but that their own sense of self-preservation would make them clear up that confusion, explain how the confusion arose, state clearly what the present position is and the exact method of calculation of the sum involved so that we could have confidence in the figures, which do not tally with what is in the Council's resolution as reported in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  I had expected the Taoiseach to say where the money would come from, whether from the European Investment Bank or by a supplementary estimate, so that we would be able to judge how it might be used.  I had expected him to say what constraints there would be on the use of the money.  These are the facts we need in order to assess what the Government turned down, without ever discussing what the Government should now look for.  I would ask the Taoiseach to remedy the gross inadequacy of the statement by putting all that information <Col N="1005" /> on record in the Dáil Library at once, so that we and the media can at last be enlightened as to what happened two days ago.</P>
    <P>I believe the way this has been mishandled is damaging&mdash;I hope not fatally&mdash;to the chances of renegotiation.  The evidence that the Government did not understand what they were offered is not the best position from which to start in going back to look for more.  Our message at this stage is to sort out the mess and publish the facts fully as to what was offered in terms people can understand and believe, which is not the case so far.  The Government must decide among themselves what they have achieved and when they have agreed on that they should tell us.  They should then attempt to obtain a better deal.</P>
    <P>There have been some reports from Paris of the possibility of second thoughts.  It is in the light of that situation and in the light of the fact that it is not in the interest of France that Ireland and Italy should be outside and that the President of France may, under the pressure of the moment, have miscalculated his own country's interest and the interest of Europe that I believe the Government should seek to renegotiate. I urge them to do so.  I would hope that any renegotiation in the next few days would be on a Community basis.  Any extra provision will need to be very large even to reach the figure which the Government thought necessary if Britain joined&mdash;it would need to be treble the present £45 million cash grant.  The renegotiation should be pressed quickly.  It is a good moment in that there may be second thoughts in France.  There is certainly deep regret in Germany.  It is obvious that the German Chancellor is very disappointed at what has happened. He was willing to go further.</P>
    <P>According to some newspapers, including French newspapers, the obstacle would appear to be the Taoiseach's allies, the Gaullists.  The more I see of that alliance the more damaging to the national interest it seems.  They are the one party in Europe whose interests totally diverge from ours.  Any time we try to achieve anything for this country, whether it is keeping hold of fish for our <Col N="1006" /> own fishermen off our coasts or whether it is in an area like this involving additional transfers from the Regional Fund, who sabotage it?  The Gaullists sabotage it with their pressure on the French President.  I do not blame him. He is under great pressure.  He has a minority in Parliament and depends on the support of the Gaullists <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Communist and the Socialist opposition. He is not completely free and is not to be blamed if he gives in to these pressures. What is the value of the alliance with the Gaullists if the Taoiseach cannot prevent them at every stage from sabotaging Irish interests?</P>
    <P>Surely the whole purpose of an alliance with any party is to be able to ensure that whatever they do they do not work against our interests, that they try to accommodate our interests and that whatever proposals they put forward take full account of our interests.  That is the case in relation to our alliance with the Christian Democrats and the Labour Party alliance with the Social Democrats.  It works, When matters come up in the European Parliament the small delegations we have can persuade our colleagues that by doing something a little differently they will be no worse off and will avoid hurting us.  That is the purpose of the system in the European Parliament.  Why belong to a party who never listen to Irish interests, who ruthlessly sabotage Irish interests and at this stage a vital Irish interest?  I trust the Taoiseach will draw the consequences and will disalign himself from that group.</P>

      <P>This is not a three-card trick; it is now a four-card trick.  I have not been dogmatic as to what the Government have achieved.  I have pointed out the incompatibilities in the different stories given, right up to the speeches this morning.  I have asked the Government to clarify it, write it down in simple English and simple arithmetic and put it in the Dáil Library.  It is a <Col N="1007" /> reasonable request and if that is done perhaps the Irish people will find out what it is the Government have turned down.</P>
      <P>I suspect, and it seems to me, that the Taoiseach was right to turn it down.  I am not arguing that the Taoiseach should have accepted it.  It seems that what was offered was grossly inadequate. What I find puzzling is why it was so inadequate.  We must recall what the Taoiseach said to us this day week in the Dáil.  The Taoiseach said at column 413 of the Official Report of 30 November 1978 that the French President had:</P>
      <P>... recognised the merits of our case for assistance.</P>
      <P>At column 414 of the same report the Taoiseach said that after his German visit he was</P>
      <P>... greatly encouraged by the Chancellor's very positive response.</P>
      <P>which indicated that he would be prepared to support transfers to Ireland in the fullest possible degree.  The Taoiseach also said on that occasion at column 413 that the British Prime Minister</P>
      <P>... showed the utmost goodwill and understanding of our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach came away full of optimism, conveyed that optimism to the Irish people, and he went off to a meeting where two of the three people concerned do not seem to have been much bothered about the Irish position. The German Chancellor would appear to have done what he could in the circumstances. The Taoiseach seems to have derived a wrong impression, or at any rate to have conveyed to the public and the press a wrong impression, of what was said to him by the French President and the British Prime Minister. I had expected that in his own interests the Taoiseach would have today told us what they said&mdash;if they gave him grounds for believing that a package of the order of magnitude we were looking for was possible, but that, as the Press reports, fed by the Government spokesman, said, it might not come wholly in the form of grants, it might be partly in some soft loans <Col N="1008" /> and partly in some grants through the regional fund.  If the Taoiseach got that impression from these discussions, in fairness to himself he should convey that to the House.  The people are wondering whether he was conned by certain gentlemen or whether he misled himself or whether he was not misled but gave a wrong impression to the papers.  The Taoiseach should clarify that so that some of the doubts that surround the results of this discussion can be resolved. It is not good for a country that its head of Government should leave himself in a position where perhaps he was misled and does not make that clear.  I hope that the Taoiseach will clear himself of any imputations in this area, that he got it wrong, which may be incorrect.  I hope that the Taoiseach was misled, that he did not get it incorrect or mislead the Press.</P>
    <P>I would like the Taoiseach to tell us about his discussions with the British Prime Minister and about what happened at the European Council.  The Taoiseach said that the British Prime Minister said he would show the utmost goodwill and understanding of our position. I have my interpretation of that and of the press reports which enlarged on that, that Britain would not stand in our way.  From knowing the way the system of negotiation works I was aware that it was an absolutely fixed principle of French policy that there could be not transfer through the regional fund to Britain if France did not also benefit.  Having fought that battle over a period of 18 months from the time we came into Government until it was finally settled at the end of 1974 it was quite evident to me that the pressure of the Gaullists, the Taoiseach's allies, on the French President is such that he is not free to allow Britain to benefit from the regional fund unless France will benefit.  The final arrangement that Britain got was 26 per cent and France got about 16 per cent. France had to get substantially more than half of what Britain got or would not agree to the fund.  That was a crucial characteristic of the regional fund, the French unwillingness to let Britain benefit if France did not benefit. That being the case&mdash;obviously there could be no question of France <Col N="1009" /> benefiting from the regional fund for the purpose of EMS&mdash;I took it that if the British said they would not stand in our way they meant that they would not seek money from the regional fund and that therefore the regional fund would be left clear for Ireland and Italy.  There have been Press reports since that at the Brussels meeting the British Prime Minister sought transfers from the regional fund, and it has been suggested that it was this that sparked off the hostile reaction of the French President which contributed to the debacle of the meeting.  Will the Taoiseach enlighten us on this?  Was the Taoiseach misled by the British Prime Minister?  Did he, as I did, take it that the British would not seek transfers, the very act of doing which would spark off an immediate French veto?  Was that the impression the Taoiseach had from the British Prime Minister?  Did the British Prime Minister then at the meeting introduce that, knowing that in doing so he would spark off a French veto and bring the destruction of the system?  I am merely speculating on the basis of limited bits of information available.  I may be incorrect but the Taoiseach, from his point of view, should clear his record in the matter if he was misled by the British Prime Minister or if he was misled with regard to the recognition of the merits of our case for assistance by the French President.</P>
    <P>What remains to be done at this stage is for the Government, despite the damage they have done by the appalling confusion they have created, to endeavour to recover from that and pull themselves together and go back to negotiations and try to use the continuing German goodwill and perhaps French second thoughts about the action of their President which has made the france the vulnerable currency in the EMS.  The Taoiseach should use those points as leverage to extract from the members of the Community in the EMS on a bilateral or multilateral but non-Community basis the additional transfers that would make it possible for us to enter the system and not leave us in the position where our efforts to join it have failed not merely disastrously but in such confused circumstances as to <Col N="1010" /> leave a very bad taste in everybody's mouth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the EMS is concerned we have had one initial debate and two statements in the House by the Taoiseach, and at the end of that exercise people are more confused than they were before the Taoiseach first mentioned anything about EMS.  The people are left to try and sort out which of the four versions that we have had from Fianna Fáil spokesmen, from the Taoiseach down, is the actual offer made with regard to our entry to the EMS. The press have been used shamefully in order to give the people a feeling of wellbeing and confidence in the Government's handling of our negotiations in the EMS.</P>
      <P>One of the things that emerged early yesterday morning inside and outside the House was the frantic search by Fianna Fail for a scapegoat on which to blame the total mishandling of these negotiations. First the press were blamed by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  That Minister has had quite a lot of experience in that area recently.  The Minister blamed them at Clontarf and other members of the Fianna Fáil Government did so in Cork in relation to Mr. Chirac's visit here.  The Minister also blamed the press, on the radio.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in the absence of the Taoiseach, said yesterday on the Order of Business that the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party were to blame.  The reason he blamed the Labour Party in the House yesterday morning was because we had sought as one of the conditions of entry a genuine transfer of resources to the tune of £650 million, as if we had mentioned the figure of £650 million.  We did mention it; we said we thought it was inadequate. But, seeing that the Government considered it adequate, we went along with it.  We said that it would be impossible for us to enter short of that figure by way of grant and short of the other conditions which the Labour Party, in the interests of the people, laid down as their conditions for support of our entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a total sense of dismay.  The people have been stunned by the <Col N="1011" /> Government's mishandling of the negotiations.  The consequences for us could be severe.  I do not believe that nothing happened at the summit.  I think there were serious developments at the summit and that we are far worse off now than we were on Monday before the Taoiseach went to the summit meeting. One could quote extensively from statements by the Taoiseach and by the various Ministers&mdash;contradictory statements&mdash;but that has been done reasonably adequately by the previous speaker, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  However, there are other quotations that could be used to give us an insight into the amateur way in which the negotiations were conducted from the beginning by the Government.  The initial mistake was made at Bremen where we gave an enthusiastic reception to the proposed European Monetary System. When we were cautioned and when the British Prime Minister asked the Taoiseach during a side conference at that meeting to exercise some caution and to give consideration to other ways of achieving the same ends which would ensure safeguards for the weaker economies, the Taoiseach apparently dismissed him out-of-hand in what he might have regarded as a display of nationalism and a break with the ancient enemy.</P>

      <P>In the absence of an unequivocal denial by the Taoiseach, I am entitled to accept that it did take place. The consequences for us of that out-of-hand dismissal to even examine, or allow to be examined, other ways of achieving monetary stability within Europe could be costly to our interests and our future development.  The Taoiseach, again, gave an equivocal answer to whether or not this discussion between himself and the British Prime Minister had taken place.  He is engaging in what has come to be known as &ldquo;Lynch speak&rdquo;.  We have all examined the document presented to the House last week by the Taoiseach and we have all read the accounts given in that document of his meetings with the various Heads of State.  We were told that there was a tremendous amount of goodwill from the President of France and from the Chancellor of Germany. We were told that the Taoiseach came <Col N="1013" /> away from the meeting firmly convinced that that goodwill would be translated into transfers of resources; that that verbal goodwill would be translated into hard action and support for a transfer of resources on our entry into the EMS. We have seen what happened.  The Taoiseach was a victim of the more sophisticated continental version of &ldquo;Lynch speak&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, he fell for it and we have seen the disastrous results.</P>
      <P>We would have to go back a bit to see just how amateuirsh our negotiations were.  The Taoiseach engaged in a series of visits to Heads of State.  He put Ireland's case for a transfer of resources and he received assurances from the Heads of State that they had great understanding of, and sympathy for our position.  But a firm commitment was not given by them at any time that their expressions of sympathy and understanding would be translated into actual support when the time came to discuss hard cash by way of transfers.  One of the questions that we should ask, and which should be answered, related to the preparation that went before the series of visits and before the discussions took place.  One of the many contradictory things that emerged from press reports of the summit meeting was that, when the proposal that might have given Ireland some transfer of resources by way of grant was mooted, the Italians, as they were entitled to do, said &ldquo;Yes, we agree, but we must get the same in proportion to our circumstances&rdquo;, which would have meant extensively more in real cash terms.  In the series of visits which he made, the Taoiseach did not seek to meet Mr. Andreotti, the Italian representative at these talks.  During an RTE interview with John McAllese in Brussels after the meeting it dawned on the Taoiseach that such a meeting might have been a necessary exercise, indeed not only necessary but crucial to the outcome of the talks.  I will quote from the interview:</P>
      <P>John McAllese: Was there a misunderstanding between you and Chancellor Schmidt or&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach interrupted him here:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> The Taoiseach: No. I still believe that there is the utmost goodwill towards us.  There was certainly a very great degree of understanding of our position, and that was expressed by Chancellor Schmidt during the course of the Council meeting today. But unfortunately there were other members who were regarded as the less prosperous countries and they did, of course, expect that they proportionately would get what we would get.  So I think that was an inhibiting factor.</P>
    <P>It suddenly dawned on the Taoiseach, after the meeting, after the total failure and humiliation of the Government and the country, that one of the most important elements in these negotiations was to ensure that we would have the support of or at least an understanding with other countries in a similar position, that Ireland could not be made a special case and that if the EEC were to be used to channel money to Ireland, other countries in a similar economic position automatically would have access to similar resources.  This was not done, and it is one of the most serious aspects of the Government's preparation for these discussions.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know precisely what was offered at the summit meeting&mdash;it is impossible to get information on the conditions that were attached to the offer that was made.  From the information we have we can estimate what the result would be in terms of cash to this country.  It did not involve transfer of resources from the richer part of the Community to us.  Indeed if you examine it objectively, the reverse is the case&mdash;a loan, repayable, on which interest would be charged.  Under the offer that we now understand to have been made to us, we would have to pay substantially for the privilege of enjoying the EMS.</P>
    <P>One feels somewhat inhibited in this debate&mdash;one must try to be careful about what one will say&mdash;because we understand from the Taoiseach that we are still in what could be described as a negotiating position.  I honestly believe that if we fail to get acceptable entry terms, having picked on the Press and <Col N="1015" /> having tried to pick on the Opposition, the Government would try to make the charge that things said in this House to-day had undermined their position in regard to these negotiations.  However, there are things that can be said which by no stretch of the imagination could fall into the category of an undermining of any negotiations that may still take place.  One can only hope that any such negotiations will be more successful than those that have taken place so far.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his voyage to Europe for the EMS summit was somewhat like Columbus on his voyage to America.  The Taoiseach set off, he did not know where he was going, when he got there he did not know where he was and when he came back he did not know where he had been.  The only thing one can be definite about is that he did it all on borrowed money.  That is quite definite as far as the offer is concerned.</P>
    <P>The only thing we have been offered is the facility, which we could have had anyway, to borrow substantial sums of money.  In regard to the EMS offer, I cannot understand the Government, who have declared repeatedly that one of the most serious defects in our approach to our economy has been the extent of our foreign borrowing, and who declared that 13 per cent of GNP as foreign borrowing is exclussive and extremely damaging to our future progress and that therefore they intended to cut back substantially on that percentage of foreign borrowing.  If we are to take the figure that has been mentioned by way of borrowing, apparently we could get £1,125 million over a period of five years.  For that we would be subsidised to the extent of 3 per cent of the 9 per cent of chargeable interest, leaving us with a net 6 per cent interest payable.</P>
    <P>That means that in the first year we would get £225 million and a subsidy of £45 million, making a total income to us in the first year of £270 million.  The rate of interest we would pay on that in the first year would be £20 million, leaving a net income to us of £250 million.  After a five-year period we would have got all the money and all the interest subsidy, <Col N="1016" /> leaving us liable to pay, by way of interest, £100 million a year.  How can the Taoiseach or the Government even suggest that an offer entailing such repayments could be described as a transfer of resources or that it would in any way cushion us against entry?  During the transitional period, such a situation would have serious repercussions on our industrial sector.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to think that we have failed to negotiate acceptable terms for EMS entry and that we are just standing still&mdash;that if we do not succeed in any negotiations that may still be going on we can carry on the same trading terms with the UK, with the other EEC countries and the rest of the world.  That is not so.  As a result of the formation of the EMS involving six countries there is now a <i>de facto</i> two-tier EEC.  Mr. Tindemans put forward a proposal some years ago which was resisted successfully by the smaller countries but which is now a reality.  We now have <i>de facto</i> a two-tier EEC structure in which the stronger and richer economies will continue to grow stronger and richer while the poorer and weaker economies such as ours will become weaker and poorer.</P>
    <P>The UK have reserved their position with regard to EMS entry.  They have left the matter open until they see how things will develop.  Mr. Callaghan's Government have made no secret in a period of years of their total dissatisfaction with the operation of the CAP.  I believe that one of the conditions they will insist on for EMS entry is a total fundamental review of the operation of the CAP.  That is the only mechanism by which this country benefits in any way substantially from our membership of the Community.  If Great Britain succeeds and there is every possibility that she will succeed in negotiating a review of the operation of that system, such revision would undoubtedly be to our disadvantage.  These are two fundamental changes that will take place as a result of the summit that has proved to be so disastrous for us.</P>
    <P>I do not intend at this stage to go into any great detail on the EMS.  There will be an opportunity for doing so next <Col N="1017" /> week when, as the Taoiseach has told us, there will be a debate on the issue, but I must point out at this stage that the conditions and the offer that have been made to us are totally unacceptable so far as this party is concerned.  The Taoiseach has said he is not prepared to recommend either to the Government or to the House that the offer be accepted. Having regard to the gross mishandling of the situation that has occurred up to now in the negotiations I do not think it is possible to be offered conditions that would justify our joining the system.</P>
    <P>There is one question, though, that I must put to the Taoiseach.  If we cannot negotiate acceptable terms for entry at this stage and, consequently, if we decide to stay outside the EMS, what would be our position should Britain decide, say, in the autumn of next year, to join the system?  Would we then seek entry under the conditions which are now being offered or would we stay out?  The Taoiseach's statement regarding what took place at the summit meeting is notable mainly in one respect, that is, its lack of the detailed information that we should be given.  A request has been made to the Taoiseach to ensure that before the debate next week detailed information of all conditions attaching to the loan being offered and to the various other matters that have been raised in the course of this morning's statements be available to the House in order to make possible a meaningful discussion of the interest of the country in general and of the seriousness of the position arising from the mishandling of the situation by the Taoiseach, by his Ministers and by his advisers.  My thoughts in full and the approach of this party to the EMS will be put forward during the debate next week but in the meantime we trust that the Taoiseach will make available all the relevant and necessary detailed information.  We do not expect the Taoiseach to be a prophet.  A prophet can foresee the future but the Taoiseach cannot tell us what happened, let alone what might happen.  Surely it would be reasonable to expect that during the week-end he will be able to ascertain precisely what we were offered at the summit and what <Col N="1018" /> conditions were attached to that offer. We need this information in order to have a full debate on the matter next week.</P>

    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was critical of <Col N="1019" /> budgetary considerations being taken into account.  This would seem to indicate a lack of regard on the part of the Deputy for the taxpayer who, as Deputy Callanan reminded us, had to find £80 million this year in lieu of the derating of domestic dwelling and also a further £40 million in respect of the agricultural grant making a total of £120 million. Surely it is reasonable and proper to take into account for budgetary purposes the effect on the taxpayer of such changes.  We must be realistic regardless of what Deputies might try to do politically.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred, too, to town commissioners and said they are to be ignored.  This is not the case.  Town commissioners are not rating authorities but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; they have the power to adopt their estimates for town charges.  The only change that will take place as a result of this Bill is that county councils will be given power to adjust the town charges in order to bring them into line with the global limit that applies to the county rates for all local authorities.  Surely this is a logical follow-up to the idea of a global limit applying across the board.  In the past Deputies, sometimes at local council level, have complained bitterly when rates were increased by as much as 11 per cent in a year but now we find they are complaining that the increase is not enough.  That, in effect is what the opposition to this section amounts to.  It seems the Deputies want a situation in which there is no limit to increases in rates.  We must consider the attitude of the very many ratepayers to any such suggestion.  They would resent very much any attempt on our part to renege on our promise to afford them some protection and we are providing that protection in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same Deputy stated also that the local authorities will be told what rate to <Col N="1020" /> strike.  This is not correct.  The direction in the section specifies a maximum rate. This year that maximum rate was 11 per cent.  Therefore, the rate to be struck is not specified so that any rating authority is free to strike a rate so long as the rate struck does not exceed the upper limit. Last year with the 11 per cent upper limit a total of 16 rating authorities did not require the full 11 per cent which was permissible.  They were able to meet their expenses and their annual commitments without reaching this 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said that 1978 was not over yet, we have not come to the end of it and there were councils who would be laying off workers because of the inadequacy of the money available to them.  He blamed it again on the 11 per cent.  I asked him to name one council or local authority; he failed to do so. It possibly is not so at all.  Indeed, some councils in order to spend the moneys available to them have been obliged to give overtime.  Another member of Deputy Fitzpatrick's party raised this six weeks ago with regard to Dublin Corporation.  It transpired that what he was saying was incorrect.  It was duly contradicted and it was accepted by everyone that the contradiction was correct and his allegations were incorrect. We have no evidence of such a situation.</P>
    <P>Under this section of the Bill we are protecting the taxpayer, the ratepayer and the Exchequer.  Surely it is only realistic that we should protect the taxpayer who is now footing up to 60 per cent of the total local authority annual Bill.  He should be protected.  We have approaching budgets, as we had last year.  We had instances of the Opposition parties, particularly the Labour Party, insisting that there should be tax concessions in the context of a pay agreement.  Now they want to impose more taxes.  That is what would happen if there was no upper limit.  It would mean imposing further taxation on the taxpayers who are very many, and not always in the more well off section.  We all pay taxes.  Our constituents generally are paying their share of the tax bill, so surely they are entitled to protection as well as the people who continue to pay rates.  We are approaching local elections <Col N="1021" /> next June, six months away, and it is only fair to conclude that the councillors at all local authority levels would be endeavouring to keep down the rates as they did in the past.</P>

The only reason he put forward was that it was not adequate for them last year, that they were going to have to dispense with the services of members because of the limit.  The only conclusion we can reach from that approach is that he wants rates in this current year to be increased by far more than the 11 per cent limit.  Approaching local elections under previous circumstances there is no way he would be saying this, but now it appears that the taxpayer is the person who would suffer most, it should be done and therefore we should impose more taxes on the said taxpayer.</P>
      <P>However, we undertook in our commitment with regard to derating to protect the interests of the commercial and industrial end, the people who would continue to pay rates.  We are doing so in this Bill and we are also tying it in with budgetary matters and protecting the taxpayer who is now footing the bill instead of the ratepayers of the past who are now derated.</P>

      <P>When we were last speaking on this the Minister was quite excited about the prospect of the Gallery filling up, or else he was just kicking for touch until such time as his advisers could script out the answers to the questions that were asked.  I regret that in his reply now the dismal performance of other members of the Cabinet seems to have spilled over on to that side of the House in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions in relation to section 10 of this Bill were raised. Instead of getting replies on how it would function we have been talking about local elections, taxpayers, the underpaid sections of the community and <Col N="1022" /> Uncle Tom Cobley and all, and we have not come back to the nub of this thing. The Minister is trying to skate over a total change in the way in which local government will from now on function. He is confusing legislation with his honeymoon period in office and assuming that the performance in the Custom House and the Department of the Environment will always be equivalent to what has happened in the last year.</P>
    <P>If that is the basis on which the Minister for the Environment proposes to draft legislation it is an extraordinarily inadequate basis.  We are not talking about how the Minister performed over the last year.  That is not relevant to this Bill.  We are talking about something that is going to become the law of the land.  If we want to talk about precedent either in the last year or in previous years the outcome of that precedent is that in every area local government has come into conflict with central Government over the allocation of resources or over economy the body that has won out time and again has been central Government. The only area that comes immediately to mind in the last administration where some degree of autonomy was restored to local authority was capital expenditure, where in housing local authorities did not have to submit schemes of more than 15 units or more for approval from the Customs House.</P>
    <P>The history of local government, which is buried deep into the structure of section 10 of the Bill, is that every time Fianna Fáil come into office in one way or another they chip away at the autonomy and powers of local government. In the second inter-party Government, the amendment of the Managerial Act and the role of the manager in all of this are significant.  The role of the county manager, which to that day in 1955 was unshackled in any form, was modified with what is commonly referred to as the section 4 clause in the 1955 legislation brought in by Deputy &ldquo;Pa&rdquo; O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>This section 10 is a sophisticated instrument. It lacks all of the crudity of the Deputy Kevin Boland blunderbuss that was applied to Dublin Corporation and <Col N="1023" /> Bray Urban District Council in 1969. Even that side of the House learned something.  They have learned that you do not kill or abolish a local authority if their finances go beyond what you yourself can afford.  This is a much milder, sophisticated, but nevertheless equally effective system of neutering the financial autonomy of a local body.  The Minister has not gone through the section. He has not explained how it is going to function.  He has not explained the latter clauses in relation to the role of the manager.  Instead, he has been attempting to kick up a bowl of dust in this House, throwing the responsibility for any kind of comment back to the other side of the House.  He has been talking about local elections and about putting rates back on houses, when what this House is now doing or is supposed to do&mdash;perhaps I am not here long enough to understand the real processes&mdash;is to make laws on Committee Stage.  Instead of getting replies we are getting a lot of hot air from the other side.</P>
    <P>The Minister's main defence of the extraordinary powers he is taking into his hands in section 10 is that there is a Fianna Fáil commitment in the manifesto to protect the interest of ratepayers who would not benefit from exemption under this overall legislation, and that they are going to protect them and protect the taxpayer and, included in that, non-residential ratepayers of one kind or another.  If the Minister is taking that responsibility upon himself I would like to know, as Fianna Fáil's Minister for the Environment, what class of responsibility does he regard the Fianna Fáil majority Members of the local county council of Clare, for example, as having? Have they any responsibility in this regard?  What autonomy or responsibility does he regard as resting with the majority Fianna Fáil councillors in Cork Corporation?  Have they any responsibility to the taxpayers or are they not covered by the manifesto in the same way that the Minister is?  Because repeatedly coming from that side of the House is a total denial of the essential role of local democracy.  It is not local <Col N="1024" /> democracy as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned; it is local administration.  The Government are consistently and regularly, whenever they get the opportunity, turning the screw tighter and tighter and tighter to the extent that the degree of autonomy and individualism which should be the cornerstone of our local democratic system is being reduced and replaced by a centralised government.</P>
    <P>That is bad enough for openers, but my regret in this instance is that the monitoring and control of local government as a result of this legislation taking effect will not even rest with the Minister's own Department.  As I said on previous occasions, it will now shift out of the Custom House and over to the Department of Finance in a more savage and direct way than it previously was. The reality of this provision is going to be that a principal officer or even an assistant principal officer in the Department of Finance is going to start dictating, by way of directive as set out in this section, to local authorities up and down the country through the auspices of the Department of the Environment how much money they can have and how much money they can not have.  If that is the case, the Minister knows that, irrespective of him being Minister or not, the day may come when someone who does not necessarily have his commitment to local government but has a somewhat lesser commitment will sit in the office with this legal instrument in his hands.  That is what we have to deal with.  The day may come when there really will be no point in having local elected councillors.  Have no fear about it, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, this was one of the last two major reserved functions a local authority had and we have already heard noises from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy giving out about the state of planning legislation here.  It is quite clear that it will not be long, if Fianna Fáil have their way, before even the reserved function as regards the making of a development plan will be seen as constituting some kind of danger and that will go too.  At the moment this was a major reserved function with limits to it.  There were <Col N="1025" /> always limits to it but the limits were extreme limits and, as we saw in the Kevin Boland incident, were not used all that frequently and when they were used there was some kind of public recognition of what actually was happening and the Minister had publicly to chop off the head of a local authority and not do it in the dark or behind closed doors, which is now going to be the effect of this provision in section 10.</P>
    <P>Why bother having local elected representatives?  Why bother having them at all if we have a county managerial system and a local administrative staff and this provision in section 10?  What are the local representatives going to do?  Are they going to open the door for delegations from one part of the county or another to come and see the manager to ask the manager will he spend money or not?  This is implicit in all of this, and the Minister has not effectively answered that argument. Instead he has been talking about local elections.  We are talking about the making of law, and this law when it does become law will allow the Minister to set a limit to the amount of money that a local authority can raise unilaterally by way of the rates in its area.  He does not say, for example, as he could have said, in order to protect the taxpayer and because we are abolishing rates on residential properties and associated properties that he would confine the direction of his limit to that portion of the rateable valuations within the area and leave it to the local representatives to be answerable themselves to the businessmen of that particular community or the ratepayers of that community who, as the Minister has readily conceded, have in the past been answerable to the extent that coming up to election years they would reduce the cost of the rates for the very reason that they were acutely aware of how accountable they were.  &ldquo;Out of the mouths of babes&rdquo;, I think the quotation is.  The Minister is not a stranger to it, so it is a spurious argument, it is a dishonest argument, to say that they are taking this overall power into their hands in order to protect the interests of the non-residential ratepayer because their interests <Col N="1026" /> are presumably protected by the people they themselves elect on to local councils.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously trying to tell me that the Fianna Fáil councillors in County Clare would not represent the interests of the business community?  Is he seriously trying to suggest that the councillors of Cork Corporation who are in the majority members of the Fianna Fáil Party would turn around and consistently milk the business community because they do not represent them?  Is that what the Minister is saying, because it is implicit in his argument?  If that is what he is saying, that he as Minister for the Environment does not trust Fianna Fáil councillors up and down the country, let him say that loudly and clearly in this House and at the next Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis.  Let him not hide behind a dishonest attempt to say that he is protecting the weaker sections of the community.  They do not pay rates and they will not be hit by this provision, and it is a dishonest argument to suggest that he is protecting the lower paid members of the community who do not have to pay rates anyway.</P>
    <P>The first obvious amendment to this provision is to confine the direction of the limit to the categories of buildings which would become exempt from the payment of rates as a result of this overall legislation becoming law.  That is the first obvious amendment.  Let us just look at that limit well.  The Minister, confusing his own period in office with the creation of law, talks about the performance of the 11 per cent limit last year. He has said quite accurately and correctly that indeed many local authorities including the two that he quoted in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency&mdash;Carrickmacross and Clones were the two towns he mentioned&mdash;as having not needed the 11 per cent.  He remarks with some degree of surprise that this should be so.  I would like to know if he is still surprised at the figure, what he has been learning in the Department of the Environment for the last year, because if he seriously thinks that every local authority has exactly the same percentage need in terms of an increase of money due to it and that one single limit <Col N="1027" /> will be sufficient, then unfortunately this country is in for a bad period of stewardship from the Custom House.  In the foot of today's <i>Irish Times</i> there is a story in relation to population surveys which I only had an opportunity to scan. The population survey, which regrettably we have to take in the unfortunate and very regrettable absence of the census which we should now have, shows that the population is growing at a rate even faster than had been anticipated, but nobody is suggesting that it is growing at the same rate in every county in the country or in every local authority in the country.  It is that fundamental fact of population rate of growth alone that has generated a need for a source of services at a differential rate of demand in each local authority.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;limit&rdquo; is mentioned a number of times in this section.  Despite repeated questions to the Minister on Committee Stage and at other times in the House he has refused to give any indication how the limit is to be calculated or if it will be a differential limit for different authorities.  We are being asked to approve a section which gives those explicit powers, where the manager becomes the spy in the cab, as Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested, or the runner in the council, who will carry out the provisions of this Bill on behalf of the Minister.  We do not know what the limit will be.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the autonomy of local authorities.  If a new subsection was added to this section, which showed local authorities how the limit might be calculated and the factors which would be made an essential part of any formula for calculation, we would have less fears about its provisions.  We have had some interesting general speeches which have not got to the core of the section, one of the longest in the Bill.  The Minister has not shown us how this limit will be calculated nor has he even suggested in the section some of the factors that will have to be taken into account in considering the limit for local authorities.</P>
    <P>In other European countries the State directly finances the expenditure of local authorities.  In the Netherlands the local <Col N="1028" /> authority expenditure accounts for 50 per cent of overall public expenditure and 14 per cent of GNP grants from central Government account for 88 per cent of local authority revenue.  There is a degree of autonomy in the receipt of that money which is totally absent from the provisions of this Bill.  There is a similar type of provision under a different system of money collection in Denmark.  The way in which an increase in money for any local authority in any of those places is calculated is on the basis of certain objective factors, such as population increase, the structure of that particular population, the rate of organisation, the industrial growth in the area and so on.  The variables involved in the Netherlands can amount to as high as 20.  None of them depends on how much the Minister for the Environment can bargain around the Cabinet table at the end of any year prior to the financial year starting with the budget in February of the following year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not explicitly told the House how this money is calculated but he has said quite clearly to me, in reply to a repeated question from me on the adjournment debate, that one day he would tell me how a Government meeting actually works and then I would be the wiser.  The only information which came from the Minister that night was that statement.  The inference, until we are told otherwise, is that the Minister for the Environment did not know on 23 November what he would have available for local authorities and he did not know last Tuesday night what he would have. He still does not know.  He knows even less now because the cash they thought was coming from Brussels on 1 January, has started to disappear.</P>
    <P>There is total confusion in the Department of the Environment and with the Minister and his Minister of State about how much money will be available. There is no guarantee of the smallest amount of money a local authority can get because there is no way in which that money is to be calculated or safeguarded by reference to legislation in this section. We are left with a Bill which mentions the consent of the Minister for Finance at the beginning of it, no guarantees for <Col N="1029" /> calculation of the limit and, consequently, a legislative factor which will result in the Minister for the Environment of the day having to fight his corner with other Ministers around the Cabinet table for a portion of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that I may appear to be doing that, but that is not my intention.  We could have made longer Second Reading speeches and made detailed comments on each provision, but I will accept your direction.  I would like to hear from the Minister or the Minister of State, if they are so concerned about protecting the taxpayer and if they cannot trust their own councillors at local level to protect the payers of non-residential rates, would they not at least limit the area of control implicit in section 10 in regard to the limitation of finance to the properties which will be exempt from the payment of rates as a result of this Bill?  I would like the Minister and his advisers to take serious account of that because we will expect something from them in this area on Report Stage.  It is a reasonable request which meets the requirements stated by Deputy Callanan in particular and in his quieter moments by the Minister in regard to having some degree of financial control over local authorities as a result of this provision becoming law.</P>
      <P>Let us match the control with the quality of the provision and let us confine that control to the area which will come into benefit as a result of what has already happened and which this Bill subsequently makes a fact and not use it as an opportunity to control the total amount of revenue any local authority can raise.  That is not an unreasonable request.  It is strictly to the point and it meets the objective of the Minister without challenging the principle of the Bill or suggesting that rates should increase. It meets his explicit commitment in the manifesto and at the same time protects to a certain extent the autonomy of local representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> Section 10 (3) (e) states:</P>
    <P>it shall be the duty of the manager&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  before the adoption by the authority of an estimate of expenses relating to the local financial year specified in the direction, to prepare for the authority a statement indicating the effect of the direction in relation to such estimate.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister envisage this functioning?  Let us take the case of a local authority who can no longer afford to wait until the Minister finds out how much money will be in the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; and decide to proceed with their estimates, as Dublin Corporation will do next week. They may find, as a result of the process of costing and projection, that their estimates would require a revenue of £100 million, as in the case of Dublin Corporation. Subsequent to the establishment of that figure the Minister may indicate that the maximum revenue which the local authority may raise is in the region of, say, £93 million.  There would be a shortfall of £7 million if the original estimate and the proposed additional services of the local authority were to be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>This section states that, before the authority can adopt their estimate of expenses, it is the duty of the manager to prepare for the authority a statement indicating the effect of the direction in relation to such an estimate.  I want a clear explanation of the meaning of &ldquo;duty&rdquo;.  Will the manager say that everything must be reduced by 7 per cent across the board?  He simply cannot do that.  Some local authority services are statutory and must be provided.  A building contract cannot be reduced as that would be a capital item.  Wages and certain other costs could not be reduced by 7 per cent.  In reality the estimates would have to be revised in other areas.</P>
    <P>What is the full legal understanding of the phrase &ldquo;duty of the manager&rdquo;?  Does the use of the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; confer on the manager the authority to prepare his estimate of the effect of the direction in relation to estimates?  If so, I submit that the Minister is taking away a further <Col N="1031" /> degree of authority and antonomy from local public representatives.  He is enabling the manager to order the range of priorities for expenditure within the amount available.  If a manager wished to interpret it in that way he could say that he is a public servant and it is his duty.  Public representatives like Deputy Callanan could be countered by the law agent of Galway County Council saying that the manager is right in his interpretation of the law and consequently he must order priorities.  He could decide to do things with which Deputy Callanan or other members of the local authority would not agree.</P>
    <P>I want to know how the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; is to be interpreted.  I am not a lawyer.  I have difficulty in reading a lot of legal English.  I have seen a law agent in operation at local council meetings and I have seen how one interpretation of a clause as against another can completely change the direction of a meeting and the subsequent democratic decision.  As Labour Party spokesperson on the Environment, I want to be quite clear how this will be interpreted by the Minister and his officials in the event of an appeal by local councillors who disagree with the interpretation of the law agent or the manager.</P>
    <P>These are the two critical areas in this section.  We are no longer talking about the abolition of domestic rates but about the local taxation base.  The combined effect of these two provisions will be seriously to undermine the autonomy of public representatives to an extent which is not fully realised, except by the official in the Department of Finance whose hand is so clearly evident in the drafting of this legislation.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with the latter question first.</P>

      <P>I will refer to Deputy Quinn's allegation that the powers vested in elected members of local authorities have been practically taken way by this Bill, particularly by section 10.  I would ask the Deputy to read a booklet published by the Department of local Government in April 1975 which sets out clearly the powers vested in <Col N="1032" /> elected members of local authorities.  If he would read that book he would see quite clearly that about 99.9 per cent of such powers will remain with local representatives following the enactment of this Bill.</P>

      <P>That is a good point.  I would like to read paragraph 4 of a letter which was issued in October 1969 by the Department of Education in the context of the teacher being in <i>loco parentis</i> so far as the child is concerned and its relevance to the Deputy's supplementary.</P>
      <P>As has already been pointed out the sanction for use of corporal punishment in schools does not arise from Departmental regulations.  It proceeds from the legal relationship between pupil and teacher, which is that the teacher stands in <i>loco parentis</i> and therefore may use such means of discipline and correction as might be used by a wise and prudent parent.  In that the teacher stands in <i>loco parentis</i> it follows that the parents of a particular school or of a particular educational area, if they object to the use of corporal punishment, may insist, through the school manager or the appropriate educational authority, that the use of corporal punishment does not form part of the school disciplinary code.  Because of this a manager of a school may forbid the use of corporal punishment in the school.  On the other hand no parent has the right to claim that a child of his who through indiscipline disrupts the life of a school should be retained in that school.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that a parent in law does not have the right to strike a child?  The Minister said he is not sure that he has the power to change regulations.  Surely a Minister in a sovereign parliament has the right to change the law in any way he wishes?

      <P>The Deputy's second question dealt with power to change the regulations.  If the Deputy reads carefully the statement which I did not succeed in finishing yesterday he will see that I had the views of the people who are involved <Col N="1036" /> in education.  There is a point of view that you can send a ukase to the factory workers and must make them obey it, but I do not think our society works that way.  As Poignant said in his report on west European education, if you do not have the people directly involved, namely the teachers, convinced of any move you make in a school, it is very difficult to make that thing stick.  It is all right saying that a dictate should go forth, but it is a different thing altogether to force the people who are working in that situation and who feel confident that a certain rule is necessary and who guarantee they will not abuse the rule.</P>

      <P>The following is the present position in relation to the provision of Dental Hospital premises in Cork and Dublin. A contract for the provision of new premises for the Cork Dental Hospital was negotiated in November 1977 and work on the site commenced in December 1977.  It is anticipated that the building work will be completed by November 1979.</P>
      <P>Following the decisions to transfer the faculty of dentistry to TCD that college formally indicated its desire that a new Dublin Dental Hospital should be located at the St. James's Hospital site. A project team was established by the St. James's Hospital board to prepare a brief for the design team for the long-term development of the general hospital.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority were informed in November 1977, by my Department that it had been decided that a clinical science building should be included in the brief for the St. James's Hospital project and that the proposed new Dublin Dental Hospital should be located on the St. James's site.</P>
      <P>The general development plan which has been completed by the project team makes provision for a clinical science building to include facilities for dental education and training.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The time lag in submitting appointments for sanction makes it impossible to have up-to-date, accurate figures on any temporary unemployment among qualified national school teachers.  In any even, I am satisfied that the improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio, which I announced to take effect from 1 July 1978 and 1 January 1979, and the creation of additional posts as remedial teachers are sufficient to provide posts for all such teachers to take up appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not.  It is an exceedingly difficult thing to do because there is a time lag so far as sanction for appointments is concerned.  We have no way of knowing how many teachers qualify and do not take up teaching immediately, no way of knowing how many indulge in further research and no way of knowing how many leave the country.  There is a small percentage of such people each year.</P>

      <P>With the permission of <Col N="1048" /> the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to provide a regional technical college or other third-level education institution in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The regional technical colleges were set up to serve designated regions, each region comprising a number of counties or parts of counties.  North Mayo is part of the region served by Sligo Regional Technical College and South Mayo is part of the region served by Galway Regional Technical College.  Both these colleges have recently been extended to meet the expanding requirements of their respective regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the increasing pressure in County Mayo for a third-level institution. Will he state if there are specific criteria that he would wish to have before a regional college could be established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The regional colleges, with the addition of the college at Tralee which was included recently, were set up at the locations as a result of an inquiry held in the late 1960s and the recommendations made by that inquiry.  They were placed strategically to cover certain areas.  I know there has been a request for Mayo and, strangely enough, for Cavan for a regional technical college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take into consideration the size of County Mayo and the amount of travelling involved for the thousands of students who presently attend the regional colleges in Sligo and Galway?  It would appear much more logical to have a central college in Mayo to serve that county and also Roscommon rather than having the students travel north and south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that Mayo is a large county.  The areas, particularly in the western part, stretch out very far away from Sligo.  As of now there are no plans for a third-level college in Mayo.</P>

Regardless of what the Minister inherited from the previous Government, which he mentioned in reply to a previous supplementary, can the Minister say whether the pupils of schools from catchment areas which were amalgamated are entitled to continue to get free transport?</P>

      <P>They are.  What is called the B scheme was introduced.  If the Department spokesman had done his job properly he would have indicated to the school being taken over the terms under which the scheme would operate. In respect of that scheme there is a condition which states that, if the number availing of the scheme falls short of seven in two successive periods, the scheme may be discontinued.  That was the term under which the transport was initially offered.  If that condition is not satisfied the scheme will suffer.  In respect of the conditions which were conveyed to the people at the time of the amalgamation, all those conditions are being honoured.  I came across a case where there was some misunderstanding. In that regard I had that omission corrected. If the Deputy is aware of any departures from the promises given to the people at the time of amalgamation, I will have them examined if I am given details.</P>

      <P>From my own knowledge as a member of the Government that introduced the free transport scheme, is it not the case that many amalgamations were only finally arrived at by agreement as a result of an open-ended promise of transport to the pupils of the catchment area of the school that was closed?  That was the manner in which the scheme was sold in quite a number of cases.</P>

      <P>Though I should like to read through this document in relation to the reserved functions of local authority members I will not do so in case I would be accused of filibustering. Among other things, elected members of local authorities can initiate any scheme and direct the county manager to carry out investigations with a view to implementing schemes.  They can fix the priority lists of improvement works on roads.  They can also fix schemes for the letting of local authority houses.  They are only a few of about 100 important powers still enjoyed by local authority members.  They can direct the country or city manager to perform any function which he is legally entitled to do.  They have full control over the borrowing of money for and on behalf of the local authority.  They still have powers regarding the making, revoking and amendment of by-laws.  It is therefore not correct to say that their powers are being eroded by this section.</P>
      <P>The second important question raised by Deputy Quinn was in regard to the functions of county managers in the context of this section.  Paragraph (e) of subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>it shall be the duty of the manager&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  before the adoption by the authority of an estimate of expenses relating to the local financial year specified in the direction, to prepare for the authority a statement indicating the effect of the direction in relation to such estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The form of statement to be made by the manager under this section will have to meet the requirement that it should show the effect on the estimates of the directive mentioned in paragraphs (c) and (d). How exactly he would frame that statement would be, and of course is, left to the manager's own judgment and professional expertise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of clarification of that point and so that we may both remember the words we used, the point I was trying to make was whether the manager will order priorities in estimating the effect of adhering to the Government's set limit or whether the local authority will do this.  I am concerned about the words used by the Minister to the effect that the manager would prepare for the Minister an estimate of how the new limited rate will operate and will affect services.  The Minister has confirmed my worst suspicions because in effect he has told us that the estimates will be prepared, not for members of local authorities but for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely a matter for members of local authorities to decide on priorities within the limit laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister did not mention them in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many other matters raised, too, to which I have not referred yet.  I would remind Deputy Quinn that the County Management Act, 1940, placed a duty on managers to advise and assist their councils in regard to the performance of their statutory functions.  This has always been part and parcel of the role of managers.  Therefore, there is nothing new about managers having this function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Quinn and Fitzpatrick said there are numerous reasons for section 10 not being operated.  If we are to ensure that there will not be imbalances as between one service and another within the local authority services, it is very important that section 10 be operated in full.  For example, it would not be correct <Col N="1093" /> for any council to spend 60 per cent of the finance available to them on the maintenance and improvement of roads at the expense of repairs to houses, nor would it be correct for them to spend a percentage of that level on house repairs as against the maintenance of other services such as water and sewerage schemes.</P>

      <P>County managers and engineers are meeting elected representatives on a regional basis in relation to roads, houses, water and sewerage schemes and many other services and are working out for themselves satisfactory programmes for the coming year.  Therefore, it is totally inaccurate to allege that there will be only one meeting this year in respect of the striking of rates for 1979.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn raised a very important matter when he related this section to the situation of county committees of agriculture.  These committees must work within guidelines and limits laid down by law.  They cannot expend in any year more than what was expended in the previous year.</P>
      <P>I should like, too, to repudiate the numerous suggestions that were offered concerning the making of decisions in respect of the limit to be imposed.  It was alleged that a principal officer in the Department of Finance is responsible for such decisions.  All these decisions are taken by both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment on foot of their mature consideration of all aspects of the situation.</P>
      <P>Having derated domestic dwellings we must also protect other people and ensure that no undue burden is placed on other ratepayers such as farmers, business people, hoteliers and industrialists who provide employment for a large sector of our community.  Of course, we must protect the taxpayer including those within the PAYE system, but the only way in which they can be protected is by the operation of section 10 of this Bill.  Therefore, the arguments put forward by the Deputy would not stand up under scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am strongly opposed to section 10 because I am satisfied that by imposing a limit on local authorities as to the amount of rates they should levy or as to the amount of finance they can provide, the Government are taking away any useful function which local authorities generally can perform and <Col N="1095" /> are restricting the exercise by these bodies of a discretion to provide reasonable budgets to enable them to carry out necessary schemes within their area.  For that reason the whole structure of local government will suffer and in effect there will be an end to local government and a centralisation of what we know now as local government.</P>
      <P>The Minister when he last intervened stated that section 10 is necessary in order to protect the ratepayer, the taxpayer and the Exchequer.  From whom is the Minister protecting the ratepayer, the taxpayer and the exchequer?  He is protecting them from elected local representatives, people who have been elected to serve on local authorities by their neighbours, the people in their own locality who know and trust them.  I suggest to the Minister for the Environment that there is no necessity to protect the Exchequer, the ratepayer or the taxpayer from local representatives because local representatives have in the past behaved in a responsible manner with a commitment to the raising of money from the rates and to the spending of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is conceded by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As conceded by the Minister, I pointed out earlier that on a few occasions in the history of this State the Minister for Local Government moved against local authorities and dissolved them because he said they did not discharge their statutory functions.  On each of those occasions, without exception they were removed from office, not for striking too high a rate, but for not striking a sufficient rate, for economising and sparing the ratepayers, for not spending as much money as the Minister for Local Government thought they should spend.  That is the record of local councils throughout the years and I defy contradiction on it.  We have a more recent example of councils behaving in a reasonable manner out of the mouth of the Minister himself here today.  The Minister was putting the case that if this <Col N="1096" /> section 10 is omitted from the Bill local authorities will run amok and strike rates regardless, that they will raise money and spend money regardless, but that has not been the experience since the Minister started to assume powers which he has not got over those authorities.  In fact the Minister has been operating section 10 of this Bill since 1 November 1977.  He issued a directive to local authorities at that time before last year's estimates were agreed upon, before last year's rates were struck.  The directive to local authorities was that none of them was to exceed an increase of 11 per cent on the previous year. What do we find?  We find out of the Minister's own mouth that local authorities acted in such a reasonable manner and went into the Estimates in such a careful and businesslike fashion that 16 of them, including two in my constituency, came to the conclusion that because of savings and credit balances or for one reason or another they did not want 11 per cent and they struck a rate at an increase of less than 11 per cent on the previous year.  Is not that evidence?  I put it to the Minister, through the Chair, that local authorities will continue to behave in a reasonable way.  One would think, to listen to the Minister and to hear his argument against opposition to section 10, that rates were utterly removed and there was no such thing as rates any longer. One would also think that local representatives would never again have to submit themselves for election and secure the votes of people in their area. Of course there will still be the best check possible on local representatives to encourage them to behave in a reasonable manner.  They will have to submit themselves to the local electorate and secure the confidence of that electorate if they want to remain in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very substantial amount of local revenue still comes from rates&mdash;rates that will be raised on and paid by the business people of the areas in which these county councillors live.  The farming community must still pay rates if their holdings are over £20 valuation, and the larger farmers have been brought more effectively into the rating <Col N="1097" /> system.  Local representatives will be responsible to these people.  Every huckster's shop in the country and every small businessman will be liable for rates.  Maybe the millionaires or people approaching that category living in private houses will not be liable for rates but the small man who is making his livelihood out of a business will be liable for rates and the local representative will see to it that he does not displease that man and that he does not act in a manner that will seem irresponsible to the ratepayers by whom he will have to be elected in the next local election and the one after, if he is alive then and still wishes to remain in public life.  This is the reality, and not the make-believe climate in which the Minister and his Minister of State are living and arguing. Local representatives have never been irresponsible in regard to the striking of rates and the spending of money.  They have never been extravagant.  The opposite is the case and the records of this House and in the Minister's Department will show that.  Even since the Minister started to impose an 11 per cent increase it was not availed of when it was not necessary.</P>
    <P>I was alarmed to hear the Minister of State spelling out this section 10 even more clearly than I understood it.  I merely regard it as an objectionable section that imposes an unreasonable restriction on local representatives, but I did understand the Minister for the Environment to say that he was leaving with local authorities the right and the discretion to spend the money which they raised as they thought fit themselves, presumably after they had taken care of certain statutory matters which they would have to provide for. However, if I understand correctly the remarks of the Minister of State, not alone is this upper limit going to be imposed over the whole country in a blanket way but each council can be told by the Minister how much to spend on repairs, on county roads and on environmental matters.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am glad to have that on the record because the Minister of State certainly gave the opposite impression. We will probably have to tease that out a bit more before we are finished.</P>
      <P>I rose on this occasion to defend the public representatives of this country from the attack that is being made on them by the Minister for the Environment. The Minister, when he last spoke, alleged quite unreasonably that what this side of the House want is the unlimited raising of money and spending of money by public representatives.  We want no such thing.  I want public representatives to be treated and respected as they always were.  If they behave in an unreasonable manner the best people to deal with them are the electors, just as the best people to deal with the Members of this House if they do not behave as they want them to behave are the electors. That is the way democracy works. If we are going to have local democracy that is the way it should continue to work.  If we do not want local democracy we should scrap these councils and tell the local representatives that their services are not required and operate the whole thing from the Custom House or Government Buildings, but as long as we have local democracy it should operate on the basis that local representatives will in the future, as in the past, behave in a reasonable manner and if they are to be brought to task by anybody they will be brought to task by their masters, the people who elected them.  That is as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should avail of his presence in the House this evening to tell us when he proposes to notify the local authorities what rate they may strike in respect of next year.  He should tell this House why estimates meetings are being adjourned all over the country.  He should tell the House, if he knows, why the estimates meeting of Cavan County <Col N="1100" /> Council which was fixed for Tuesday, 19 of this month, has now been adjourned until next year.  How in the name of patience are local authorities going to run their business, how are they going to run the affairs of the county, if they do not know until perhaps one-twelfth of the year in which they are operating has elapsed?  If they do not know what amount of money they may have, what amount of money they may raise, how will they know what schemes they may embark upon?  Is all this not a waste of valuable time?  Is it not a waste of the valuable time of professional people such as engineers and other people who are employed by local authorities but cannot give the service that they should be giving because the Minister cannot make up his mind or the Government will not let him make up his mind to tell them what money they may spend next year?</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on this note on this occasion that my objection to this section is, in a nutshell, that by limiting the amount of revenue it is limiting and restricting the services and the jurisdiction of local councils.  I want to again put on the record that these people have behaved reasonably in the past under the old system and they have shown, the whole 16 of them, that they are prepared to act reasonably in the future.  This section is quite unnecessary and should be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all must be convinced that section 10 is by far and away the most far-reaching section in so far as it applies to local government here.  If enacted it will undermine in a most serious far-reaching way the existing powers vested in local authorities.  It will, moreover, deal a death blow to local democracy here as we have known it to exist.  This section, together with section 11, contains in it the power to destroy local government in this country, and for the Minister of State to stand up here a short time ago and to state that there was no such limitation of powers of the members of local authorities involved in this section, that they still retain, in his words, 99.5 per cent of the powers vested in them is not, to say the least, in accordance with the facts.  The powers <Col N="1101" /> vested in members of local authorities have for some years past been limited. The main powers have been reposed in our county managers.  The executive functions were performed by them, but the primary and fundamental power vested in a member of a local authority and his colleagues was power in respect of money, power to provide the essential finances, to implement the essential services for their people.  In the striking of the rate, the provision of money for essential services lay the power vested in members of local authorities.  That power is being removed in this section.  I defy contradiction on that statement. The Minister for Local Government Deputy Sylvester Barrett, and his colleague the Minister of State, Deputy J. O'Leary, are staring me in the face as I make that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the yellow book.  All the limited powers which apply to members of local authorities revolve around the fundamental of money.  Take that away and nothing is left.  Absolutely nothing of any consequence to the people or their public representatives is left.  Members of local authorities are now subject to control not merely by the Minister for Local Government but also by the Minister for Finance.  It is a pity the Minister allowed himself to become subservient in such a direct, formal way to the Minister for Finance.  That is the position.  The exercise is complete control over the amount of money which shall be provided.  If members of local authorities have the temerity to increase the estimates by any amount for an essential purpose the county manager and the Minister are brought into it and the rate is sent back to the Minister.  The increase sought is nullified by him.  This places members of local authorities in shackles.  It must undermine their confidence in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This makes a mockery of estimate meetings because when councillors sit down to work out the various things required in respect of roads, housing, sanitary services and so forth they are confined to an overall limit.  The freedom <Col N="1102" /> councillors had in the past is gone under this section.  They are now confined to controls and limitations.  Despite this the Minister of State has the audacity to imply that the powers still lie with the managers.  What happens if, due to some type of emergency, such as severe weather, flood, fire or storm, a supplementary estimate is required?  Up to now members could, by a majority, decide to provide for such contingency by a supplementary estimate.  That power is gone and they must seek sanction from the Minister for any extra money required.  It is obvious to all of us that since the Minister will have control in such a rigid form at the outset of the amount of money to be provided in any given year that he is not likely to condone increases in estimates for any purpose.</P>
    <P>Another very important power which local authorities had was the invocation of what is known as section 4 to direct managers to do certain things.  What are the powers now vested in members under section 4 to direct their managers to carry out essential works and services? Is that power gone?  Is it subject to the sanction of the Minister also?  That seems to be the situation, but we have this audacious statement that the members still possess 95.5 per cent of the powers already vested in them under the yellow book, to which the Minister of State referred.</P>
    <P>We are told that all the restrictions by the Custom House are necessary to ensure that there will not be an imbalance in respect of estimates and the provision of services.  That is a serious reflection on members of local authorities.  Those of us who have been members or are still members are responsible people.  We have always provided as much money as we felt was necessary to provide for the services the people needed.  If we acted irresponsibly we knew that we faced the electorate at the next local election and could, and often did, suffer the consequences. Those restraints were on us to be responsible in relation to expenditure. We had the courage to increase the rates in the estimates as public demands were made on us.  When people make demands on public representatives, for houses, roads, lights, sewerage, water <Col N="1103" /> and all the modern amenities of life they must be prepared to pay for them.  I believe that people are prepared to pay for what they want when they know that they will have a better life by the provision of those particular things.</P>
    <P>Public representatives have always been conscious of this.  They invoked section 4 and brought in supplementary estimates to provide those services.  It is very wrong for the Custom House, the Minister and his officials to usurp the powers of local authorities and take unto themselves the power to say what is good for the people at local level.  The officials in the Custom House cannot know the needs of people down the country in any rural or urban area.  If the power to provide the money to meet the demands of those people is taken from local authorities it is a very bad day for democracy.  That is the reason we oppose this section so strongly.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made a lot of play about the few functions still left to members of local authorities.  He said they could initiate schemes for houses, roads and so forth, but when one comes back to the brass tacks one realises it is futile to initiate anything unless one is providing the money.  The money is being controlled by the Minister for the Environment, and those members of local authorities have no initiative in those matters.  Money is an ingredient for this, for initiating.  Members of local authorities no longer have the power to provide money over and above a figure set by the Minister in any given year.  If members overspend in any year how will that over-expenditure be dealt with?  Will it be deducted from the estimates for the following year?</P>
    <P>It is impossible to confine oneself to an estimate.  The amount needed can be over-estimated or under-estimated.  Up to now local authorities had the power to utilise for other essential purposes any moneys left over due to underspending. What penalties will be imposed upon local authorities who inadvertently overspend?  In the matter of wage increases, the Government's recommendation last year was 5 per cent but the actual increase was approximately 11 per <Col N="1104" /> cent.  Local authorities had to incur this over-expenditure and the same thing can apply in many other areas.</P>
    <P>The real concern is the attack upon local democracy inherent in this and the following sections.  Power is being taken away from members of local authorities to determine the standard of life of people at local level.  If people want to spend money on essential services and are prepared to raise the revenue locally and face the consequences of that during democratic elections, they are entitled to that power.  This is a far-reaching issue; it is too serious to be fobbed off with a pretence that it is necessary to ensure there are no imbalances and that it does not affect to any appreciable degree powers vested in local authorities.  It is an attack on the democratic life we have known.  It makes a mockery of the local elections being talked about for next June.</P>
    <P>Existing members of local authorities from all parties are utterly demoralised by this Bill.  They see no future in continuing to serve the public as mere puppets of the Minister.  Many high-ranking public officials have gone on record as saying they are gravely perturbed at what is happening in this Bill.  The Minister should bear that in mind.  I ask him to look carefully at this section and consider the damage he is doing to local authorities.  We all value highly local democracy and the work and self-sacrifice of members of these authorities.  We try to inculcate into people a sense of civic pride, duty and responsibility.  All that is being destroyed in this section and the following one.  The Minister is seeking to take over and usurp all these powers.  In doing that, he must realise he is destroying local democracy.</P>
    <P>Anyone concerned with public life does not want this section.  It is a movement towards dictatorship which makes a mockery of the term &ldquo;local government&rdquo;.  I have a document before me which outlines the functions of members of local authorities.  They comprise decisions on major matters such as making rates, borrowing money, making or varying a development plan and so on.  Fundamentally it all comes back to striking the rate, the provision of money. <Col N="1105" /> When the Minister takes that function from local authority members, he is rendering them effete, sterile, worthless, as nothing.  Members of local authorities from henceforth are mere puppets of the Minister for the Environment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, these are new and genuine matters.  In reply to my questions the Minister of State quoted from a little yellow book and attempted to suggest that 99.5 per cent of the functions and powers of local authorities would remain.  In Part I of the appendix to this book there is a list of the functions of local authority members.  The first function is the making of a rate and the second is the borrowing of money.  These are to be interfered with.  Now let us consider the other powers to which the Minister of State so grandiosely referred.  Among the powers to be left with local authorities are the appointment of a committee; the appointment or election of a person to membership of another body; the nomination of a person as candidate for the office of President of Ireland; the admission of persons to the freedom of a borough; the requisition of the county manager to prepare and submit plans and specifications for the execution of any particular works which can lawfully be executed, together with an estimate of the probable cost of the works; and the obtaining from the county manager of all information in his possession or procurement in regard to any business or transaction of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not being completely facetious in referring to the first of those functions, such as the appointment of a committee or the nomination of a candidate for the office of President of Ireland.  They fall within the specified functions of members of local authorities.  The requisition of the county manager to prepare and submit plans for works assumes <Col N="1106" /> that money will be available.  That money will now effectively be determined by the Minister's direction and limit.  I suggest the Minister of State has not been forthright with the House in regard to section 10.</P>
    <P>We have every reason to believe that this legislation should proceed without undue delay.  We hold the view that section 10 raises matters of principle in its operation about the residual functions that will devolve on local authority members when this section becomes law. It is reasonable on Committee Stage to ask questions to clarify the intent, meaning and effect of proposed legislation and we will continue to tease out those questions until we get an answer.  The answer may not please us but an answer we want and not an evasion.  To date we have had evasions, perhaps because the Minister of State and the Minister do not know the answers and their advisers have not had the chance to find out what the realities are.</P>
    <P>Subsection (e) is very important because as Deputy Fitzpatrick said the question of the ordering of priorities of the local authority within the context of the amount of money they are going to get is a critical one.  On the powers and functions of elected members in the little yellow book at paragraph 12 it states under the heading &ldquo;General Control by Elected Members&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The elected members have financial control over the business of the local authority and the manager, therefore, must act in conformity with the general policy laid down by them.</P>
    <P>That is a paraphrase of the law relating to the functions and authority of elected members and is published by the Department of the Environment.  Will the Department have to change that paragraph as a result of subsection (e)? What is the interpretation of the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; in the context of that subsection? To what extent will the elected members continue to retain control as specified in paragraph 12 of the yellow book?  Is the Minister of State in a position to answer those question?  It may require reflection, and if so perhaps at a later date when we have had time to reflect, we can get a legal opinion on this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> As spokesman for the environment I would be failing in my obligation if I did not get explicit clarification of what this means.  A manager in a particular authority may choose to interpret this in such a way as to evade the powers specified in paragraph 12, which deals with the powers of elected members.  If that is the case, it completely nullifies the statement made earlier by the Minister of State which was to the effect that local authority members had discretionary powers for the allocation of funds within a specified limit.  I think he got confused because he went on to suggest that it would be totally unreasonable if a local authority opted to spend 60 per cent of their revenue on roads.  While he was correctly taken up on that point by Deputy Fitzpatrick, I know he was referring to a hypothetical case because to my knowledge that situation has never arisen.  Even if it did arise, reason would support his case that that would be an unreasonable allocation of funds.  The curious philosophical position he adopts underpins Fianna Fáil's attitude to local government.</P>
    <P>If a local authority opted to make such a decision, irrational and unacceptable as it may be, he immediately assumed that the big hand of central Government should have the power to correct such a distorted allocation of resources, not the elected members in the area.  In the implicit value behind that statement he has reinforced Fianna Fáil's attitude to local democracy which is clearly indicated in this section and highlights why this side of the House are against it.</P>
    <P>We argue that in such a hypothetical situation the elected members of such a local authority are and would become directly accountable to the electorate at the next local elections.  The Minister of State appeared to imply that this was not acceptable but that the Department should have that sanction.  If so, why bother to have local representatives? What is their function?  Is he seriously confining them to electing people to the freedom of the borough, to nominating people for the post of president or to nominating people to be members of <Col N="1108" /> another authority?  What is the Government's serious attitude in this regard.  I will move to a new point soon and I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be glad to hear that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the absence of an explanation from the Minister for State on the interpretation of the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo;, I want to ask him what will be the role of the manager <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department of the Environment?  Is it fair to infer from this that he will be the agent of the Department and not the servant of the local council?  Is it fair to take from a literal reading of this section that he will be specifically under the guidance and direction of the Minister for the Environment, with the consent of the Minister for Finance?  If so, I find it very difficult to reconcile this with what happened in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the Fianna Fáil Party introduced the managerial Acts which strengthened the hand of the manager&mdash;the town clerk as he used to be&mdash;<i>vis-à-vis</i> that of elected members and there were historical reasons for it. It was opposed by the Labour Party in the thirties but was put through by a majority in the Fianna Fáil Government. The second Inter-Party Government redressed the balance somewhat with the 1955 Local Government Act.  We now have a situation where a new range of potential powers is being thrust upon managers by this section.  Instead of giving them autonomy and executive <Col N="1109" /> freedom as was the case in the past, this provision, if one takes a particular interpretation of it, will tie them more tightly into the apparatus of central government than any previous measure. That is not only my reading of that provision but it is also the confidential comment of a number of city and county managers given to me in the course of consultations with them.  That is coupled with their general dissatisfaction on the question of their status on higher salaries and so on.  I should like to know if the Minister has received, informally or otherwise, any representations from the managers' association on this section.  Is the Minister happy, in the absence of such representations and on the basis of the regular contact his officials have with managers, that they are reasonably satisfied with this legislation?</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister is happy that he will get their co-operation in the overseeing of funds and accounts and the whole process of book-keeping that will become implicit in the operation of this section?  Does the Minister feel that the managers would willingly and actively make their time and staff available to make this section work? There are implications here in terms of staff time, in terms of available time for the staff in the administrative sections of the Department and throughout the country.  The information I have received leads me to suggest that there is a great feeling of unease among managers in this regard but, because they are public servants, that unease cannot be voiced publicly or voiced in such a way as to be of use politically to any side of this House.  I should like to draw attention to this area because the more one takes executive and reserved functions from local authority members the more one depends upon the managerial system to efficiently and effectively operate a system no longer of local government but more effectively of local administration.</P>
    <P>Many managers are now more in the position of being branch managers of a central organisation than being county or city managers of an autonomous body in some kind of confederation relationship to Dublin.  If that is the case I should like to know if the Department <Col N="1110" /> are happy with the prospects of the continued high level of service of management and administration that has benefited rural and urban Ireland in the past from the managerial system?  Much as I, and my party, may have objections about the operation of the managerial system in principle my experience has been that local democracy and local government have been blessed with the high calibre and dedication of many such managers.  We are fortunate in that we are free of the kind of difficulties and shame that local administrations in Britain and other countries had with regard to the responsible and honest administration of local affairs here.  Long may that remain so.  However, there is a <i>quid pro quo</i> in everything.  People who by definition must keep silent in public and who built up a workload, a reputation and a track record in the area of administration are now possibly being made subject to a degree of interference and direction so far unexperienced and unforeseen.  If that is the case we will have the worst of every possible world. We will have a local government system that is no longer under the control of democratically elected members and we will have a managerial system which will be subject to the interventions of central government.</P>
    <P>That is not an argument of the baddies being central government and the goodies being local government.  I do not wish it to appear in those simplistic terms, but it is an argument in support of the point of view put forward by Deputy Treacy which states that no official in central government, no matter how well motivated or informed, is in the same position of understanding and recognising the needs, priorities and nuances that must order priorities within any local authority as a county manager.  If he or she is in such a position in central government then by definition, as far as I am concerned, they are not looking after their main job in central government. Managers are well informed about matters in their area and they understand the reasons why certain projects are proposed and why certain projects must get priority even though in an objective assessment of the case the same principal officer in the Department may <Col N="1111" /> not fully understand the situation.  There may be a history to a particular project or a tradition associated with the local history that would be too complex, in some cases, to be written down but which would have the support of the local community.</P>
    <P>It is for the reasons I have given that managers must retain some degree of autonomy.  As an unforeseen by-product a future Minister for the Environment may take this legislation and, reading out the last clause in this section&mdash;&ldquo;it shall be the duty of the manager&rdquo;&mdash;request a manager to provide something. There are various ways of suggesting what a manager might do.  My request about the interpretation of the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; is the primary one, but there is also the potential impact on the managerial performance and the calibre of people who will remain within local government at such a high level.  We have already had a specific instance of a person who is regarded as progressive and go ahead leaving the local government service for an appointment elsewhere.  Press reports stated that one of the reasons was the level of remuneration. I would add, the potential degree of interference implicit in section 10.  For that reason I do not think he will be the last manager to bow out of local government service.</P>
    <P>Over many years of involvement in local government managers acquire an understanding of the complex and difficult field involved.  It is not possible to transfer a marketing manager from the private sector into such a position, or a civil servant from some aspect of central government.  It is significant that the flow of personnel from central government to local government is very limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In case of any ambiguity in respect of the stance we are taking on this side of the House in relation to section 10 I feel it necessary to reiterate a number of points.  When this Bill is enacted, the Minister for the Environment will not only dictate the limits of local authority expenditure but may also lay down limits of expenditure for individual items within the overall estimates. This is because the Minister is now taking on himself powers to interfere with the powers vested in members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Quinn, referred to the functions of county managers. What is contained in this section is to be deplored.  It is retrogressive in regard to the involvement of county managers in doing what I must assert is the dirty work for the Minister and his Department. We know what good has been achieved in public life has been achieved as a direct result of the co-operation, trust, goodwill and respect between managers and members of local authorities.  If the managers are put in the position as provided for in the section, it will be their duty to prepare a statement for the local authorities indicating the effect of the direction in relation to the estimate of expenses.  If the direction is not complied with, it will be their duty to notify the Minister in writing of the extent by which the limit is exceeded.  This is the dirty work I have referred to.  To be a spy, to be the Minister's agent, is now to be the role of our esteemed county managers.  This is bound to alienate the managers from the members.  It is bound to destroy the goodwill, confidence and co-operation that has been built up during the years. This rings the death-knell for progress in the future.  The moment the managers find out&mdash;as they must do very soon&mdash;that the limit has been exceeded to any extent for however good a reason or for the provision of an essential or an emergency service, it will be reported and the Minister will clamp down.  That money will not be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a situation where there must be over-expenditure, where money must be provided for an essential or an emergency service, will the Minister sanction such a proposal?  To what extent <Col N="1113" /> will he be charitable enough or generous enough to approve excess expenditure under section 4?  Will there be rigidity, a strict limitation of working within the moneys allocated for a given year?  If that is the position, God help us in this country.  If that kind of autocratic approach is to be adopted it will be ruinous to local government.</P>
    <P>I concur fully with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Quinn when he raised this pertinent question.  The Minister cannot make messenger boys out of men of the calibre of county managers.  There is grave concern about this section.  Up to now county managers were men of great independence, power, influence and were men of integrity. They led their members along the road to progress.  They won for their counties the reputation of being progressive in regard to essential services such as water supplies; in the field of hospitalisation when they had a function in respect of the health services, in respect of essential housing needs, sanitary services and in the building of roads and bridges they contributed immensely to the infrastructure of our towns and cities.  All of this is being called into question in this section by the Minister insisting&mdash;shame on him&mdash;that he will be subservient to the Minister for Finance, that the county managers will be subservient to him and by ensuring that local authorities will be mere talking shops with no powers whatever in respect of the provision of money.  When you take away money you take away power, pride, everything. We should not fool ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a disaster.  It will have disastrous consequences for the people.  It destroys the independence of our managerial system and relegates the members of local authorities to mere puppets.  It will prove to be a blight on the life of our people.  Now they can scream as often as they like for improvement of a specific service but it will not be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney has received permission to raise on the adjournment matters arising out <Col N="1114" /> of four parliamentary questions concerning the treatment of political prisoners in the Six Countries and in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago I had the satisfaction, if one can call it that, of getting replies to questions in regard to the urgent and important matter of the treatment of prisoners generally and, in particular, in regard to Long Kesh prisoners, women prisoners in Armagh, Irish prisoners in British jails and remand prisoners from south of the Border being held on what can only be regarded as internment in Six County jails.</P>
      <P>After endeavouring for weeks from 11 October to have these matters answered by the Taoiseach, who I think is the person most immediately responsible for the Government's lack of action in regard to these very serious matters, I did not succeed until the Minister for Foreign Affairs endeavoured to reply to these long outstanding questions which are of such vital importance to those who are suffering as a result of the scandalous treatment being meted out to them in Long Kesh, in Armagh and in British jails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Citizens from this side of the Border were taken in questionable circumstances as long as 19 months ago and are still on remand without any charges having been preferred.  If that is not sufficient to raise the hackles on our Ministers, our Government and our Taoiseach, I do not know what should. We are completely ignoring the safeguards we should be insisting upon for any citizen of this country but, in particular, citizens from this side of the Border for whom as a State we claim to have not only responsibility but also jurisdiction.  The jurisdiction part has been removed by hauling them out of Carlingford Lough and by stopping them on their way back from a commemoration in Derry to their homes in Donegal.  A dozen or so of this category are on remand&mdash;in the case of the Carlingford Lough people, from January 1977.  Still no charges have been preferred against them.  Nothing can justify holding people on remand in this manner. Even the most draconian laws, even the emergency powers, could not envisage <Col N="1115" /> or justify this unwarranted interference with the freedom and liberty of a number of citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in reply to some of my questions, we have to leave it to him to do it his way.  The interests of these people should be looked after, and the only way to do that is to see that they are released or charged.  They should not be allowed to be held until by their treatment they are brought to a point where &ldquo;confessions&rdquo; are secured from them which, when put in evidence before the so-called courts in the Six Counties, are sufficient to justify putting them away for half a lifetime.  The Minister must be alive to this aspect.  He can only feel ashamed of doing nothing in such circumstances to rectify the situation after the passage of all this time.</P>
    <P>On the question of Long Kesh I do not think there is any better way to describe the appalling conditions there at the moment, and which have existed without a break for the past two years and more, than to use the words of Archbishop Ó Fiaich who visited Long Kesh on Sunday, July 30 and issued a statement afterwards.  Having spent the whole Sunday in the prison, he said he was shocked by the inhuman conditions prevailing in H Blocks 3, 4 and 5 where over 300 prisoners are now incarcerated. He said one would hardly allow an animal to remain in such conditions, let alone a human being.  Nothing has changed since then except a deterioration in the conditions of the prisoners.</P>
    <P>The archbishop also said that the nearest he could get in his effort to describe the appalling conditions in Long Kesh was to compare it with the spectacle of hundreds of homeless people living in sewer pipes in the slums in Calcutta.  Those are his own words. Those are his impressions indelibly imprinted on his mind and indelibly imprinted in the publications which carried his report after 30 July.  The stench and filth last July&mdash;and I am sure they are no less today because nothing has been done to remedy the situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Long Kesh, the words I have used are not mine.  They were in a statement by Archbishop Ó Fiaich after he spent the day there on 30 July last.  He described the stench and filth in some of the cells. He described the remains of rotten food and human excreta scattered around the walls.  He said it was unbearable to the point where he was almost unable to speak lest he might vomit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of that, how can the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who took responsibility for answering this question when it eventually reached the House, justify his inaction in not going to the greatest possible extremes diplomatically or through the Court of Human Rights? How can he ignore what has been said? How can he hope to hear anything more affirmative, more clear, more damaging, than the words in the Archbishop's statement?  How can he possibly give the impression, against that background and much more, that he is almost afraid to condemn what he knows deserves to be condemned by any person with any humanity?  How can he possibly appear to run away from this situation on the basis&mdash;quoting roughly what he said himself&mdash;that the real obstacles to doing something to relieve the terrible situation in Long Kesh are people outside who make propaganda out of the deplorable conditions in Long Kesh?  This came through time and again in the various supplementary questions.  The Minister has given this impression and if it is not a true impression it is only fair to everyone that he should get away from the impression, that what people are doing outside justifies the dreadful conditions and the inhuman treatment meted out to prisoners inside.  The Minister talked about cynical people.  There is nothing more cynical than to make the suggestion in this or any other Parliament that there is any justification for the treatment that I have indicated in the words of the Archbishop.  The people inside, suffering under these conditions, are not responsible for the actions of the people outside.  If there was no cause for this alleged propaganda it could not be made. If these conditions did not exist no matter how cynical was the approach of people outside, they would have no <Col N="1118" /> grounds for making that propaganda.  It is only because of the conditions that the crying out to Heaven for vengeance, that there is a basis for propaganda. Propaganda, generally speaking is taken as something that has been dressed up to appear as what it is not.  There is no propaganda and no publicity of the conditions in Long Kesh sufficiently clear to give anyone the fullest impression of the dreadful and horrible conditions that obtain in that hell hole.  How can the Minister talk about propaganda when it is beyond the knowledge and wisdom of any human person who comes to realise what is going on in Long Kesh, to fully describe it in all its colour, cruelty and inhumanity, never mind talking about cynical persons using it for propaganda purposes.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to perpetrate propaganda, I am trying to jog the Minister and the Government into a realisation of what they hold in custody in so far as the protection of any of our people anywhere are concerned, or indeed any human being that we can do anything about to relieve them of the tragedy that is being perpetrated in Long Kesh.  The only comparison that our learned friend who visited Calcutta could conceive of as being capable of being parallel to the dreadful conditions in Long Kesh, were the sewer pipes of Calcutta.</P>
    <P>The Minister should wipe from his mind what seems to be the in thing in 1978.  In the years 1972, 1974 and 1976 so many public speakers were anxious to speak in defence of the defenceless who are being degraded in an inhuman way that one would not be able to stand up but it is no longer the in thing to do. That situation has been brought about not by the propaganda of the cynical people the Minister referred to but by the greatest propaganda machine that ever existed so far as we are concerned.  God knows, we have suffered some propaganda from across the Channel for many generations, but the last few years has seen such a deluge of propaganda, of brain washing, that we now contribute to it.  It is to be abhorred to speak of Long Kesh because a person might in some way be tainted with the suggestion that he sympathised with the ideals of the <Col N="1119" /> people in Long Kesh and those who support them.  Is this not what it is all about?  Is this not the cynicism which really exists in regard to Long Kesh, the prisoners and their inhuman treatment? We just cannot ignore the situation as we are doing.  Surely, we cannot allow these weeks approaching Christmas to go by, perhaps with the unfortunate result that we may have some funerals emerging from the cells of Long Kesh.  It is inconceivable.  If I, by anything that I say, help to jerk the Government into some positive action, in time they will thank me for doing that rather than regard me as a nuisance for persisting in trying to bring this intolerable situation to light.  The prisoners' cells there are without beds, chairs and tables and the prisoners have not reading except the bible. All periodicals, books and newspapers have been taken away.</P>

      <P>These people are crying to Heaven for vengeance.  I am not looking for vengeance; I just want the Minister to effectively get stuck into this situation and to relieve this dreadful tragedy that has been unfolded before our eyes before we begin to bury the evidence.  What I say is not for cynical propaganda or for any purpose other than to relieve the position of these people who are being so dreadfully treated. The only recourse that I and others have is to our Minister and the Government to do something about this terrible blot on humanity, and it cannot be regarded as other than that.  I again appeal to the Minister to do something about this before it is too late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Deputy, or any other Deputy's only recourse is to the Minister and the Government and I accept my own and the Government's obligation to ensure to the greatest possible extent that the matters of concern here are looked into.  For one reason or another the Deputy does not seem to be aware that something has been done.  I acknowledge that I did not have the opportunity <Col N="1120" /> to put all of this on the record on the last occasion.  The Deputy mentioned, and I accept that it may be his clear impression, that as far as the physical conditions are concerned they are now as they were when Archbishop Ó Fiach made his statement in July. From the knowledge available to me.  I can say that this is not quite correct.  I say that on the basis of information from people whom I know both he and I would trust, and who have been in contact&mdash;one of them, the reverend gentleman to whom the Deputy referred on the last occasion, had not been in H Block since September but made his acknowledgment&mdash;the position had improved since Archbishop Ó Fiach's statement.  Obviously he could not have personal information on that basis.</P>
      <P>In reply to one of my communications with Mr. Mason on this matter, I received a letter from him indicating the new cleaning arrangements that had been introduced in the cells by way of special pressure water and steam cleaners which are used to clean at least the excrement off the walls, the ceilings and the floors.  I do not know whether the Deputy was aware of that or whether he should have been aware of it.  I may have mentioned it to him on the last occasion. Of course there are factors one would take into account to ensure that the conditions are the best possible and only because of some lack of understanding as to what we might not have been doing, as the Deputy seems to have suggested, do I feel obliged to say this now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me assure the Deputy that any evidence in relation to this or other issues of ill-treatment of any prisoner will certainly be examined.  There have been suggestions recently that there may be some further cause for concern and I want to assure the Deputy that, as soon as evidence is made available to me, I will pursue the matter.  If there is any indication, there or here, that people are being mistrated by those in authority, then, as I said recently at a seminar on human rights, in my view, despite what may be done by others, if the agencies of any State abuse their powers in the context of H Blocks, or otherwise, then human rights are being undermined <Col N="1121" /> because the abuse is done with the authority of the State as distinct from individual organisations who have no concern for standards or human rights. They have their own insane ways and unfortunately we have to live or die with the consequences but those who act under the authority of the State have a different obligation and they should not be allowed to ignore it.</P>
    <P>On any and every occasion on which complaints or evidence from a reliable source are brought to me I will pursue them at every appropriate level, as I said on the last occasion.  What I meant by &ldquo;every appropriate level&rdquo; may not have been understood, but let me now clearly put it on record.  It means Ministers to Secretary of State, where appropriate and where possible, and that has been more than once.  It means Ambassador to Secretary of State; Ambassador to Ambassador; Minister to Ambassador. It means constant communication between my officials on this and other issues. That is the way in which these matters have been pursued.</P>
    <P>I do not have authority for anything that happens in Northern Ireland, though the Deputy did say that all he was asking was that it be done.  I think the Deputy knows that I do not have authority to do the things that may be necessary.  I do not even have all the information. To the extent that I have reliable information, the more reliable the information the more I can do to help in trying to guarantee humanitarian conditions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to what was said last July.  I have great respect for Archbishop Ó Fiaich because I have known him for a long time.  When others have spoken&mdash;and I have some respect for some of them, such as Bishop Daly, who is a person of humanitarian concern as are some of the people who visited us in this House&mdash;they have been slandered by people who have, among other things, shot dead the Deputy Governor of Long Kesh before the eyes of his family.  That has happened since the previous occasion on which Deputy <Col N="1122" /> Blaney referred to this matter.  Irrespective of our feelings&mdash;and we must be concerned with proper prison conditions&mdash;it is proper to take into account that a wife and family are entitled to expect the life of the husband of that family to be secured for their sake.  He, too, is entitled to that right.  Even those who are concerned with fundamental rights in Northern Ireland&mdash;and there are many&mdash;have felt that that killing has made the job almost impossible for them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy used the expression &ldquo;alleged propaganda&rdquo;.  I say without doubt that the Provisional IRA are using this for propaganda purposes.  The Sinn Fein spokesmen of the so-called Republican movement are using this for propaganda purposes.  Anyone who has an idea of what the essence of Republicanism means knows that anything they have been doing or saying shows that they do not have a notion of what true Republicanism means.  They are propagandising the situation.  They are making it difficult, if not impossible, as Bishop Daly has said, to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to assure the House that reliable information from a <i>bona fide</i> source which enables me to continue to pursue my interest in humanitarian interests in Northern Ireland will be welcomed and readily accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has amended the Rules for National Schools since the date of the latest published edition (1965); if so, if he will specify each <Col N="1068" /> amendment made; the date on which he signed and sealed each amendment; if he will specify the legal instruments used to effect each amendment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Rule 165 of the Rules for National Schools reads as follows:</P>
      <P>These Rules may be altered or rescinded by the Minister with, in the case of rules involving finance, the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Numerous amendments to the rules have been made by successive Ministers since the 1965 edition of the rules were published.  These amendments have been promulgated through circulars issued by the Department as the occasion arose.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate for inclusion in the Official Report, a list indicating the rules which have been amended and the nature of the amendments.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Revision of the Rules for National Schools since 1965.</P>
      <P>The revision made in the Rules since 1965 relate to the following areas:</P>
      <P>1.  Management of Schools and Appointment of Teachers: The current edition of the Rules must be read in the context of the booklet entitled &ldquo;Boards of Management of National Schools: Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure&rdquo;.  In October 1975, Boards of Management, comprising representatives of the patrons, the parents and the teachers, were established in the vast majority of national schools.  The booklet referred to was prepared following consultation with representatives of the patrons and the managerial and teaching organisations.  Copies were sent to each Board member in November 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  Operating Costs of National Schools: With the introduction of the management system, the former separate schemes of grants towards the cost of heating and cleaning of national schools, periodic painting of such <Col N="1069" /> schools and provision of teaching requisites were replaced by a scheme of annual capitation grants towards the operating costs of national schools.</P>
    <P>3.  Capital Matters: Matters relating to capital expenditure on a national school are the responsibility of the trusteees and the patron.  The patron may designate the Board or a member of the board to act on behalf of the Trustees in dealing with the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works in regard to capital expenses.</P>
    <P>4.  Colleges of Education for National Teachers: With effect from 1974 the course of training in the recognised Colleges of Education was extended from two to three years with a university degree as the terminal qualification and an appropriate adjustment in the minimum age for open competition candidates. The college of Education are now constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland and of the University of Dublin.  In 1972 a competition for the admission of mature students was initiated; in that year also a scheme of grants for necessitous students was introduced. The requirement to refund the cost of training was discontinued in 1969.</P>
    <P>5.  Eligibility for Appointment to certain posts of Female National Teachers: The grade of junior assistant mistress has been abolished since 1966.  Any discrimination in the rules in relation to the eligibility of qualified women teachers for appointment to certain posts has been removed.</P>
    <P>6.  Salary Structure: Following the report of the Ryan Tribunal a common basic scale of salary with allowances for academic qualifications and posts of responsibility was introduced for primary and post-primary teachers with effect from 1 July, 1968.  The category of average enrolment of each school was replaced by a system of points rating which was determined by reference to the number and ages of pupils on rolls on the annual census date.  The number and grades of posts of responsibility to which a school is entitled is governed by the points rating of the school.</P>
    <P>The rates of salary and allowances are <Col N="1070" /> determined from time to time by the Minister for Education with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance on the basis of recommendations made by the Conciliation Council and Arbitration Board for Teachers.</P>
    <P>7.  Primary Certificate: The primary school certificate was abolished in 1967 and was replaced by a system of school reports and school record cards.</P>
    <P>8.  Amalgamation: The policy of amalgamating small schools was formally introduced in February, 1966.  The policy referred specially to one and two-teacher schools.  Its objectives were (a) to secure larger school units where the new curriculum could be effectively catered for and (b) to secure a more equitable distribution of teachers.  Certain concessions were granted to teachers in amalgamated schools in order to preserve their monetary position and their security of tenure.</P>
    <P>9.  Curriculum: A new child-centred curriculum was introduced in 1971.  The following are the individual Rules in the current Code which have been the subject of revisions:</P>
    <P>Rule 15: See 1 above.</P>
    <P>Rule 18: See 1 above.</P>
    <P>Rule 19: The provision in relation to insurance is stated as follows in the booklet referred to at 1 above.</P>

    <P>Rule 143: This rule was revised with effect from 1 January, 1974.  Instead of <Col N="1072" /> additional increments a special allowance is now payable on the same conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if any consultations will take place between his Department and school authorities at primary and post-primary level to ensure that full school text book lists are available in the early Summer, to enable pupils to purchase texts in advance of the September school opening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as national schools are concerned, a new curriculum was introduced some seven years ago and necessitated the provision of new school books in many subjects.  An adequate number of such texts have been published over the years and a comprehensive list furnished to every school.  No change in these texts is anticipated for some years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a rule, teachers in national schools give children a book list before the school closes for the Summer holidays. Indeed, it is quite common for teachers to collect money from pupils to purchase <Col N="1073" /> whatever texts are deemed necessary for their particular classes and supply them to the pupils at the beginning of the school year.  There is regular on-going consultation between the Department and teachers and Managers in regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>The selection of text books for post-primary schools is a matter for the individual school authorities.  In relation to the texts prescribed for examinations, my Department have arrangements whereby two years' advance notice is given to schools.</P>
    <P>My Department issue a circular letter annually to the school authorities to remind them, <i>inter alia</i>, of the importance of giving as much advance notice as possible to pupils and parents regarding text books required for the next school year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the position has changed since this Question was put down.  Traffic lights are again operating normally or, where they are not, they are expected to be so operating very shortly.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that ever since some traffic lights ceased to function in Dublin most major junctions were manned by the Gardaí at least over the peak periods.  I am assured that they did all that was possible but that manpower was not available to do duty at all of the junctions all of the time.</P>
      <P>While the number of collisions at such junctions which were reported to the Gardai has shown an increase over the number reported during a comparable period when the traffic lights were working, the Gardai do not know the total number of collisions involving motor vehicles that occurred as minor collisions involving only material damage are frequently not reported to them.</P>
      <P>To compile a detailed costing of a non-recurring police function such as the manning of traffic junctions at a time when traffic lights are not operating would involve the Gardai in time-consuming work which could only be carried out at the expense of other more pressing duties.  I do not consider that I would be justified in asking the Garda authorities to carry out such an exercise.</P>
