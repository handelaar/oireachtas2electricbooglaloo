    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 3, 7 (resumed), 9, 8, 10 (resumed), 4 and 5. Nos. 4 and 5 will be taken together. Private Members' Business, No. 19 (resumed), will be from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.  I should like to add, for the information of the House, that I propose to make a statement tomorrow in the House on my recent visit to Paris, London and Bonn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether he intends that there will be a discussion on the European Monetary System tomorrow after his statement, in accordance with the agreement made in October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since no agreement has been made and since no terms have been set forth I do not see the value of a discussion at this stage.  I have indicated publicly already that I would envisage, if the terms disclosed next Monday and Tuesday in Brussels are sufficiently attractive, indicating my intention to recommend them to the Government and to the Dáil in which event there would be a debate on the terms.  In my view that would be more useful at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear on this matter.  Is the Taoiseach saying that no commitment will be given at the Summit <Col N="180" /> and that the matter will be referred to the Dáil before any decision is reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that if I made a commitment it would be made subject to the terms being approved by the Government and the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that when we originally discussed the arrangements for debates he specifically accepted that there would be a debate in the Dáil, and a document produced before that, before a decision was taken?  The Taoiseach expressed some doubt as to whether the European Council would take decisions but he said there would be a debate before the decision was taken.  He is now telling us the decision will be taken which he will recommend to the Dáil.  Is he not required by his previous promise to have a debate tomorrow before that decision is taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give any positive undertaking.  The Deputy tried to read into my reply the other day that I gave such a firm undertaking but I did not.  There was no intention on my part to avoid a debate but I did not anticipate at that stage&mdash;I could not&mdash;the course of the bilateral discussions that have been taking place since.  Even if bilateral discussions could have provided agreement bilaterally they were not able to provide overall agreement on the terms which we would be prepared to accept. These terms have not yet emerged and I cannot see, usefully, what the purpose of the debate would be.  My intention is to make a statement and I do not know that any good purpose would be served in a debate afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is quite reasonable for the Opposition to request a debate and a full discussion on a series of visits not only undertaken by the Minister for Finance but by the Taoiseach?  Surely it is possible <Col N="181" /> at this stage, instead of a statement tomorrow by the Taoiseach, for him to start a debate tomorrow and continue on Friday.  In a matter such as this which is of such tremendous importance to the development of the nation it is reasonable in a democratic society to have a full debate before any undertaking or commitment is entered into.  Undoubtedly, the Taoiseach gave that commitment and it is too important a matter to be going in on what an SDLP member described as Lynchspeak.  The Taoiseach gave a commitment to the House and any normal person listening to the words he uttered would take it as a commitment.  Surely the Taoiseach should honour that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting at all that I have a commitment to honour and if I did make a firm commitment it would be honoured.  It is only fair to say that three weeks ago I could not anticipate the development of the negotiations that have taken place since then. Negotiations have not developed to the point that I could set forth to the House the conditions in any certain fashion under which we might enter the EMS.  I cannot do that and I do not know, therefore, on what basis a debate could ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that making distinctions between commitments and firm commitments has unhappy echoes in this House of similar adjectival references eight years ago and that we ought either between us here enter into commitments or not enter into them.  There should be no adjective attached to them.  Will the Taoiseach accept that there is considerable public disquiet and concern and that throughout the country people are asking what this is about and what the pros and cons are?  Every politician is faced with such questions and the people are entitled to be told something before a decision is taken which is then recommended to the House to be put through by the Government's majority?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the British Government this week issued a Green Paper and agreed to a debate?  If the people of Britain are <Col N="182" /> entitled to that why are we not?  We are a sovereign State also and a democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy has read that Green Paper and I do not know that there is a lot of information for the British public in that Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than we had published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to state again that we had an unlimited debate already in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us, including the Taoiseach, knew anything about it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a debate without any strings attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was acknowledged by the Taoiseach to be a preliminary debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt any Opposition speakers and surely I am entitled to the same courtesy from the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out a matter to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can point out what he likes because he does not know what he is talking about.  I said on the occasion of the last debate that there would be another debate.  At no stage did I intimate that it would be definitely before.  I am not going to go into the polemics of the situation now but I sincerely believe that without the terms under which we could enter the EMS being known&mdash;they will not be known until after the meeting in Brussels of the Heads of State and Government next week&mdash;I cannot see the usefulness of a debate.  There is little more known now to the House than was known before.  As far as making the public aware of the situation to date I intend in my statement tomorrow to give the fullest possible information in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach would agree that the question of whether and how any aid and transfers that might be provided would be used to assist this country and the affected sectors to adjust to the problems of EMS is a matter that we should discuss usefully in this House before we enter into a commitment in relation to the EMS which involves aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that we have not discussed it fully.  The Taoiseach gave an undertaking that the first debate was an initial one.  He gave an undertaking also that the Government would publish a White Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that I do not think the House should agree to the introduction of Supplementary Estimates if there is any question that the money has been spent in advance <Col N="186" /> and that, therefore, the authority of this House is being flouted.  One would have thought that the Minister, knowing that a similar matter was raised yesterday, would have been able to obtain the information in regard to the Estimates he is introducing and would have been able to give an assurance that the money has not been spent.</P>

What I said was that the ordinary practice&mdash;and this is the practice one would expect from any rational person&mdash;is that in debating any Supplementary Estimate the question is put and if Deputies are concerned in regard to the answer, they can oppose the granting of the amount sought.  What we are doing today is simply deciding whether leave will be given to introduce the Supplementary Estimates.  If leave is not given they can-not be discussed because the details of them and the question of whether the money has been spent cannot be disclosed to the House in those circumstances. If that is the position that Fine Gael wish to pursue, they may pursue it but they must not try to misrepresent our position.</P>

      <P>Most of the interruptions in this House are from Cabinet members.  Leave to introduce the Supplementary Estimates has been sought by the Minister for Finance.  A legitimate question has been asked in connection with the Supplementary Estimates: Has the money included in the Supplementary Estimates already been spent?

Surely before we are asked to vote on a matter of that nature it is reasonable that the Minister for Finance would inform the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate Deputy Kelly asked how the IDA's capital expenditure over the next few years would be such as to necessitate raising the limit on aggregate expenditure of a capital nature from £400 million to £750 million.  He suggested that the increase in the authority's projected capital expenditure might be associated with the construction of a zinc smelter.  I would like to clarify this point and explain why it is necessary to raise to £750 million the limit on aggregate expenditure by the IDA.</P>
      <P>The projected expenditure by the IDA over the next few years reflects IDA activity as set out in the industrial plan 1977 to 1980.  It does not include expenditure on the construction of a smelter. The situation will need to be reviewed when a decision is taken to construct a smelter.  The IDA's expected annual capital requirements at 1977 prices over the next three years are as follows: 1979, £81.5 million; 1980, £92 million and 1981, £100 million.  The total for the three years at 1977 prices is £273.5 million. One or two extra large projects involving substantial IDA contribution could increase capital expenditure requirements beyond these projected figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure requirements are based on first grant payments arising from projects approved in previous years and allowing for time lags; secondly, expenditure arising from job approval targets in the industrial plan assuming a limited increase in the grant cost per job and (c) increased capital expenditure on site purchase and development and factory construction in response to the growing need for more factory space for leasing as part of the incentive package for industry. The projected IDA capital expenditure to the end of 1981 at £273.5 million is, as I said, at 1977 prices.  Allowing for this, and for the fact that the revised industrial plan published in the new year will incorporate higher job approval targets, actual capital expenditure by the IDA to the end of 1981 will be significantly higher than this projected <Col N="195" /> figure of £273.5 million.  Accordingly, to allow the authority to continue to discharge their functions for a further three years or, perhaps, even slightly less, it is necessary to raise the limit on aggregate expenditure of a capital nature to £750 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly compared the IDA's capital expenditure in the past with the level of expenditure over the next few years implied by the raising of the aggregate limit to £750 million.  There are various factors to which the Deputy did not, of course, refer which must be taken into account in any comparison of expenditure as between one period and another: first, differences in job approval achievements with corresponding differences in grant payments.  Industrial grant incentives were first introduced in 1952.  During the period 1952 to 1970 the annual average for job approvals was approximately 3,500 and the total amount of grants paid was approximately £50 million in the whole of that period of 18 years.  During the period 1970 to 1976 the annual average for job approvals was approximately 16,000 and the amount of grant paid was approximately £117 million.  By comparison the annual average job approval target for the coming years will be substantially higher.  For the period 1977 to 1980 the target published in the industrial plan was approximately 25,000 per annum. In the revised industrial plan this figure will be considerably higher and it is more than 50 per cent higher than that for the period 1970 to 1976 and is many times greater than the average figure for the years up to 1970.  The achievement of these job approval targets represents a greatly increased task, requiring significantly increased financial resources.  There has been drastically increased expenditure in recent years on the provision of sites and buildings.</P>

      <P>At Deputy Kelly's request I will skip the information which I was in a position to give, was perfectly willing to give but which he apparently resented.</P>
      <P>References were made by a number of Deputies to the general question of natural resource based industries and disappointment was expressed at the fact that some of these were not making the kind of progress we would wish to see. Some sectors in this general area are unfortunately experiencing difficulties at present.  Many of the factors which occasion these difficulties are completely beyond the Government's control but we are making every effort through the IDA and other agencies to alleviate these difficulties and to provide for the future growth and development of these sectors on a sound basis.</P>
      <P>One of the industries which is experiencing difficulty is the leather and tanning industry.  These difficulties are known to the House.  My Minister of State, Deputy Burke, dealt with the matter fairly fully and in the past week or so he called on the Commission in connection with the matter and he has also raised the matter in the Council of Ministers.  There are some prospects that the Commission will take the steps which we are strongly suggesting to them in order to protect not just the Irish industry but the tanning industry in several other Community member states.  We are particularly anxious that the Commission impose controls on the imports of cheap leather from three South American countries which we regard with justification as trading unfairly, in view of the attitude that has been taken by these countries to the export of unprocessed hides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> On the question of timber, it is well known that several of our timber using industries are in considerable difficulties. This is due to market conditions.  It is due to cheap products in these lines such as chipboard and hardboard being available on Community markets, particularly the British market.  The Government have taken considerable steps and unfortunately have had to spend a great deal of public money in order to try to keep these factories open while the whole question of the timber industry and the future planning for it is worked out.  This can be done following the completion of a major study on timber which the IDA had under way for some time, the results of which are expected at the end of this year.  We are in the position that we will have a huge upsurge in the quantity of Irish timber becoming available over the next number of years as many of the early forests planted in the twenties and thirties come to maturity.  It is the Government's wish that this timber will be used to the greatest extent and that the greatest possible value would be added to it and that our heavy imports of timber for many purposes would be reduced and that perhaps we might be able to build up an export market in this commodity of which we will have a more than adequate supply in the years beginning around 1980.  Unfortunately, in certain northern and eastern European countries there has been State intervention in the timber industry to an extent that makes it very difficult to trade against them in certain of our traditional markets both here and in Britain. I hope that the Commission in whose hands these matters unfortunately now lie entirely, will take the appropriate steps to ensure that Community producers and processors of timber will not be put at an unfair disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other countries.</P>
    <P>In regard to meat processing which was mentioned by some Deputies, the position is that in the last couple of years the IDA have given substantial grants towards the processing and boning out of meat.  They have not given any as-sistance towards the slaughtering of beef of which there is considerable overcapacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> The question of processing meat was one of great difficulty up to April of this year because of anomalies in the MCAs on processed meat and in the co-efficient on cuts of processed meat.  I am glad to say that after a long struggle my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, succeeded in getting the worst of those anomalies, so far as frozen or uncooked meat was concerned, removed in April and the way is now clear for an increase in processing.</P>
    <P>The employment content of meat processing is very high.  The amount of value which is added is also considerable and is, therefore, something we will naturally seek to encourage to the greatest possible extent.  Now that the opportunities are better, due to the removal of at least some of the anomalies, but unhappily not all of them, one looks forward to an increase in investment and employment in this important and valuable area.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that there is an absence of MCAs on cooked beef products and this has rendered that industry noncompetitive and has effectively prevented any worth-while development taking place in it.  Until this situation is rectified the opportunity for developing cooked beef products which offers the greatest prospect of all for adding value and increasing employment will remain untapped.</P>
    <P>During the years 1973-77, inclusive, the IDA approved grants of £25 million towards eligible expenditure of £86 million in respect of projects in dairying. The IDA are introducing an industrial development strategy for processing the expected substantial increase in milk output.  I understand that this year alone it is running at 50 per cent higher than it was last year.  In 1977, 70 per cent of milk was used for the manufacture of butter and skimmed milk powder.  If this pattern is maintained, increased milk output would provide an additional 750 jobs over the next two years.  If, however, alternative higher value-added products were produced from milk, a total of 1,500 jobs would result from the increased productions.  The IDA policy will be to diversify milk <Col N="200" /> usage into the high value-added products and will work closely with the Department of Agriculture to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the development of that sector.</P>
    <P>With regard to natural gas, which was mentioned by one Deputy, the position is as is generally known.  I have asked BGE and the IDA jointly to identify natural gas using sectors and to seek to attract either indigenous or foreign investment in those sectors.  The main sectors where our natural gas would be of the greatest benefit to us lie in the glassware, ceramics, porcelain, metal treatment and food processing sectors of industry. The IDA have made approaches to a number of target companies within these sectors and two projects using natural gas and with a job potential of 480 have already been approved by the IDA.  Between now and March next, the IDA will have approached a large number of additional firms in both Europe and the United States.</P>
    <P>Complaints were made in the course of the debate by Deputy Kelly and I think one other Deputy, that the IDA were very good at establishing new industry but it was wondered if there were adequate procedures for looking after existing industries, particularly those which might run into commercial or production difficulties from time to time. Part of the IDA's responsibilities for industrial development generally include responsibility for looking after existing industries.  They provide rescue and development services and assist firms in commercial difficulties through joint action with my Department, Fóir Teoranta and the Industrial Credit Corporation. They promote joint ventures between Irish and foreign firms where these are felt to be necessary or beneficial to the survival or expansion of the firm concerned. They promote product-licensing and subcontracting opportunities for existing firms and assist with the identification of product development opportunities for firms.</P>
    <P>Existing industries are eligible for the full range of grant and other incentives for expansion and/or re-equipment.  The procedures for looking after existing industries are in my view adequate, but unfortunately it too often happens that <Col N="201" /> firms in difficulties do not approach the IDA or one of the other agencies for assistance or advice until it is too late to do anything effective and the firm has collapsed.</P>
    <P>Some very slight reference was made to the EMS by one or two Deputies and its possible effect on industry.  The fact that a minute or two of this debate was devoted to the EMS contrasts starkly with the fuss that was kicked up here this morning for the purpose of publicity and nothing else.  Proof that it was an artificial fuss is the fact that what should have been a prime topic in this debate was virtually ignored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but when the debate was going on I remember the Chair gave the EMS as an example of something which it would not be in order to raise.</P>

      <P>I hoped that Deputy Kelly would cease interrupting me after the appeal of the Ceann Comhairle some minutes ago to him to desist from doing so.  I want to say in connection with this that the Government are naturally giving very serious consideration to all the possible implications of our possible entry to the EMS.  I recently met the national executive of the Confederation of Irish Industry to discuss the implications of EMS for the industrial sector.  The needs of industry will be fully taken into account when a decision is being taken by the Government on whether to join or stay out of the proposed new system.  It is important to point out, however, that the benefits of participating in the EMS will not be automatic or immediate. Lower inflation, increased output and the growth of trade in investment will only be achieved if, as I pointed out in some detail yesterday, we adhere to the strict disciplines which that system entails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond asked whether there was adequate liaison between the IDA and AnCO as regards training grants.  I am happy to assure him that there is very effective and constructive co-operation and liaison between the two bodies.  Training grants approved by the IDA are agreed in consultation with AnCO.  AnCO are also heavily involved in assessing for payment purposes the <Col N="202" /> training which is carried out and in respect of which grants have been approved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond expressed his concern that no trade union representative has been a member of the IDA since it was established in its present form in 1969.  Under all Governments, since 1969 and before that in relation to the bodies which preceded the IDA, with the exception of representatives of specific Departments it has not been the practice to appoint people to the authority in a representative capacity.  If the need for trade union representation was as acute as Deputy Desmond feels it may be, it was open to my predecessor over a period of four-and-a-half years to appoint such a representative, but he obviously must agree with the view that I hold and my predecessors held, that such representative appointments are not necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard raised the matter of Border areas and the difficulties experienced by industries there.  I assure him that the IDA are very conscious of the special needs of Border counties and in their Industrial Plan, 1977-80, the Authority state that priority will be given to offsetting any difficulties in Counties Donegal, Louth and Monaghan which are caused by proximity to the Border and that this priority will be reflected in the grant offers to industries which are suitable for location there.  I am glad to say that in recent months as a result of the intensive efforts which the IDA have made they have been successful in getting some major industries located in these counties.  It is particularly noteworthy that the Abbot Laboratories' third factory in Ireland is going into Donegal town where it will be a very substantial industry employing 600 or more people.  Their two existing factories which are very successful are also situated in Border counties.  While it is not our practice to resort to the sort of statements that emanate from another part of this country from time to time about industrial projects, it is no harm to mention in passing that Abbot are now establishing their third major plant in the Republic in County Donegal in spite of very considerable competition and pressure to get them to go to another part of <Col N="203" /> the country.  The competition is very severe because while the IDA are subject to financial limitations some of our competitors no longer seem to be.  This and some other major industries for border counties which will be announced in the next month or two are major successes for the IDA on which they deserve our congratulations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins raised some questions about Waterford Glass but a full announcement in relation to it was made yesterday and I presume Deputies are now apprised of all the details.  He also inquired whether certain industries were pushed, as it were, by the IDA into certain areas.  It is entirely a matter for the promoters of any industry to decide where they should be located.  There is no question of promoters of new industries being directed to particular locations. My attitude and that of the IDA is that we are very glad to see worth-while new industries established anywhere in the country.  There has always been a certain effort to attract them to some of the less developed areas by offering higher grants in the designated areas as opposed to the non-designated areas but apart from that limited financial inducement&mdash;it is limited as I know from experience because companies frequent-ly take much lower grants to go where they want&mdash;which has always been there and is enshrined in legislation, no other pressure is put on them to go to any particular place if they do not want to go there.</P>
    <P>Deputy White referred to what he called the large number of vacant IDA advance factories which he alleges are to be found in the country.  It is necessary therefore to clarify the position regarding these factories.  Of the 31 factories built under the first programme launched in 1971, 29 are occupied, one is reserved and only one is vacant.  The projects established in these factories at present provide employment for over 800 people.  The second programme under which the cluster concept was pioneered was embarked on by the IDA in 1974.  At present 22 of the 23 factories comprised in this programme house industrial projects employing in <Col N="204" /> excess of 1,200 people.  Special attention is being paid to the pressing employment needs of the Dublin area in the authorities' third programme initiated last year.  A total of 60 factories is at various stages of development.  Of the 19 units completed 12 are occupied, five are reserved and only two are vacant.  Based on these results, there is no doubt that advance factories are one of the success stories of our industrial development strategy since the early 1970s.  There does not seem to be anything like the number of vacant factories alleged or suggested by Deputy White.  The position is in accordance with the figures I have given.</P>
    <P>A possible source of confusion regarding vacant advance factories is the fact that there is a time lag between the date that a factory is reserved and the date on which the promoter takes up occupation and the factory goes into promotion.  This time lag is determined by the time taken to cover legal technicalities of concluding agreements between the promoter and the authority, time necessary to order and secure delivery of machinery for it and the time required to train staff.  Thus, a factory that may appear to be vacant may be awaiting the start up of a project for which the factory has been reserved.</P>
    <P>I was going to say that that covers all the points made in the debate.  It covers all of them other than the one in respect of which Deputy Kelly objected to the information being given.</P>

      <P>The only other thing I wish to say in regard to the debate on this Bill is that I consider it a bit unreal nowadays to talk about industrial development here, successful and all as it is at present, without talking about some of the obvious difficulties that exist or are looming up.  One of these concerns industrial relations.  In the past I have deliberately refrained from saying the kind of things I feel I have a duty to say in this regard because I feared what I might say could be counter-productive so far as the IDA's activities abroad are concerned especially in view of the fact that it is the practice of some of our <Col N="205" /> competitors for international mobile investment to pick up any and every item they can find which would tend to show this country in a discreditable light in the context of industrial development.  They have had newspaper articles, statements and so on reprinted and sent to various firms abroad with whom the IDA might be seeking business.</P>
      <P>Being conscious, therefore, of the difficulties that could be engendered by what one might say as Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, I have refrained from speaking as openly or as bluntly about these problems in the past as perhaps I might in other circumstances. I shall certainly say what I have to say now with some circumspection. Nonetheless I feel it incumbent on me to say that one of the major problems that the IDA are now running into in their industrial promotion campaign abroad is the matter of industrial relations here.  I think I have acquired over the past year or 18 months a fair amount of experience abroad about what the IDA are meeting with and what they and I are being asked abroad.  It is only right that people here should know that industrial relations in Ireland form a fairly major area of inquiry to me and to the IDA.  The question is often put in the form: &ldquo;Has Ireland acquired the English disease?  Is Ireland going to cut its throat in the same way as Britain is doing and has been doing for some years?&rdquo;  I can truthfully and cogently say that is not so but I cannot truthfully say that I am not concerned at trends in this country.  I do not think that anybody who has the good of this country at heart and who is concerned particularly to create industrial employment for young people, which must be the prime national priority, can be other than concerned at some recent trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few weeks the promoters of an important industry which was secured by the IDA after long months of detailed, protracted and difficult negotiations, where a decision had been made, grants approved by the Government and where everything was in order, came to me and told me that they were thinking twice of establishing this major new industry that would employ 600 people. <Col N="206" /> The reason was that a small subsidiary which their group has had in Dublin for the past 20 years had run into industrial relations difficulties of a kind they found particularly unpleasant.  The belief of the firm was that although the proposed new factory would be more than 100 miles from Dublin they were liable to run into the same kind of difficulties and what they regarded as harassment and they inquired from me why they should risk £15 million or £20 million of their own funds in the investment it would be necessary for them to make in the new plant.</P>
    <P>This is the first concrete example I have of a major plant being put in danger.  It is not often in this general area that one gets concrete examples because frequently firms do not get to the stage of signing agreements, of having their grants passed by the Government, of buying a site and so on before having doubts or changing their mind.  Usually doubts arise at a much earlier stage and quite often Ireland does not know it has lost an industry.  I do not know.  Certainly I suspect it happens in certain cases but there is not the concrete proof that, unfortunately, there is in the instance I mentioned.  I have taken such steps as are open to me to try to rectify the situation and there has been a great deal of activity in that area in the past 10 days or fortnight.  As of yet I cannot say that the situation has been definitely rectified. However, I am optimistic but it is only because great efforts are being made to rectify the situation that there is any hope.</P>
    <P>I wish to say generally to people who are in employment that their duty is not only to themselves.  There are many young people without work who genuinely want to work and, of course, that does not include everybody on the unemployment register.  Many young people genuinely want work that can be provided by the IDA but their ability to get the jobs is being put in jeopardy because people who are in a fortunate position are seen sometimes to be abusing that position.  I do not want to be any more specific about it than that.  I want to sound this warning in general terms. At the same time, I wish to point out <Col N="207" /> that the ILO figures show that in manufacturing industry Ireland is right in the middle of the league so far as man-days lost per year are concerned. Among other nations we are better than the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and several major industrial nations. We are worse than some other industrial nations but we have consistently remained in the middle of the league.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons Ireland may be acquiring in the public mind a reputation approaching that of Britain&mdash;I hope we will never acquire a reputation as bad as Britain's&mdash;is that while our industrial relations in manufacturing industry, particularly in foreign-owned manufacturing industry, are quite good and are very good so far as the majority of foreign firms are concerned, nonetheless the kind of industrial disputes and go-slows that we have had in the public sector have affected industry.  They have given the country a rather unfair image of being much more strike-prone than we are and people abroad who may not study the figures in great detail and with great precision think that the kind of troubles that have arisen in some semi-State bodies and departmentally exist throughout manufacturing industry as a whole.  It should be noted by all who are interested in trying to increase our industrial development that telecommunications are an absolute prerequisite for modern industry, that air, road and sea communications are of major importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Power supplies are of fundamental importance and if we continue to lag behind the advanced countries in this respect our industrial development will be diminished.  The losers will not be that vague and nebulous thing, the national economy; the losers will be young unemployed people who are eager to work in their own country.  It can be said that the policies of not just this Government but of successive governments in the past 15 or 20 years in regard to industrial development in general have been successful. They are the envy of many other <Col N="208" /> nations.  Therefore, it seems to me that when we have the opportunity, as we have today, to solve one of our great national problems we are a very foolish and shortsighted people if we do not avail of the opportunity, if we do not so regulate our affairs that the chance that we have will not be thrown away.  If we throw away that chance by selfish or petty action on the part too often of small numbers of people for what too often would seem comparatively slight reasons, we will have a great deal to answer for to the up and coming generation. I can only hope that a realisation of these factors will become clearer to all our people and that there will be a realisation also of the potential harm and damage that can be done.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to allow banks licensed under the Central Bank Act, 1971, to engage in certain types of bonding and guarantee business so as to facilitate the needs of the Irish construction industry. <Col N="209" /> Over a considerable period the construction industry has made representations about difficulties being experienced by it in having its bonding requirements met by the insurance market in respect of contracts arising abroad.  This situation has seriously affected the ability of our construction firms to compete in foreign markets and the problem is being accentuated by the tendency of many foreign clients to require that bonds be issued by banks rather than by insurers.  In the course of considering this problem and in the light of further representations from the construction industry it emerged that difficulties are also being experienced by construction firms seeking bonding arrangements to cover contracts at home.  I propose under this Bill to allow the licensed banks to engage in this business in future, both home and abroad, and to do what are commonly described as development bonds also.</P>
      <P>I am advised that certain export industries would also be helped if banks as well as insurers were enabled to meet their bonding requirements and the Bill proposes to allow the licensed banks to engage in bonding and guarantee business required by such enterprises in relation to their exports or the provision of services outside the State.  Provision is also made in the Bill&mdash;in clause (C) of subsection (1) (a) (ii) of section 2&mdash;to ensure that Irish banks will not face legal obstacles in guaranteeing loans to customers wishing to borrow for projects in Ireland from international financial institutions or from EEC sources such as the European Investment Bank. These bodies represent an important source of capital for industry or major projects.  The law as it stands was regarded by the banks as not making clear their power to give guarantees of the kind referred to and the provision now proposed is intended to put beyond doubt the power of the banks to give such guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of representations made by the banks following publication of this Bill I have agreed, in order to reflect what is normal banking practice, to legislate for the licensed banks to issue all forms of pure financial guarantee regardless of where the needs for such arise.  In doing this the need to refer to <Col N="210" /> specific financial institutions as was the case under section 2 (2) is not now necessary.  I propose to introduce an amendment to the Bill to remove the statement at section 2 (1) (a) (ii) (C) which reads &ldquo;being a contract to which a body to which this clause applies is a party,&rdquo; and to delete section 2 (2) accordingly.</P>
    <P>Another important area dealt with in the Bill relates to the issue by foreign banks of bonds or guarantees in respect of the construction, manufacture or production in the State of any thing. This provision at subsection (2) (1) (b) is seen as of assistance to the need of the operations in Ireland of foreign companies. Such Irish operations often depend on the guaranteed backing of their parent companies' banks when the Irish based enterprise is getting finance from the Irish banks.  In the Bill, the ability at law of such foreign banks to engage in guarantee business is limited to cases where bonds or guarantees are required by the licensed banks as a condition of granting financial facilities, and the provision is no wider than this.</P>
    <P>Here again the banks, following publication of the Bill, urged on me and I have accepted that this provision also should be extended to allow foreign banks to engage in the business of pure financial guarantee where this is required by and given to the licensed banks, and I will propose an amendment to that effect at the appropriate stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also allow the licensed banks to engage in bonding and guarantee business in some further areas closely related to banking business such as in relation to lost bank notes, missing documents, bills of lading etc.</P>
    <P>The matters to which I have referred have up to now been governed by the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1936, which confined guarantee and suretyship business to licensed insurance companies only.  By providing for the availability from the banks, in defined areas, of the services covered by this Bill, I consider that I am meeting a clearly established need.  Moreover in giving to banks the powers proposed under the Bill I am enabling them to do what is already the widespread practice of banks in other countries.  My proposals in this <Col N="211" /> area have been the subject of discussions with the insurers, the banks and the construction industry, and I think can be said to enjoy broad consensus.</P>
    <P>None of the provisions of the Bill will affect the ability of insurers to continue to engage in the business of giving bonds.  As a technical operation it will also be necessary by Statutory Instrument to amend the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Regulations, 1976, to take account of the Bill's provisions and to free the banks from the requirements of those regulations in so far as they engaged in the type of business provided for by the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity of this Bill to increase the export credit scheme cover.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has powers under the Insurance Acts 1953, 1969 and 1971 to give guarantees with respect to the insurance of risks in connection with the export of goods and in relation to the rendering of design and planning services, the work on which is carried out in Ireland in connection with engineering and constructional works executed abroad.</P>
    <P>Export credit insurance enables exporters to insure against loss the risks entailed in selling goods abroad on credit terms.  These risks fall into two main classes: commercial risks arising from default or insolvency of the buyer, and political risks, arising from the outbreak of war or revolution in the buyer's country or from Government action in the buyer's country which would prevent the goods being delivered or paid for. Examples of such action would be the introduction of new import controls or restrictions on payment transfers.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 3 of this Bill is to provide for an increase in the aggregate amount of the liability which may be assured by me under the Insurance Acts, 1953, 1969 and 1971 for export guarantees covering the insurance of risks in connection with the external trade.  This increase from the existing limit of £30 million to £100 million is made necessary by the growth in the value and volume of exports being insured under the present export credit insurance <Col N="212" /> scheme.  It is envisaged that the proposed limit of £100 million should be sufficient to cater for the growth in demand for export credit insurance over the next three to four years.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the aggregate potential liability could only fall to be met if the multiplicity of risks covered by all the insurance policies issued should materialise.  Such a possibility is extremely remote, indeed.  For the information of Deputies the present export credit Insurance Scheme is operated in such a manner that taking one year with another there is no net loss to State funds.</P>
    <P>The enactment of these provisions will, I feel sure, be greeted with satisfaction by the construction industry, manufacturers and exporters and indeed all of us who are aware of the importance of these industries to the nation's overall wellbeing and have no hesitation in commending this Bill to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I welcome the Bill.  We support and see the good sense of it.  I am surprised it has taken so long for an uncontentious measure in no way commissioned by party politics to emerge from the Minister's Department.  I do not blame the Minister's administration solely for that but I remember making representations to the Minister's predecessor five years ago on this matter and being told that legislation was either being drafted or was under consideration.  This need is a known need and has existed for a long time, and I am not sure why it should have taken so long to produce this relatively short Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point of substance I want to make arises from what seems to be the lost opportunity to extend the scope of the Bill to possible future needs, additional to those which the Bill actually envisages.  I call them possible future needs but it may be that they have already arisen.  There are forms of enterprise, as the Minister probably realises, in which Irish firms and institutions are beginning to engage abroad and very glad we are to see it happening. These may require the giving of a guarantee or a bond of the same kind as <Col N="213" /> those involved in the construction industry and they do not seem to be covered by the terms of the Bill.  One instance would be the development of a firm abroad.  There is a well-known Irish firm in the business of developing completely equipped and supplied farms in some parts of the world where that kind of farming is not yet known, where a large tract of land is taken over, irrigated, developed, stocked and so on. While it is true that the equipping of a farm in Saudi Arabia must involve putting up a number of farm buildings and may involve the export of something from Ireland, the whole job seems to be of a different kind than that which the Bill envisages. I should like the Minister to consider drafting the Bill in such a way that if the need arises for the giving of guarantees by banks in respect of undertakings of this kind he will not have to come back here with a further amendment of the Insurance Acts in order to take account of it.  On a reading of the Bill it seems that the instance I have given is not covered by it.</P>
    <P>Another instance which, I am glad to say, is now becoming well known is the equipping of a hospital abroad.  I do know of at least two instances where an Irish hospital has had the honour of being asked to lay on a complete hospital or unit of some kind in which equipment has to be installed, equipment which in many cases has not been produced here. Again, a guarantee may be required from a bank.  If all the equipment is produced here the export of it would probably be covered by the Bill.  If what is being paid for is the skill of our medical people in planning a hospital or a unit and devising a scheme for equipping it and ordering that equipment from Sweden or the USA, it may be that that operation will fall outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The last instance is of a pure consultancy service.  It may be that consultancy services in engineering not purely connected with construction as defined in the Bill, or some other kind of service, may require guarantee by a bank.  I would have thought it useful to take the opportunity which the Bill affords us of extending its terms so that activities of this kind, and other activities <Col N="214" /> of which no examples yet exist, would clearly come within the terms of the Bill. If my remarks are based on a misunderstanding of the Bill, I apolgise to the Minister.  If I am right&mdash;in other words, if the need has already arisen or might arise for the giving of bank guarantees for activities of the kind I have instanced&mdash;then this is the moment to amend the Bill.  That could be done by either expressly amending the Bill, which might involve delay by trying to con-struct useful definitions, but it might be possible to do it in an uncontentious area like this by including a new section which would give the Minister power to extend the list by order, subject to the usual conditions that the order might be annulled if challenged within 21 sitting days.  That would be a way of doing it, perhaps a more satisfactory way than wasting time trying to evolve suitable definitions for the kind of activity I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>In subsection 2 (2) the word &ldquo;Governments&rdquo; seems to be unfortunate. I think I know what is meant but I could imagine a financial institution which was set up by official, State-authorised financial institutions in foreign countries, such as the central banks of foreign countries.  For all I know they may have legal authority to join in setting up an international finan-cial institution without concurrence on the part of their Governments.  I wonder what the Minister's Department mean by &ldquo;Governments&rdquo;.  For all I know, the Governments in the countries which he has in mind may not all have the same constitutional complexion that our Government have and there may be autonomous financial institutions which could co-operate in setting up an international organisation of the kind which the Minister would wish to come under section 2 (2) but which the use of the word &ldquo;Governments&rdquo; may prevent from so coming.</P>
    <P>My last point concerns drafting.  It would be neater in section 2 (3) not to go through the rigmarole of giving a definition of the 1971 Act because that phrase occurs only twice in the Bill.  It would be easier in the definition of &ldquo;banking business&rdquo; and &ldquo;licensee&rdquo; to say &ldquo;granted under the Central Bank Act&rdquo; or &ldquo;as in <Col N="215" /> section 2 of the Central Bank Act, 1971&rdquo;, rather than for the sake of these two references go through the ceremony of including a separate definition.  The use of this formula will definitely put people astray, even if only for three minutes, and they will turn with a gesture of annoyance back to the Bill looking for this definition.  Anyone not concentrating on the first definition in that subsection would automatically assume on reading the term &ldquo;Act of 1971&rdquo; that it was the Insurance Act of 1971 which was in contemplation.  That happened to me yesterday.  When going through the Bill a second time I came upon this expression and of course I could not find these definitions in the Act of 1971.  Only then did I turn back as I should have done to the beginning of the subsection to see that it had this special meaning.  It would be neater and cause less irritation for busy people if the definition were taken out and the phrase &ldquo;Act of 1971&rdquo; were expanded in the way I suggest.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister will give some consideration to the first two points I made.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Kelly for the warm welcome he has given to this measure.  Regarding the delay of five years, I refuse to accept responsibility for the first four of those years.  As far as the fifth year is concerned, this was one of the jobs I was given when I was appointed last January.  Deputy Kelly will know from his own experience that very often the shorter the Bill the longer it takes to draft and the more complicated it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the points made by Depputy Kelly, the possible future needs with regard to the development of the farm, the equipment of the hospital and general consultancy work are all covered in section 2 (1) (a) (ii) (A) which relates to the provision of any service outside the State or the export of any thing.  The matters raised by Deputy Kelly regarding development of the farm would be a service outside the country. <Col N="216" /> The equipping of the hospital would be covered by the export side and items bought abroad would be covered by the service side.  Consultancy would also be covered.  That is the interpretation but I will have it examined to see that the points raised are fully covered and I will come back to Deputy Kelly on this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The second point concerned the use of the word &ldquo;Governments&rdquo;.  That whole subsection is going anyway, as I men-tioned in my introductory speech.  I will examine again the use of the phrase &ldquo;Act of 1971&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A larger insurance Bill is at present being drafted and any inadequacies in this Bill may be covered there.  However, I would hope to clear them up on Committee Stage.  I am grateful for the warm welcome given to this Bill and I will be circulating amendments during the day.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, there are many more pressures on the smaller Gaeltachtaí than the bigger ones especially Corcaigh, Port Láirge agus Ráth Chairn.  Some representation should be given to those Gaeltachtaí.  I think the House would be unanimous on that.  As the Bill stands, it is quite possible that two people from Kerry could be elected.  It is quite on the cards that two Kerry men would be elected and County Meath would have no hope of electing somebody when they are in with the Connemara Gaeltacht, because the representations from that side of the country will come from Mayo and Connemara. I would urge the Minister to give some representation to the smaller Gaeltachtaí because there are more pres-sures on them than there are on the big places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the smaller Gaeltachtaí who have kept the flag flying through <Col N="219" /> very difficult years.  I appeal very passionately to the Minister to accept that there is no hope of these people getting a voice on the Údarás as the Bill now stands.  If two men are elected from Kerry, they will not go to Waterford or to Cork to find out what the views are there unless they get a substantial salary. That is the reality of the situation.  Iarraim ar an Aire féachaint ar sin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was discussed on Second Stage the Minister made the point&mdash;and it was a very reasonable point&mdash;that you could not give representation to every townland in the Gaeltacht because of the danger of establishing an Údarás that was too large and too unwieldly.  I have a lot of sympathy with that point of view and I suspect Deputy Begley has also.</P>
      <P>In relation to the size of the Údarás proposed by Deputy Begley in his amendment, it could be said that such an Údarás would not be too large and too unwieldy.  I have not got by me details of the numbers of members of other authorities in the State, but I would certainly think that in comparison with the RTE Authority and perhaps Bord na Gaeilge and other institutions of a similar nature anything up to about 20 at the absolute maximum would be reasonable for the purposes of ensuring adequate representation and efficient administration. I agree with the force of Deputy Begley's remarks in relation to representation for the smaller Gaeltachtaí because I believe that few things will case harden the sense of identity and the sense of growth and of responsibility for the language in the smaller Gaeltachtaí than the election of their own representatives to An tÚdarás. The suggestion of ten elected members is a very fair compromise between the needs of representation and the needs of efficient administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is however another point to be considered in conjunction with this and that is that An tÚdarás will be carrying out a number of very technical and complex tasks in relation to the assessment of financial and industrial and business propositions which are brought before it. There is no doubt that ministerial appointments <Col N="220" /> can and will and should be used in order to ensure that An tÚdarás has the right measure of technical industrial and professional expertise to enable it adequately to evaluate such projects.  It may be, in the circumstances, that five members to be nominated by the Minister is not quite enough to secure the purposes that we are talking about, especially if we are going to increase the election representation to ten.  I would have no objection to a slight increase in the number of nominated representatives provided always that the fundamental principle of the majority of elected representatives was maintained.  I believe that we could have up to, say, eight representatives nominated by the Minister which would leave An tÚdarás with a maximum number of 18 which is still well within the bounds of efficiently administering the services for which An tÚdarás will be responsible.  We would be grateful to hear the Minister on this point.</P>

      <P>Ins na páipéirí le déanaí agus ar chlár radio, chualamar ó bhainistíocht Ghaeltarra Eireann go raibh sort eagla orthu anois i dtaobh Údaráis na Gaeltachta.  Chuaigh bainisteor Gaeltarra ar RTÉ coicís ón lá inniu agus san agallamh a thug sé bhí eagla air toisc nach raibh industrialists ag teacht insteach sa Ghaeltacht anois. Measaim gur thainig cuid den eagla sin ón Bhille seo.  Sin é an rud atá á chur isteach orm.</P>

      <P>The confidentiality of members of the board comes up again in section 15 which tries to protect that confidentiality. This is the point that is worrying the bainistíocht of Gaeltarra Éireann, that is, that the private affairs of a company can now be discussed openly by an elected board.  That is why I think it applies to section 7 also.  This misgiving, I believe, is genuinely held by the management of Gaeltarra Éireann and that is why I am doubtful about section 7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The original phrasing of the Bill was, as the Minister agrees, rather weak.  It referred, in English, to the preservation and the extension of the use of Irish as a vernacular language of the Gaeltacht.  This undifferentiated treatment of Irish was very inadequate because it simply gave it the role of being a vernacular language among vernacular languages.  Perhaps there are parts of the Gaeltacht where, at certain times of the year, the vernacular languages include not only English but German, Dutch and French.  It is important to give the Irish language a more specific and more powerful status.  It is very difficult to confer rights on a language because a language is not something that is disembodied.  It is spoken by people but in so far as it is possible to confer rights on it, this should be done.  While the Minister's amendment is an improvement on the original phraseology I would hope to strengthen it further by way of my additional amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 33, to delete &ldquo;a&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the primary&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An difríocht atá i gceist againn anois, sé an difríocht idir na focail atá ins an mBille anois, tar éis an leasú deireanach a dhéanamh, agus na focail atá ins an leasú.  Mar a dúirt mé, ní raibh an Bille ar an slí ceart ar an gcéad dul síos.  Tá leasú ón Aire déanta agus cuireann sé feabhas ar an mBille ach níl sé ceart fós. Níl sé láidir fós.  The difference between the language of the Bill as it stands now and the language of my amendment can <Col N="227" /> be stated easily.  The Ministerial amendment substitutes the phrase &ldquo;the use of the Irish language as the principal medium of communication&rdquo;.  Any of us here who will be familiar with the issues during the past decade involving the Irish language will know where this phrase comes from.  It comes from a report of the Commission on the Revival of the Irish language and was the agreed consensus terminology of that commission in relation to the Irish language but the point about that commission was that they were referring to the Irish language in the country as a whole and that they defined the aim they would like to see the Government adopting to make Irish the principal medium of communication throughout the country as a whole.  If this is to be the aim of the Government, the aim of all parties in this House and of the community generally, it follows that our aim for the Gaeltacht should be stronger than this and the words of my amendment would delete &ldquo;a&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the primary&rdquo; or &ldquo;mar phríomh-theanga&rdquo;. This is as explicit as I can make it and I urge the Minister to consider the amendment favourably.</P>

    <P>...such industries and productive schemes of employment as it thinks fit other than those referred to in subsection (2).</P>
    <P>I believe there has been simply a grammatical mistake here and that the form of words needed in order to give effective expression to what is intended by the Bill is &ldquo;in addition to&rdquo; rather than the words &ldquo;other than&rdquo;, because the latter is an exclusive term and might create subsequent legal difficulties.  Therefore, I should be grateful for the observations of the Minister on this problem.</P>

Cén bealach a bhéas ann chun go mbeadh nascadh nó comhnascadh idir an Údarás, na Gaeltachtaí agus Roinn na Gaeltachta?  Tá <Col N="229" /> cumhachtaí ag Roinn na Gaeltachta i leith an chultúir agus na teangan san Ghaeltacht.  Cén ceangail a bheidh idir an Údarás le Bord na Gaeilge?  Cén bhaint a bheidh ag an Údarás leis an Roinn Oideachais?  Measaim féin go mba cheart é a bheith soiléir ó alt a 8 go mbeidh cumhachtaí ag an Údarás airgead a chaitheamh ar an Gaeilge agus an cultúr agus an fhorbairt a leanúint san Ghaeltacht.  Ba chóir é sin a bheith scriofa san mBille.  On section 8, I ask the Minister if this subsection gives the Údarás any powers whatsoever in regard to the Irish language.  Can the Údarás spend money to strengthen the language in the Gaeltacht?  How is it proposed that the Údarás will fit into Roinn na Gaeltachta, which have a statutory duty in relation to cultural matters in the Gaeltacht, with Bord na Gaeilge which have a national responsibility for the language, and with the Department of Education, which should have a national responsibility for the language but which have reneged it entirely.</P>

      <P>Tá forbairt á dhéanamh i leith leathadh na Gaeilge, agus tá deontaisí ar leith á bhfáil maidir leis an obair seo.  I láthair na huaire tá cúraimí cúltúrtha, dul chun cinn na teanga san Ghaeltacht féin ag brath níos mó ar Roinn na Gaeltachta ná ar rannóg ar bith eile.  Tá deontais á n-íoc ag Roinn na Gaeltachta leis na cuspóirí sin a bhaint amach.  Tá cuid mhaith scéimeanna atá faoi chúram Roinn na Gaeltachta maidir leis na cursaí sin ar fad.  Anois níl sé istigh sa Bhille go mbeidh na cúraimí sin ar an Údarás, ach ní fheicimse go mbeidh aon fhadhb ann más rud é leis an am, go dteastaíonn ón Údarás na cúraimí sin a ghlacadh chucu féin, agus ní i leith na rudaí sin amháin ach i leith cúrsaí cile a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht a bheidh siad ag iarraidh cumhachtaí a ghlacadh chucu féin, cumhachtaí a shílfeadh siad go dteastódh uathu le cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a reachtáil.  Ní fheicimse go mbeidh aon deacrachtaí sna cúrsaí sin san am atá le teacht, ach sílim go bhfuil sé níos daonlathaí ag an bpointe seo a fhágáil ag an Údarás féin a leagan amach céard iad na cúraimí a ghlac-faidh <Col N="230" /> siad maidir leis na cursaí seo a chur chun cinn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address myself to section 8 (2) which states:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás shall, subject to section 10, carry on, control and manage (either directly or, in any particular case, through a body corporate controlled by an tÚdarás) the industries and productive schemes of employment carried on, controlled or managed, directly or indirectly, by Gaeltarra Éireann immediately before the appointed day.</P>
      <P>Possibly an opportunity has been lost here to create, in place perhaps of the old Gaeltarra Éireann structure, a general holding company which would make the Údarás an effective agent of industrial development in the Gaeltacht. The history of Gaeltarra Éireann since their inception has been that of an institution which has grown and developed in ways that were not always entirely foreseen.  For example, Gaeltarra Éireann now have shares of one kind or another in around 70 companies and in perhaps half of those they have a controlling interest.  The logic of the phrase &ldquo;in any particular case through a body corporate controlled by an tÚdarás&rdquo; is that this total of 70 companies, some of whom are effectively controlled subsidiaries, is going to be increased. Instead of a general gathering in of the industrial promotional and development activities of Gaeltarra Éireann, now to become the Údarás, we have the possibility of further proliferation and further complications of these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always thought it strange that the chief executive of Gaeltarra Éireann who has a larger number of subsidiaries under his wing than the head of almost any other semi-State company, should be ranked so low on the famous Devlin scale.  If the industrial development of the Gaeltacht is to be carried out along the lines suggested in subsection (2) his life is going to become even more complicated and his worries even more extensive. Is the Minister sympathetic to the idea of Gaeltarra Éireann, now to become the Údarás, as a general holding company which would encompass <Col N="231" /> globally as much industrial development in the Gaeltacht as possible, or as an umbrella covering a huge number of companies, privately owned and part publicly owned, in view simply of the growing complexity of managing such a network of companies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is fíor a rá go bhfuil cruth ar Ghaeltarra anois nach raibh air nuair a bunaíodh an t-eagras ar dtús, agus dá bharr sin tharla go raibh go leor deacrachtaí ag an bhfoireann ansin maidir le cúrsaí a reachtáil mar ba mhaith leo, ach tharla taobh istigh de cúpla mí ó shin anois go bhfuil atheagrú déanta ar an bhfoireann ar fad ansin.  Tá rannóga faoi leith agus daoine faoi leith a bhfuil cúram orthu maidir leis na rannóga sin, agus sílim de bharr an atheagraithe a deineadh ar an bhfoireann nach bhfuil sé chomh deacair ar an mbainisteoir féin anois na cúraimí a bhí air a dhéanamh.  Tá daoine speisialta, daoine a bhfuil eolas acu ar chúrsaí bainistíochta, agus tuigim i láthair na huaire nach bhfuil na deacrachtaí céanna aige agus a bhí de bharr seo.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an rud a luaigh an Teachta Horgan faoi chomhlacht speisialta, sin rud nach ndearna mé scrúdú air.  Tuigim, ar bhealach, nach mbeidh an tÚdarás ag casadh le boird chomhlachtaí eile.  Beidh siad ag tabhairt aire do chúrsaí gnó agus níl siad cosúil leis na daoine a bhíonn tofa ar bhoird chomhlachtaí mar a thuigimid é.  Níl mé ag rá ag an bpointe seo go n-aontaím gur cheart cloí ar fad leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Horgan ar an rud seo, ach b'fhéidir nuair a thoghfar an tÚdarás go bhféadfaidh siad an rud sin a scrúdú.  Ní hionann daoine a bheith tofa agus an tÚdarás féin agus board of directors mar a thuigimíd é.  Tá súil agam go n-oibreoidh sé ceart go leor, ach b'fhéidir go mbeadh deacrachtaí ann.</P>

      <P>(1) Déanfaidh an tÚdarás caomhnú agus leathadh na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha sa Ghaeltacht a spreagadh agus cinnteoidh sé gurb i an Ghaeilge a úsáidfear a mhéid is féidir nuair a bheidh a fheidhmeanna á gcomh-lionadh aige agus thar a cheann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> Fágann sé sin nach bhfuil aon dualgas leagtha ar an Údaras i leith na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht pioc níos troma ná an dualgas a bhí ann nuair a bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann.  Nuair a bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann i 1957 is mar seo a léigh alt 4 (2) d'Acht um Thionscail na Gaeltachta:</P>
    <P>Is é dualgas an Bhoird cabhrú le caomhaint agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáthurlabhra sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh na cumhachtaí breise scríobhtha isteach san Bhille.  Tá sé ceart go leor don Aire a rá anseo nuair a thoghfar an tÚdarás gur féidir leo teacht go dtí an Rialtas agus go bhféadfadh an tAire ordaithe a dhéanamh chun comhachtaí breise a thabhairt don Údarás.  On this particular point the section is so similar to the section when Gaeltarra Éireann was established in 1957 that the similarity is quite remarkable.  We have the Minister coming in here then, tongue in cheek, telling us that when Údarás looks for powers the Government will give them to them.  If we want to give the powers, then today is the day to do that, whether they be powers in regard to planning, deontais and so on.  We should spell out in black and white what we want the Údarás to accomplish and the way it should go.  The Minister says if Údarás looks for powers they will get them.  No one can say what will con-stitute the Government of the day in the next ten years.  No one can make a commitment for a Government which is not in existence and so no one can say a Government will give powers.  I would ask the Minister to be more specific and not indulge in vague generalities about powers which can be got if they are looked for.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;9&mdash;(1) For the purpose of promoting the linguistic, economic, social, cultural and environmental development of the Gaeltacht, an tÚdarás shall in respect of the Gaeltacht, exercise from the date of the coming into effect of this Act the powers in relation to the granting of planning permission exercised under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts 1963 to 1976 in respect of the Gaeltacht by the various planning authorities in whose areas the Gaeltacht is situated.</P>
      <P>(2) Nothing in this section shall restrict the right of any applicant to appeal to an Bord Pleanála.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is, I think, really at the core of our approach to the Bill.  There are really two amendments locked into one and, depending on the fate of these amendments at this stage, I would reserve the right to reintroduce at least one of them on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The first part of the amendment simply reorders the words in subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>For the purpose of promoting the economic, social, cultural, linguistic and physical development of the Gaeltacht an tÚdarás shall have ...</P>
    <P>The initial part of my amendment makes two linguistic changes which are, I believe, of importance.  The first one is to reorder the words in order to put &ldquo;linguistic&rdquo; at the head of the list.</P>

If I was not particularly accurate about the title I meant the person who now occupies the position of Press Secretary.  It <Col N="237" /> was a question of mistake in title and I do not think it has any special significance.  The Deputy will remember that that statement was in response to a number of supplementary questions.</P>

I should like to inform the Deputy in case he has not heard&mdash;I am sure he has not by reason of the manner in which he has been pursuing his supplementaries&mdash;that a work survey of the Government Information Services was carried out by the last Government in 1976 and the suppression of the post was recommended because a Press Secretary had been appointed by that Government and because the functions of both coincided.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I wish to raise the question of whether the Taoiseach will accept that it is discourteous to the leader of the party opposite and to the House to transfer to other Ministers questions to him on major issues of policy such as the EMS with which he is personally concerning himself with negotiating or the question of commissions for electoral boundaries to which he has a personal commitment. If I withdraw those questions, may I invite him to answer them in courtesy to myself, to my party and to the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of courtesy.  It is the question of objectivity, a question of judgement as to which Minister is primarily responsible.  It does not matter from which source on the Opposition benches a question may come.  There is a tendency on the part of every Deputy to try to get a question down to the Taoiseach because he knows that on two days each week he will get priority.  Apart from that reason, it is only right that the Minister primarily charged with a particular subject should have questions addressed to him on that subject matter and not addressed to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has specific responsibility in relation to the two questions.  Question No. 307 relates to the securing of democratic control over the single monetary authority that must emerge with monetary union, his own statement in this House and a matter on which he is negotiating.  Why should responsibility for replying to that question, which is using his own words in relation to the matter, be transferred?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is negotiating the EMS.  I am glad he is doing this because it is an appropriate matter to discuss at the level of Heads of Government.  Why has a question on that subject been transferred?  Secondly, surely the Taoiseach accepts personal responsibility for the guarantee with regard to electoral commissions?  This is not a matter for the Minister.  What I wanted to discuss in this House is the Taoiseach's commitment, not the Minister's commitment.  I have not heard the Minister on the subject commit himself to anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  There is a statutory exemption for members of the Defence Forces from the <Col N="259" /> obligation to hold a driving licence under the Road Traffic Acts, which is limited to driving Army vehicles on official duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time it has been represented to the Department of the Environment that because of the driving instruction and test given by the Army authorities for drivers in the Defence Forces such drivers should be exempted from the driving test of the Department of the Environment for civilian purposes seeking a driving licence under the Road Traffic Acts. This question was examined by the Department of the Environment in consultation with the Department of Defence and the suggestion was rejected by successive Ministers.  It was not accepted that there should be any breaching in favour of the Defence Forces for civilian purposes of the uniform arrangements for the entire public in connection with driving tests under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Under regulations recently made by me it is the function of the local authority concerned to determine the number, if any, of new taxi licences which may be granted by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in the period from 1 November 1978 to 1 September 1979 and thereafter in any period of one year.  The regulations also provide that an application by the owner of a vehicle for such a licence be made to the Commissioner in the period 1-14 November 1978 after which it is a function of the local authority to specify application periods.  Applications must be made in the form and manner directed by the Commissioner, and may be obtained at the local Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> In the case of the Cork taximeter area, the Cork Corporation are the relevant local authority to determine the number of new licences and application periods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to clarify the question of who decides to whom licences are issued?  Is the Minister aware that in Limerick a year ago licences were issued in bulk to substantial businessmen who sold them for substantial sums of money to Ferenka workers who had lost their jobs and who were fooled into buying licences issued on such a scale that they were valueless?  Would the Minister not agree that that was a serious abuse, and would he take steps to ensure that it never recurs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The present changes arise from recommendations made by the Taxi Services Council which first met on 12 September 1978.  Following a request from the Minister the council is to consider criteria which I might recommend to local authorities to help them in determining the number of new licences to be granted.  For the information of the Deputy it is the members of those local authorities who will now decide the numbers to be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Who decides who gets them?  That is the question I have asked.  It has been asked twice and has not been answered, because in the case of Limerick whoever took the decisions took them in an abusive manner, and it constituted an abuse of power, to the financial benefit of certain individuals. Therefore what I want to know is in future who will have that power so we can be assured there will never again be such an abuse of power to the benefit of wealthy people and in exploitation of workers who have lost their jobs, as occurred in Limerick a year ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a function of the local authorities to determine from time to time, by resolution, the number of new licences which the Garda Commissioner may grant up to 1 September <Col N="262" /> 1979 and thereafter in each succeeding period of 12 months.  The local authority will determine when application for taxi licences may be made to the Garda Commissioner.  But the regulations specifically name the period 1 to 14 November 1978 as the first period for application.  If the number of valid applications for new licences exceeds the number fixed by the local authority successful applicants will be determined by lot by the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Would the Minister agree that cigarette lighters in private cars could indeed constitute a fire hazard, es-pecially if young children, and not so young children, are left in cars even for a short time?  It is very easy to pull them out and it would be extremely easy to start a fire.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that a cigarette lighter is fused when fitted to a vehicle by a manufacturer.  Accordingly if a fault develops in a lighter the fuse will blow and the lighter assembly becomes inactive.  The heat content of a blown cigarette lighter is barely sufficient to light one cigarette.  If the lighter is held manually in the engaged position against the release spring it will continue to heat and eventually may initiate a fire. However, it is likely that hand knob would become too hot to hold before a fire could be started in this way.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Ireland is represented by a certain professor on the EEC expert group studying the problem. Ireland is also represented on the EEC Advisory Committee on Programme Management for environment research by the National Board for Science and Technology.  A meeting of the expert group was arranged for 13 and 14 of this month.  It is not possible to say what form measures to control the use of fluorocarbons will take pending completion of these EEC studies.  It is probable that the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and the Department of Labour will be involved in the implementation measures.  Ireland's domestic consumption of flurocarbons has been estimated at 1.3 per cent of total EEC consumption.  Any unilateral action by Ireland, therefore, would not have a significant impact on the overall problem.</P>

      <P>Recent international studies suggest that fluorocarbons' emis-sions into the atmosphere reduce the ozone layer and that this is a matter of concern.  The importance of the reduction of the ozone layer is that it would allow more ultra-violet radiation to reach the earth's surface and increase radiation, and affect human and animal health, causing skin cancer as suggested by the Deputy.  A final assessment of the effect of fluorocarbons on man and the environment is not yet possible.  We are taking every possible step.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Derelict Sites Act, 1961 is to provide a procedure whereby local authorities can secure the clearance and improvement of derelict sites which are in a condition injurious to health or amenities.  It is a matter for the local authorities to operate the provisions of the Act as they consider appropriate.  Details of its operation are not available to me but I have no grounds for concluding that it is not being used, where appropriate, by the local authorities.  The Act itself makes no provision for grants but where clearance of a derelict site can be incorporated in a suitable project, local authorities can avail of grants provided, for example, under the environmental improvement works scheme.</P>

Is there a grant scheme to the individual owner of a derelict site who clears, whether by his own volition or at the behest of the local authority?  Is there any grant or assistance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not as such. <Col N="285" /> Derelict site grants were payable from 1960 to 1971 to local authorities and local associations carrying out works to clear or improve derelict sites.  The grants were 50 per cent of the approved cost of the work subject to a maximum grant of £100.  The new amenities grant scheme introduced in 1972 replaced the derelict site and amenity grant schemes which have been in operation since 1960 and 1962 respectively.  The amenity grants scheme was discontinued in 1975. I would suggest that local authorities should consider carrying out these works in conjunction with road improvement works and also with the assistance of the environmental improvement works scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment I was explaining the reasons behind different aspects of this amendment. There are two minor but still significant aspects and one major aspect to it.  The first of the two minor aspects of it is the revision of the order of the adjectives preceding the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; in order to ensure that the linguistic task of An tÚdarás is given priority in the Bill.  If An tÚdarás is to be more than merely Gaeltarra Éireann under another name its linguistic task must be given priority in the Bill.  As the Bill is presented to us its linguistic task is named third in rank order after &ldquo;economic&rdquo; and &ldquo;social&rdquo;.  This is a small part of the amendment which perhaps will need to be introduced separately at a later Stage but is something which should commend itself to the Minister and to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is perhaps purely linguistic and is the substitute of the word &ldquo;environmental&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; in the English text.  I have searched the Department of Education's <Col N="307" /> new Irish language dictionary to find the word &ldquo;gnéithiúlachta&rdquo; without finding it. If I found it at all it was in relation to physical comeliness of a type usually applied to young maidens and not of a type applied to the physical environment in which we live and breathe.  I feel sure that environmental is meant here. Perhaps this is a matter for a separate and more detailed amendment later on, but I feel it worth while mentioning it at this stage.</P>
    <P>I said that the main burden of this amendment is really at the core of our approach to this Bill.  When I spoke on Second Stage I made it clear that without an effective say in planning the social and linguistic aspect of the work of An tÚdarás would effectively be a dead letter.  I still believe that, and that is why I put down this amendment, which, although relatively brief, confers a considerable range of powers on An tÚdarás without, at the same time, impeding in any way the right of any person looking for planning permission to follow the normal procedures and appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem of many of the Gaeltacht areas in relation to planning is that they form only a small part&mdash;in some cases only a tiny part&mdash;of the total area over which their planning authority exercise jurisdiction.  Their representation on that local authority and on the planning committee of that local authority is necessarily limited and may even be non-existent, so that with the best will in the world there is a high probability that the fundamental linguistic and social characteristics of the Gaeltachtaí may not be given sufficient weight when it comes to the granting of planning permission.  We believe that this is a fundamental issue, I suspect that it is one which any Udarás of the type we are proposing here will come looking for very shortly after its establishment.  We are looking to the Minister now to be generous in advance and to give An tÚdarás this power so that the total social and communitarian qualities of the Gaeltacht areas will have this very necessary protection against invasion and disruption.</P>

Is dóigh, le firinne, má thógáimid an tAcht Pleanála mar atá sé i láthair na huaire níl i gceist ann ach pleanáil fisiciúil, mar a déarfá, agus níl aon cheist faoi cultúr ná a leithéidí sin.

Mar sin fhéin, tá caoi ann le cur in aghaidh iarrataisí pleanála, is cuma cén áit a bhfuil siad nó cén chuid den tír a mbaineann siad leo.  Tá sé luaite, fiú amháin, ag an Teachta fhéin i gceann de na moltaí atá déanta aige ansin go mbeadh deis ag an Údarás dul go dtí an Bord Pleanála le cur in aghaidh pleanáil nó a mhalairt.

Tá an tAire ag rá ó mhaidin go mbeidh sé ábalta na cumhachtaí sin fháil ón Rialtas.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil sé ábalta rud mar sin a dhéanamh?  Beidh sé á thaispeáint dúinn go bhfuil a chroí sa Bhille.

It is fine for the Minister to say that if they look for the powers he will give them, but when they want the power the Minister might <Col N="310" /> not be there or Deputy Horgan might not be here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might enlighten Deputy Begley as to why there is no possibility of inserting even at this point compulsory purchase powers into the Bill from this side of the House, and that is because it would suffer the same fate as a number of our amendments which were regarded as creating a potential charge on the revenue and were put out of order for that reason.  The Minister's argument on this amendment was based on two points, first, An tÚdarás could make their views known to An Bord Pleanála and, second, we could not write every type of power into this Bill.  Of course An tÚdarás can object to An Bord Pleanála but the right of objection to that board is no more than is given under the 1976 Planning and Development Act to every dog and devil in the Gaeltacht.  There seems to be little point in going to the trouble of setting up the new Údarás if they will not be given any more rights in the Bill in relation to planning than any other single individual.</P>
      <P>In relation to what the Minister said about putting powers in the Bill I would agree with him to this extent.  You cannot write everything you would like to see into a Bill because the dangers and limitations of too much detail become self-evident after a while.  An attempt was made by myself and Deputy Begley to write many other powers into the Bill but they were ruled out of order on the ground that they would involve a charge on the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This single power which we seek to write into the Bill would not involve any potential charge on the revenue and to my mind is worth all the other powers put together.  If they had this power, we would not be making much of a fuss about any other power we think An tÚdarás might need.  This is the critical <Col N="311" /> one for the survival of Gaeltacht communities. If it is not given now God knows when it will be given and by then it may be too late, if it is given at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Horgan in what he said about planning.  An tÚdarás cannot plan for the Gaeltacht because they have little or no power.  I can visualise the cat fight which took place.  The Minister for the Environment is not prepared to give away any of his powers.  His Department wish to retain those powers, and the same thing is running through the Bill.  The Minister was tied up by other Ministers when he went to the Cabinet looking for powers.  I have a certain amount of sympathy for him because he gave an undertaking that he would bring in An tÚdarás but what he is bringing in is not what the people in the Gaeltacht, Connradh na Gaeilge or anyone else want.  I would appeal at this late stage for the Minister to accept the spirit of Deputy Horgan's amendment that at least planning be included in the <Col N="312" /> Údarás and assure us that he will come back on Report Stage, having twisted the arm of the Minister for the Environment to give that bit of power to the Údarás.</P>

      <P>Ar leathanach 11, roimh alt 9, alt nua a chur isteach mar a leanas:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;(1) Chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn ó thaobh teanga, geilleagair, sóisialachta, cultúir agus gnéithiúlachta, iarrfaidh aon údarás pleanála a bheidh ag feidhmiú sa Ghaeltacht comhairle agus toiliú an Údaráis sula dtabharfar cead pleanála le haghaidh aon fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>(2)  Ní chuirfidh aon ní san alt seo srian le ceart aon iarratasóra achomharc a dhéanamh chun an Bhoird Phleanála.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>7.  In page 10, before section 9, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;(1)  For the purpose of promoting the linguistic, economic, social, cultural and environmental development of the Gaeltacht, the advice and consent of an tÚdarás shall be sought by any planning authority operating in the Gaeltacht before planning permission is given for any development in the Gaeltacht.</P>

    <P>This is the last opportunity that we have to give a significant role in planning to the Údarás and I would be prepared to <Col N="315" /> consider altering this amendment.  If the Minister still and steadfastly refuses to give the Údarás the right of a veto over the operation of the planning legislation he might at the very least give them a statutory right to act in an advisory capacity to all local authorities.  If the Minister is not in agreement with the insertion of a power of consent, will he at least agree to the insertion of a statutory advisory power for the Údarás in respect of the planning legislation between now and Report Stage of the Bill?</P>

      <P>During the debate on the Second Stage I asked the Minister, and perhaps he could give me the information now, for any precedent in relation to subsection (2), paragraph (a) of section 9.  This paragraph includes the phrase &ldquo;including modification of statutory provisions&rdquo;.  We would like to know if this creates a precedent for a different method of legislating in the future whether in relation to Údarás na Gaeltachta or any other statutory body. Does this mean that the Government may effectively by order change the law subject only to the passage of an affirmatory resolution by each House of the <Col N="316" /> Oireachtas?

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to page 12 of the English text and to page 13 of the Irish text.  Subsection (3) refers to the need which is now laid statutorily upon the Minister for the Gaeltacht to consult with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in relation to the financial assistance to be provided for any particular project specified in subsection (2).  That is in relation to the financial limits.  It seems to us that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is not by any manner or means the only Minister concerned with the economic development of the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry <Col N="317" /> should also be written in here because agriculture and fisheries are still among the most important components of the economic life of the Gaeltacht.  It goes somewhat against the grain to be writing further consultation procedures into a Bill of this kind but in this particular case there seems to be a reasonable argument for it and it seems odd to include one of the three relevant Ministers without including the others.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Horgan this is a vital section because the limits to be set under this subsection are absolutely vital since they will determine the level of grants and incentives or shareholding which An tÚdarás can apply within their own discretion.  The question of consultation with three Ministers bothers me.  Why should we have to go to three Ministers?</P>
      <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh rud éigin scríobtha isteach sa mBille.  Ba cheart go mbeadh time limit ag na hAirí chun ceist a phlé, mar tá sean eolas agam féin nuair a chuaigh rud éigin go dtí an Roinn Airgeadais bhí sé ann ar feadh dhá mhí sular chuala an tAire go raibh an rud céanna sa Roinn aige.  Iarraim ar an Aire rud den chineál sin a scríobh isteach sa mBille.  Nílim ag cur an milleán ar an státseirbhis mar bíonn siad an-ghnóthach ar fad ach is minicí mar adúirt me go dtagann rud éigin isteach go dtí an Roinn Airgeadais agus ní fheiceann an tAire é in aon chor go dtí go dtéann duine eile go dtí an tAire ag lorg an eolais agus mar sin táim ag iar-raidh ar an Aire time limit a chur ar na hAirí eile, más féidir é.</P>

      <P>I am making the point that the Minister for Finance has a vital role to play as far as this section is concerned and there should be a time limit imposed on the Minister for Finance to come to a decision.  I had personal experience of this during the Coalition Government.  One particular project was sent by Roinn na Gaeltachta to the Department of Finance and nothing was coming back.  I tackled the Minister, Deputy Richie Ryan, as to the reason for the delay and that was the first he heard about it.  There should be a time limit.  An area could very well lose an industry if a decision was not arrived at.</P>

Níl fhios agam, b'fhéidir nach raibh an tAire a bhí ag an Teachta Begley ró-mhaith ina phost.  Má tá seisean ag cur locht air níl mise ag dul ag cur leis, ach le dul ar ais chuig an mBille féin, níl i gceist san leasú seo ach an tAire Talmhaíochta agus an tAire Iascaigh.

      <P>Tá rud éigin ag cur isteach orm anois.  Nuair a bhí Gaeltarra Éireann ann níor ghá dóibh dul go dtí Aire na Gaeltachta agus an Roinn Airgeadais.  Tá an triú Aire tar éis teacht anois, An tAire Tionscáil, Tráchtála agus Fuinnimh, agus measaimse gur de bharr sin go raibh níos mó cumhachta ag Gaeltarra Éireann ná mar atá ag an Údarás anois.  Tá cumhacht Ghaeltarra Éireann á laghdú anseo.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from this section that the approval of three Ministers is required. There are many grants dealt with under subsection (5) of this section, the research and development grant, the enterprise development grants, the marketing grants, the interest subsidy grants and others which are all subject to the consent of three Ministers.  In my view Gaeltarra Éireann had more power because they had only to go to two Ministers, the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Finance but now a third Minister is brought in.  Those who have read annual reports of Gaeltarra Éireann will see that they are in competition with the IDA, a body which is under the aegis of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  That is where the conflict of interest can take place.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy could delay a project long enough for the IDA to have it wrapped up and placed in an area other than a Gaeltacht area.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to at least give an tÚdarás the same power that Gaeltarra Éireann had.  On reading the annual report of Gaeltarra Éireann one can see that they are in competition with SFADCo and the IDA for the same industries. It is obvious that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has won his argument.  Prior to this an industrialist approached Gaeltarra Éireann and the IDA and based his decision on the best bargain he got.  The gun is now being put to the industrialist's head because he is at the mercy of the IDA who make the decision in relation to grants.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy can delay a project sent by an tÚdarás long enough for it to finish up in the IDA books.</P>

Bhí sé sin i gceist i gcónaí go mbeadh teagmháil leis an Aire Tionscail, Tráchtála agus Fuinnimh maidir le tionscail. Anois san ghnáth shlí má thagann tógra isteach chuig an údarás nó chuig Gaeltarra deineann siad féin cinneadh cé acu is ceart glacadh leis an tógra nó é a chaitheamh amach, agus ní chuireann duine ar bith isteach ar an obair sin, fiú amháin Aire na Gaeltachta.  Is iad an bord iad féin a dhéanfaidh an cinneadh agus tá siad saor ar na bealaí sin agus beidh an rud céanna fíor faoin údarás. Tá coimhlint i gcónaí, is fíor sin; tá sé ann leis na County Development Teams agus an IDA.  Tá sé sin ann le fada.

Níl aon difríocht idir an chaoi a bhfuil cúrsaí anois agus an chaoi a bhéas siad nuair a bhéas an tÚdarás bunaithe.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put some questions of detail to the Minister and I would be grateful if he could give me an assurance on them.  Can the Minister as-sure the House that the section as it stands gives the Údarás the right to make advances for working capital?  I notice that under subsection (5) (a) an tÚdarás is allowed to make grants for purposes other than in respect of fixed assets or the training of workers.  I hope this includes the question of making grants for working capital but perhaps the Minister would make this clear to the House.  I ask this question because as far as I understand under the present Gaeltarra Éireann situation the maximum grant is approximately 60 per cent of the fixed assets of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some forms of economic activity where the relationship between the amount of capital ploughed into fixed assets and the amount of capital involved in working capital is substantially different from the traditional relationship. For example, in agriculture and mariculture relating to the development of fisheries, both fresh water and sea water in the coastal areas which include many of the Gaeltacht areas, there can be a very small investment in fixed capital and a large and continuing investment in working capital for a number of years before the enterprise comes to fruition.  If An tÚdarás are not <Col N="322" /> going to be allowed to make advances in relation to working capital, this would strike at the heart of this possibility.</P>
    <P>My second question to the Minister is whether the same section authorises the granting of loans by An tÚdarás.  There is a need for them to be given such powers.  It could be argued that loans are available already to enterprises through organisations such as the IDA, the ICC and BIM but the interest rates on loans vary considerably.  For example, the ICC may give a loan for a project at 12 per cent or 12½ per cent whereas the most favourable loan rate available as far as I am aware is that available from BIM where, on certain projects, the rate is as low as 8 per cent.  The cumulative 4 per cent for the term for which a loan is normally held is substantial, and I would argue strongly that An tÚdarás should not only have the power to give loans but that they should have the power to give loans on terms no less favourable than the most favourable terms available from any other semi-State organisation. If we mean what we say when we talk about the economic development of the Gaeltacht we should be doing this.  We should put our money where our mouth is.</P>
    <P>My final question relates to subsection (4) which states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás shall not provide financial assistance in any particular case where financial assistance has been provided by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I can see the point behind the subsection, that industrialists should not run around behind the back of the IDA to get a grant from An tÚdarás or <i>vice versa.</i>  It may well be the case that a particular development in the Gaeltacht have got an IDA grant for their establishment, that they have been established and are doing very well and want to double their capacity.  They may decide that the most appropriate source of financial help for this reinvestment programme is An tÚdarás.  Under subsection (4) the fact that the IDA have given a grant to the enterprise seems to rule out the possibility of any assistance from An tÚdarás for further development, no matter <Col N="323" /> how wise and sound such a development may be.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to state if he would consider at a later stage amending the subsection, to write in a proviso that financial assistance should not be provided by An tÚdarás in any case where financial assistance has been provided by the IDA without the prior consent of the IDA or without consultation by An tÚdarás with the IDA.</P>

      <P>Maidir le caipiteal oibre agus iasachtaí tá mise sásta go mbeidh na cumhachtaí atá anseo faoin Údarás ceart go leor.  Is féidir leo scaireanna a ghlacadh, cuirimíd i gcás, agus a chinntiú go n-aisíocfar na h-iasachtaí.  Níl aon chumhacht ag an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail, an IDA, iasachtaí a thabhairt i láthair na huaire agus bíonn iasachtaí le fáil taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ón gcuideachta, An Cáirdeas Tionscail Teo, sin an ICC.  Sa gnáth shlí is iad na bainc is mó a chuireann airgead ar fáil le h-aghaidh caipiteal oibre.  Sílim go bhfuil na cumhachtaí sin, mar atá siad í láthair na huaire, réasúnta go leor.  Bíonn deacrachtaí ann go minic maidir le daoine a bheith ró-fhlaithiúil agus ró-éasca le deontaisí a thabhairt amach.  Is féidir leo teacht agus bob a bhualadh b'fhéidir ar an Údarás agus ansin glanadh leo.  Caithfidh srianta a bheith ar chumhachtaí an Údaráis fhéin maidir le dáileadh amach airgead le h-aghaidh deontaisí ar nós scaireanna agus a leithéidí sin.

      <P>Maidir leis an IDA de ghnáth is é an chaoi a n-oibríonn Gaeltarra taobh istigh de limistéirí na Gaeltachta.  Ní bhíonn fonn ar an IDA aon bhaint a bheith acu le tograí nó le deontaisí a thabhairt taobh istigh de limistéirí na Gaeltachta.  Ar an gcuma chéanna is annamh a thárlaíonn sé go mbeadh an scéal ar an gcaoi eile maidir leis an Údarás.  Ní bheadh siadsan ag tabhairt cuidiú taobh amuigh den <Col N="324" /> Ghaeltacht ach amháin i gcaoí go mbeadh b'fhéidir ceangal éigin ag an tionscail leis an nGaeltacht féin.  Dá mba rud é go raibh a leithéid ann bheadh comhoibriú idir an dá dhream ach go hiondúil ní thárlaíonn sé agus baineann sé sin leis an rud a raibh muid ag plé cheana, an chuid den Acht faoin teagmháil a cheart a bheith ag an Aire Tionscail, Tráchtála agus Fuinnimh, gur cheart an ceangal sin a bheith aige le Roinn na Gaeltachta agus leis an Údarás ins na cúrsaí seo.</P>

Nuair atá airgead an Stáit i gceist, bíonn daoine, déarfainn, ag iar-raidh bheith ró-fhial.  Ní shílim gur ceart dúinn dul thar an bpointe seo maidir leis an Údarás agus na cumhachtaí seo.</P>

Instead of making special allowance for such depressed areas the banks can now apply stringent conditions. That is why I appeal to the Minister again: the Údarás would be running less risk if they had loan powers rather than guaranteeing powers.

It is certainly open to question whether the terms and conditions considered equivalent by An tÚdarás would also be considered equivalent by the trade union representing the member involved.  I would suggest that this kind of thing is more easily written into a Bill than ac-tually made to happen, and the Minister should impress on the members of An tÚdarás whom he appoints the necessity for paying attention to responsible representations by trade unionists representing workers who may be transferred from Gaeltarra to An tÚdarás.</P>

      <P>As everybody knows, the Minister for the Public Service is in a difficult position at the moment.  If the Údarás wish to appoint an engineer or a quantity surveyor, it is not good enough that they must go cap in hand to the Minister for the Public Service for sanction for that appointment.  If they employ a clerk of works to look after a project, if it is an extra job, they will have to go the Minister for the Public Service for sanction.  The spirit of that is all wrong and the Údarás should have some type of independence.</P>

Tá gá leis sin ar eagla go mbeadh daoine á dtabhairt isteach agus airgead poiblí á chur amú.  Ó thaobh an ghnáth-fhoireann a bhéas ag an Údarás tá an tÚdarás saor le daoine a cheapadh ach i gcás daoine faoi leith, saineolaithe a bheadh á dtabhairt isteach acu go ceann cúpla bliain, caithfidh siad cead a iarraidh ar Aire na Seirbhíse Poiblí.</P>

The Minister's argument is futile.  There is no point in barking up that tree.  I am too long on the road to be side-stepped.  If the Údarás wish to employ an engineer, an architect or a solicitor, they will have to get the per-mission of two Ministers.  That situation is chaotic.

It is stated clearly in the Bill that the Údarás must get the permission of the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service if they want to employ any consultants.  That is ridiculous.  The Údarás should have some autonomy. The Office of Public Works can employ an architect, a clerk of works or a consulting engineer, without getting the permission of the Minister for Finance in the case of a new school or a drainage scheme, and so on.  The Minister should be big enough to agree that the Minister for the Public Service should have no say in the employment of consultants by the Údarás.  The Údarás should be independent enough to be able to employ people.  They would not employ them if they did not need them.</P>

      <P>I am against this section of the Bill because it contradicts itself.  I would say that this is the only Bill in relation to a State body in the history of the State that has such an obnoxious section in it.  A person without the consent of An tÚdarás cannot disclose any information obtained by him when performing duties as a member of An tÚdarás or as a member of the staff of An tÚdarás or as an adviser or consultant to An tÚdarás.  A person who contravenes this subsection cuirfear fineáil nach mó ná £100 air.  I am intrested in this section.  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire an bhfuil an t-alt sin in aon semi-State body?  Tóg an pointe seo: Dá rachadh mé féin i gcóir an Údaráis thios i gCiarraí Thiar agus gur sheas muintir Chiarrai Thiar laistiar dom agus gur bhuaigh mé suíochán san Údarás, nílim ábalta caint i dtaobh oibreacha an Údaráis toisc go bhfuil an t-alt seo san mBille ach dá dtagainn isteach anseo go dtí Dáil Éireann d'fhéadfainn caint agus ní fhéadfaí aon fhineáil a chur orm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> The point I am making is that this section contradicts itself.  Some members of An tÚdarás will have to keep their mouths shut but if an elected member of An tÚdarás is a TD he can come in here and say what he likes about An tÚdarás and about the workings of An tÚdarás and he cannot be caught.  Under the law of the land he can say what he likes.  I would appeal to the Minister to look again at this section.  I would like to improve the Bill but certainly as it reads now it is all wrong because some members can talk and others cannot. That is not fair.  Under the Constitution it is not fair.  I would appeal to the Minister to look again at that section.</P>

Nuair atá tú ag plé le cúrsaí gnó, cuirimíd i gcás, gur comhairleoir chontae a bhí ina ionadaí ar an Údarás nó leis an Teachta Begley é féin&mdash;ní gá go mbeadh sé ina bhall den Údarás ach cuirimíd i gcás go raibh sé ag cur isteach moladh éigin faoi ghnó éigin&mdash;ní shílim go mbeadh sé ceart go dtabharfadh an Teachta Begley nó duine ar bith eile a bheadh ina bhall den Údarás gaoth do rud mar sin agus gur cheart dó dul thart agus insint don phobal go raibh seo no siúd ar siúl. Bíonn am ann le tograí go gcaithfidh rudaí a beith faoi rún agus níl san chuid sin den Bhille ach le cur ina luí ar na baill go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go gcoinneofaí rudaí faoi rún.</P>
      <P>Céard is £100 sa lá atá inniu ann?  Ní bac romhór é sin ná ní fineáil rómhór é sin.

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have some sympathy with the points advanced by Deputy Begley I disagree with him on one or two aspects of the question. Unless I misunderstood him he was talking earlier about some reservations which were expressed by the chief executive of Gaeltarra Éireann on the possible deleterious effects on confidentiality of certain aspects of this Bill.  If that person believes that confidentiality is important for the working and functions of Gaeltarra Éireann, which will be taken over by an tÚdarás, there is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case for agreeing that the power to ensure confidentiality should find some place in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There might be a difference of opinion between the Minister and me about the phrasing of the thing because as it is phrased in the section one is given the impression that everything is confidential unless specific approval is given by An tÚdarás for its publication whereas, unless I misread him, the force of the Minister's reply was that from time to time the Údarás would want to make certain things confidential and might, therefore, consider wording the article to give the Údarás power to make things confidential if it so chooses rather than giving the same power in the reverse way to exempt things from confidentiality. The effect is the same but it creates a small bias in favour of openness where confidentiality is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I would like to make in relation to confidentiality, although I have some sympathy with Deputy Begley's remarks about the need for people to report back to their electorate, is that confidentiality can be a protection for the elected representative concerned. <Col N="338" /> who may in certain circumstances be subjected to very strong local pressure in relation to certain decisions or in relation to certain business to be transacted by An tÚdarás.  I feel that some elected local representatives might be grateful in the long run for an apron of confidentiality over certain decisions which would enable them to do their duty to the Gaeltacht as a whole as they see it, irrespective of any particular sectional interests in their own constituency or, indeed any other ones as well.  In relation to the openness or otherwise of the dealings of An tÚdarás, could the Minister tell us if one of the effects of this section and perhaps of the Bill as a whole will be to remove Gaeltarra effectively from the ambit of the committee on State-sponsored bodies under which, certainly at one stage, Gaeltarra was included?</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhí Bainisteor Ghaeltarra Éireann a raibh mé ag caint <Col N="339" /> mar gheall air ar maidin, ag rá nach raibh sé sásta leis an Údarás.  I now quote from the interview which took place:</P>
      <P>Jim Fahey: This could well be the last year that Gaeltarra Éireann will be functioning as it has up to now as we have known it, with the introduction of the new Údarás, its powers and its functions may be changed.  As the man who has guided Gaeltarra for quite a number of years now do you think that there are any fundamental changes needed to be made if it is going to function effectively, particularly in the face of increasing competition from industrial development authorities in other regions of the Continent, I am thinking of Scotland of France and the south of Italy?</P>
      <P>Bainisteoir: That has not stopped us up to now from obtaining new projects even though the number of approvals in 1977 was lower than in 1976, but the changes which will make us more competitive in the future will be determined outside. Within the Udarás we will have a question of the democratic influence by having a majority of elected representatives and it will be the job of management to see to it that we derive the maximum advantage from the better communication with the people of the Gaeltacht which this will give us, and also that we will minimise the possible disadvantages which might result from a majority of elected members of the Udarás.</P>
      <P>Jim Fahy: What kind of disadvantages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bainisteoir: There could be a danger that elected representatives would be under pressure to reveal information about companies which were involved in transactions with the Udarás where up to now there would be no worry on the part of industrialists about any breach of confidentiality. There would also be the possibility that there would be a competition between elected representatives for projects on the basis of <Col N="340" /> geographic distribution rather than on a basis of logical situation.</P>

      <P>I am not against confidentiality. I want to make that point quite clear and I am sorry if the Minister misunderstood me.  Suppose three TDs stood for this Údarás, Deputy Paddy Harte in Donegal, Deputy Enda Kenny in Mayo and myself in Kerry if we could come in here and discuss the Údarás <i>ad lib</i> if we liked&mdash;I am not saying that we would do it&mdash;we would have a big advantage over the other members of An tUdarás who could not open their mouths.  I am bothered that some members have an advantage over other members of the Udarás.  I do not know how the Minister will get around it.  I know it will depend on the integrity of the elected representatives because, like the bainisteor of Gaeltarra Éireann, I would be worried that if a company thought their affairs would be discussed from A to Z, their profit and loss, their projects and what they were going to do for the coming year, and some person found the Údarás was able to go along and tell a rival that this person was going along on this line he would be there before the new company had started at all.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to the phrase &ldquo;stand seconded from employment by An tÚdarás&rdquo; in subsection (1). This phrase is capable of interpretation in a number of ways.  The first interpretation is that anybody who is effectively a Dáil or Seanad candidate and is elected shall have his job kept on ice for him until he comes back at the end of <Col N="342" /> his period of membership of Dáil or Seanad.  The other interpretation is that any member of the staff who is nominated for and elected to the Dáil or Seanad shall have a job kept for him, on conditions no worse in relation to salary and other matters, than he had when he left, presumably increased by national wage agreements and other devices.</P>
      <P>There would be a problem if this ambiguity remained because of the possibility that some member of the staff might become a member of the Dáil or Seanad and because of this ambiguity the Údarás might not be able, for a period of perhaps several or many years, to fill that precise position.  Say, for example, the person concerned was the public relations officer of An tÚdarás and decided to run for election, for a political party or otherwise, for the Dáil or Seanad.  Would the effect of the subsection be that as long as he remained a member of the Dáil or Seanad, An tÚdarás could not appoint anybody else to that job?  If that were the interpretation, or even a possible interpretation, of the subsection it might seriously hamper the work of An tÚdarás by preventing them from filling specific jobs which may have been vacated on secondment from time to time by people who stand for and are elected to the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this section between now and Report Stage to ensure that the hands of An tÚdarás are not tied in relation to the filling of jobs that may be vacated for several years by people who are going into active politics, while at the same time guaranteeing, as the section attempts to guarantee, the right of such persons to continuing employment by An tÚdarás after they cease their full time involvement in politics.</P>

Maidir le duine de ghnáth an Údaráis ní bhéas an scéal <Col N="343" /> céanna ann.  Sílim go bhfuil pointe maith á dhéanamh ag an Teachta Horgan gur ceart dearcadh ar sin ceart go leor le fáil amach i gcásanna mar sin, cásanna ina mbeidh cáiliochtaí speisialta aige, agus go mbeidh sé tairbheach don Udarás a phost a líonadh fhad is bheadh sé in a Theachtá Dála nó in a Sheanadóir.

Níl sé ag cainnt faoi ghnáth bhaill an Údaráis.  Ní bheidh deacracht ar bith faoi gnáth bhall den Údarás. Beidh sé cosúil leis na múinteoiri, leis na státseirbhisigh agus daoine eile atá anseo&mdash;baill de chomhairle chontae, mar adúirt an Teachta féin.  Ní bheidh aon deacracht ansin.  Is féidir duine a thabhairt isteach go sealadach leis na postanna a líonadh, ach i gcás duine a mbeadh eolas faoi leith aige, saineolaí de chineál éigin agus go mbeadh tábhacht in a chuid oibre don Udarás, ní ionann an cás sin ná ní bheadh sé furasta duine den chineál sin a fháil.</P>

      <P>This amendment while appearing to limit the scope of the section is in fact one which intends to have the opposite effect. The need for long-term budgeting has been accepted in principle by Irish Governments for some time.  The first Devlin report which suggested the idea of quinquennial budgeting was accepted in principle by the Fianna Fáil Government at that time.  I think it would be a very good exercise for the Minister to look for reasonable projections over, say, a three- to five-year period from An tÚdarás not with a view necessarily to restricting the scope of their financial activities but to making sure that the money they have available is put to the best possible use.</P>
      <P>Under a system of purely annual budgeting it is possible for the expenditure implications of particular financial commitments, over a period of time beyond the time for which the budget is produced and the plans are drawn up, to be missed.  As we on this side of the House are very much in favour of planning and of creative forward planning of the economy in general, we hold that the activities of An tÚdarás provide a very useful encapsulated sort of area where effective planning could have very profoundly beneficial linguistic and social as well as economic effects.</P>

      <P>I tabled this amendment because of the possibility of a misunderstanding or ambiguity in respect of a phrase in subsection (2).  The word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; in English and &ldquo;imeachtaí&rdquo; in Irish have the connotation of minutes as in the minutes of a meeting, whereas, in line with all we have been saying here, it is precisely to the minutes of meetings to which will most frequently apply the confidentiality that the Minister was talking of.

      <P>Gan dearmad a dhéanamh ar na Gealtachtaí beaga.  Tá Dún na nGall, Maigh Eó, Gaillimh agus Ciarraí sásta go leor.  Tá trí Gaeltachtaí beaga&mdash;Corcaí, Port Láirge agus Ráth Cairn.  Níl mise sasta iad a fhágaint amach ar fad.  An bhfuil an tAire ábalta aon ní a dhéanamh mar measaim féin go bhfuil ard-mheas ag dul do na Gaeltachtaí siúd mar do choimeádar an teangan beo nuair a bhí ana-bhrú orthu ar fad.  Tá sort &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; attitude againn anois anseo: Tá gach rud ag dul go dtí na Gaeltachtaí móra.  Níl aon ní do na Gaeltachtaí beaga.  Níl a dhóthain daoine ins na Gaeltachtaí beaga duine a thoghadh mar bhall den Údarás.  Tá na hoileáin againn freisin.  Leigh me i bpáipéar nuair a ceapadh an tAire mar Aire na Gaeltachta gur thug sé cuairt ar cheann dena h-oileáin.  Dúirt sé go raibh <Col N="352" /> sé beartaithe aige na deontais chéanna a thabhairt dona daoine a bhí ag maireachtaint sna hoíleáin cosúil leis na daoine a bhí ag maireachtaint sa Ghaeltacht.  An bhfuil dearmad déanta ag an Aire ar an gcuairt sin?  Chonaic mé a phictiúr i gceann dena nuachtáin as a chontae féin agus bhí an tAire ag féachaint galánta sa phictiúr.</P>

      <P>My amendment has been ruled out of order but, speaking on the section, I would urge the Minister to look again seriously at the plight of the small Gaeltacht areas such as Rath Cairn, Waterford and Cork.  The people owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to those living in these areas for the way in which they have kept the language alive despite all the pressures on them.  It is easy to keep a language alive where everyone speaks the language.  In these particular areas the people have gone out of their way to promote Irish culture and the Irish language in every walk of life.  I would appeal to the Minister even at this late stage not to let these people think they are forgotten.  They are a special case and I am sorry the Minister would not accept our appeal to him that membership of the Údarás should be increased to include representatives from these areas.</P>
      <P>I am interested too in the islands.  The islands are fast becoming depopulated.  I remember a report of the Minister meeting a deputation of islanders and telling them it was his intention or the GovernMent's intention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tóg bog é anois, the Minister told them he would certainly improve their lot.  The Minister now has a golden opportunity to honour that commitment.  I know that he and the <Col N="353" /> Minister for Defence, Deputy Molloy, may have been flushed with victory when they visited the islands.  I tabled a question to the Taoiseach asking if it was intended to improve the grant structure for the islands for new houses, and so on, and that question was transferred to the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  His reply was he was looking into the matter. He has spent a year and a half now looking into it and is in a position now to make an indelible mark so far as the islands are concerned by including them in this section.  These people have a part to play.  They live in these remote districts without the facilities enjoyed on the mainland.  I would urge the Minister to think again about the islanders and the small Gaeltachts.</P>

      <P>Luaigh an Teachta Begley cuairt a thug mé ar na hoileáin. Bhí mé i ngach oileán ar an gcósta ó Thoraí go Oileán Chléire. Sílim nuair a bhí sé ag caint faoi na hoileáin i Maigh Eó b'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé ar eolas aige&mdash;níl fhios agam cén fáth ar thárla sé seo ach tá sé fíor i gcás dhá oileá agus ceann atá ar chósta na Gaillimhe, Oileán Bofín, nach Gaeltachtaí iad agus nach raibh Gaeilge ins na h-oileáin sin le fada an lá.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Thug mé geallúint dóibh agus cloífidh mé leis, ach ní bhaineann sé sin leis an mBille seo. Cuirimíd i gcás fiú amháin dá nglacfaí leis an moladh sin bheadh sé an-deacair toghroinn ceantar amháin a dhéanamh dena h-oileáin ó Thoraí síos go h-oileán Chléire.  Dá dtoghfaí duine i gCléire cuirimíd i gcás nó duine i dToraí nó fiú amháin i gceann ar bith dena h-oileáin cén chaoi a dtiocfadh leis freastal ar na h-oileáin ar fad?  Sin an cás atá dhá dhéanamh ag an Teachta Begley. Tuigeann muid uilig na deacrachtaí atá ag na h-oileáin sin.  Sílim gur fíor a rá go bhfuil níos mó déanta ar na h-oileáin sin ná mar atá déanta ar na h-oileáin eile.  Tá deontais faoi leith le fáil acu, tá cumhacht aibhléise acu; bíonn siad in ann deontais a fháil le haghaidh tithe a <Col N="354" /> dheisiú, deontais nach bhfuil ar fáil sna hoileáin eile.  Le blianta beaga anuas tá siad ag fáil cuidiú sna comharchumann ar na hoileáin sin le cúrsaí a reachtáil agus arís tá deontais á fháil acu nach bhfuil le fáil ag muintir na n-oileán eile. Tugann sé sin le tuiscint nach bhfuil Roinn na Gaeltachta ag déanamh faillí ar bith ar mhuintir na n-oileán sin. Tuigimid na deacrachtaí atá acu ach de réir a chéile táimid ag teacht i gcabhair orthu chomh maith agus is féidir linn.  Ní morán cabhair dóibh bheith ag caint faoi nó bheith ag iarraidh breis ionadaíochta a thabhairt, nuair mar tharla ar maidin, a votáileamar nach mbéadh ar an Udarás ach triúr dhuine dhéag.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis an argóint sin, ní aontaim leis.  Thug sé mar argóint go raibh na hoileáin an-scaipthe ó Oileán Toraí, go Oileán Cléire agus nach bhféadfaí togh-cheantar amháin a dhéanamh díobh.  Is fíor sin ach mar sin féin tá Contae na Mí anfhada amach ó iarthar na hÉireann agus tá ó thuaisceart na hÉireann agus tá Gaeltacht ansin, tá Gaeltacht i bPort Láirge agus tá an Ghaeltacht seo curtha isteach le Gaeltachtaí atá i bhfad i bhfad ó bhaile, mar a déarfá.  Tá Gaeltacht Chiarraí ann.  Is dóigh liom gur fíor-lag an argóint a rá go bhfuil siad ró scaipthe le h-iad a chur isteach i dtogh-cheantar amháin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire go raibh eolas maith aige ar na deacrachtaí agus ar na fadhbanna a bhaineann leis na h-oileáin sin.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil taithí aige ar an gcuid sin den tír, taithí go deo aige, le fada an lá.  Ní haon mhaith eolas a bheith agat ar na deacrachtaí agus ar na fadhbanna munar féidir leat rud éigin a dhéanamh futhu.  Mar adúirt mise anseo nuair a bhí an Bille seo á phlé cúpla seachtain ó shin, ní thuigim cén fáth nach féidir rud éigin nua a dhéanamh maidir leis an fhadhb seo agus triail a bhaint as cheantair nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga labhartha iontu a thógáil isteach agus triail a bhaint as an scéim seo féachaint an dtiocfaidh feabhas ar bith ar an scéal ó thaobh na teanga dhe.  Tiocfaidh feabhas cinnte ar an scéal chomh fada is go mbeidh deontais á bhfáil ag na daoine seo atá ar fáil <Col N="355" /> faoi láthair ag Gaeltachtaí móra.  Ní thuigim an argóint atá ag an Aire faoi na ceanntair seo a bheith scaipthe i bhfad amach ó chéile agus nach féidir féachaint orthu mar aonad faoin mBille seo.  Tá ceantair ar an mórthir atá i bhfad níos scaípthe á gcur isteach le pobail atá scoilte amach na mílte uathu. Mar sin, ní dóigh liom gur argóint chóir nó cheart nó réasúnach í sin.</P>

    <P>Molaim an leasú seo don Teach. Measaim féin nach bhfuil sé ceart d'aon Aire Stáit a rúnaí a tharraingt isteach sa phoilitíocht.  Tá prionsabal ann.  Go dtí seo bhí an sheriff, the county registrar or the county manager ann.  There is a principle involved here.  It is wrong to be dragging the secretary of a Department into politics.  It will now be up to the secretary to appoint personnel to run the elections.  The secretary may appoint persons who appear suitable to people living in Dublin but who might be very active in local politics, and who would be in charge of local political party branches.  It should be written into the section that objections to the appointment of personnel would be listened to. This situation would not arise if county managers or county registrars were responsible for running the election.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Gaeltacht have no experience of running elections. It is very unfair to put the Secretary of that Department in this position and to set him up as a target for opposition parties in the life of a Dáil because of something that might have happened in the course of an election to an tÚdarás. County registrars are considered to be above politics.  This section put the secretary of a Department in an invidious position.  We can now have a go at him.  I am quite sure that the Secretary of the Department will do his duty according to his conscience.  He would not have reached that position if his integrity had not been beyond question.  For the first time the Minister is questioning <Col N="358" /> publicly the integrity of a Secretary of a Department.  I appeal to the Minister to leave that side of it to the hardened politicians, the county registrars or the county managers as the case may be. The Minister should take the Secretary out of the line of fire.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;, nó a gheofar ciontach i gcion faoi alt 15 den Acht seo, nó a mhainneoidh leas a nochtadh mar a cheanglaítear faoi mhír 8 den Sceideal seo&rdquo;, a chur isteach i ndiaidh &ldquo;sin&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> In page 24, paragraph 2 (b) (ii), line 50, after &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; to add:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;, or who is found guilty of an offence under section 15 of this Act or who fails to make a disclosure required under paragraph 8 of this Schedule.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an important amendment because it relates to the matter on which the Minister has placed such emphasis in his interventions here today, specifically that of confidentiality and of disclosure of interest.  It is absolutely essential for the effective working of An tÚdarás, and for An tÚdarás to be seen as impartial, efficient and just in the administration of the moneys entrusted to them by Dáil Éireann and the Minister, that any infringement of a fiduciary relationship by a member of An tÚdarás should be punished in the most obvious way by rendering a member of An tÚdarás ineligible to continue in membership after a breach of such relationship.  This is not a case in which half measures can be tolerated, because you cannot have half confidence or semi-confidence in a member of An tÚdarás; you have to have complete confidence in him, or you have no confidence in him.  Paragraph 7 (2) of the First Schedule lays it down only that a member of An tÚdarás shall be disqualified for holding office... if he is adjudged bankrupt or makes a composition or arrangement with creditors or is sentenced by court of competent jurisdiction to imprisonment or penal servitude or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to add two further causes of disqualification for members of An tÚdarás: the first is when a member of An tÚdarás is in breach of confidentiality under section 15 (2) of the Bill.  The second is in relation to any member of An tÚdarás who fails to make a declaration of interest in relation to a matter with which An tÚdarás is dealing under paragraph 8 (1) of the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>It seems to be inescapable, in the logic of the Minister's own remarks and from the whole thrust of the Bill, that if we are to have confidence in An tÚdarás breaches of this kind must merit the ultimate <Col N="365" /> sanction of exclusion from the workings of An tÚdarás in the future.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider adding these criteria to those for disqualification contained in paragraph 7 (2) of the First Schedule at present.</P>

      <P>Táimíd chun seacht mball den Údarás a thoghadh agus cuir i gcás go bhfaigheann duine amháin acu bás nó má éiríonn sé as oifig.  I think the Minister must re-phrase this paragraph. It is wrong because the Minister said only the elected members can decide a co-option.  Let me cite the example of a situation in which seven people are elected.  One of the seven is called away or resigns from office for some reason or another.  There is then the situation in which there are six remaining.  Let us say that three of them are Fianna Fáil, perhaps two are Fine Gael and one Labour, or perhaps three Labour, three Fianna Fáil, or whatever the case may be.  Who will decide then on the person who is going to be nominated?  It does not make sense as it is.  Will you draw from a hat, toss a coin or what but, as the paragraph reads, it does not make sense.  The Minister will have to look at this paragraph again and come back to me.  I think it is an error in the drafting of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister appoint the person in the event of a tie?  He is elected to the Dáil.  The co-option will be by elected members.  The Minister owes it to the House and to the spirit in which we have been debating this Bill to state how the appointment will be made if a tie situation exists.  How is the appointment to be <Col N="366" /> made when it is specifically stated in the Bill that only elected members shall coopt? I would ask the Minister to reconsider this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last Thursday I had said this was one of the most important Bills to come before this House.  It has received the unanimous support of all parties and a definite welcome from all sides of the House.  Therefore, it should get a speedy passage through the House, although I have no doubt a number of technical matters will require some teasing out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Speaking last week I mentioned the difficulties which might arise in relation to articles or goods of a technical nature. A foreign manufacturer may not accept that an article was defective at the point of sale, and may state that the defect did not arise at the point of manufacture but was caused by negligence on the part of the consumer or the user.  Obviously this would cause serious difficulties for the sales agent or the retailer.  If the courts were to find in favour of the buyer, this could cause a number of difficulties and also expense for the seller although the problem was not of his making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1893 Sale of Goods Act the contract between the buyer and the seller was equally binding, but this new Bill puts greater responsibility and onus on the seller to ensure that his customers will have full protection and that the goods sold will satisfy the requirements or the needs of the purchaser.  No one <Col N="369" /> should think for one moment that this Bill will solve all the problems.  There are a large number of difficulties in this area, and the passage of this Bill will not convert over-night people who are trading for a fast buck or a fast profit.</P>
    <P>There are far too many chancers in business today as is generally known, particularly those who are here today and gone elsewhere tomorrow.  This type of trading is becoming a very serious hazard to commerce and undoubtedly it is cheating respectable, established, reputable traders who are giving employment and contributing a fair share to the economy.  This area requires urgent legislation.  In the meantime, the consumer is being tempted and exhorted by advertising pressure in a very big way to purchase every household article imaginable: furniture, carpets, electrical goods, toys, and so on, which are advertised at give-away prices.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in many cases the public are actually queuing to get into hired halls and sheds and millions of pounds are leaving the country with little or no return for anybody.  In a situation like that, the consumers need protection from themselves.  Goods bought at these sales, whether they are called bankruptcy sales, fire damage sales, monster sales, or whatever, are generally foreign made.  Many of them are unbranded and junky.  They carry no guarantee.  Generally the sellers are unknown and the consumer has no redress in the event of articles proving unsatisfactory in any way.</P>
    <P>In the case of electrical articles there is an even greater danger.  Very often inferior electrical goods such as electric blankets, fires, heaters, and so on, can be a serious hazard.  As we know, 95 per cent of them do not conform with safety standards as laid down here.  The consumer is under severe attack by unscrupulous traders.  From now until Christmas there will be a constant barrage of advertising by fly-by-night merchants.  Consumers have been conned. As a temporary measure the Minister responsible should draw the attention of the public, in the media if necessary, to the serious risks they are taking in purchasing goods from this <Col N="370" /> type of trader.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong lobby advocating action in this area.  I hope the Minister will consider introducing some measure which might curb that type of trading.  The section in the Bill relating to the sales of used cars is very timely and very necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As I tried to point out last night, despite whatever gloss the Minister tries to put on it, the factual situation is that on any available statistics an extremely serious situation prevails in the national housing picture. We are not building houses fast enough <Col N="371" /> to cope with the growing demand.  In the context of their manifesto the Government's pledge to make it easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it rings very hollow indeed.  There will be another time and place for party politics, and leaving aside the manifesto, so far as it is possible to do so, and considering the facts, I would ask the Minister to face up fairly and squarely to the enormous implications of the problems.</P>
      <P>On the question of house prices the facts are that, from the first quarter of 1977 to the first quarter of 1978, new house prices for which loans were approved by building societies increased by 44.1 per cent.  New house prices for which loans were approved by assurance companies increased by 37.64 per cent. New house prices for which loans were approved by associated banks rose by 37.88 per cent.  The general picture shows that house prices have gone out of control.</P>
      <P>Take alongside this the fact that this year the allocation of finance for local authority house building has decreased as a percentage of the public capital programme to an all-time low of 10.55 per cent, and take also into account the fact that so far as there are available figures as, for example, in the major Dublin region, it is clear that we are going to build the lowest number of local authority houses since the beginning of the seventies.  There has been a dramatic increase in the number of people seeking houses, from 6,100 to 8,400 families. Those are the facts and figures of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister consider the wider national implications?  We must provide houses for people all over the country if we are to get rid of not just the growing number of people who need houses but the existing backlog.  A number of studies have been carried out, for example, that by J. G. Eustace of the Department of Town Planning in UCD entitled &ldquo;Housing Requirements in the Dublin Sub-Region&rdquo;.  These reports estimate that if the housing needs in Dublin city alone are to be met, 14,000 houses a <Col N="372" /> year until 1991 would need to be built. The NBA will build 1,500 houses.  Their report is permeated by a tone of pessimism and concern about the future. This would not give anybody confidence in them, hamstrung as they may be by a number of problems facing them.  There is a real problem here.  No party could tell the people that the housing situation is anything but serious.  This situation is very serious, because so much good or ill can spring from the basic policy and attitude of the Government towards housing.  How can the Minister and the Government expect people who are inadequately housed, who are living in hovels, to live in any sense of the word a right life and to bring up their families in decent conditions?  I suggest that the Minister pay attention to the facts and do something about this rather than trying to malign his predecessors who did their best during a difficult period.</P>
    <P>From reading any of the statistical analyses or reports recently made available by the ESRI, the Central Bank or figures supplied by an independent source, one realises there is a serious housing shortage.  There is serious inflation in house prices, there is a serious shortage of serviced sites and there is a growing number of applicants looking for them.  The increases in cash payments by the Government in this area are irrelevant, unless they are taken in the context of the percentage ratios to previous years.  If they are the criteria adopted it will be seen that the Government's efforts at this stage are far too little, too late.</P>
    <P>There are one or two specific matters the Minister tried to draw out attention to last night.  The certificate of reasonable value system is not working satisfactorily.  The Minister has a number of reports on his desk to which I understand from his answers at Question Time yesterday he is addressing himself.  I would ask him to consider the minority of unscrupulous builders who exploit this system and inflate prices.  This can be and is simply done, and I will forward the details in my possession to the Minister in due course, and privately.</P>
    <P>If we are to tackle the provision of <Col N="373" /> serviced sites it will need imaginative and courageous vision and action by this Government of a kind which has not been forthcoming so far, not just in the housing area but right across the board. We have derelict sites all over the city which are ripe for housing potential.</P>
    <P>The question of planning permission might be looked at.  It is most inflationary that people should be able to acquire planning permission and then sell sites.  I suggest that planning permission be made applicable to the first applicant and not transferable.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal more one could say, but perhaps other speakers will raise other relevant points.  Any Government that seek to water down the motion before the House are negligent in their duty, and I call on them to set up an open public inquiry to reconstitute the National Building Agency, to give adequate funds to future housing needs, and to face this issue fairly and squarely. They will be doing everybody an outstanding service if they do so, but if they bury their heads in the sand they will be doing nothing but harm to the people on this island.</P>

      <P>I am not going to enter into a diatribe about the performance of the Coalition Government in relation to housing.  I will, of course, refer to the performance of Fianna Fáil, in relation <Col N="374" /> to housing not only now but over many years.  I remember a time when the former Coalition Government were in power and houses could be given away because people were emigrating to England.  Then began an economic development period when houses became more valuable.  This has something to do with what happened in recent times in this country.  There has been a resurgence in growth and development at a pace which was faster than people expected, although it was set out in the targets of the economic Ministers at the beginning of this Government's term of office.  This growth in itself creates and generates new interest and a capacity to purchase houses.  Land is a problem in every country, not only in Ireland.  This problem did not arise only tonight or last week.  During the year we had various debates in which we discussed this problem.  On the Estimate for the Department of the Environment we had detailed contributions from both sides of the House and various measures were taken by the Minister.  Every country has a problem providing land at a reasonable cost for housing.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have a tradition of facing up to problems.  We have not been afraid to face up to them in the past.  One aspect of Fianna Fáil policy was to provide a land bank.  They introduced the concept of a land bank and provided land by the capital purchase of land in advance of housing requirements.  Many estates around our city were purchased in this way.  The corporation estates in Kilbarrack, Donaghmede, around Raheny, Baldoyle and other areas provide excellent houses for people who want to own their own homes.  These estates were provided because of the foresight of Fianna Fáil Governments in establishing not only the concept but the reality of a land bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition built houses during their term in office but they benefited from the land bank and the serviced land that had been established during the term of office of the last Fianna Fáil Government.  If we consider the pattern of the completion of dwellings we find that the figure in this regard for 1971 <Col N="375" /> was 15,380, that in 1972 it was 21,573 while in 1973 it was 24,660.  Surely the Coalition cannot claim that these increases were due to them.  Obviously the increases were the result of a plan that had been prepared in advance and which was being executed by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  In fairness to the Coalition they continued, on assuming office, to provide houses with the result that in 1974 there were completed 26,256 houses while in 1975 the figure was 26,892 but 1976 showed the beginning of a decline when there was a drop back to 24,000.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that in 1977 we completed 24,500 houses while the figure for 1978 will be more than 26,000, having regard to the current figures.  Consequently, the indications are clearly that Fianna Fáil have a very responsible attitude to the question of the provision of houses.  But I am concerned regarding the figures in respect of land acquired by agreement.  Let us take Dublin Corporation as an example.  In 1972 they acquired 245 acres.  That was during the term of a Fianna Fáil administration. During 1973 the corporation acquired 617 acres but in the following years the figures show a falling off&mdash;to 197 in 1973 to 118 in the following year, to 83 in the year after that while the figure for 1977 was 120.  This indicates a fall-off in the supply of serviced land provided by the local authority.  Personally I had suspected that there was a tendency to build houses without providing sufficiently for the future.  In this respect I would merely say that Fianna Fáil introduced the concept of the land bank and provided a supply of serviced land for future generations, and I am sure this party will do that again.  In the meantime the land bank has been depleted.  The supply of serviced land has been reduced, but Fianna Fáil's policy is one of commitment to home ownership.  Therefore, every measure possible will be taken to facilitate the purchase of land for housing. Bearing this in mind a review and, if necessary, an updating of the Kenny Report is timely.  In this regard we should consider the EEC dimension of <Col N="376" /> this question.  The EEC could help with the development of land and with the necessary infrastructure to provide serviced land.  I would assume that if the transfers which relate to the EMS are obtained, transfers involving as much as £650 million, they will go largely towards infrastructural development, and that in turn this will go in part towards the provision of roads and serviced land for industry and commerce.</P>
    <P>In addition the EEC could be helpful by way of the application of regional aid to special problem areas in respect of development such as the inner city area, a question that has been harped on recently a good deal and which presents a great problem for us in Dublin. However, the matter is being tackled and the Minister is providing an additional budget in that regard as against the other parts of the country.  But even this needs to be supplemented, and that is why I should like to see the EEC regional aid being applied to special problem areas.  The problem, though, is not peculiar to Dublin.  It is an extensive problem in the major population centres of all member states.</P>
    <P>When I consider the facts in relation to the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and the low-rise mortgage loans, I am surprised at the motion in the names of Deputy Quinn and others, because I realise the performance of this Government to date in this sphere.  I note that in 1977 when the Coalition was still in office there was a budgetary provision in respect of low-rise mortgage schemes of £2.1 million whereas under the Fianna Fáil administration in 1978 the amount in this respect was £5.9 million.  This scheme is very useful and can be used very beneficially by people on low incomes in that it gives a tremendous start to a young couple by subsidising the interest charges for the first ten years on a decreasing scale.  I should like to see the scheme being extended and used more widely.  Having regard to the facts, the situation would not support the points made by the Opposition in their motion.</P>
    <P>Regarding the SDA loans, which, again are very important, I note that in the Coalition budget of 1977 there was provided for this purpose £17 million <Col N="377" /> whereas the figure in the Fianna Fáil budget of 1978 was £30 million, but more than £30 million will be used during the year.  In the past SDA loans have been used widely by people even in the middle-income group.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the maximum loan position so far as the SDA scheme is concerned.  Most Deputies will be familiar with the problems associated with house purchase, particularly in relation to income limits and the extent of the loans. However, when I refer to the record I find that the Minister increased the SDA loan in the first instance from £4,500 to £7,000 and that subsequently when that was found to be inadequate he increased the amount to £9,000.  I do not think any reasonable person could have expected the Minister to do much more in that short time.  Of course all of us would like to see more money being made available, but it is obvious that the Minister is concerned, that he has taken very positive measures, and that he has been prepared to take further measures when necessary.  The low-rise mortgage scheme has been increased from £7,500 to £9,000.  Here again it started off at a higher point initially and has been increased to the same level as the SDA loan of £9,000.</P>
    <P>The income limits are a bone of considerable contention at the moment and a matter about which we must all be concerned.  It is only fair to say that during the Coalition period these were not increased, but when the Minister came in he increased the income limits almost immediately from £2,450 to £3,500. Like many other Deputies I would like to see this limit increased further.  One of the main problems in the short term is the fact that the basic £3,500 includes overtime.  Around the country in different counties I find some variation in the methods of assessment of this basic income.  The most satisfactory immediate step to take here would be to exclude overtime from basic income assessment; in other words if the basic income does not exceed £3,500 the purchaser should be eligible for the loan. The next step would be to increase further the actual limit as soon as is feasible.  I ask the Minister to consider in <Col N="378" /> the very near future the question of removing overtime from the wages assessment for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has caused a great deal of debate and discussion recently is the interest rates on mortgages.  Initially under Fianna Fáil and for quite a long time the interest rates came down as the economic situation improved and plans for economic development got under way.  In the short term we had a fairly dramatic reduction in interest charges on mortgages.  The Minister has reduced the SDA loan interest charge from 12½ per cent to 11½ per cent and at the same time the building society rates came down.  Quite recently we have had a sudden rise in the interest rates on building society mortgages.  It was not because of our Government's action that the interest rates rose; it was because of general problems with the British £ sterling and of Britain's decision to increase drastically the lending rates.</P>
    <P>We can constructively analyse the possibilities here.  One of the effects of our joining the EMS would be the breaking of the absolute dependence on British interest rates and on the British £. Hopefully, in that event we would have greater stability in interest rates for house purchasers.  I am certain that the economic environment created by such a measure would foster the stabilising of interest rates, and this would be of considerable benefit to house purchasers.  A long-term objective of joining the EMS is to achieve lower interest rates for borrowing for social, industrial and economic investment.  I do not know if this aspect of the matter is realised; I have not heard it put forward as yet.  If we could get away from the immediate effects of British policy on the interest rates and come to a situation of greater stability such as applies to Dutch and German interest rates, we could introduce fixed interest charges for building societies for, say, three years.  If we can bring our currency to stability and with that bring down our interest charges, then we could introduce a scheme under which building society mortgage rates would be fixed for, say, three years.  This would be possible <Col N="379" /> because the rates would not vary very much from year to year anyway, and at the end of three years there could be a review period for establishing a new level.  This would be quite feasible and practicable.  It would give the house owner with a building society mortgage far greater stability in meeting repayments and this is what he wants.  He wants to be sure that he will be able to budget ahead for a period.  In addition to that he would like to have smaller swings in interest charges.</P>
    <P>If we enter the EMS I will ask the Minister to consider such an arrangement for greater stability in mortgage interest rates.  I have had a fair deal of experience of people on mortgages and of the problems which they encountered.  I would like to see a means whereby we could have this stability, and we should plan accordingly.</P>
    <P>In relation to this motion I am very pleased with the performance of the Government to date.  Numerous external factors have affected our environment. The Government, by speeding up the growth and development of progress in the economy, have created a wealthier economy where people have more money to enable them to seek to buy houses.  A great deal has been said about the £1,000 grant.  It has been of considerable benefit to those seeking loans and it was availed of quite extensively.  It was not in any way a cosmetic touch, as has been suggested.  The changes in the SDA limits have been an important step ahead.</P>
    <P>I doubt if any Government in the past in such a short time have taken so many measures in relation to the provision and financing of houses.  We have had a new and very generous scheme of grants for house improvements and the installation of piped water and sewerage services. The adaptation of houses for the physically handicapped and mentally ill has been introduced.  The subsidisable limit on housing sites developed by local authorities for modestly priced housing was increased from £900 to £1,500 per site.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> We have had also reviews of the national rent and tenant purchase schemes.  Various actions have been taken by this Government in relation to borrowing from building societies to do what they can and what is in their power to ensure that young people, particularly, and first time purchasers seeking their first houses, have the support of the financial institutions.  I am, and I have said this previously, disappointed with the response from some particular sectors. If we look at the total cash expenditure on housing we find that in 1975 £115 million were spent on housing.  In 1976 the sum was down to £105 million on the public capital programme and, in 1977, it was down to £93.13 million. There was, in fact, a decline in spending on the public capital programme under the Coalition whereas, in 1978, under the first full Fianna Fáil budget of the new Government we had a rise to £140.58 million under the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>When I look at the figures and at the actions taken by the previous Government, and compare those with the present Government, I find it very hard to sustain the views presented by Opposition speakers.  In fact, I find the evidence points to a Government which is very concerned, a Government which has taken very direct and very immediate action to remedy the situation they found themselves faced with.  I have every confidence the Government will review the Kenny Report and consider what other measures are necessary to ensure reasonable prices for land for housing purposes.  I am also confident that the rate of provision not only of finance but also of sites will be increased and improved under the present Government. One must appreciate that the rate of provision of serviced land will have some lag in it because, if it is not done consistently right through, there will be a lag in the provision of serviced land.  I know that the Fianna Fáil Government are committed to this provision and I believe the figures achieved before Fianna Fáil last went out of office will again be reached.  It certainly will not be a case of just building houses and not providing capital for the future provision of serviced land in addition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> I have pleasure in supporting the amendment tabled by the Minister for the Environment expressing confidence in the Government, in the work already achieved and in what is currently being done in this area of providing land for housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting the motion introduced in the name of Deputy Quinn and the other Labour Party Deputies in relation to the serious problem that exists in housing in the country in general and in the capital city of the country in particular.  I listened with interest to what was said by the Minister of State and to what has just been said by Deputy Woods, because there is a distinct difference in tone between them.  Deputy Woods did not embark on a diatribe of any kind, as he said, but they were basically using the same arguments and basically the same approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods said one or two things of an original nature which deserve a comment.  He suggested that overtime should be excluded from reckonable earnings for the purpose of SDA loans. With respect to Deputy Woods, this is a very crude solution to a very complex problem.  It is certainly true to say that over the past decade or so the dividing line between basic wage and overtime has become blurred.  But that is not to say that here in housing policy is the place to deal with that particular problem in all its complexity.  The answer is basically to increase the upper eligibility limit for these loans.  Deputy Woods and the Minister of State can make all the capital they like by raising the amount of the loans to £5,000 and then to £9,000, but that ignores the fact that the take-up of loans is related far more fundamentally not to the maximum amount of the loan but to the maximum reckonable earnings of the person who wants to claim it.  You can raise loans to £10,000 or £15,000 without getting any noticeably greater take-up if you fail to make any substantial alteration in the upper limit of reckonable earnings.  That is the way to tackle the problem, and not the overtime rate he suggested.  Raise the limit and you do not thereby discriminate, as his <Col N="382" /> suggestion might do, between people who are earning a great deal of overtime and people who are earning very little overtime.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the EMS as a kind of fairy godmother coming along with the magic wand to save us from all our problems, on this particular occasion from the problem of high interest rates on house purchase loans.  He went to some lengths to argue that the advent of the EMS or, to be more precise, the accession of Ireland to the EMS&mdash;a reversal of the policy of St. Patrick because we are bringing the snake back into Ireland&mdash;would create this desired stability.  But there is stability and stability.  There is no point in having stability if it is stability of 14 per cent or more, and no point in having stability at a lower level if that stability is bought, or subsidised, or underwritten by long-term soft loans from the European Monetary System, loans which will eventually have to be repaid, and repaid with interest, however soft.  Achieving low interest rates is only postponing the problem for another day, another Minister and another Government to solve.  Indeed, there is some evidence that the number of problems which fall into this category under this Government is increasing by the day.</P>
    <P>As part of his peroration Deputy Woods looked forward to the time when the housing programme would achieve the figures achieved by Fianna Fáil when they were last in Government.  But that is not the target for Fianna Fáil. The target for Fianna Fáil is the target of 100,000 houses built in the four years under the last Government.  If Fianna Fáil achieve that, or beat that, then they may have something to talk about, but not if they confine their expectations, modest and all as they are, to reaching a figure which was beaten by the last Government, and resoundingly beaten at that.</P>
    <P>The speech of the Minister of State was a model of its kind.  He used figures where figures suited his purpose and he used percentages where percentages suited his purpose.  He skated very rapidly over the thin ice of his argument and it is logical to assume that, because he <Col N="383" /> used figures in certain instances rather than percentages, it was because percentages would not have suited him.  If he used percentages in some instances rather than figures it was because figures would not have suited him.  The ice on which he was skating was very thin indeed. A classical example of the thin ice department is contained in the Minister's speech where he stated:</P>
    <P>Housing authorities estimated some weeks ago that they would complete about 6,500 houses this year.  I would be glad to see their expectations realised but because of the factors outside my control, and which I have mentioned, completions will probably be no greater than in 1977.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the number of completions was approximately 6,333.  The Minister is being sanguine if he believes that completions this year will reach this figure.  On the basis of information available to us to date it seems unlikely that they will even break 6,000 or, if they break it, it will not be by very much.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in the course of his speech that the public capital programme in 1979 will once again give evidence of the Government's firm intention of achieving their housing objective. If we look at the question of capital we must look in terms of percentages and not in terms of gross increases.  In particular, we must look at percentages of the public capital budget accounted for by housing in general and by local authority housing in particular.  That is at the core of our motion and the only kind of housing available to people who are unable through their own means to buy private houses.  If we want to examine cutbacks or increases in capital expenditure on housing the only unbiased way we can measure this is by calculating the percentage of the public capital programme allotted to housing in each financial year.  The public capital programme gives not just estimates but, in relation to past years, gives actual outturns and actual expenditure.  For example, for the years 1976-77 and 1978, under the headings of local authority <Col N="384" /> housing and public capital expenditure on private housing there are some interesting percentages.  These percentages, because they relate to the percentage of the public capital budget expended on housing, are a far more reliable guide to the sincerity of the Government when they talk about spending money on housing than any gross figures however much they may have increased in actual terms or in percentage terms on the actual allocation for the previous year.  The public capital budget changes from year to year and it is the slice of that cake for housing, and public housing in particular, that we are concerned with.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the public capital programme outturn for local authority housing, as a percentage of the total public capital programme, amounted to about 10.89 per cent and the estimate for 1978 is that the equivalent percentage will be 10.55 per cent.  That means that a smaller proportion of the public capital budget will apparently be allocated for local authority housing this year than was last year.  This 10.55 per cent includes the low rise mortgage increases of which the Minister and Government Deputies have been so proud.  In the private sector in public capital expenditure on private housing there has been an increase over the two years from 3.85 to 7.54 per cent. It must be remembered that that includes the famous £1,000 grant which went, basically, into the pockets of the builders.</P>
    <P>It is a fundamental part of our argument that the problems which the Government are now trying to solve are ones which they created by their inflationary policies and rash promises. They have thrown a whole series of spanners into a machine which is uniquely sensitive at the best of times but which has reacted in a predictable way to such uncouth and crude stimuli as have been applied by the Government.  A classic example of this was the £1,000 grant on which the Government made such play coming up to the election.  The recent report of the ESRI on housing stated this, and those who have bought a house know that the real obstacle for most people when it comes to buying a <Col N="385" /> house is not so much the weekly repayments on a mortgage, although these represent a substantial problem, as the initial deposit required.  Once one gets one's foot on the ladder of domestic house ownership unless one is very unlucky or unwise one can never effectively be budged off that ladder.  The problem is to get on it in the first place. The price of getting on it in the first place is the deposit one puts down on one's first house.  The effect of the Fianna Fáil manifesto was to persuade tens of thousands of couples that the pennies and pounds they had scraped and saved together would, on the advent of Fianna Fáil, be miraculously augumented by the dazzling figure of £1,000.</P>
    <P>We all know what happened to that £1,000.  Where it existed at all&mdash;even this was questionable in some cases because so many existing grants were absorbed into the £1,000 that in some cases the net gain to an individual would be about £100&mdash;it went basically on to the price of houses.  The speed after the general election with which the average price of houses rose by exactly the £1,000 mentioned in the manifesto was eloquent testimony of the ability of the market to take advantage of a carelessly thought out scheme to the detriment of the people whom the scheme was supposed to benefit.  I do not know if the Government ever considered the possibility of what would happen, but I suspect that even if they had they would have let it stand in the belief that this confidence trick&mdash;that is what it was&mdash;would have a substantial positive effect in their favour in the general election campaign.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of my contribution relates to the undeniable fact that a very high proportion of available mortgage finance has been going to people who are buying more expensive houses with larger mortgages.  A couple of weeks ago in my constituency a large estate of houses, costing £45,000 each, was opened.  They are within yards of Dundrum village and within sight of many people who are on one of the longest and most pathetic waiting lists of any housing area within the general responsibility of Dublin County Council. Those houses at £45,000, all no doubt <Col N="386" /> mortgaged to the hilt, are an affront to the officials and members of Dublin County Council who are trying to provide decent housing for the people who really need it.  The tragedy was that the scheme was officially opened by a Deputy of the Minister's party.  If the Government mean what they say about the need to provide low-cost housing for those who need it most, about the need to direct mortgages into the lower end of the mortgage market, it is time that Ministers and Deputies suited their actions to their words.  They should avoid, politely or impolitely as they choose, public association with housing developments of the kind I have described which eat up mortgage finance that should be available for other sectors of the community. I can assure the Minister of State and whoever else lives in one of those houses in my constituency that I certainly would not because I cannot afford it on £6,700 per year and that amount is substantially ahead of the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this in his speech where he mentioned the Government's request to the building societies to make loan money available in certain ways; for example, that at least 60 per cent of the total funds available for mortgages should be allocated for house purchasers whose mortgage requirements do not exceed £13,000.  Ironically the figure of £13,000 is the maximum that a building society will lend to a Member of this House on the basis of a salary of £6,700.  As I have pointed out, this is not a small salary in comparison with the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>The Minister may make these approaches to the building societies but they are caught in a double vice which is in large part the creation of other fiscal and taxation policies of this Government. In the ESRI report to which I have referred, the authors point out that there are several reasons&mdash;I am identifying two in particular&mdash;why more mortgage finance should go to people who are buying larger houses.  One is that the reduction of the higher marginal rates of taxation in 1977 would have enabled many on above average incomes to finance greatly increased mortgages. <Col N="387" /> Secondly, the shortage of land in the outer Dublin area and the land price escalation could have given impetus to builders to build expensive houses.</P>
    <P>It is not by any means the fault of the building societies.  They have to do this because, among other things, they have a responsibility to their investors and they have to ensure that their appropriate liquidity ratios are maintained. I should like to ask the Minister of State or the next speaker on the Government's side if the Government have considered the possibility of allowing the building societies in a phased way over a period of time to alter their liquidity ratios so as to release a significant amount of money for mortgages at the lower end of the market.  Carefully managed, this could be part of the answer to the housing problem.  I do not say that it would be the entire answer, but at least it is a possible solution and it is one that has been canvassed in public.  It is distinguished by the fact that it is the only one that the Government, so far, do not appear to have considered seriously.</P>
    <P>The final point to which I wish to refer is the question of the price of land. In his speech the Minister referred to &ldquo;problems such as possible constitutional difficulties, the possible disruption of the long-established traditional marketing arrangements for land, and other legal difficulties.&rdquo;  I love the phrase, &ldquo;the possible disruption of the long-established traditional marketing arrangements for land.&rdquo;  What are they? They are institutionalised and legalised greed and that is one of the things that has helped to put up the price of land, to increase the price of housing and to put it beyond the reach of many ordinary citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not altogether blame the builders in this regard, because in many cases they pay the initially inflated prices demanded and got by the middlemen in a position of scarcity.  The builders make their own profits.  Some of them make too much profit, but it is the middlemen who are creaming off the profit on land and we have been slow to do anything about these people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> The problem is that there is a finite supply of building land.  We live on an island, and sooner or later we are going to run out of the stuff.  Even if we did not live on an island the same would come true.  I cannot remember the name of the American sage who said that he was putting his money into land &ldquo;because they are not making any more of it.&rdquo;  If that was true in the United States with its endless frontiers in the 19th century, it is doubly and savagely true for us in Ireland today.  They are not making any more land.  What there is is getting scarcer and the price is going up.</P>
    <P>There is an irony in this because since the establishment of the State on occasions we have made structural changes in relation to land ownership in rural areas and to the acquisition of land by bodies such as the Land Commission. They have not been revolutionary but they have been significant in creating different patterns of ownership of agricultural and rural land from the patterns that were traditionally there.  We have always fought shy of touching the development land in and around our cities because that is where the big money is, that is where the influence pedlars are and where the middlemen are.  Those are the people who can buy and sell their way through laws and taxes whenever they wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for urgent action especially in the Dublin area where I suspect the problem will get worse before there is any hope of it getting better.  The problem can be met in part by the supply of serviced sites, and it may be true to argue that the provision of such sites has not kept pace with demand or even with the possibility of demand. As Deputy Woods pointed out, in the area of serviced sites inevitably there is a lag between the adoption of a particular policy and the provision of so many thousand sites in any area.  What we should be advocating, as well as the serviced site policy, is an aggressive and creative policy directed towards the control of the price of building land, and I hope to be more specific on this because <Col N="389" /> we owe it to the House and to the public to be specific.</P>
      <P>The way this can be done, possibly without a constitutional amendment, is for each local authority to adopt a zoning policy in relation to all development land that will be required in the near future for housing purposes in their area. Having zoned land, there should then be legislation to control the resale price of that land.  I am talking about the resale price, not the sale price.</P>
      <P>If we adopted legislation such as exists in certain parts of Australia, not renowned for their socialism, which would allow the owner of land zoned by the public housing authority as development housing land to sell his land for whatever he can get for it&mdash;and the best of luck to him&mdash;but which would refuse permission to anybody who bought it from him to sell to anybody else for a price greater than that for which he bought it, grossed up by inflation, legal charges and so on, that would present us with at least the bones of a solution.  <i>Apropos</i> our precious Constitution we would not be interfering with the right of the owner of that land to sell that land for whatever he could get for it.  We would merely be restricting the right of any purchaser of that land to resell under certain circumstances.  He would buy under notice of that restriction so that he could not claim subsequently that his constitutional rights were being infringed because his constitutional rights would be the rights that he had under the Constution and under the laws at the time he bought the land.  Our Constitution says that the right to private property may be delimited from time to time in order that the Constitution should meet the requirements of the common good.  If ever there was a case for delimiting the rights to private property it is in relation to the supply and control of the price of building land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the most basic and serious problems.  We will not solve it on a short-term basis because it will be even more acute in four or five years time. There will be less land; land will be more scarce; land will be more expensive.  The corollary of that is that the people who <Col N="390" /> own that land will be ten times as hungry, ten times as anxious to hang on to that land, make the most they can out of it and therefore will be mobilising an opposition which will be ten times more effective to any fundamental and radical change of the type I am describing in the structure of land ownership and in the transmission of land from one owner to another.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in supporting this motion because it is not until the ideas in this motion and the arguments behind it are accepted by the Government of the day&mdash;hopefully a Labour Government &mdash;that we will have any radical change in the problem confronting us about housing today.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the amendment put forward last evening by the Minister.  With one or two exceptions this debate has been conducted in a very reasoned way.</P>
      <P>This is a vital and national issue.  We must avail of every opportunity afforded us in this House to assist in putting forward proposals which would help to accelerate the growth and development of the housing industry generally because it is in that way we help to rehouse adequately the many people who are in need.</P>
      <P>However it was regrettable that Deputy Keating last evening should use this Labour Party motion to launch a typical barrage of irrelevant bombast about derelict sites, the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings, the rise and fall of shares on foreign markets, the association between social stability and education, and any random thought that came into his head on this matter&mdash;half truths poured out; misleading statements, one after another.  He went to the bottom of the barrel to drag William Shakespeare.  Indeed, in the quotation he gave he might have given Antonio's full account of Shylock.  Perhaps when he has more time to browse through this debate and go over what he said he will appreciate my completing that quotation for him:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keating told the House that the numbers on local authority housing lists had increased by 35 per cent.  He quoted from quite a number of reports&mdash;quite deliberate samples from a number of them&mdash;but I challenge him to produce a report to this House which can prove that the number of qualified applicants waiting on our housing lists have increased in the last year or two by 30 per cent or 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>In support of what I am saying I should point out that Deputy Quinn, in a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment in October this year, sought that information and was told that there were 25,415 people on the waiting lists around the country and that that was roughly the figure for that precise date the preceding year.  I do not want to say that that is not a problem. There are many people in that category who tonight and for this winter will live in dire housing circumstances.  But it is wrong that a Deputy should endeavour to mislead the House in that way because that is not helping any family to get a house.</P>
      <P>According to Deputy Keating, there is a negligible housing bank in the country. This House has been told that there are 78,000 sites, approximately equivalent to the annual out-turn for three years. While we should continue to increase and buy land in our cities, towns and villages and service that land as fast as we can, it must be obvious to anybody that a statement of that kind cannot be sustained and is in no way helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a broader housing front Deputy Keating asserted that the numbers of all housing completions this year will be lower than last year.  Again, he has not done his homework.  In the last complete <Col N="392" /> calendar year of the Coalition's period of office, 1976, 24,000 houses were built; last year, 24,548 and the number this year is likely to exceed 26,000 based on the fact that 22,222 houses were completed up to the end of October, 1978, as compared with 20,359 during the first ten months of 1977.  No political party in this House have said that they would build any more than 25,000 houses per annum.  The reason for that is basically that the building industry is a massive industry here which, as well as providing houses for people went through cycles in the fifties, at other times and again during the Coalition period and put 11,000 workers&mdash; carpenters, bricklayers, every labourer involved in the building of a house&mdash;on to the dole queues.  In building more houses in this country each year we want to safeguard these men and their families as solidly as we did in the sixties by building gradually each year more houses but not having the peak and valley periods that run us into that kind of situation.  The Deputy may talk about 14,000 houses in Dublin but his front bench spokesman would not come into this House and make that same sort of statement because he knows the answer: that for one or two years that can happen but then the numbers of people employed drop dramatically.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the Deputy's assessment of the situation and the typical manner in which he completely disregarded the elimination of rates on houses, the reduction of electricity and other domestic costs, the facts are that in the first nine months of this year all the lending agencies approved almost 21,000 loans and these will require an expenditure of £219 million when they mature on payment.  In the same period in 1977 the number of loans approved was 17,700 with a potential funding of £154 million.  This confirms the success of the Government's policy on the promotion of home ownership.  We have the highest rate of home ownership of any country in western Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> Deputy Keating claimed that our promise to increase SDA loans to realistic levels was not kept.  The present income limit is £3,500 and that is a considerable increase on the limit of £2,350 when the Deputy's party was in power. That limit was unchanged from September 1973 until we came back into office and it takes some audacity to come into the House and make that claim.  Nobody who was a Member of this House during that time spoke on this motion from the Opposition benches because such Members realise that there are aspects of their policy at that time which could not be sustained against the argument put forward on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>We do not claim that we have solved any or all of these problems.  Many problems still remain to be solved and we want suggestions that will help solve them.  While Members on the other side may not remain there for ever, they will be there for very long periods unless they put forward propositions that will help.</P>

      <P>I have read Deputy Quinn's speech and I consider it a reasoned one in most parts.  He claimed that people who benefit from Government policy are not in the lower income group.  Only first-time buyers of new houses qualify for the £1,000 grant and 70 per cent of loans paid were to people who qualified for that grant, while 60 per cent of loans made by all financial institutions were to people whose annual income was under £5,000.  The Government directed that 60 per cent of finance available for loans should be used for houses costing less than £13,000 and a further 20 per cent for houses under £16,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The lower income group are availing of SDA loans and payments which this year will be over £30 million, as against £17 million last year.  There are 12,000 applications for SDA loans with the local authorities, compared to a little over 10,000 when the Coalition left office. This is ample evidence that many people are still availing of these loans and that they are relevant.  That is not to say we should not still consider ways to increase them.</P>
      <P>The argument put from the other side of the House may be summarised as follows: the removal of rates on domestic dwellings has caused all these problems, together with the £1,000 new house grant.  Will a speaker from the Opposition say: &ldquo;When we come back into office we will bring back rates on houses and eliminate the £1,000 grant&rdquo;?  If these are the problems then speakers opposite must tell us how they would remedy them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to the points made.  Due to lack of time I may not be able to cover all of them.  I have not had until tonight the pleasure of hearing Deputy Smith speak in this House and I listened with interest to the points he made.  He made a good speech, the best he could make of a bad case. Instead of attacking me, though I moved this motion, he attacked a colleague in Fine Gael whose name is not on the Order Paper at all.  Deputy Keating represents Dublin North-Central, an area which probably has a more acute housing problem than any other constituency. <Col N="395" /> He spoke as much from his heart as from his head.  He, together with Deputies Michael O'Leary and Vincent Brady, realises the daily deprivation in this area.  They confront the problems of housing despair in that constituency.</P>
      <P>There are three points to our motion, the first of which is the impact of the Government's action in the area of local authority housing.  I agree with the Shakespearean quotation; it is indeed possible to quote Scripture or statistics for one's own purposes and turn them upside down to prove a point.  The final test is the effectiveness on the ground.  In housing circular H37/78 the Minister states that the public capital programme allocation in 1978 is £80.77 million, but more than £100 million could have been required if local authorities had been allowed to go ahead with all the housing schemes they proposed to commence. Deputy Smith knows the reality of local authorities.  Presumably they do not build houses in Tipperary for the fun of it and they do not, therefore, propose to the Department of the Environment housing schemes for which there is not a need.  The Minister has said that he could satisfy only 80 per cent of the formal requests for funds from local authorities.  In terms of the demand for housing, there has been a cutback to the extent that the demands have not been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to Deputy Smith, he said that was not acceptable to him, but regrettably he does not have responsibility for housing.  The responsible Minister said that the Government have never varied their commitment to ensure that a family in genuine need of housing should not be debarred from getting it by reason only of their limited financial resources.  He went on to express satisfaction with the performance of local authorities.  In concluding his remarks on local authority housing the Minister of State said: &ldquo;In short, I can assure the House that the local authority housing programme is at a satisfactory level.&rdquo;  I cannot understand such satisfaction.  Time would allow me to flesh out that argument.  Local authorities who responsibly represent people looking for housing requested <Col N="396" /> £100 million and were told they would get £80 million and the Minister of State says he is satisfied.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> They are not confused by idealism, or ideas, or a commitment to dogma, or anything like that.  They do not question their commitment to private enterprise as being a commitment to dogma.  They consider themselves hard-nosed good managers of the economy.  They made a promise in the document published in May 1977, I think, about funds for the private sector.  They said: &ldquo;There will be a grant of £1,000 if you vote for us. Rates will be abolished instantly if you vote for us.  There will be all sorts of other goodies, and money for the construction industry.&rdquo;  The private commitment to the private industry sector was a lot more, although it is not on any public record.  Many builders at the builders' dinner tonight are celebrating the fact that, in part, that private commitment was honoured by the Government.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Smith, who is a reasonable man, does not want to take my partisan word, would he accept the verdict of two eminent economists in the Economic and Social Research Institute?  They assessed the combined effects of lumping the abolition of rates, lumping the £1,000 grant and lumping all the other goodies on the day Fianna Fáil assumed office.  Their view was that the impact of the measures was such that it led to a bunching of demand for housing as people were not able to meet the deposit requirements, supply was not able to respond quickly enough due to the nature of house building, and hence the price rise occurred.  We are not necessarily arguing about the £1,000 grant.  We are not arguing about the abolition of rates. We are talking about the incompetent way in which the Minister, Deputy Barrett, who unfortunately cannot be with us tonight, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Leary&mdash;and let us identify the absent rogue, the genius who thought up this package of election goodies who cannot be with us either&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Many builders who openly and unashamedly support the Fianna Fáil Party say that the biggest curse in the building industry&mdash;as an architect I am part of that industry&mdash;is its cyclical nature.  The Government have aggravated the difficulties which confront that industry.  They increased the capital allocation for local authority housing. They increased the capital allocation for the private sector and they introduced the £1,000 grant.  In answer to a Parliamentary Question in October or November 1977 the Minister was able to say that, by the time the first £1,000 grant was paid his Department were producing statistics showing that the price of houses had increased by £1,004. Is that competent economic management?  That is what this motion is about.  Fianna Fáil were concerned about house prices.</P>

He decided that something must be done and the building societies were approached.  It is significant that the Minister referred to the agreement made with the building societies on the basis of legislation introduced by the Minister for Local Government which was so quickly denounced.  They also went to the assurance companies.  They went to the insurance companies and asked them to provide some money for the building industry. We have two major insurance companies which are Irish owned. Ninety seven per cent of Irish Life is owned by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley.  What was the response? It was that there would be no money unless it was commercially favourable. There may be an argument for not messing with the State sector.  The Minister also went to the New Ireland Assurance Company, the Chairperson of which happens to be the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in the other House.</P>

      <P>There is a temptation on both sides of the House to play politics with housing.  In the debate on this motion we have tried to shy away from that and point to certain areas of incompetence and mismanagement.  Unfortunately I cannot refer to the latter part of the Minister of State's speech on land prices.  The Government have not dealt with our arguments in a satisfactory manner and therefore we are rejecting the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On two occasions within the past six months I have raised by way of parliamentary question the matter of the Irish Centre in Camden Square, London, but on neither occasion was I given a satisfactory reply.  Consequently I am forced to raise the question on the adjournment this evening.</P>
      <P>My question of Thursday last to the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked the financial aid, if any, which the Government intend making available to the Irish Centre at Camden Square, London. That question was tabled also in the name of Deputy Donnellan but unfortunately it was merged with another question which concerned the rate of immigration to this country.  Consequently, the relevance of our question seemed to have been lost.  Therefore, I wish to have the matter clarified this evening.</P>
      <P>Emigrants from here to Great Britain are regarded in Britain as the forgotten community.  Emigration has been a safety valve for this country for many years.  It has solved many of our unemployment and social problems but as a race we have not made any effort to improve the lot of those people who had to emigrate to Britain.  This is something of which we should all be thoroughly ashamed.  Successive Governments must share the blame.  The problem has been in existence for many years but no attempt has been made to resolve it.  Now, when there is considerably more affluence in the country than was the case in the past, there is all the more reason for making some attempt to help our emigrants in Britain.</P>
      <P>As a result of the mass emigration of the past 50 years we have gained considerably in terms of moneys that otherwise would have had to be paid by way of unemployment and social welfare benefits.  In addition we gained by way of moneys sent home to relatives by emigrants.  Although the rate of emigration slowed down during the past ten years, there are indications that it is increasing considerably again and that situation makes all the more necessary the making available of aid for our emigrants.  These people, too, spend a considerable amount of money when they come home to spend holidays with their families and most of them come home at least once a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other countries with emigrant populations in Britain help their people considerably. <Col N="403" /> For instance, in recent years the Spanish Government bought a large building complex at Notting Hill Gate where not only recreational and sporting facilities are available but where also there are schools for Spanish emigrants. The Italian Government employ 20 full-time social workers in London but the number of social workers that can be employed in the Irish Centre in Camden Square is restricted because of the absence of any aid from our Government with the result that the centre must rely on its own resources which are primarily receipts from the bar and from social occasions.  They are hard pressed to employ two social workers.  Other Governments who provide aid for their emigrants in Britain are the Polish and German Governments and, I understand, five or six others, primarily from Europe and Africa.  They have programmes such as the one I have outlined for helping their emigrants.  Is it not ironic that the only material benefit that the Irish Centre in Camden Square has ever received has been from British Rail who devised a scheme whereby the centre would benefit to the extent of 8p for every additional passenger using British Rail in journeys between Ireland and Great Britain.  Luckily in one sense, but regrettably in another sense, there has been an increase in passenger numbers between Britain and Ireland.  Unfortunately, the increase is primarily on the Ireland to Britain route.  This year it is hoped to raise £20,000 by way of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Last week Camden Borough Council voted £14,000 by way of grant towards the upkeep of the Irish Centre and they intend doing the same next year. However, it is estimated that for the centre to function as it should function, the cost would be between £220,000 and £240,000 per annum.  This is where the Irish Government can help.  Last week, too, in the House of Commons 28 MPs signed a declaration expressing anxiety at the lack of concern being shown by the Irish Government for the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain.  These MPs believe it is about time we came to the aid of these people.</P>
    <P>There is accommodation in this Irish <Col N="404" /> Centre for 140 boys and girls.  During the 25 years of its existence, the centre has catered for 55,000 emigrants by way of accommodation and the centre help also in finding employment for emigrants.  In all, they have helped about 70,000 people to find jobs.  At the moment an additional hostel under the guidance of this Irish Centre is being built at Westminster and it is planned to accommodate there 130 girls.  The cost of the hostel, which is expected to be ready for occupation shortly, is £785,000.  So far as I can ascertain, all of that money is being provided by the British Government.  I am told by the director and by the social workers in the Irish Centre that at present they can accommodate only two out of every seven girls who seek accommodation at the centre.  The magnitude of the problem is quite easily seen from that.  The Irish Centre are asking the Government at present for a major financial subvention to help them renovate and extend their existing centre in Camden Square.  They estimate that this work will cost £1,150,000.  Already they have raised £110,000 by their own fund-raising efforts and they are looking to this Government to help them get the remainder.  I ask here tonight that we do something concrete at last.  Even now it would be very welcome.  I will quote from a letter dated 23/10/1978 which I received from the Director of the Irish Centre in Camden Square, Fr. W.J. Cagney, OMI.  He refers to the question I raised here last June:</P>
    <P>Your question in the Dáil was very relevant and the answer received does not really cover the matter.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the Minister referred to social welfare benefits, whereas that was not the point I was trying to get at.  I was asking about direct financial aid for the centre.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>My two Social workers were not enthused about the answer and I am enclosing their comments.</P>
    <P>Please try again to get the Government to come to our aid.  We are really in a critical period.  The numbers seeking aid and the depth of the human problems presented are increasing <Col N="405" /> both quantitatively and qualitatively.</P>
    <P>At present we are burdened with a building really unfit for us and completely inadequate for the work.  The Government has a recommendation from me since August of 1977 and I am still awaiting an answer.  It is a request for financial aid.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is aware of the problem and that he, together with many other members of the Government, would like to help. They may be inhibited by the thought of a possible flood of applications from other Irish centres in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That fear may be unfounded. Even if there is a request from the other centres, may be and more than likely their claims can be justified.  I ask the Minister to make a start and use his influence to get the Government to look after the interests of our emigrants, which we have ignored for far too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of replying to Deputy Deasy's question in greater detail than was available to me at Question Time when this matter was raised.  The manner in which he has presented it this evening is a fair and objective approach to the question.  In his introduction he outlined the various provisions that were being made by some other Governments.  He talked about the need for provision for our people in England.  Generally one has to accept that his concern is well motivated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, this matter has been under consideration for some time. He will be aware from his communications with Fr. Cagney from the Irish Centre that Fr. Cagney has been in fairly constant communication with representatives of both this Government and the British Government.  I do not want to enter into any political issue on this, but the Deputy will also be aware, as I am sure Fr. Cagney is, that this matter was considered by our predecessors and for one reason or another&mdash;<Col N="406" /> let me leave it at that&mdash;they did not or could not meet the request at that time. The matter then came before us and we have been in direct contact with Fr. Cagney and also have been considering this matter for some time.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, we appreciate fully what is being done in the Irish Centre, and what is now being proposed to do, and we are aware of the need to meet the cases that they attend to.  At the same time, lest there may be any misunderstanding, while we are dealing with serious problems here, we are dealing, nonetheless, with a minority of the Irish community.  I say this lest people would have the impression from these discussions that the whole Irish community in London or elsewhere are in constant need of social welfare assistance, social advice or accommodation.  Secondly, as the Deputy has suggested, this centre, while obviously the biggest in Britain, is not the only one.  The Deputy will be aware that there are other centres&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in Birmingham, in Hammersmith and also in Liverpool.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the Government approach to this must be on the basis of how we can discharge our responsibilities as we see them to all of these areas, if not these centres in the strict sense of the word. The fact that the Irish Centre in Camden Square are now undertaking this major development obviously makes them a matter for special consideration.  The Government are considering not just the Irish Centre in London but the whole question of how we could effectively make a contribution towards the services being provided.  It is not as easy as it might seem in the first instance to transfer money directly to another source.  The Government must have regard to their obligations in terms of the structure to which things are done and to the precedents that would be created. When we talk in terms of Irish communities we cannot confine ourselves to Irish communities in Britain.  There are other areas where Irish communities might make certain demands on the Government.  Therefore, it has to be considered in the overall context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> An inter-Departmental committee are and have been for some time looking at the whole question and they have been in contact also with the Emigrant Advisory Committee.  I hope that when we get the outcome of their deliberations I will then be able to consider what scheme, if any, I can propose to the Government.  I do not want to convey a false impression.  I am not in a position at this stage to make any commitment in respect of the Irish Centre at Camden Square.  The matter is part of the overall situation being considered by the Government.  I can only assure the Deputy that this is a matter that I will, I hope, be able to look into in further <Col N="408" /> detail when I get the outcome of these deliberations.</P>

I cannot say at this stage when I will be in a position to approve Drinagh sewerage scheme, preliminary proposals for which are under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>The age limit for pensionable offices under a local authority in relation to which I am the appropriate Minister is 65, except where the office holder would not be entitled to a pension were he to retire at 65, in which event the age limit is the age at which he becomes so entitled. Local authorities may, however, retain, in a temporary capacity, officers who ceased to hold office in a pensionable capacity on reaching the age limit, provided steps are taken to fill the vacancy concerned in a permanent capacity not later than one month after the vacancy has occurred.  Information regarding the number of local authority officers who are on retention on the foregoing basis at any given time is not available in my Department.  The retention in a temporary capacity of officers in circumstances other than pending the permanent filling of a vacancy requires my specific approval and has only occurred in very few exceptional cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No statutory age limits apply in the <Col N="303" /> case of local authority employees other than officers and the imposition of age limits, if any, in the case of such employees is a matter for individual local authorities.  Information regarding the number of such employees who are over sixty five is not available in my Department.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to erect new Garda stations at Blackrock, Mayfield and Gurranabraher. The stations at Mayfield and Gurranabraher will replace the existing stations at St. Luke's and Shandon.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Office of Public Works, who are arranging for the acquisition of sites for the new stations, that terms for the purchase of sites at the three centres have been agreed but that the legal formalities relating to the acquisition have not yet been completed. Accordingly, I am not in a position at this stage to indicate when tenders are likely to be invited or when construction works are likely to commence.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed to erect a new station at Douglas to replace the existing one and a suitable site is currently being sought by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the reorganisation of Cork Division, which may involve the erection of additional Garda stations, are being considered, but it will be some time before final decisions are reached in the matter.</P>
