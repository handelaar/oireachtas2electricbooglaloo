    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Another change is that there is a tighter definition in relation to de-control of carriage for reward of newly harvested wheat, oats and barely.  This was brought in at the request of the hauliers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This section introduces a new fine of £250 for illegal haulage, with £500 for second or subsequent offences, and it repeals by omission a fine of £50 and a further daily fine of £5 as provided for in section 9 of the Road Transport Act 1933 which had been rendered ineffective by the continuing fall in money values. The new 9 (2) also repeals by 9 (2) (c) section 28 of the Transport Act 1958 which provides for doubling of fines to a maximum of £320.  The original section provided for forfeiture of the vehicle.  That provision was dropped <Col N="920" /> because of the present high cost of vehicles and the forfeiture of vehicles might have the effect that cases would be simply dismissed because to proceed with the forfeiture would be out of proportion to the offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more involved than that.  In the original Act the fines could be doubled up to a maximum of £320.  In this case the first fine is £250 and the next is £500 for a second or subsequent offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am still right, the maximum fine under the old Act was £320 and, under this Act, it is £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the position is that the £320 was the maximum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): And £500 is the maximum under this Act.  Just to get the record straight and to let us see what we are doing, as far back as 1958 the maximum fine for an offence under the Road Transport Act was £320. Now in 1978, 20 years later, the maximum fine is £500.  Again, so that we may know what we are doing, I say <Col N="921" /> that that is a reduction in real terms. If one compares the value of money in 1958 with that today I would be prepared to have a bet that the fines are being reduced rather than increased. If that is what the Minister intends doing that is all right but we should be clear about it and appreciate what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the question of court jurisdiction enters into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of court jurisdiction, the level of fines permissible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): But there is a way round that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would assume that under the 1958 Act the actual fines would probably be very much lower than the £320.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Indeed they were not.  I have a clear recollection of the doubling-up system of fining which led then to what were regarded as extremely severe fines in the then money values.  One could have been fined very large sums.  Two hundred and fifty pounds in 1958 was a sizeable amount of money and so was £320. Fines of that nature were imposed on people who continued to break the law and ignore the prohibition against carrying on a merchandise business without a licence.  They were fined very substantial sums in the then money value, which had the effect of putting illegal carriers out of business.  I put it to the Minister that, under this Bill, the maximum fine is £500 whereas, under the 1958 one, the maximum fine was £320.  In a period of 20 years that is an increase of only £180.  There is no point in trying to draw a distinction, the maximum is the maximum, and the maximum in 1958 was £320 and now is £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said&mdash;in reply to a question by me&mdash;that the jurisdiction of the court had to be taken into <Col N="922" /> account.  I appreciate that, generally speaking, the ruling of the Supreme Court would seem to mean that an offence which is punishable by a fine of more than £500 is no longer regarded by the Supreme Court as a minor offence fit to be tried summarily in the District Court.  The Minister knows as well as I that in regard to practically every Bill that goes through this House that is got over by providing that in regard to a conviction on indictment the fine may be far above £500, up to £1,000, or that there may be imprisonment.  That means that in the case of a very serious offence&mdash;for somebody who simply thumbed his nose at the authorities, at the law and insisted on carrying on an illegal road transport business&mdash;the offender would not be tried in the District Court but would be in the Circuit Court and a suitable fine could be imposed on him. I venture to suggest that a maximum of £500&mdash; when one gets into the big business of road transport&mdash;is not really prohibitive or a serious deterrent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is reasonable in the circumstances.  If we take other factors of this Bill into consideration I feel we will have very much less illegal haulage than heretofore.  It can always be reviewed if we find that the fines are not sufficiently high but, for the present, I feel that they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Having regard to the fact that transport is being liberalised under the Bill and that trucks up to 2½ tons are being freed it is easier for a person to get a licence to carry on his business in a legal manner, it is all the more serious for a person to ignore the law and embark on an illegal business, he should be punished and the penalty should be such as to discourage him to the extent of putting him out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied there will be very much less illegal haulage. I would imagine it will almost phase itself out because of the more liberal provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there will be very much less illegal haulage under this Bill.  But somebody who <Col N="923" /> will be hauling illegally after this Bill is passed will be flouting the law deliberately and will have to make a considerable investment in the purchase of a lorry.  If one accepts Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument that the money value of the fine is less now, if one puts into the scales also the fact that under the 1958 Act there was forfeiture of the vehicle in question as well, not alone will the fine not be a deterrent but in fact the amount of money involved will be considerably less for somebody who engaged in illegal haulage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the fine is suitable.  We can always review it later.  I should refer to the fact that the hauliers themselves&mdash;who were the people insisting on the strengthening of the fines&mdash;did not object to the proposals in this Bill. Therefore, I take it that they are satisfied with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There was provision for it in the 1958 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, but I would assume that the judge would make that decision, and I could not imagine him making it too often.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the argument put forward by Deputies Fitzpatrick and Barry is valid.  The fine should have been increased substantially. There is no point in saying there will be less illegal haulage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, there will be less illegal haulage; that is certain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If a haulier flouts the law in the new circumstances he deserves to be fined more than £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Minister could not ever condone the breaking of the law.  It was understandable up to now when the law was broken, because there was a very restrictive licensing system.  But the fact that someone will now break the law will mean that the action is deliberate.  It will not be done to make a living because there will be more lorries and the restriction on the 2½ ton lorries will be gone and so anyone who sets out to break the law will be doing so deliberately.  It will not be because of lack of transport or to convenience a friend down the road or anything like that.  People will go out and purchase lorries over 2½ tons and break the law, and they should be discouraged and fined.  It should be obvious from the very beginning that anyone who engages in that kind of exercise will get no sympathy at all from the Government, the Department, the courts or the public.  We must build up an orderly transport business with the object of reducing the cost of transport, which is far too high in relation to the cost of carrying units of goods in other countries, and so we must ensure that the illegal operator is frightened by making it prohibitive for him to engage in illegal haulage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Under the previous legislation an offender could be fined £320 and have his vehicle forfeited.  These were very heavy penalties.  In this Bill the maximum fine is increased to £500 and forfeiture is done away with.  This will be a temptation to the illegal haulier operating heavy load carrying vehicles.  It is an indication that this House does not take a serious view of illegal haulage.  It cannot be taken as anything else.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that. I could not imagine anyone paying an enormous price for a vehicle for the simple purpose of illegal haulage.  Most illegal haulage is done with vehicles which very often should not be on the <Col N="925" /> road at all.  A fine of £500 for the second or subsequent offence will be a sufficient deterrent, and I doubt very much that any individual would pay £20,000 or £30,000 for a vehicle for the purpose of illegal haulage.</P>

      <P>The Minister said last week that this is a well-thought out Bill and that it took a considerable time to put it into perspective.  The only difference between this Bill and the 1976 Bill is in the matter of fines. It is not a huge difference.  Forfeiture is gone.  Am I right that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;newly harvested&rdquo; in subsection (4) (c) is the only difference between section 3 of the 1976 Bill and this Bill?</P>

      <P>The basic change comes later.  We had a long argument here about the value of the fine in present day circumstances.  The 1976 Bill provided the same fines that had been there in the 1958 Bill and this provision, to say the least, is an increase on what was proposed by the previous Government in the 1976 Bill. I am rather surprised that two Deputies who had a hand in the 1976 Bill should now be arguing so strenuously about the level of the fine when they were providing for a much lower fine, and that in circumstances where inflation is going down.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I want to go on record as saying the penalties in the 1976 Bill were much more severe and prohibitive. They acted as a deterrent because the courts were entitled to order the forfeiture of the vehicle.  That is a well-known penalty.  It appears in Customs and Excise Acts and other Acts.  It is a real deterrent.  It may not have been used but it was there and it could have been used.  The Minister could still write in a subsection providing for prosecution on indictment in the Circuit Court and he could make the penalties as big as he likes and he will not get away with it by saying he has increased the penalties, because he has not increased them.  In 1976 a reasoned amendment to the Bill was introduced but the Minister then did provide for forfeiture, and that is the important point.</P>

      <P>Under the 1976 Bill it was proposed that anybody who had a licence could operate an unlimited number of vehicles on that licence but under the 1978 Bill it is proposed that anybody with an existing merchandise licence can operate six vehicles.  I can see why there would be two different points of view on this matter.  One is that it is urgent that we liberalise road transport here as quickly as possible and try to reduce the crazy dependance we have on own transport carrying.  I understand that up to 80 per cent of goods here are carried most unprofitably by own transport and it is essential that we get to a situation where we have a strong professional body of licensed hauliers who will undertake the carriage of goods.  My view was that the quicker we got to the situation where anybody who had the qualifications to get into road transport would be able to do so as easily as possible, the better it would be I also held the view that it was wrong that a licence dating back to 1933 should assume a commercial value.  A licence should be an acceptance by the authority that the person holding it was a competent person to operate in the road haulage field.  Instead, they were left in wills, were hidden under mattresses and passed on from uncles to nephews.  The latest I heard is that they are changing hands for figures in the region of £7,000 and £8,000.  A fee of £10 or <Col N="928" /> £20 should be charged by the Department to cover the expenses of that Department in assessing the suitability and qualifications of the applicant for such a licence.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that merely because a person has £7,000 or £8,000 to purchase a licence, which for historical reasons the Department have no option but to transfer to the new owner, that such a person can get into the haulage business without any qualifications.  The reasoned amendment put down by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition was to the effect that the Bill did not contain any provisions to control the standards of road transport and heavy road vehicles.  That was true at the time but I do not think this Bill contains anything either.  When I introduced the Bill I intended getting professional and competent people into the road transport business.  I wanted to make it easy for people who had the necessary qualifications to get into the business. The Minister takes a different view. He feels this should be a more gradual process than I envisaged.  He provides that a licence which at present entitles one to operate one vehicle will in future entitle the holder to operate six vehicles.  That is a small step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand how the Minister arrived at the figure six.  Why not five or ten?  Was the figure six plucked out of the air or was it chosen after consultation with the association which represents licensed hauliers?  At the time I was preparing the previous Bill I was confused by the attitude of the licensed hauliers.  The executive committee of that association issued a statement to the effect that they welcomed the Bill but the members of that executive made efforts to communicate to me that they did not approve of it because of the objections listed in the Fianna Fáil amendment.  Fianna Fáil felt so strongly about that Bill that they would not give it a Second Reading. I have been a Member of this House for nine years and to the best of my recollection I only saw a reasoned amendment on an Order Paper on two occasions.  One of those reasoned amendments was put down by Fianna Fáil in connection with my Bill.  The <Col N="929" /> party who put that amendment down must have felt that the future of the country was at stake and that this was such a serious matter that they had to refuse a Second Reading to the Bill, something that was almost unheard of.  However, they have introduced, almost word for word the same Bill as I introduced.</P>
    <P>They made a few small amendments to give the impression that they were catering for the views of those who prompted them to put down their amendment to the last Bill.  The changes made are not of any substance. They could have been dealt with on Committee Stage of the other Bill.  Had I been Minister I would have listened to them if they had put forward a good argument for not having an unlimited number of lorries on one licence.  Why not limit that number to two, double the present figure?  If that was done the number of fleets would be doubled.  Multiplying the number by six will probably mean that we will have four times as many lorries on our roads.  I do not think it will mean we will have six times as many lorries because not everybody will be capable of making such a huge investment.  When I introduced my Bill Fianna Fáil felt that its provisions would cause further heavy congestion on an inadequate road system and would put the continuation of the railways in jeopardy.  If the Minister believed that does he not think that this section will put the railways in jeopardy also?  The same thing will happen now as a result of this section that Fianna Fáil expected to happen under my Bill.  I find myself not arguing against my own Bill but incensed that Fianna Fáil in Opposition were so hypocritical in their attitude to this matter.  They put down a reasoned amendment and, without a blush, when in Government introduced exactly the same Bill.  The changes they made could have been moved during Committee Stage debate on my Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the basic changes in the Bill relates to this point.  It refers to the matter which was contained in the reasoned amendment put down by Fianna Fáil in Opposition.  I agree that the basic aim <Col N="930" /> is to provide a professional and competent service but my party and I were convinced that the best way of easing out the present restrictions was not to give unlimited numbers on extant licences.  I could not accept that the way to deal with this matter was to substitute an unlimited number for the number I propose.  I gave considerable thought to the manner of change and having examined the situation in a number of countries I decided that six was the best number.</P>
      <P>I did of course consult with the hauliers, but, naturally, the Deputy will understand I could not discuss precise details with them because of the difficulties that would involve.  I decided on the number of six because in general terms it appeared to be the number&mdash;say from six to ten&mdash;which would provide the best and most efficient and possibly the most profitable type of business and the one most likely to afford us a professional and competent type of road haulage business and would not at the same time do the damage which we believed that the sudden introduction of an unlimited type of situation, as was proposed by the Coalition, would have done.  I believe this constitutes a considerable change in what was proposed by the Coalition and that the easing in of a new, liberalised system will be to the advantage of road haulage generally and will not do damage in any other area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I shall be relevant.  This is the section that provides for increasing the number of lorries under licence from one to six and the number of licences that any one person can hold up to 80.  I respectfully suggest that I am entitled to deal with those points and deal with what we were providing and what is being provided now.  For some years there was a demand for the liberalisation of road transport.  My colleague, Deputy Barry, when Minister for Transport and Power, introduced the 1976 Bill which freed trucks up to two and a half tons and liberalised transport up along the line.  That Bill when introduced was met by a reasoned amendment, a procedure that is very rare indeed, as Deputy Barry says.  It is a device used by those opposing a Bill when they are totally and absolutely opposed to it and to the principle enshrined in it and when they are not prepared to entertain it at Second Stage or let it go through the House to any extent.</P>
      <P>The reasoned amendment then put down by Fianna Fáil was to delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that the provisions of the Bill will cause heavy unemployment in rail freight and road freight sections of CIE and among the employees of licensed hauliers at a time of existing high unemployment.&rdquo;  That was the view of Fianna Fáil in Opposition. What change has come about subsequent to the general election?  Has the unemployment situation changed or improved so dramatically that this objection of Fianna Fáil is no longer valid?  They said then that the proposal to increase the number of licences would cause wholesale unemployment in CIE and among licensed freight hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> The Minister says that he is not doing this on as large a scale as Deputy Barry proposed, but he has just told me that there are about 700 licensed hauliers in the country and each of them may, if he wishes, have 80 trucks, and if you multiply the number of licensed hauliers&mdash;if the Minister does not agree with that he may correct me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point is that there are 750 licences in the country but there would be considerably fewer licensed hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I asked the Minister the number of licensed hauliers and he said 750.  As I understand the Bill, it proposes to enable each of those hauliers if he wishes to increase his total number of lorries to 80.  If they do that there will be as many trucks on the road as there would have been under Deputy Barry's complete freeing provision.  Fianna Fáil went on to say that the Bill contained no provision to control the standard of road transport and heavy road vehicles.  Does this Bill provide for the control of the standard of road transport and heavy road vehicles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They went on to say that the provisions of the Bill would cause further heavy congestion on an inadequate road system and put the continuation of railways in jeopardy.  What has changed since the general election? Have roads suddenly become perfect and have railways become so competitive that they do not fear any competition from private enterprise or road transport?  Fianna Fáil went on to say that the Bill would enable a haulier from outside the jurisdiction, by acquiring one merchandise licence, to operate an unlimited number of vehicles in the State.  What is to prevent an outside operator coming here and buying a few licences to enable him to put a big number of lorries on the roads and go into competition? That was Fianna Fáil then pretending to be speaking seriously and to be putting forward a valid objection to this Bill, but in fact they were indulging <Col N="933" /> in political play-acting and were not really serious.</P>
    <P>If we were to take Fianna Fáil as serious with their reasoned amendment they would not have anything to do with Deputy Barry's Bill; it was not acceptable; it would create unemployment. It would destroy the roads, it would bring foreigners here wholesale to take over the business of road transport, it would flood the roads with unsuitable lorries and encourage low standards.  That was the attitude when Deputy Barry's Bill was introduced.  We would expect great things if we took them seriously.  We would be expecting a complete re-think and a complete new approach, and the manifesto issued before the last general election would have encouraged us to expect a re-think, a fresh approach and a brand new Bill.  There is a short paragraph on page 35 of the manifesto which says:</P>
    <P> Fianna Fáil will establish a <i>Transport Authority</i> to investigate and report on the measures necessary to achieve the most efficient and economic transport system for goods and passengers having regard to the need to maintain a flexible competitive transport system&mdash;thereby ensuring the facilities necessary for industrial development through the country as a whole. </P>
    <P>If we took that seriously we would have expected the Minister to establish some sort of high-pressure committee or commission to review the whole thing or we would have expected the think-tank to work overtime and produce something completely new, but what do we find?  We find the Minister going into his Department, taking out Deputy Barry's Bill and making a few changes in it which could be made on Committee Stage in this House when it is going through.  At the time I understand Deputy Barry had already decided to make some of the changes that are in the Bill on Committee Stage. We find the Minister for Tourism and Transport&mdash;who was a member of a party who were shocked by Deputy Barry's Bill, would not have anything to do with it, felt so strongly that they had to put down an amendment, wrote the special paragraph into their election <Col N="934" /> manifesto, told all and sundry they were going to have a great new approach and a great re-think about transport&mdash;going to the section of his Department concerned and bringing in what is the same Bill for all practical purposes.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I have made the points I intended to make and I am now coming to the section of this Bill which proposes to enable the Minister for Tourism and Transport to grant a licence enabling a haulier to operate six lorries where he could hitherto have operated only one.  Admittedly, Deputy Barry's Bill would have enabled that man to operate far more, but why could that amendment not have been put down on Committee Stage of the previous Bill?  Admittedly, the proposal here restricts the overall number of vehicles for any individual to eight, when there was no restriction in Deputy Barry's Bill, but why could that amendment not have been put down on Committee Stage of the previous Bill?  Of course it could have been put down and, as I said earlier, the fines are the figures increased but not the value, and that is the effect. There is no alteration at all in this Bill that could not have been dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few Bills go through this House without amendments, many of them brought in by the Minister in charge of the Bill following Second Stage to meet points made by the Opposition, others put down by members of the Opposition and accepted by the Minister. Many Bills are amended and improved.  Why could those amendments and that improvement not have been-effected on Committee Stage of <Col N="935" /> the 1976 Bill instead of going through the make-believe and fraud of pretending that the 1976 Bill was so outrageous that nothing could be done with it in this House and that the principle behind it is wrong?  The Second Stage debate is only to establish the principle in a Bill.  Fianna Fáil were so outraged&mdash;if you could believe them&mdash;by the 1976 Bill and so much against it that even the very principle of it was wrong.  Even the very principle was so damaging to CIE and to the roads, so facilitating to foreigners who would come in here and gobble up all the business and so encouraging to people to put inferior vehicles on the road and indulge in low standards, that they could not accept the Bill or give it any hearing or consideration in this House.  That is the fraud I want to expose here.  Political fraud it was and political play-acting and we now see through Fianna Fáil and their true thinking.  We now see that when they got away from the desire to get back into power and when they had an opportunity to consider Deputy Barry's Bill they found that there was not much wrong with it.  Certainly there was nothing wrong with it that could not have been amended on Committee Stage and there was no necessity for the recent amendment that they put down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): How many can they increase them to now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>They can increase them to six.  The Deputy's whole argument, as will appear in the Official Report, was based on the case he was making that every licensed haulier is entitled if he so wishes to have 80 vehicles, and he multiplied that 750 × 80 and said there would not be room on the roads for the number of vehicles that could be made available. The Deputy has made his case on something which is not a fact.  As I said, that clearly showed he was more intent on trying to bash this Government than to put a reasoned case on this matter.  The fact is that each licensed haulier who has one vehicle on his licence will, if this Bill is passed in its present form, be entitled <Col N="937" /> to six vehicles, not 80 vehicles.  His whole case was similar to the arguments he was putting forward when talking about fraud on the part of this Government.</P>
      <P>This Bill was promised by the Coalition for so long and did not see the light of day for so long that the people believed it was not going to appear at all.  Eventually it did appear and was circulated, but it never came before the House.  Even if a reasoned amendment had been put down by Fianna Fáil, the Government of the day had a sufficient majority to override it.  For some strange reason it never had a Second Reading.  I am convinced that if there had not been a change of Government this Bill would never have been discussed here. I cannot understand the reason for that unless the Coalition feared that in some way it would affect their political position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also stated that some of the new items in the Bill would have been brought in on Committee Stage as amendments by the then Minister, Deputy Barry.  If these amendments were of such importance as I believe they are, why were they not included in the original substantive Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  The Deputy, as Minister, would have had to concern himself with opposition to these particular areas&mdash;I am not talking about the Dáil Opposition.  I had to concern myself with both oppositions but I took a decision and included them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the amendment.  There is clearly a very big difference between the right of an individual to have six vehicles on his licence as compared with an unlimited number of vehicles.  It was no wonder that the licensed hauliers themselves or that CIE workers were worried about that.  While we accepted that it was necessary to have liberalisation, we believed the proper type of liberalisation was a phasing in as I have done now.  I am convinced that the manner in which I have done it and <Col N="938" /> the number of vehicles which I have permitted on each licence overcomes a number of the problems referred to in the reasoned amendment&mdash;the one about CIE and the possibility of a haulier outside the jurisdiction buying a licence and being able to have almost a monopoly of the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>What about quality control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We have overcome that.  If a licensed haulier buys a licence with one vehicle on it, he can only have six vehicles.  That was regarded as a real danger.  Whether it was or not, or whether it would ultimately have become a fact, one cannot be certain but the danger was there and licensed hauliers and CIE were perturbed about it.  Therefore I decided that rather than have an unlimited number on the licence, there would be six vehicles on a licence which had one vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part refers to the lack of provision for controlling the standards of road transport and heavy road vehicles.  Deputies are aware that since the 1976 Bill was introduced the EEC have adopted proposals for compulsory vehicle-testing applicable in general to public service vehicles and to large commercial vehicles and that this will be phased in over a number of years. That to quite an extent overcomes this problem.  Deputy Barry said he did not think it was proper that a person, simply because he had sufficient money, could buy a licence irrespective of whether he was a suitable or competent person.  The Deputy will be aware that the EEC directive which came into force on 1 January 1978 required new entrants to the haulage business to be professionally competent, of good repute and to have adequate financial resources.  I am sure he is also aware that I appointed the Chartered Institute of Transport to operate courses and to hold examinations in professional competence.  If a merchandise licence is now to be transferred from the present owner to somebody else, that person must have a certain degree of competence, and comply with the regulations as laid down in the 1978 EEC directive.  That <Col N="939" /> also helps to cover the situation referred to.</P>
    <P>With regard to the road system, the number of vehicles likely to become available under the proposals as put forward by me are not going to have anything like the effect that an unlimited situation would have, but apart from that the present Minister for the Environment who is responsible for roads this year has made considerably more money available for the development and upkeep of the roads than was provided previously. In every instance in relation to the reasoned amendment, I have now shown that I have met and overcome to a considerable extent the problems identified with the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>As I said, there was nothing to prevent the previous Government bringing in their Bill and defeating any opposition to it with their majority in this House, but they did not do that. I cannot understand a Government which promised for years to bring in a Bill but did not do it and which finally, after a very long period, had the Bill circulated but then did not discuss it.  It is obvious to me that had they remained in office this Bill would never have been discussed in this House.</P>
    <P>What I have stated now has clearly shown that the manner in which I approached this was such as to confront the problems we saw and to overcome them to the greatest extent possible. I doubt very much if we would ever have seen this Bill discussed here if the Coalition were still in power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Bill was introduced by me in the spring of 1976. If the Minister remembers the circumstances of the time he will know that the Order Paper was full of proposed legislation, unlike now when it has to be dragged out of the Taoiseach.  Before Christmas he was asked what legislation was pending and off the top of his head he took the Road Transport Bill and then sent the Minister scurrying away to get something on the floor of the House so that there would be a discussion after Christmas.</P>
      <P>As I said, the previous Bill was introduced in the Spring of 1976.  At that time all the quality controls the Minister is talking about were being discussed and had been agreed in principle.  One point&mdash;I think it was the tachographs, or some part of the social legislation of the quality control of road haulage&mdash; was holding up the final implementation of this by the EEC.  If Fianna Fáil were so concerned about the quality control of vehicles, they should have known that this was being discussed in the EEC and would become law as soon as the point dealing with the tachographs was cleared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will remember that when the previous Bill was introduced there was a change in the composition of the previous Government&mdash;in the autumn of 1976.  I left Transport and Power and became Minister for Education. A new Minister was appointed Minister for Transport and Power. Fianna Fáil should not try to make any great mystery about this.  That is the reason the Bill was not brought before the House, and a tremendous amount of legislation was available for discussion, unlike now when the Fianna Fáil Government are dragging and pulling little bits out to try and keep this House going from week to week.  There has never been a Government who promised so much before they came into office which they said would be done immediately.  They said they would introduce legislation immediately and now, 12 months later, only two Bills have been passed by this House which were not initiated by the previous Government.  One of them, strangely enough, was to increase the numbers of Parliamentary Secretaries <Col N="941" /> attached to the Government and their salaries.  That is the only original legislation passed during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the restriction is not on the number of permitted vehicles on a licence.  It is a restriction but for the small haulier the greatest restriction would be in finding the necessary capital.  The Minister says that the vast majority of the 750 licensed hauliers have only one lorry and each of them would need about £150,000 to extend his fleet from one lorry to six.  That is the real restriction, not the number of vehicles permitted under his licence.  In arriving at the figure six the Minister says that he looked at other countries in Europe. I should be glad of the Minister's assistance on this because I think there are no other countries in Europe which employ the same licensing system as ours.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me the countries which are involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to a licensing system; I was referring to the fact that people who had six to ten vehicles seemed to have the most effective business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, it does not matter whether it is restricted to six or is unlimited because it will work out at between six and ten vehicles anyway.  It might as well be unlimited. I am not arguing with the restriction because the Minister is taking two or more steps to do what I intended to do in one step.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, there is almost dishonesty in the whole exercise.  It reminds me of <Col N="942" /> another matter in the Minister's Department which is even more dishonest, that is, the matter of a helicopter for the unfortunate people in the west who had to make a huge investment and whose faces were spat in when the Government changed.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to anybody that there is no difference between the two Bills. Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the amendments to section 6 which I had intended to introduce.  It is silly for the Minister to ask why I did not write this into the Bill.  The Bill is not available for study until it is published.  The Minister receives representations when it is known that he is considering legislation.  He accepts some points and disregards others.  When the Bill is published many people become interested and come to the Minister through the Department making points that appear valid.  If the Minister is reasonable&mdash;as, of course, I was&mdash;he will be quite willing to accept those points and introduce amendments on Committee Stage.  This is the normal way of doing business in this House, as the Minister should know a lot better than I do.  That is how most amendments come here.  The Minister may bring in amendments himself or he may accept amendments from the Opposition or from his own backbenchers at party meetings.  Very few Bills remain unchanged while passing through the Oireachtas system and come out as law.  With any reasonable Minister there would certainly be amendments which he would accept having listened to reasonable arguments and he himself would introduce amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The amendments which I had in mind are the ones which are now written into section 6.  For the various changes in the exempted areas I had in mind 15, 15 and three tens.  The Minister has now extended this to 20, 20 and three fifteens.  That is quite reasonable and I would have done it myself on Committee Stage of the 1976 Bill.  We are now establishing that the only changes in this legislation are the present section, which would have been changed on Committee Stage, and section 9, which is consequent on section 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister seems to make a great point of the fact that Deputy Barry proposed to create a provision by which any number of vehicles could have been licensed, while he is restricting the number to six per licence or an overall 80 per licensee.  We all know that under any provision there will be only such number of vehicles as there is business. These will be expensive vehicles. People will not be able to get into this business with the investment of a small amount of capital.  The Bill provides that a licensee can build up his fleet to 80.  The Minister cannot deny that.  Of course, the haulier must buy a number of licences but in business of that kind it will not be prohibitive for him to buy seven or eight licences.  I am not objecting but I am pointing out to the Minister that there is no real difference between his Bill and Deputy Barry's.  The Minister tells us that there are 750 licensees and 850 licensed vehicles.  If that is so, it means that the number of licensed vehicles in the haulage business may be increased under this Bill from 850 to 4,000 or 5,000.  That is the reality of the situation.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many vehicles CIE have but it would be interesting to know the number of their haulage vehicles.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us that.  He is taking powers to enable existing hauliers to build up their combined fleet from 850 to about 4,500 vehicles and any individual haulier may build up his fleet to 80 vehicles.  This would represent the maximum number which would go on the road anyway, and I would ask the Minister what has changed to satisfy him that this will not have an effect on CIE employment, that it will not clutter or damage the roads, that it will not prevent a number of English people coming here and acquiring vehicles far in excess of 80.  There will be many legal techniques that will enable them to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is to prevent a number of companies being formed and running, for all practical purposes, the one operation? If we do not want to indulge in company law what is to prevent a number of brothers each building up a fleet <Col N="944" /> to 80 and operating as individuals?  I can see nothing in this Bill which changes the position in regard to the complaints Fianna Fáil had against it when they were in Opposition. There is nothing that will protect CIE employment more now than then. There is nothing more in the Bill now than there was then that will control or improve the standards of road transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that more money is provided for roads now than there was then.  Perhaps a larger percentage is provided, but in real terms it is not very much.  It will take years for that to filter through.  What change has been made in the roads in those few short months?  The Fianna Fáil Party should be exposed for their performance in regard to road transport and in regard to the Road Transport Bill when it was introduced by Deputy Barry, when they put down their amendment, and in regard to their manifesto, when they promised a completely new thing authoritatively set up to look into the whole matter.  In the end we got Deputy Barry's Bill with a few amendments which could have been made on Committee Stage.  No amount of talk from the Minister will change that position, because those are the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused me of not reading certain sections of the Bill.  I am well aware of what is in the Bill.  I do not think the Minister read his own Bill, because he made fairly heavy weather out of explaining the penalty section to us.  I believe he took Deputy Barry's Bill and said: &ldquo;We will have to cosmetically dress this up so that it will look different and so that I will not have to come in here and eat humble pie until it comes out through my ears,&rdquo; as Deputy Boland said that Deputy Haughey had to do.  He had to change the Bill to give him some excuse for coming in here with something different.  Those are the facts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> I did not say that any Bill as published would come out the same at the other end.  I took exception to the suggestion by Deputy Fitzpatrick that something the Minister is supposed to have had in mind would have come out at the Committee Stage and that the fact I had those amendments in the Bill meant there was not any original thinking on my part.  I refute that.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is the Minister who shed crocodile tears for poor CIE and their employees who would be pushed out of business by Deputy Barry's Bill which enabled the number of vehicles on the road to be increased.  Now the cat is out of the bag and we find that CIE have in fact 800 vehicles for haulage purposes.  The Minister will get detailed figures now.  He will put 4,500 vehicles on the roads against CIE.  I am not against that.  He will enable the fleet of private hauliers to be built up to 4,500.  How can he reconcile that with the tears he shed in the House in the form of his recent amendment for the damage this would do to CIE employment?  Lots of people think that private enterprise would give a more efficient transport service.  I do not quarrel with that, and <Col N="946" /> I do not quarrel with this Bill, but I quarrel with the dishonesty of the Fianna Fáil Party in their handling of this Bill.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they were very concerned about CIE.  We now find that at the moment CIE have 800 vehicles and private enterprise have 850.  Those are the facts which I got from the Minister. He will now enable private enterprise to put 4,500 vehicles on the road.  He is a member of the party who said in their amendment in 1976 that Deputy Barry's proposal would cause very heavy unemployment in the rail freight and road freight sections of CIE and among the employees of licensed hauliers at a time of existing high unemployment.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose the Minister is saying that we have no unemployment or that it has disappeared since Fianna Fáil came into power.  That is the sort of dishonesty I am objecting to.  That is the sort of carry-on from the Government party in the last year of the previous Dáil up to the last general election I want to expose, and the Minister will not stop me.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a valid point when he said that the Minister wept crocodile tears for CIE when he was in Opposition and that he now proposes to put on the road five times the number of lorries as CIE's total fleet.  Then the Minister stands up and says that Deputy Fitzpatrick is being derogatory about CIE, that he will not allow anybody to be derogatory about them and he will defend CIE, who are doing a very good job.  I never heard the like of such nonsense.  The Minister picks a fight with himself and then accuses Deputy Fitzpatrick of coming into the middle of it.</P>
      <P>He made another point which I failed to answer the first time.  To answer the Minister on that would be nonsense because it is not real argument.  He knows Deputy Fitzpatrick was not derogatory about CIE and he knows that Deputy Fitzpatrick knows as much and appreciates CIE every bit as much as the Minister does.  To pretend that he was criticising them in any way is nonsense.</P>
      <P>Earlier, the Minister said that the Minister for the Environment was providing more money this year than had ever been provided before for the improvement of roads.  This is the same as the attitude towards this Bill.  You dress it up and then you say it is totally different.  Up to last year the roads were funded in three different ways.  There was the bit that came from the rates, the bit that came from the car tax and the bit that came from central funds.  The central fund contribution has, of course, increased because it has taken over the rates section on domestic houses from the local authorities, and the abolition of car tax has meant that the central fund has to pick that up as well.  That is the only reason Deputy Barrett is providing more money.  The roads themselves are not getting any more money but more of it is coming from the Department of the Environment.  To pretend that more money is being invested in our roads in 1978 than in 1977 is nonsense.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P> In page 5, between lines 55 and 56, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(3)  Whenever an order or regulation is proposed to be made under this Act a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft order has been passed by each such House. </P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that where the Minister may, as he is taking the power to do under section 5 (2), make orders to amend or revoke any order under this section, he may also under this section make orders to exempt from the provisions of section 7 of the Road Transport Act, sections 9 and 34 of the Principal Act and sections 6 and 7 of the Road Transport Act, 1935.  He may, by order, exempt people from the provisions of all those sections, that is, not individuals but classes of persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is taking significant powers which could affect, in their execution, the purpose of the sections in question if he were to exempt a wide range of people from them.  The purpose of my amendment, which is an amendment I intend to put down in respect of any order-making power taken under any Bill by any Minister, <Col N="950" /> is to ensure that such an order will have to be approved by the House before it takes effect.  We have the habit of passing to the Minister the power to make orders which are, in effect, often as important as, if not more important than, this legislation without proper scrutiny of the way in which those orders take effect.</P>
    <P>There are three ways in which an order can be made by a Minister.  The way in which it is done in this Bill is the least effective way, where the Minister is simply given power to make the order.  There is no obligation on him to even inform the House of the order that he is making.  The second and slightly stronger provision from the point of view of parliamentary control is one whereby the Minister may make the order but must lay a copy of it on the table of the House and any Member of the House may put down a motion annulling the order, which must be taken in Government time if it is put down within 21 days of the order having originally been laid down by the Minister.  In consumer terms this is what one would describe as inertia selling.  If the consumer, namely the public, as represented by their legislators, objects to the order within 21 days then it must be discussed.  It is a weak power, but a power which the Minister is evidently not prepared to provide for this House.</P>
    <P>The strongest power of all in relation to orders made by the Minister is the one which I am suggesting should be incorporated in this Bill.  This is one whereby&mdash;and I am quoting the amendment which puts it in exact terms: &ldquo;Whenever an order or regulation is proposed to be made under this Act a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft order has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;  This means that the Minister must obtain the approval of the Dáil for the order which he is making.  The objection might be put forward that this would impose great difficulty on the Minister and that there would be delays.  My experience is that delays in the drafting of orders do not occur in this House.  Where an order <Col N="951" /> of this nature comes before the House &mdash;and I have a recent example in mind of a technical order which this provision applied to under the friendly societies legislation&mdash;it is passed within a few minutes if it is not of a contentious nature.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were not engaging in any contentious activity under the powers which I am proposing he would have under the section, he is unlikely to have to wait for days and days while this matter is discussed interminably.  The recent example of an order under the friendly societies legislation which I have cited shows that, where it is a non-contentious matter, the House is prepared to deal with it in a non-contentious manner and put it through quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister may contend that there would be delays, but the delays will not occur in this House.  The delays may occur in getting the order drafted by the parliamentary draftsman's office.  My experience of legislation of this sort, whether it be principal or subsidiary legislation, namely orders, is that the delays do not occur in getting the matter through the House if it is non-contentious.  If it is a contentious matter that is another question, and legitimately the House will delay it.  If it is a non-contentious matter, the delay occurs in getting the order drafted.</P>
    <P>I would argue that the Minister would have nothing to lose by conceding this amendment, which would give much greater democratic scrutiny to the exercise of the powers he is taking in this Bill.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting it.  If he does not accept this amendment, I would ask him at least to accept the suggestion that the order must be laid before the House and can be annulled within 21 days.  Obviously I would prefer him to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am seeking in this provision is delegated power from the Oireachtas to deal with certain transport matters which may be settled in the course of international negotiations for the benefit of the <Col N="952" /> countries concerned, which will usually be of a marginal nature in the context of the national economy.</P>
      <P>The practical effect of the proposed amendment would not only be to refuse that power to the Minister but to place him in a position where, because of the lack of delegated authority, he could not take any effective part in international discussions on practical matters affecting the day to day operations of the haulage industry.  It would create a problem for him to undertake to honour any commitment no matter what the benefit to our transport might be.  In those circumstances, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give more information about the precise type of circumstances in which these order-making powers would be used? What sort of international agreements are in mind?  What sort of exemptions are in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, the ECMT decided some years ago that international coach tours would not require licences.  We had no power to exempt.  We are taking that power here. To give another example, in the event of our having a bilateral agreement with the Netherlands to exemp a particular type of traffic from licensing, we could not do that unless we had this power I am seeking.  There are several other matters which are relatively marginal.</P>
      <P>The Deputy read out section 7 of the Road Transport Act, 1933.  That is a requirement to hold a passenger licence.  There might be a decision by the ECMT that there was no need to hold that type of licence.  In those circumstances, we would need the power to implement it here.  Under the European Communities Act, the Minister may make orders to implement EEC enactments, and this is an analagous matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before replying substantially to the points made by the Minister, I wonder would he confirm that this is confined to international agreements.  Section 5 (1) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an international agreement relating to international transport by <Col N="953" /> road to which the State is a party, or an agreement, arrangement or resolution relating to such transport to which the Minister is a party so requires. . .</P>
    <P>They are alternatives.  It could be either an international agreement or any other agreement.  For instance, the Minister could have an agreement with some private group here.  He could have an agreement with CIE, and the power conferred by this section could be used in relation to such an internal private deal by the Minister, which could be one with considerable political connotations, one which was not achieved by diplomatic negotiation in international circles where there were proper checks and balances, one which was a back door agreement by the Minister with some vested interest in the transport field here.  He would have the power to exempt a class of person from the provisions of the various Acts pursuant to that agreement, a private agreement, without having to seek the approval of the Dáil, or without even having to inform the Dáil that such an agreement had been entered into by him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's assertion in the matter.  I want to turn my attention not to the Minister's assertion but to what is contained in the Bill.  It could be international transport which was being authorised by the Minister not pursuant to an international agreement but pursuant to a domestic agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how it would arise in practice in any case. We are referring here to changes.  As things stand at the moment, under EEC provisions I have power to make regulations.  I have not got that power in relation to international transport related to ECMT.  All I am doing here is taking that power.  It <Col N="954" /> relates purely to international transport.</P>

      <P>Is the amendment withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I now come to the main objection made by the Minister to my proposal, which was that he could not enter into effective international discussions unless he could make orders under this legislation by a back door method which did not even involve informing the Dáil about the orders he was making.  To my mind that suggestion is ludicrous.</P>
      <P>Many if not most international negotiations on EEC matters involve some changes in our law.  If one is talking about negotiations on the EEC price package for farm products, if that is approved it will involve changes in our law, because it will involve changes in consumer prices and these will have to be adjusted by a household goods order under the Prices Act. Although they spring directly from and are an inevitable result of negotiations entered into and completed in Brussels by the European Council of Ministers of Agriculture, under the Prices Act those orders can be annulled by resolution within 21 days by this House.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the Minister for Agriculture has complained that he cannot negotiate in Brussels because of the fact that the agreement he enters into may be annulled by this House to the extent to which it affects domestic consumer prices because under the Prices Acts Members of this House have the right to table a motion seeking to annul an agreement.  This does not inhibit the Minister in any way. Therefore he is making a very poor argument in opposition to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that international negotiations are entered into by the Government in good faith and that if there is involved a change in the law the Government must make the change through the legislature.  This is a common feature of international agreements. It is ridiculous for the Minister, with a majority of 20, to express the fear that to inform the House of an <Col N="955" /> order might mean its defeat.  There is no problem in regard to his succeeding in having ratified by the House any exemption in relation to the sort of agreement we are talking about, but what is important is that there be some discussion of the agreement before it is passed here.  Although the Opposition would not be able to defeat an order they should be given the opportunity of expressing their views on it.  Such discussion would give the House the opportunity of ascertaining what was involved in the exercise under consideration.  That is what the amendment is designed to achieve. Presumably after a brief discussion of the order it would be passed by the House.  This would ensure that Deputies who might object to an order would have the opportunity of tabling a motion to annul.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how this very limited power would inhibit the Minister in any way in respect of international negotiations.  As I have pointed out, such a provision exists in respect of agricultural negotiations and I have not heard any complaint from the Minister concerned that, for instance, he cannot negotiate in Brussels in relation to food prices by reason of maximum prices orders having to be made by order under the Prices Acts. The area we are speaking of here is less contentious than agriculture, so I do not see any problem for the Minister in agreeing to our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe my argument to be valid.  The changes that would be made are relatively minor. Already we have power in relation to the EEC countries in this respect and nobody has found anything wrong with that situation.  Neither is there anything wrong in this case.  I have explained what I regard would be the difficulties in relation to the amendment.  Consequently, I am justified in refusing to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is experienced in the area of international negotiation, and from this experience can be illustrate how in practice there could be interference with international negotiations by reason of the existence <Col N="956" /> of a power providing for the laying of an order before the House?  Is he suggesting that his fear relates to the possibility of his stance in international negotiations being defeated in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If we are to follow the Deputy's argument it seems that the sort of agreement reached would be of no consequence so long as the Minister succeeded in having it passed in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the position he is incorporating in this Bill is better in some way than what is contained in my amendment in so far as parliamentary control is concerned?  If the Minister gets his way the result will be that these matters can be put through without being discussed here and that in addition there would be no statutory obligation on him to inform the House of what he was doing.  The Minister was trying to argue that it would be impossible for him to negotiate internationally if a draft order could not be put through the House.  He contends that acceptance of my amendment would tie his hands in regard to such negotiations, but I have asked him to illustrate how in practice this would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>When a Minister makes an order that order is published, so there is no question of an order being made secretly.  If I am given the power being sought an order would be published after it had been made. What, then, is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the order might be publicised there would be no statutory obligation on the Minister to have the order drawn to the attention of this House.  In the Order Paper for each day there is a list of documents that are laid before the Dáil.  Today, for instance, we read that the Public Service (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order, 1978, has been statutorily laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>If the section goes through in its present form the Minister will be under no obligation, although an order would be published, to make details of that order available to the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> House or to have it placed in the Library for the perusal of the elected representatives who have been sent here by the people to ensure that Ministers do not abuse their functions in any way, nor would there be any obligation on the Minister to provide an opportunity for debating contentious orders.  Either of the amendments I am suggesting would provide that opportunity.  I wonder what the Minister has to fear from public discussion of the orders he is making under this section.  Of course it would be much more convenient if orders could be made with the knowledge only of those directly involved, but the question is not one of convenience. We are considering the exercise by the Minister of delegated functions, functions conferred on him by statute.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the reason behind the Minister's refusal to provide for discussion of the exercise of these powers.  It is very rarely that a Deputy seeks to have annulled any order laid before the House, but it is a safeguard to have provision for such a situation. It is my contention that in every case an order should be discussed, but this seems to be more than the Minister is prepared to agree to, and neither is he prepared to accept the much more modest proposal of having the order laid before the House and provision being made whereby a motion could be tabled seeking an annulment of the order.  I would be happy to withdraw my amendment if the Minister would assure me that at Report Stage he would introduce an amendment to provide for the 21-day procedure.  This would mean that there would be no necessity for a debate but that if anybody wished to put down a motion to annul there would be such provision. In 99 cases out of 100 there would be no such motion and no debate would be required, but the safeguard would exist.  If the Minister is prepared to accept that normal and standard provision in the taking of order-making powers by the Minister under statute, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment which goes a little further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It now appears that that is a considerable understatement and that the maximum number of vehicles being provided for is about 6,500.  I do not think there is much difference between 6,500 vehicles and unlimited licensing.  This is a peculiarly drafted section.  Subsection (1) states that the Minister may distribute the licences as he has outlined and this provision seems to facilitate a person who has two or three licences to build up the number of vehicles he wants for his own use and if he has two licences to sell the other.  I am worried whether we are facilitating the sale of licences and enabling people to make substantial profits by the sale of licences through legislation being passed here. Subsection (2) provides that an application under subsection (1) may be made only once in respect of any licence and subsection (3) provides that the section shall cease to have effect on the expiration of one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> This seems to be a section inserted for a specific purpose and I should like the Minister to tell us if he has any particular case in mind or if any representations have been made to him in this respect.  Measures have gone through the House in the past bearing the names of individuals who had made representations.  I honestly do not think we should lay down general principles in a Bill like this providing that a person may multiply the number of lorries on a licence by six in one case and then, by a specific section put into the Bill, be enabled to split up the number of vehicles.  The purpose appears to be to enable the licensee who holds more than one licence to arrange the licences so that he can have enough lorries under one licence for his own use and then to sell the rest.  He should take his chance the same as everybody else.  No small group or less than a small group should be facilitated in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is reading too much into this.  I will go back to my original instance.  If a man is entitled to have one vehicle under one licence and two vehicles under another, he will be entitled to increase the numbers to 12 under one licence and six under another.  There is nothing to prevent him selling either the 12 or the six.  They are his property and he is entitled to sell ten of the vehicles if he wants to or to sell one on that basis.  If he thought ten would be the number he would be able to operate, I do not see why he should not be entitled to change the allocation to ten vehicles and eight vehicles and then to sell the eight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy Fitzpatrick that I did not get representations about this that I can remember.  My reason for having done it in this way is that I had a look at the figures in relation to people who, for example, had two licences, one with three vehicles and one with one. I decided that this meant one licence could have 18 vehicles and the other six, and that if such a man wanted to leave the licences to two sons there could be imbalance because one <Col N="964" /> would get 18 and the other six.  The owner of such vehicles could add the 18 and the six and divide by two, giving two twelves.  There was no ulterior motive in drafting the section in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Honestly, did the Minister think that out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a situation is a possibility.  There are numerous instances where people might wish to do that, where persons might wish to change the number of vehicles under different licences.  This has nothing to do with the sale of licences.  At the moment if a person has two licences he can sell the two or he can sell one. In other words, he can sell the business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I have no objection to facilitating a person who wants to dispose of his licences within his family by way of gift or that sort of thing. However, there are 524 cases where there is one licence which caters for only one lorry.  There is no problem there.  There are 107 cases of one licence covering two lorries.  The man who has one licence and two lorries can get 12 lorries and the 25 cases with one lorry and three lorries can get 18 lorries, and so on.  When we get into the higher ones I am not sure whether this is a facilitating section to enable a person to juggle about with licences which would give him enough vehicles for himself and enable him to sell one which he would not be entitled to do.  If the Minister can assure me that will not be allowed to happen I will be happy, but if there is a possibility that that can happen, I am dead against it.</P>

      <P>No, that is a different situation.  This is where the lessor has a merchandise licence.  That is the group to which Deputy Fitzpatrick was referring.  In the 1956 Act a loophole was closed in the transport legislation under which a person with no merchandise licence could nevertheless earn a living from owning a truck by hiring it to other people.  Vehicle leasing or rental as an alternative to purchase was hardly known when the 1956 Act was passed.  It was not the intention of the Act to prohibit that but it did.  Section 9 of the Bill legalises the use of leased vehicles for the carriage of own goods where the lessor holds a merchandise licence and the leasing agreement contains provisions approved by the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P> In page 7, line 35, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to add &ldquo;:  provided the estimate for the year in question containing provision for those expenses has first been approved by Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is another amendment I have put down not so much because of its specific relationship to the Bill but because I believe it should be incorporated in all legislation to achieve a greater degree of parliamentary control over the expenditure of moneys by the various Departments of State. To make clear what the amendment provides I shall read the existing section 10 which says:</P>
      <P> The expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And it stops there.  I propose to add that the money may be paid out of funds provided by the Oireachtas, provided the Estimate for the year in question, containing provisions for these expenses, has been approved by the Dáil.  In the case of expenses to be incurred under this Bill these would be incorporated in the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power. The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power <Col N="973" /> for, shall we say, 1979 is considered before that year commences, in other words, during 1978.  There are provisions, under the Central Fund Act of 1965, whereby Estimates for a particular year may be considered before the year commences.  To my knowledge these powers under the Central Fund Act have not been exercised by any Government.  What happens at present is that Estimates, if they are considered at all&mdash;and in many cases they are not &mdash;are considered during the year to which they apply.</P>
    <P>In many cases by the time the Estimate is debated here half the money has already been spent and so the debate is meaningless in so far as half the money involved is concerned.  If the debate were to take place before the year in question then the debate would be a real debate because we would be discussing policies and suggestions could be offered as to ways in which the money should be spent and the Minister could accept these suggestions if he found them worth accepting. In many cases there is no discussion at all on the Estimates.  Last year the Government spent over £2,000 million and only 3 per cent of that expenditure was actually discussed on the Estimates during 1977.  The remainder was not discussed at all.  The Estimates were passed in a lump without any discussion.  In that situation the Dáil is not performing the function it should, namely, scrutinising the way in which money is spent by the Government.  My amendment would require the Estimate for Tourism and Transport for 1979 to be discussed this year and, if it were discussed, that would greatly improve the debate here and Deputies could offer ideas for the better presentation of the Estimate.  I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment very favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>However well this amendment may sound in theory it would be utterly impracticable.  In a previous amendment the Deputy sought to curtail the power of the Minister to deal with certain matters. In this it is the powers of the Oireachtas the Deputy seems to want to circumscribe.  The effect of the <Col N="974" /> amendment would be to suspend the implementation of an Act until such time as the particular Estimate had been passed.  The Deputy suggests the discussion might take place the year before.  The Deputy has had sufficient experience to know this would not be practicable.  Such an approach would place an impossible burden on the conduct of Government business.  The standard provision in the Bill leaves the matter in the hands of the Oireachtas.  It does not derogate from the power of the Oireachtas.  That is the most satisfactory situation, and I could not, therefore, accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister says it would not be practicable for the Estimate for Tourism and Transport to be discussed in the year prior to its taking effect.  I do not agree, because the Central Fund Act provides that Estimates may legally be considered in advance of the year to which they relate.  Secondly, all West European Parliaments consider the Estimates in the previous year because they realise, as we apparently do not, that there is no point in talking about money already spent and pretending control over it.  The Minister may argue that that would clog up the House.  It would not clog if the Estimates were introduced in time and, if there was any difficulty, there is nothing to stop the setting up of Select Committees to consider the Estimates and report back to the House and nothing to stop the House then having a short plenary discussion.  In that way the Estimates would go through fairly quickly.  In the French Parliament they have to get the Estimates through in three months.  There is intensive work by select committees and there is a proper discussion about the way in <Col N="975" /> which the money will be spent.  There is no proper procedure here.  I appreciate that it would be difficult for the Minister to accept this amendment because other Departments are ininvolved.</P>

      <P>The Minister will also realise that there are difficulties imposed on the Opposition in introducing legislation. They are not entitled to introduce certain forms of Bills.  I intend, without apology, to make these points clearly on every Bill that comes before the House.  This is the first occasion I have had an opportunity of doing this, but if the Minister comes here again I am afraid he will have to listen to the same argument until such time as the Government change their practice.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the comments made by my colleagues on this serious piece of legislation, the title of which is somewhat of a misnomer.  It is not a relief, it is quite a hefty additional burden on a certain section of the community.  I understand that in the case of Cork an extra 2,000 farmers will be asked to contribute in the region of £1 million extra.  That is an unfairly distributed burden.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that valuation at present is irrelevant.  At one time it was a genuine assessment <Col N="977" /> of the capabilities of land, but valuation as we know it at present is no indicator of the value of land.  Very often small holdings, for historical reasons, are highly valued and it is possible that a farm of 70 acres carries a valuation of £140.  One can appreciate the burden such a farmer would have in trying to survive after this Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>Almost everybody else has been given relief of rates, even those in the wealth tax bracket.  People with houses costing up to £250,000 do not have to pay rates but a small section of the farming community are expected to make up the deficit.  In this case the Government are giving away something indiscriminately while asking a small section of the community to pay for it.  Of course the matter does not end there.  We know that the Government have limited the increase this year to 11 per cent, but we do not have any statutory guarantees that next year the contribution will not be increased to 30 per cent and the Government's contribution reduced to 16 per cent.  I should like to tell the House that a farmer now paying £433 will be asked to pay £763 while a farmer with a valuation of £90 who is now being asked to pay £543 will be faced with a bill for £918.  On a valuation of £100 a farmer pays £612 now but he will be asked to pay £1,021. That is at the current rate of increase. The Government are demanding hefty sums of money from the farmers regardless of profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware those involved in farming are at the mercy of the weather, and the health of a farmer can be an important factor in determining whether he will make a profit. This type of penal legislation should be considered carefully before it is passed.  The Minister should have another look at the Bill because I believe he has gone too far.  Our farmers, in common with farmers in other European countries, pay their taxes, but now they are being asked to pay almost 81 per cent extra on their rates, regardless of profits.  That is unfair. Such an increase will have to be passed on to the consumer.  There is no way of stopping this increase at the farm gate. <Col N="978" /> The increase must find its way into the shops, thereby making our basic foods more expensive.</P>

      <P>Yes, thanks be to God.  Would the Taoiseach not now agree that he was not standing idly by when he ordered the Director of the GIS to attend, against his wishes, the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis?  Would the Taoiseach inform the House what was his status there?  As a civil servant was he responsible to the State that pays him or to the Fianna Fáil Party?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I do not think his wishes enter into the matter if he attends a function like this at my request.  He attended, as I said, to make arrangements for interviews, which were requested, and to convey to Press representatives generally any information that I wanted to give to them on Government policy. He was not there in any capacity related to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>Surely the Taoiseach is aware that Ard Fheiseanna have been held in this country for the last 50 to 60 years, that interviews have been given and that this was the first time in the history of the State that the Director of the GIS was ordered to attend such a political function?  Does the Taoiseach not think it a pity that he would do anything to erode the trust that has been built up since the foundation of the State between different Governments and the Irish civil service because of the integrity and, indeed, the loyalty of the civil servants of this State to different Governments?  Does the Taoiseach not think that this is again encouraging low standards in high places?</P>

      <P>I wanted to ensure, as I think it is my right and to an extent my duty, the availability of the best possible liaison officer between me and the Press.  The Government Press Secretary is the best possible liaison officer in this respect that I know of and, therefore, I felt it right that he should be there.</P>
      <P>Over and above all that, his function related to his position as the Government Information Press Secretary under my control.  I may tell the Deputy that when I was Taoiseach before, I frequently instructed civil servants, to wit my private secretary, from time to time, to attend the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in different places, as I required them to attend and as long as it was consistent with my duties as Taoiseach.  Further, may I ask the Deputy, if he was aware that the former Press Secretary was in attendance at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the limited space in the Dublin wholesale market and its location in a congested area of the city are unsatisfactory for the producer delivering his produce and for the efficient handling and quick throughput of perishable vegetables.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive, together.  While I agree that our livestock should, to the greatest extent possible, be processed in Ireland, nevertheless I regard the continuance of a live export trade as essential to maintain balance and competition in the industry.  In any event I am advised that a levy on exports of live animals for any of the reasons mentioned would be &ldquo;a charge having an equivalent effect to a customs duty&rdquo; and as such would be prohibited by the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the recommendations in the McKinsey Report have been incorporated in a plan for the food processing industry which has recently been put forward by the Food, Drink and Tobacco Federation of the Confederation <Col N="989" /> of Irish Industry.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and I recently discussed this plan with the Federation.</P>
    <P>The Study refers to areas in our beef industry that will require special attention, in particular greater production of processed products and improved marketing.  I intend to take all possible steps to facilitate the achievement of these objectives.  In this connection, I am, for example, currently pursuing with the EEC Commissioner for Agriculture possible ways of removing or offsetting anomalies in the MCA system, which hinder exports of processed beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the increase in the incidence of sheep scab since the change of the dipping period from June to October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.  It has been established that the mite which causes sheep scab does not generally become active until the late autumn and winter months and that the only way to control or eradicate the disease is to dip all sheep during those months.  For that reason the Sheep Dipping Order, 1965, which originally required dipping to be carried out twice each year&mdash;in summer and autumn&mdash;was amended in 1976 to provide for a single annual dipping between 15 September and 31 January.</P>
      <P>While 96 outbreaks of the disease were reported to my Department in 1977 compared with 61 in 1976, I do not accept that this indicates an increased incidence of the disease in our flocks.  Rather do I regard it as an increased awareness of the importance of bringing outbreaks to official notice so that urgent remedial action can be taken, and this I attribute to the renewed campaign to get rid of sheep scab launched in 1976 by the local authorities who are responsible for the implementation of the Sheep Dipping Order.</P>
      <P>Sheep scab can be finally eradicated only if all sheep are dipped annually in an approved dip as prescribed under the Order.  Returns showing the number dipped in the 1977/78 season are not yet to hand from all local authorities, but the returns for the previous season indicated that approximately 74 per cent of the national flock was dipped in that year.  I will not be satisfied until there is full compliance with the Order, and my Department are continuing their efforts to achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that efforts to eradicate sheep scab <Col N="991" /> have been going on for perhaps 30 years and we seem to be no nearer to eradicating it now than we were when the scheme was started?  Is he satisfied that local authorities are the appropriate bodies to be responsible for this matter?  As a result of the change to winter dipping, has there been any increased scrutiny as to whether these inspections are taking place as it was indicated they would at the time?  Is any check carried out by the veterinary service of the Minister's Department at sheep slaughtering plants as to the incidence of scab in sheep which are slaughtered and the areas for which infected animals are coming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that progress is not being made.  Progress has been made since this order was introduced.  There is a new awareness of the disease.  That is good in itself. It has been represented from time to time, mainly by county councils, that the Department should take full responsibility for the implementation of this sheep dipping order.  The Department must observe priorities in the allocation of moneys and staff resources available for the work of animal disease eradication.  At present the eradication of TB and brucellosis must be the main priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Land valuation is used for a variety of purposes including local rating, farmer taxation, social services and educational grants, and the methods used to determine the valuations do not come within my direct area of responsibility as Minister for Agriculture.  I should say, however, that the basis to be used for determining equitable land valuation for a variety of purposes would raise very broad issues which would require extensive study before a decision in principle could be taken on the question of undertaking a national revaluation of agricultural land, and such basis might not necessarily fall within functions appropriate to An Foras Talúntais.</P>

Surely that is part of the function of the Minister for Agriculture and surely it is an extremely important thing to establish a proper and up-to-date valuation of land.

The sum of £28 million provided for this year is in fact 14 per cent over actual expenditure under the scheme last year and it represents the estimated amount needed to meet payments arising in 1978. <Col N="1007" /> On the basis of recent trends, it is expected that commercial farmers will account for about 6 per cent of the 1978 expenditure, development farmers for about 40 per cent and the balance will go to other farmers.  Farm buildings and other fixed assets are expected to account for about 70 per cent of grants for capital works, land improvement works for some 20 per cent to 25 per cent and the remainder of about 5 per cent will be absorbed by machinery and equipment.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1978: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the rates Bill there is a very antiquated, unfair and inaccurate form of assessment.  The Minister should try to do something about it.  The existing valuations bear no relation to a farm's capacity to produce.  I know of one parish where <Col N="1021" /> there is a 70 acre farm with a valuation of £130 and in the same parish there is a 140 acre farm with a £70 valuation.  It is obvious that this savage increase will be imposed very unfairly. Any impositions of rates or tax should be seen to be fairly distributed.  In County Cork, for instance, the north and south carry over 85 per cent of the extra burden.</P>
      <P>When the Coalition Government removed health from housing which accounted for £5 in the £ and when we removed the 25 per cent from the rates, there were no strings attached. During the election campaign we were told nothing about this and we were projected as an anti-farmer party.  Now we can see the reality, that it is only now that farmers are being treated badly.  When the £17 employment scheme finished, bringing a revenue of about £½ million, there was uproar in this House but now £7 million is being taken and there is nothing about it. It has been suggested that the rates can be used to offset income tax.  The category of people who will be involved under this are people who are involved in heavy borrowing and who have big families and so on, and they are usually not liable to income tax, so that suggestion is of no benefit to them.  These people are faced with an additional bill which could in cases amount to £1,000 along with all their other commitments.  When one considers that that is being done in order to give free rating to very well-to-do people with houses costing up to £¼ million it can be seen how unfair this is.  This is why I oppose it.  If everyone was to be treated fairly under this Bill it would be all right, but discrimination is wrong and cannot be defended. The category of the people affected by this Bill enjoy few benefits, they must pay voluntary health and university fees for their children and so on.  This is a savage slap at one section of the community.  The Minister should amend this, even in a small way so that people who are not liable for income tax would not have to pay the extra involved under this Bill.  Even if the Minister could give us assurances that it would not be over 11 per cent in the years ahead that would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> The Minister should not proceed with this Bill as it stands because he is working on a wrong premise.  We were not altogether without blame when in government, because we based the income tax on that premise, but two wrongs do not make a right, and if we are to continue with farm rates we should look for a different system of assessment.  When speaking about farm taxation I was inclined to promulgate the idea that we should have one form of tax such as income tax.  I do not see why the farmer, unlike his Northern Ireland or UK counterparts, should be put into a non-competitive position.  When the effect of this Bill is fully realised there will be widespread dissatisfaction.  I appreciate that every Government must collect a certain amount of revenue but I am opposed to this manner of doing it because it is hitting at a small section of the community who can ill afford this extra burden.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to think about this again in terms of removing farm rates altogether.  At present one section is carrying the can for everybody else, business people and others, even in respect of such things as malicious damage and so on.  It is not proper that they should carry additional burdens year in year out and be singled out in this respect, especially when they are given no indication in advance.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the whole rates system scrapped leaving instead, as is desired by the farming organisations, one form of taxation.  Then if somebody did not wish to keep accounts they would have an alternative, something based not on valuations but on adjusted acreage.  The Minister does not really have to go through the whole rigmarole of having revaluation done because in the Agricultural Institute they have worked out fairly well a system of adjusted acres; for example, if somebody did not wish to keep accounts then he would pay a few pounds per adjusted acre.  That would bring in revenue and would also solve the problem of the farmer who did not wish to keep accounts. In the case of the farmer who is caught in the tax net the alternative <Col N="1023" /> of the notional system is out for him now and he must keep accounts even if he is making no profit.  And, having properly costed out farm accounts very often he would be paying little or no income tax assuming he is a progressive man, has heavy borrowings, is developing his farm and rearing a family.  At present that man with a 70 to 100 acre farm would be paying little or no tax on the basis of keeping accounts.  On the basis of my figures he will now be asked to pay £500 or £600 extra for no reason whatever.</P>
    <P>This emanates from a Minister whose Government went into office on the basis that they would create a better Ireland for everybody, that they would create more jobs. I ask: what effect will this have on job creation or on production?  If one hinders a man buying a new machine or extra fertilisers by requiring that he must give the Minister £500 or £600 extra how can he possibly produce more?  How can he provide more jobs?  The Minister is hampering that man, and I take that point very seriously to the Minister.  This is a bad Bill, an anti-production Bill, an anti-job Bill and will be seen and identified as such when its full implications are realised.</P>
    <P>If there was a sort of state of euphoria when we could give everybody free rates, including the farmers, fair enough, or if the whole rates bill could be abolished and provided equitably some other way that would also be fair.  But nowhere did I read&mdash; in any election manifesto or anything else&mdash;anything from the Fianna Fáil Party that this would be their treatment of rural Ireland.  They gave no such indication.  In fact they came into office as the saviours of Irish farmers and this is what they do.  The Minister should be thoroughly ashamed of himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few short points on this Bill.  In general my party feel that rates are and always were an unjust type of taxation, in so far as they had no regard to one's ability to pay or to one's income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> The provisions of this Bill constitute an imposition on farmers over a certain valuation.  They are not this year being given the relief they had last year.  It has been argued that now they can allow their rates as a payment off their income tax.  Straight-away that assumes that they would pay income tax and leaves them no form of appeal with regard to keeping accounts or anything else.  It assumes also that they are not paying anything extra because they are being allowed it as a tax payment.  That may be all right provided they are liable to tax or that they opted not to prove whether or not they are and accept their liability as a result of the notional system.</P>
    <P>This action on the part of the Government is a means of financing&mdash;to a certain degree&mdash;the removal of rates from private dwellings.  It will also finance local authorities in an unjust manner.  It is unjust because it bears no relation whatever to the position of the large farmer who would have to pay tax&mdash;and probably this would be a small proportion of it&mdash;and who is allowed this as a tax payment.  But the man on the border line who possibly could prove that he was not liable to tax and who could produce accounts to that effect cannot do so now and must pay the tax as rates anyway.  That cannot be justified and is wrong.  It would be better&mdash;I say this in all sincerity&mdash;that the notional system be done away with altogether and farmers forced, just as are other business people, to produce accounts showing what their tax rate should be and be taxed accordingly.  There should be no question of somebody getting away with the notional system if he is a sufficiently large farmer and his valuation possibly incorrect in comparison with his income.  It is entirely wrong to say he is being allowed this as a payment of tax and therefore it does not constitute any increase in his payments.  It is a way of offsetting what has been offered by way of rates reduction.  There should be some form&mdash;and I say this fearlessly without reference to anybody it may offend or anything else&mdash;of local taxation.  But it should be a just form and, in my opinion, rates never were <Col N="1025" /> that; they were the most unjust form imaginable.</P>
    <P>It is so many years since valuations were established that they are now meaningless.  Therefore, any tax applicable to a straight-across-the-board valuation must be an unjust one and I oppose it on those grounds.  I am not saying that possibly these people should not pay tax.  If they are liable to tax they should pay it.  I admit that freely.  But to maintain they they are being allowed this rate as a payment of their tax is unjust, because heretofore such people may have been able to prove that they were not liable to income tax.  In that way an extra burden is being imposed on them.</P>
    <P>I maintain it is an imposition not spelled out by the Fianna Fáil Party during their election campaign.  They went into office spelling out that they would allow rates as a payment on taxation, but certainly they did not spell out that they would do away with the system under which farmers received rates remission on agricultural land, and that is what is happening now.  It is a deception, and the Minister should consider seriously allowing these people the same concessions as they had heretofore even if he were to say that they must produce accounts to prove to the satisfaction of the Revenue people that they would be paying a lesser amount of tax because they could be paying a lesser amount of tax than their increase in rates would mean.  It is not just to tax them in that manner.  I am opposed to that idea in the Bill and would ask the Minister to consider that aspect very carefully.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate over the last few weeks.  There were interesting points made, with some of which I could not agree. Some of the points raised can be dealt with more relevantly when we resume the discussion on the Estimate this evening or tomorrow.  Deputy Fitzpatrick had some difficulty with regard to the Title of the Bill and subsequent speakers followed the line he set, namely, that the Bill was misnamed <Col N="1026" /> and therefore misleading.  Deputy Quinn seemed to think the purpose of the Bill was to increase local taxation on land and on small farmers generally.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There is no basis in fact for the suggestions made by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>The Bill is correctly named.  It is similar to Bills that were brought before this House in the past.  The purpose of the Bill is to give £38.5 million relief to farmers on their rates. Before people reject this Bill they should remember that, if the Bill is not passed, we will not be able to give this £38.5 million relief to the farming community.  I find it difficult to understand why there should be any confusion about the Title of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The proposed relief amounts to £38.5 million and I hope that those Deputies who seemed to misunderstand the nature of the Bill now have a proper understanding of it.  Deputy Clinton said the purpose of the Bill was to get easy money for the Exchequer. The purpose of the Bill is to give rates relief.  The Bill will not collect money for the Exchequer, as Deputy Clinton tried to imply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the Government's approach to the whole question of rates and he tried to trace changes in Fianna Fáil's approach from 1972.  He should not have started at 1972.  If he checks the record he will find that every single improvement in the agricultural grant over the past 46 years since 1932 was brought in by Fianna Fáil and not by either of the Inter-Party Governments or the recent National Coalition Government.  Indeed, during the period of the three Governments to which I have referred there was several Bills brought in with regard to the agricultural grant and they gave an opportunity to the Minister at the time to give further reliefs had his Government wished to do that.  It would be wrong to say they did not introduce any changes.  In the 1976 Bill the National Coalition Government abolished the employment allowance.  Admittedly it was only £17 per year per full-time employee.  The reason why the allowance is mentioned here is for drafting <Col N="1027" /> purposes.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was under some misapprehension about it. It has to be mentioned for drafting purposes, but the allowance was abolished, as I said, in 1976.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn was advocating task forces, or something of that nature, to look into the whole question of local taxation.  I suppose these have their uses but my concern is to implement Government policy on rates relief, not to introduce task forces. This Bill deals solely with rates relief on the agricultural community.  Since we came into office the Government have been engaged in taking action on rates.  We have provided this year £80.75 million in rates relief on ordinary dwellings, including farm dwellings, farm out-offices and certain other buildings.  We are providing a further £38.5 million in relieving rates on land and this bring us to a total for rates relief in this year of £120 million approximately.  How we can be accused of not taking account of rates is something I cannot understand. State grants towards current expenditure of local authorities will bring rates relief this year to £109 million and a total of £229 million is being made available this year from the Exchequer to finance local authorities.</P>
    <P>I referred to the abolition of the employment allowance of £17 per year by the National Coalition Government. Some Deputies argued it was an incentive to the creation of more employment. Deputy Enright suggested that this allowance, abolished in 1976, should be brought back.  He said it would create extra jobs in agriculture. It never was much good when it was in existence.  I would point out that under the employment incentive scheme a sum of £20 per week is payable for up to 24 weeks for each additional person taken on and retained in employment for at least three months. The scheme applies also to the agricultural industry.  I do not think I need to say any more about the £17 per annum allowance.  If this £20 per week per employee is not sufficient to encourage the farming community to employ more workers then I do not know how one can create proper <Col N="1028" /> incentives.  This incentive should make it sufficiently attractive for them to employ extra people.  Employing extra people is going to lead to increased production, and we all know what increased production means for exports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright was wide of the mark in suggesting that Bills of this type were sponsored by the Minister. This is incorrect.  Agricultural grant Bills have always been sponsored by the Ministry of Local Government which is now the Ministry of the Environment.  The Minister for Agriculture never sponsored these Bills and never introduced them in the House.</P>
    <P>Much has been said during the course of the debate about farmers in the £75 and upward category.  I have already said that this Bill gives relief to the tune of £38.5 million in 1978. There may be other Deputies who, like Deputy Deasy, are not too sure about this allowance.  The relief in rates of £38.5 million will go, firstly, to continue the total derating which was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1967 for all small land holders.  These small land holders with valuations of £20 or less represent 78 per cent of all rated occupiers of agricultural land.  This Bill confirms the total relief of rates on rated occupiers of £20 valuation or less. Secondly, the Bill will mean a total derating on the first £20 valuation for occupiers up to a total of £33 valuation. Farmers in this category will pay rates only on that part of their valuation which will be over £20: in the case of a £25 valuation they will pay on £5 and in the case of a £33 valuation they will pay on £13.</P>
    <P>The third category farmers with valuations over £33 and up to £75 will also benefit from this £38.5 million.  On the first £20 valuation farmers will get a primary allowance of 80 per cent of their rates and they will get a further 30 per cent relief on every £ valuation over £20 and up to £75.  I am talking about the category of farmer with a valuation of between £33 and £75.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the last category in the farming community.  These are farmers with total valuations that bring them up or above the income <Col N="1029" /> threshold, that is a total of the £75 valuation this year.  It is this category that will be treated differently from last year.  This year they will have to pay full rates on their land.  Nobody can say that they are small farmers. Deputy Quinn was incorrect in his assumption that we were taxing small farmers.  By Irish standards they are all regarded as substantial farmers, yet Deputy Quinn talked about small farmers.</P>
    <P>The rated occupiers of land which falls into the category of £75 valuation and over in 1978 will not get any special relief under the Bill.  These farmers occupy 3 per cent of all land holdings that are at the top of the scale so far as valuations are concerned. Deputy Taylor might like to know that they occupy less than 3 per cent of the land in Clare&mdash;2.6 per cent, for his information.  While they will not get rates relief under the Bill they will be able to offset their full rates, not just this increase, against any income tax for which they are liable.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) referred to the situation in which some farmers in the taxable category may not be liable for income tax.  This can happen in any year in which a farmer has heavy expenses and allowances to claim for under the income tax code.  Farmers who are not liable for income tax will be allowed to offset in full as a credit against their income tax the amount they have had to pay in rates.  This was made very clear by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech last February and again in the Finance Bill which has now been circulated. The offset against income tax is not limited to extra rates resulting from the upper limit being placed on the agricultural grant reliefs.  Just as some farmers may have no income tax bill against which to offset their rates, there may be others who will be able to offset the extra rates and the rates which they would have had to pay this year if this category had continued getting rates relief under this Bill.  Some or all of the rates which they would have had to pay in 1978, even if they continued to get the agricultural grant reliefs, will be offset <Col N="1030" /> against their income tax.  That is a reasonably fair answer to the cases which Deputy Fitzpatrick put.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton could also have given more thought to that side of the story.  He did his best to paint a black picture of what the Bill was doing to farmers.  This Bill gives relief in rates to the tune of £38.5 million in this year alone.  The facts are simple.  The farmers who are not getting relief under this Bill are the bigger farmers. On the average land valuations, the farmers affected in 1978 would have on average 185 acres and upwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to know where there are high valuations and certain anomalies, some with less than 80 acres are involved, but in most cases this is good land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Griffin and some other Deputies said that some farmers had valuations above the average.  It is true and this brings us back to the Griffith valuation.  There are some isolated areas and some areas in my own county under the Griffith valuation. Somebody mentioned £150 per acre.  There are some in my own county with £2 per acre, a very small area, along the estuary.  At that time <Col N="1031" /> as I understand it, this type of land was deemed to be suitable for growing wheat.  By modern standards it is not suitable at all. It is too clammy or some such reason according to the experts.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the whole question of land valuation.  These anomalies exist in certain cases, I agree.  Unfortunately, under existing legislation you cannot change the valuation of a perch of land.  The entire country would have to be revalued.  All you can do is apportion an existing valuation between two people if the land or part of it changes hands.  That is the position without revaluing the whole country.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that farmers in this category can offset their rates against income tax.  The Finance Bill has confirmed this.  Deputy Murphy asked what saving would accrue to the Exchequer if the allowances continued with an upper limit. The figures for the agricultural grant are well known.  The grant would be about £7 million more this year if there were no upper limit.  Last year's grant is reduced by a total of £2.3 million.  At £38.5 million it is £2.3 million less than the total made available last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill makes provision for that.  I may be able to give it to the Deputy before we finish, but I have not got the exact figure right now.  It is not right to assume this £7 million would be a saving to the Exchequer, because the income tax question and the setting off against income tax have to be taken into account.  Those are the actual figures <Col N="1032" /> involved.  It will be £7 million more this year, in other words £45½ million including the over £75 valuation categories. As against last year's sum it is £2.3 million less.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn suggested that the Minister for Finance dodged farmers' rates in the Budget.  Deputy O'Keeffe seemed to speak on the same lines. There are no grounds for such an accusation. The Government could not have acted in a more open way on this matter. There was nothing to hide and nothing was hidden.  I got my Department to send a circular to the county councils on 10 January 1978 telling them clearly and simply about the basis on which the allowances would be made in this current year.  The circular referred directly to the upper limit of £75 valuation.  I also had a formal statement issued through the Government Information Services on the same date drawing attention to the circular and giving details of the allowances for 1978.</P>

      <P>Anything about rates in the manifesto is now a fact.  The Minister for Finance dealt fully with the limits on agricultural grants for 1978 in his budget statement of 1 February 1978.  I refer Deputy Quinn in particular to the Official Report of 1 February 1978, Volume 303, columns 383-385.  These clear and repeated statements would appear to have escaped the notice of some Deputies on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that difficult to understand because we had a full House on the day the Budget was introduced and the people who made these accusations undoubtedly were listening and also got copies of the budget.  There has been no attempt at dodging, ducking or hiding on this issue.  It was spelled out clearly on 10 January.  The circular was issued at local council level.  Many Deputies are members of <Col N="1033" /> councils and they must have heard about it at council level.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon suggested that local authorities are being left short of money this year.  That is far from being a correct statement.  It is far from being true.  Between current and capital money local authorities will have £530 million to spend this year. That is almost £100 million up on 1977.</P>

      <P>Deputy Creed seems to feel that rural ratepayers are not getting value for their rates.  He might be interested to know that State grants meet 68 per cent of non-capital expenditure of county councils while rates meet only 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people may have got the impression from what Deputy Deasy said that his county were left short of £200,000 of the domestic rate grant for last year.  That is not so.  Every single penny claimed and certified for last year was paid before the end of 1977, for Deputy Deasy's information.  Deputy O'Brien referred to the 11 per cent limit on the increase on the rate in the £ for 1978.  I hope he has not lost sight of the fact that the limit is a protection for farmers and all others who still have to pay some rates.  It was part of our undertaking on rates that the public who remain ratepaying would not be asked to bear the burden, and they have not been asked to do so.  The 11 per cent ensures that they will not be asked to do so. <Col N="1034" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that farmers are somehow being asked to pay for the relief on domestic rates. That is not so and the 11 per cent ensures that.  All farmers will benefit from the £80.5 million for the relief of rates on dwellings and other buildings being provided this year.  Farmers will benefit to the tune of £9.5 million approximately on their houses and on farm buildings which were not already derated.</P>
    <P>Farmers also benefit from the relief of rates on all farm outoffices built or improved since 1959.  This is because the temporary remission of rates granted in respect of these hereditaments was made permanent again by Fianna Fáil in an Act of 1966.  These buildings are not even valued but if they were valued they would now enjoy relief of rates to the extent of a further £4 million in this year alone.</P>
    <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate which I followed with interest. Some of the points made were very wide of the mark.  During three-and-a-half hours Deputy Harte made many points.  I would not agree with many of the points that were made.  However, what must be made clear in regard to this Bill is that in no way is it misnamed.  It is exactly what it says, that is, a rates relief Bill.  It had to be brought in because the last Bill, in 1976, allowed for relief of rates for the farming community up to this year.  Without this Bill the farmers would lose out to the extent of £38.5 million which is the extent to which they will benefit now under this Bill. In the event of the Bill being rejected by the House this relief could not be given.</P>

    <P>Athcuireadh an cheist: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bill an Dara hUair.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress I had mentioned to the Minister that I hoped the board would be appointed on merit rather than on political allegiances.  I was going on to mention that I welcomed his decision to reduce membership of the board from 20 to 12.  Some people may consider it strange that the Minister should reduce the membership, but it often happens when a board is unwieldy that effectiveness is reduced.</P>
      <P>The second reservation I have about the Bill is in regard to the period of six years for which members will serve. Admittedly, there is provision in the Bill whereby the Minister can relieve members of their posts, if he thinks fit, and for co-option in the case of the death of a member.  A six-year period of service causes stagnation.  It might be better to provide that two members of the board would retire every two years and that no member would serve the maximum six years.  This would be particularly important in view of the fact that we need drive and initiative to get the Irish language revamped and revitalised and to get the language spoken by the people.</P>
      <P>In the past few years the learning of languages has become very important, and it is encouraging here to see an upsurge in the number of people trying to learn Irish and to speak it.  However, the new board will need a lot of active young men who understand the problems and who are willing to devote a lot of time to solving them.  First of all they will need to put across a new slogan.  We have seen the Buy Irish Campaign and in relation to encouraging the revival of Irish &ldquo;Be Irish, Speak Irish&rdquo; might be a useful slogan.</P>
      <P>A lot of credit must be given to Gael Linn for the work they have done.  Nowadays they have introduced new Linguaphone courses so that those interested in learning to speak Irish have the same opportunity as those learning to speak German or French. This leads me to the summer schools in Irish colleges.  As the Minister will know, they have not only been a boon to the localities in which they are situated but have provided an excellent way for students, from an early age up to leaving certificate, to learn their native language.  I suggest that this scheme could be extended to the parents of students attending these courses, for whom the schools could put on courses every afternoon.  A subsidy of say, £20 or £30 towards the holidays of parents and their children from Dublin, Belfast and Cork, in Gaeltacht areas would be a great encouragement to more people to learn the language.</P>
      <P>It has been a pity in the last ten or 15 years that the Gaeltacht areas have not been extended, part of the reason being that previous Ministers did not state why they should be extended. I suggest that the Minister should proclaim that if 50 per cent of schoolchildren on the perimeters of Gaeltacht areas passed the deontas qualifying examination in a period of two years such areas would automatically become a part of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that if it had not been for the many incentives provided, particularly by Gaeltarra Éireann, the <Col N="1039" /> Gaeltacht areas would be even more denuded than at present.  There is no use trying to retain Irish in an area from which people are emigrating to the USA, Australia, England and Scotland.  If we are to encourage the speaking of Irish in Gaeltacht areas we must make serious efforts to bring industries to every townland in those areas.  We must provide work for the people if we want them to continue to live in those areas.  Gaeltarra Éireann have doen a great job in bringing factories to the Gaeltacht, but there is need for many more.</P>
    <P>Emigration has been the curse of the people in Kerry, West Donegal, Connemara.  We must see that the reasons for such emigration in the past will not obtain in the future. I mentioned to the Minister a case in point concerning people who leave Gaeltacht areas and who send home money from England or Scotland to build houses at home to which they can eventually return.  However, such people do not get the Gaeltacht housing grant because they had not been living in a Gaeltacht area.  It is clear that the reason for such people going abroad in the first place was to save up to have houses built at home.  This matter should be looked into and they should be entitled to these grants. Many emigrants, fathers and mothers, return home with their children.  They are fluent Irish speakers but their children, who have been reared abroad, are not and the children therefore do not qualify for the deontas.  I suggest that children who have come here with their parents from England or Scotland should be given a period before they are examined for the deontas.</P>
    <P>As I have been saying, more incentives are needed.  Anybody who wants to join the civil service must qualify in Irish.  It would be an incentive of a kind if we were to give a money token to civil servants who have Irish, in the form of higher salaries or wages&mdash;a sort of premium for knowledge of Irish.  Here we are said to have two traditions and we have had talk about what should be done for one or the other tradition.  In the Border <Col N="1040" /> areas some of the people in the minority tradition have not a good enough standard of Irish to allow them to enter the civil service.  Such a distinction should not be applied, because we are all Irishmen and proud of it.  It is an appropriate time to be speaking about restoration of the language as we are probably on the eve of direct elections to the EEC.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic and not alone talk about Irish but must encourage people to learn other languages.  The day is fast approaching that when we talk about good jobs, we will be talking about jobs where girls and boys will speak Irish and English and will have a knowledge of German, Spanish and French.  As far as jobs in the EEC will be concerned no person will be refused a job because they have not got Irish but people will be given an extra incentive if they have Irish. All job-conscious people know that anybody with a knowledge of French, German, English and Irish can be practically assured of jobs with perhaps higher salaries than the salaries of Dáil Deputies.  In the Gaeltacht areas we should teach through the medium of Irish but we must give a lot more thought to languages such as German, French and Spanish.</P>
    <P>I represent the largest Gaeltacht in the country and I do not speak fluent Irish.  Looking back at history we realise that some of the people from Border counties who were educated in Northern Ireland did not get a knowledge of Irish.  It does not make a person any less an Irishman if he has not a fluent knowledge of Irish.  We have two traditions, and nobody can say that one tradition is more Irish than the other because these traditions go back hundreds of years.  The people I condemn most are the people who try to prove that they are more Irish than we, the people who probably were not even born here, the people who daub the road signs because they are bi-lingual road sings.  The Gaeltacht areas need the tourist industry more than any other part of the country. The people in the Gaeltacht areas should see that this type of sign-daubing is stopped.  Foreigners visiting this country expect and deserve to have <Col N="1041" /> bi-lingual signs in the Gaeltacht areas. There is no doubt that we have warmth and friendliness and that great hospitality is shown in these areas.</P>

      <P>Níl aon rud os comhair na Dála ach bunú Bord na Gaeilge.  The only thing before the Dáil is the establishment of a board. The Deputy is wandering a bit into generalities, and if we allow the debate to follow those lines we could lose complete control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>All this comes back to the type of Irish language we would like to foster.  I wish to refer not to just the Irish language but Irish music, traditions, dancing and the Irish culture generally.  There is no doubt that most of us love the Irish culture and traditions and the Minister is probably more attuned to Irish music than many in the House.  When we come to the home of Irish music, Doolin in County Clare, we find that the majority of people there travelled probably half the length of the world to be there in the atmosphere and the tradition of the great Irish Gaeltacht night.</P>
      <P>I welcome this new Bill which has tremendous possibilities.  I know the problems involved.  What we need at present is a new approach whereby the people will feel Irish and will be encouraged to speak Irish so as not to end up like me, representing the biggest Gaeltacht without the fluency in Irish that I would like to have.  I wish the Minister the best of luck in his new portfolio.  The Minister is a man from the Gaeltacht who understands the problems and I have no doubt that he will do a first class job.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil an Bille seo os comhair na Dála agus cé go mba mhaith liom caint as Gaeilge ar an mBille, níl dóthain Gaeilge agam chun é sin a dhéanamh.  Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Teachta O'Toole aréir.  Thosnaigh sé ag caint go mall agus tar éis tamaill bhig bhí sé ag stealladh Gaeilge go han-líofa ar fad.  Rinne sé óráid thar barr agus ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta. This as we all know is a straightforward Bill merely consolidating the <i>ad</i><Col N="1042" /><i>hoc</i> position of the board which was operating for some time and was set up by the previous Minister.  We are now giving the board statutory authority.</P>
      <P>My experience of the setting up of this kind of board is that the first three or four years are spent on the administrative structures, the status of the various staff and interminable inter-departmental delays in deciding what status the head of the board will have, what will be his position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Civil Service and so on. I hope all these difficulties have been ironed out so that the board can get on with the business it is intended to do, that is, to encourage and promote the Irish language.  In my experience as a member of the Executive of the National Road Safety Association such matters delayed the business of the board far too much.  If the civil servants and various Departments responsible can only cut out the red tape and get on with making decisions rapidly it would be a great help to the board.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the Minister's remarks when he said:</P>
      <P> Under language development schemes six areas have been selected where the aim is to extend the use of Irish in various aspects of everyday life. . . . </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He mentions, amongst those six areas, Scoil Lorcáin in the Monkstown area of County Dublin.  I should like to refer him to south County Dublin, to the Ballinteer area where we have an Irish school, Scoil Naithí, set up some years ago under great difficulty when Irish speakers in the district persisted. As a result we have a school that stands second to none in dedication to and encouragement in the Irish language.  I would ask the board&mdash;who will be independent of the Minister&mdash; to consider extending the scheme, or setting up a similar one in south County Dublin, in the Dundrum-Ballinteer area in particular where we have a very active Irish community, one which is far from being&mdash;as was mentioned by Deputy O'Toole yesterday&mdash;fanatical about the Irish language.  They are people who, like myself, are not terribly fluent in the <Col N="1043" /> language because they have not had an opportunity of using it as frequently as they would like but where there is the nucleus of encouragement for the language.  There is the will in south County Dublin, in the Dundrum-Ballinteer area in particular, I might say, perhaps more so than in the Monkstown, County Dublin area.  I fail to understand how the board arrived at Monkstown, County Dublin, as a pilot area for a scheme of this nature.  Ceoltas Ceoltoirí Éireann are in Monkstown and perhaps that was the basis for that decision.  I would respectfully suggest that the Minister consider an additional scheme in south County Dublin where it would be welcomed.  There is no doubt about that.  The goodwill is there in abundance.  Scoil Naithí held a function recently to which they invited Ceoltas Ceoltoirí Éireann musicians, when the house was packed.  This is a way in which we can encourage the language.  Certainly the people in Scoil Naithí go out of their way to meet people and bring in people who have not a word of Irish.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to section 12 subsection (1) (a) of the Bill which deals with the question of membership of the Oireachtas of employees of the Board and which says:</P>
    <P> Where a member of the staff of the Board is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann or for election to either House of the Oireachtas he shall stand seconded from employment by the Board and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from, the Board any remuneration or allowance&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) in case he is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, in respect of the period commencing on his acceptance of the nomination and ending when he ceases to be a member of that House, </P>
    <P>While I have no particular objection to subsection (b), which is the norm anyway&mdash;that one takes leave of absence from the semi-State body&mdash;I am not privy to what is the salary scale of the full-time members of the board but I do feel this is setting an unusual precedent.  I am open to correction <Col N="1044" /> on that.  A member of a semi-State body, or of this particular board, who may have a salary of £6,000, who seeks nomination to the Seanad, who is elected to the Seanad and then has to forego his salary from the semi-State body leaves him with a salary of approximately £3,200 or whatever. Probably he would be an individual who had spent all of his life in the civil service, in the administrative area, and who was very highly qualified in that area.  He will not be able to live and meet his commitments on £3,200 or whatever is the Seanad salary, which seems to me to be rather unfair.  Therefore, in most semi-State bodies, if a person is elected to the Seanad he can get a day's leave of absence on the days the Seanad is sitting.  But, in the event of his being elected to the Dáil, he must either resign or take leave of absence.  I would ask the Minister to take another look at that subsection, which seems to me to lay down quite unfortunate conditions.</P>
    <P>Sometimes in this House we have a very narrow vision of what it takes to run an operation such as this.  I hope the membership of the executive committee will be representative of the widest possible spectrum of interests, with interest in the Irish language, in Gaeltacht areas and so on. I do not envy the Minister his job when it comes to selecting the members of that executive committee because there are so many genuine organisations that should be represented. However, I know the Minister, in his wisdom, will do the correct thing.  I would say to those people who find themselves not represented to be patient, that really what is happening in the setting up of this board is in the interests of the Irish language in general.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the Dublin area outside of my constituency.  I should like to refer to the number of Irish schools and avail of this opportunity of paying tribute to the teachers in them.  I refer especially to Scoil Nathaí, Scoil Bhríde in Ranelagh, Scoil Lorcáin in Monkstown and Coláiste Mhuire, old established schools under the Christian Brothers. <Col N="1045" /> They were the vanguard who stood for and with the language in good times and bad and encouraged its use.  Parents who send their children to these schools, while they have sympathy for the language, also recognise the low-pupil-teacher ratio.  There is the problem that the children who go to these schools have free bus passes to the nearest school to them and, if they choose to go to another school, they no longer have bus passes.  For instance, parents living in Marley Grange who want to send a child to Coláiste Mhuire find that the child does not qualify for a free pass because Scoil Nathaí is nearer.  I think that is unreasonable.  I know this does not come under the Minister's bailiwick. It is part and parcel of the Department of Education but, if we are really serious about encouraging these schools and the language, this kind of petty bureaucracy should be wiped out. There should be flexibility.  Anything else is ridiculous.  Quite a number of people have mentioned this anomaly to me.  It certainly does not help anyone, much less the revival of the language. I would urge the Minister to consult with the Department of Education in an effort to find some satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>Referring back to the attitude of Irish teachers in national schools in the Dublin area, I know they have tremendous tolerance.  They recognise the limitations on their pupils.  There is no element of fanaticism.  Deputy O'Toole referred to the fanatics and the purists.  We need the purists.  We should remember that there are many fanatics who are trying to bring about the downfall of the language.  In fact, that is one way in which to help the language.  It is pleasing to hear Deputies speak so favourably about the language. We would all like to see a more gradual use of the language.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this board could bring pressure on the different agencies to encourage the use of the language as Liam O Murchu has done in &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom&rdquo;.  That programme has remained very high in the TAM ratings. In fact on one occasion it surpassed &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  I cannot understand why RTE decided, <Col N="1046" /> in its wisdom or otherwise, to drop the programme.  I know it does not cost a great deal to make.  In fact the cost is minimal compared with other programmes.  &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom&rdquo; has revived interest in the language. Children are interested in the programme.  It is a mix of everything. Perhaps this board might be able to consult with RTE to see if there is any way in which it could help, because it is through this kind of programme we can bring about a greater understanding and appreciation of the language.</P>
    <P>Many people, particularly in urban areas like Galway, Cork and Limerick, would like to avail of the summer courses for their children.  Unfortunately costs have escalated and some parents cannot finance their children's trips to these schools in the Gaeltacht during the summer months.  There are limits on the resources of the State, on the Department of the Gaeltacht and there will probably be limits on this new board, but the board might consider asking some of the more successful companies to sponsor scholarships to the Gaeltacht so that children in the lower income groups would be enabled to avail of these scholarships in order to visit the Gaeltacht.  It might be useful to fund young people who want to avail of the Gaeltacht summer courses.</P>
    <P>Many of the Gaeltacht courses are successful and more young people are putting pressure on their parents to make the outlay so that they can attend them.  There is the danger that when they do get down to the Gaeltacht they speak more English than Irish as there is not sufficient supervision.  This wastes their parents' money and the State's subvention and should not be allowed.  It is not necessary to go to the Gaeltacht areas of Kerry, Donegal and Connemara as we have a summer camp within 20 or 30 miles of the city which is rigidly supervised.  If the children who attended the camp did not speak Irish they were promptly put on a train and sent home.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.  I am more than delighted at the unanimous approval <Col N="1047" /> which it has received.  It is encouraging to see that while we have political disagreements we have none in regard to the Irish language.</P>

      <P>Mar mhalairt ar an scéal níl i gcás agam féin aon fháilte iomlán a chur roimh an mBille seo; níl i gcás agam ach fáilte theoranta a chur roimhe.  Is cuimhin liom anois thart ar 30 bliain ó bhí mé im' bhuachaill scoile, agus gach re cúpla bliain bhíodh scéim nua dá bhaisteadh ag pé Rialtas a bhí i réim.  Cuireadh ar chuile thaobh &ldquo;fáilte Uí Cheallaigh&rdquo;, mar adéarfá, roimh pé scéim a bhí i gceist ag an am sin.  Bíonn na páipéir bhochta Gaeilge ag scríobhadh agus ag rá go bhfuil ré nua in ann don Ghaeilge toisc an scéime nua seo, toisc an Bhille nua siúd, toisc an udaráis nua atá dhá chruthú.  Ná ceapaimís sa Teach seo inniu go bhfuil scéim íontach, éachtach nua dá bhaisteadh againn inniu, ná go bhfuil scéim faoi bhráid na Dála inniu go n-éireoidh níos fearr léi ná mar a d'éirigh lena lán eile le mo linn féin, gan trácht ar na scéimeanna a d'imigh roimhe sin.</P>
      <P>Thagair an tAire agus é ag caint inné do chúpla ceann díobh, agus dar liom féin go mb'fhearr dó iad a fhágáil as an scéal ar fad, fanacht ina thost níos túisce ná bheith ag cur i gcuimhne do dhaoine go raibh a leithéid ann mar an Páipéar Bán 1965. Is cuimhin liom maith go leor é.  Sin an páipéar gur ar éigin go raibh tada ann seachas &ldquo;gríosófar&rdquo; seo agus &ldquo;gríosófar&rdquo; siúd.  Bhí an Rialtas ag an am ag dul ag &ldquo;gríosadh&rdquo; na Ranna Stáit a bhí faoina chúram, ag dul ag &ldquo;gríosadh&rdquo; na n-údarás leath-státúla. Ní raibh sé i gcás acu breis Gaeilge a labhairt iad féin&mdash;ní raibh sé sin i gcás acu ar chor ar bith; ach bhí siad ag dul ag &ldquo;gríosadh&rdquo; Ranna Stáit, na státsheirbhísigh a bhí gan chosaint i gcoinne a leithéid, le tuilleadh Gaelige a labhairt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roimhe sin féin bhí an t-iar-Aire, Caoimhghín Ó Beoláin.  Is cuimhin liom an t-am go raibh sé ina Aire Cosanta.  Ní raibh sé i gcás aige siúd an tír a chosaint ar chor ar bith.  Ní raibh sé i gcás aige ach an tArm a Ghaelú&mdash;ach oiread leis an am a raibh <Col N="1048" /> sé ag dul an córas votála a Shasanú. Sin an dá éacht is mó&mdash;seachas gur éirigh sé féin as oifig&mdash;a rinne Caoimhghín Ó Beoláin agus é sa bpolaitíocht.  Bhí sé ag dul an tArm a Ghaelú, agus ní raibh toradh ar fiú trácht air ar an saothar sin; agus bhí sé ag dul an córas vótála a Shasanú, agus tá fhios againn go léir cé mar a d'éirigh leis an iarracht sin.</P>
    <P>I 1965, faoi mar adúirt an tAire inné, bhí an Páipéar Bán againn agus ní raibh sa bpáipéar seo ach a lán &ldquo;gríosadh&rdquo;.  Níor labhair Aire Rialtais ná duine a bhí istigh sa Dáil seo oiread agus focal breise Gaeilge toisc an Páipéar Bán sin.  Cúpla bliain ina dhiaidh bhí leabhar mór millteach eile dá fhoilsiú ag Rialtas Fhianna Fáil, &ldquo;Feidhmiú Polasaí Teanga&rdquo;.  B'shin i 1969.  Rinne an tAire tagairt don pholasaí sin chomh maith agus é ag labhairt anseo inné.  Is cuimhin liomsa an leabhar millteach mór céanna, agus ach oiread leis an bPáipéar Bán ní raibh ann ach &ldquo;gríosadh&rdquo;.  Ní raibh i &ldquo;Feidhmiú Polasaí Teanga&rdquo; i 1969 ach a lán téarmaí socheolaíochta nár chuala fiú amháin Béarlóirí trácht orthu ariamh, gan trácht ar bith ar na daoine bochta thiar sa Ghaeltacht.  Bhí difríocht le feiceáil don chéad uair riamh idir &ldquo;bilingualism&rdquo; agus &ldquo;diglossia&rdquo;.  Dá mbeadh an t-anam le sábháil agam, ní fhéadfainn a rá inniu féin cén difríocht atá idir &ldquo;diglossia&rdquo; agus &ldquo;bilingualism&rdquo;. Ach seo an bonn ar a raibh an Ghaeilge le sábháil ag an am sin.</P>
    <P>Sin an ráiméis a bhí dá thairiscint don Teach seo agus don tír, agus airgead maith poiblí á chaitheamh air. Sin an méid a bhí mar pholasaí ag an Rialtas ag an am; agus tá sé de dhánacht ag an Aire anseo teacht isteach sa Teach seo agus am a chur amú ag cur síos ar &ldquo;Feidhmiú Polasaí Teanga&rdquo;.  Cén trácht a chualathas ó shin i leith ar &ldquo;Feidhmiú Polasaí Teanga&rdquo;, gan trácht ar chor ar bith ar an bPáipéar Bán?  Cén trácht atá le cloisint inniu ar &ldquo;diglossia&rdquo; nó &ldquo;bilingualism&rdquo; nó ar rud ar bith eile a bhí istigh sa leabhrán sin, &ldquo;Feidhmiú Polasaí Teanga&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Fágaimís <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht</i> amach as an scéal ar fad.  Leabhar millteach mór eile a bhí ansin.  Bhí <Col N="1049" /> fáiltiú oifigiúil ann, bia agus deoch dá dtairgeadh do na daoine.  Cén gníomh a rinneadh don Ghaeltacht, seachas gnáthobair Roinn na Gaeltachta agus gnáthobair Ghaeltarra Éireann?  An ndearnadh oiread agus rud ar bith go dtí seo, rud ar bith a bhí molta go háithrid ins an gcóras sin <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht</i>, seachas gnáthobair Ghaeltarra Éireann agus Roinn na Gaeltachta agus mar sin de?  Ní dóigh liom go ndearnadh.</P>
    <P>Ar éigin a bhí mé in ann creidiúint a thabhairt do mo shúile, mar adeirtear as Béarla, nuair a chonaic mé in óráid an Aire inné tagairt don &ldquo;taighde&rdquo; a rinne an tUasal Ó Colla, nó ar chuir sé ar siúl i 1970.  &ldquo;Taighde Uí Cholla&rdquo;&mdash;tá fuaim leis an abairt a chuireann i gcuimhne dom &ldquo;fáilte Uí Cheallaigh&rdquo; agus a lán den tsórt&mdash;&ldquo;Taighde Uí Cholla is a dhá shúil dúnta&rdquo;&mdash;ba chóir dúinn seanfhocal a dhéanamh as an méid sin.  B'ionann liomsa &ldquo;taighde Uí Cholla&rdquo; agus taighde a bhíonn dá chur ar siúl ag duine ar chuma leis ar fad pé toradh a bheidh ar an taighde chéanna.  Ar chualathas a leithéid de ráiméis sa tír seo ariamh ná an taighde úd? Do thug sé cuireadh do bheanuasal ó Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, teacht abhus d'fonn a fháil amach an &ldquo;dearcadh&rdquo; a bhí ag an bpobal i leith na teanga Gaeilge.  Chaith sé thart ar £½ mhilliún ar an scéim amaideach úd sin.  Sin an cineál Rialtais a bhí againn ag an am sin, agus atá againn arís inniu.</P>
    <P>Go dtí seo níl fhios agam an ndearnadh tagairt ar bith sa díospóireacht seo don ghníomh is fearr agus is mó dá ndearnadh riamh don Ghaeilge le leath-chéad bliain.  Ba é sin an Ghaeilge a dhéanamh neamhéigeantach sna scoileanna.  Níor thagair mo chara ón Dáilcheantar chéanna do sin chor ar bith inniu agus é ag caint.</P>
    <P>Bhí &ldquo;taighde Uí Cholla&rdquo; á dhéanamh ocht mbliana ó shin, agus do caitheadh £½ mhilliúin ar an taighde d'fhonn a fháil amach rud a d'inseodh páiste scoile don Rialtas saor in aisce, gan pingin rua a iarradh orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios againn cén dearcadh atá ag an bpobal i leith na Gaeilge. Cinnte tá cineál comhbá agus cineál grá ag an bpobal don Ghaeilge, ach <Col N="1050" /> stopann sé roimh an bpointe ar a dtosódh an pobal sin á labhairt.  Sin an deacracht atá ann, agus tá fhios agam na cúiseanna.  Tá an teanga seo an-chrua ar fad.  Sin rud nach n-admhódh a lán daoine.  Is féidir le páistí scoile anseo in Éirinn rud a dhéanamh nach ndéanann páistí scoile in aon tír eile san Eoraip&mdash;dhá bhliain déag a chaitheamh ag foghlaim teanga sa scoil, agus gan a bheith in ann i ndiaidh an ama sin ar fad abairt chruinn cheart Ghaeilge a labhairt, gan a bheith in ann fiú amháin cúpán tae a fháil in ostán trí Ghaeilge tar éis an oiread sin ama a bheith caite amú aige, in a d'fhéadfadh sé Fraincís nó Gearmáinis a fhoghlaim nó rud éigin eile a bheadh úsáideach dó.  Ach taréis dhá bhliain déag den chrá croí sin ní féidir leis abairt chruinn cheart Ghaeilge a labhairt.</P>
    <P>Ní h-iad na múinteoirí is ciontach faoi sin, agus ní hiad an Rialtas atá ciontach faoi sin, nó ní chuirim an lucht iomlán orthu.  Is é is mó is ciontach faoi sin, dar liomsa, ná gur teanga an-chrua ar fad í an Ghaeilge, agus tá sé in am dúinn é sin a admháil, agus gan a bheith ag cur i gcéill gur féidir le duine crash course a dhéanamh agus Gaeilge a bheith ar a thoil aige i gceann cupla seachtaine. Ní féidir é sin a dhéanamh.  Níl fhios agam an bhfuil oiread agus duine ar bith sa tír seo a tógadh le Béarla, agus nár chaith blianta fada sa Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil Gaeilge ar a thoil aige chomh maith is atá an Béarla.</P>
    <P>Sin difríocht an-mhór ar fad idir an teanga a bhfuil muidne ag dul a sábháil agus teangacha ar bith eile a bhíonn dá dteagasc sna scoileanna.  Is baolach liomsa nach bhfuilimid ach ag útamáil leis an gceist nó leis an bhfadhb.  Cinnte thiocfadh linn an cheist a chaitheamh amach as an bhfuinneog ar fad, gan a bheith ag ligint orainn agus ag cur i gcéill a thuilleadh go bhfuil iarracht dáiríre á dhéanamh againn chor ar bith leis an teanga a shábháil.  Ach má táimid chun í a shábháil nílimid ach ag tincéireacht leis an cheist sin le Bille dá leithéid seo.</P>
    <P>Tá sé leathanach sa Bhille.  Ó alt a 4 anuas níl sa Bhille ach gná <Col N="1051" /> fhorálacha a bhíonn i ngach Bille dá shórt ina mbíonn bord reachtúil dá bhunú.  Níl tada nua sa Bhille seo, nó is beag a bhfuil nua ann seachas na feidhmeanna agus na cumhachtaí a luaitear in alt a 3.  Ach nuair a léim alt a 3 feicim go mbeidh &ldquo;feidhmeanna ginearálta&rdquo; ag an mBord a bheidh &ldquo;faoi réir aon Aire Rialtais a bheith freagrach i ngné áirithe bheartais i ndáil leis an nGaeilge&rdquo;.  Is ionann sin agus a rá nach mbeidh smacht ceart ag an mBord seo ar ghné ar bith muna dtoilíonn pé Aire atá freagrach ar ghné áirithe den pholasaí i leith na Gaeilge go gcuirfidh an Bord a ladar isteach sa scéal.</P>
    <P>Níl smacht ag an mBord ar an oideachas.  Níl smacht ag an mBord ar an Ghaeltacht ná ar shaol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta.  Níl smacht ná tionchar ag an mBord ar RTE, ná ar na húdaráis áitiúla ná ar an &ldquo;gcomhshaol&rdquo;, má tá a leithéid d'fhocal ann.</P>
    <P>Nach amaideach dúinn bheith ag dul ag bunú bord chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, go háirithe mar theanga bheo, gan smacht ag an mBord seo ar an gcóras oideachais nó gan tionchar a bheith ag an mBord ar an chaoi ina mbíonn an Ghaeilge dá teagasc sna scoileanna?</P>
    <P>Tá clann agamsa agus, cosúil le daoine eile, tá an chlann sin ag freastal ar an scoil agus tá Gaeilge á foghlaim acu.  Tá maicín agamsa sa bhaile atá ag dul isteach ar an scrúdú meánteistiméireachta i mbliana.  Nuair a fheicim an crá croí a bhíonn dá fhulaingt ag an maicín sin, gan oiread agus puinn smachta a bheith ag an mBord ar an gcóras oideachais, fiafraím díom féin, céard tá ar siúl anseo againn in aon chor?  An cur i gcéill ar fad atá ar siúl againn inniu agus inné?</P>
    <P>Ní tharlaíonn sé go minic, ach ó am go céile tagainn an maicín sin chugamsa, agus iarrann sé orm cabhair lena chuid filíochta agus lena chuid próis a aistriú go Béarla.  Níl an lad seo ach 14 bliana d'aois go fóill.  Ní féidir leis Gaeilge cheart a labhairt ná abairtí simplí a labhairt go fóill.  Ar éigin más féidir leis fiú amháin cupán tae a fháil dó féin as Gaeilge, ach bíonn dríodar mar &ldquo;Ceo draíochta i gcoim oíche do <Col N="1052" /> sheol mé&rdquo; le foghlaim aige.  Cuirim &ldquo;dríodar&rdquo; ar an bhfilíocht sin, ní ó thaobh filíochta de, ach is dríodar é don mhaicín sin.  Bíonn dosaen nó scór focail i ngach aon bhéarsa don dán sin, gan trácht ar an maicín atá agam sa bhaile, nach féidir le fiú amháin duine as Chonamara a thuiscint. Ní haon locht é sin ar an dán sin mar fhilíocht, ach locht ar an chóras oideachais.  Níl ann ach crá croí do na micléinn agus, chun an fhírinne a rá, ní dóigh liom ach gur ionann an scéal ó thaobh na múinteoirí de.  Dá mba mhuinteoir mé féin ní fhéadfainn an dán sin a mhíniú don rang gan a lán staidéir a bheith déanta agam roimh ré agus an méid sin do chuile dán dá mbíonn le foghlaim acu.  &ldquo;Ceo draíochta i gcoir oíche do sheol mé&rdquo;, agus níl an buachaill in ann fiú amháin, páipéir nuachtán a cheannach.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis i nGaeilge sa scrúdú meánteistiméireachta agus más féidir leis cúpla céad des na focail crua sa dán sin a chur de ghlan mheabhair éireoidh leis, le cúnamh Dé.  Ach níl aon chiall ag baint leis ó thaobh oideachais, beag nó mór.</P>
    <P>Leis an bprós, níl an scéal éagsúil. Tá gearrscéal le foghlaim ag an laidín bocht, gearrscéal le Niall Ó Domhnaill, agus caithfidh mé a admháil gur an-álainn agus gur an-bhreá an gearrscéal é agus go gcorródh sé an croí ionnat&mdash;&ldquo;Nead na Riabhóige&rdquo;.  Ach tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil, ar a laghad, céad focail san úrscéal sin nach dtuigtear taobh amuigh den pharóiste nó den chontae in ar tógadh Niall Ó Domhnaill.  Cén chiall atá ag baint le sin, bheith ag dul ag múineadh focail mar sin nach tuigtear i gConamara nó i gCiarraí nó in áit ar bith seachas an áit in ar tógadh an t-údar do lad óg as Baile Átha Cliath ar éigin a bhfuil ar a chumas aige béile bia in óstán a fháil dó féin as Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Muna mbíonn ar chumas an Bhoird nua seo smacht éigin a bheith ar an gcóras oideachais agus réasún éigin a thabhairt isteach sa gcóras oideachais ó thaobh teagasc na Gaeilge de, is fánach againn bheith ag útamáil le bord mar seo nó le bord ar bith eile, nó le údarás nó le taighde nó le <Col N="1053" /> tuarascáil nó ué ráiméis eile atá feicthe againn sa Teach seo agus sa tír tré chéile le leath-chéad blian anuas.</P>
    <P>Is ar na scoileanna agus ar na scoláirí óga is mó atáimid ag brath leis an Ghaeilge a shábháil, gan trácht ar a leathadh amach.  Ach féach an timpeallacht atá thart ar na scoláirí óg faoi láthair, agus níl mé ag trácht ar thimpeallacht na scoile ach an timpeallacht amuigh ar an tsráid.  Má fhéachann tú ar an timpeallacht sin go cruinn mar dhuine fásta, caithfidh tú a admháil gurb é an tuairim a thabharfadh sé do dhuine óg ná gur cuma sa diabhal an Ghaeilge ní amháin leis an saol mhór, ach leis na húdaráis is mó agus is túisce ba chóir í a bheith mar chúram acu.</P>
    <P>Féach fiú amháin na leabhair scoile. Is cuimhin liom an uair a tháinig &ldquo;Litriú na Gaeilge&rdquo; amach, i 1948, tá mé ag ceapadh.  Seo an chóip a cheannaigh mé féin agus bhí sé mar fháinne geal an lae dhom, beagán réasúin, beagán caighdéain, beagán cruinnis sa Ghaeilge, a fheiceáil sa rud nach raibh ach praiseach ann, dar liom féin, roimhe sin.  &ldquo;Litriú na Gaeilge&rdquo; agus, ina dhiaidh sin, &ldquo;Gramadach na Gaeilge&rdquo;; agus ba mhaith liom traoslú le Rannóg an Aistriúcháin a rinne sár-obair le blianta fada anuas, sár-obair gur cuma sa diabhal le Rialtas ar bith sa tír seo í, chun caighdeán agus chun réasún de chineál ar bith a thabhairt isteach do scríobhadh na teanga seo.</P>
    <P>Tá caighdeán oifigiúil againn le 30 bliain anuas ach féach an leabhar scoile a fuair mé ó mo mhaicín inniu. Ar an taobh seo tá scríobhtha &ldquo;Páipéar scrúduithe&rdquo; agus ar an dtaobh chúl: &ldquo;Is mian linn ár mbuíochas a ghabháil le Ceannasaí Oifig an tSoláthair as ucht cead a thabhairt dúinn cóipeanna a dhéanamh de na páipéir scrúdaithe atá sa leabhar seo.&rdquo;  Sa chéad áit an focal mar &ldquo;scrúduithe&rdquo; agus sa dara háit mar &ldquo;scrúdaithe&rdquo;. Pé acu atá ceart?  An bhfuil fhios ag an Aire?  An bhfuil fhios ag a lucht comhairle? Ní dóigh liom é.  Nuair a tháinig an caighdeán oifigiúil amach bhí fhios ag an domhan cé acu a bhí ceart ach tá sé dearmadtha anois.  Níl mé ag gearán faoi botún chló.  Ní botún cló <Col N="1054" /> atá i gceist anseo, ach gur cuma sa diabhal ag pé duine atá i gcúram foilsithe an leabhair seo cad tá scríobhtha ar an leabhar.  Dá mba chás leis é, ní bheadh a leithéid de bhotún ann.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Meán-Teist&rdquo;&mdash;an bhfuil an focal sin le fáil i bhfoclóir Dineen nó i bhfoclóir ar bith eile?  Cad is brí le &ldquo;Meán-Teist&rdquo;?  An bhfuil focal Gaeilge &ldquo;Teist&rdquo; ann gur ionann le &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; é?  Tá an focal &ldquo;Teist&rdquo; ann ceart go leor, ach ní dóigh liom go gciallaíonn &ldquo;Meán-Teist&rdquo;, &ldquo;Intermediate Certificate&rdquo;.  Sin botún amaideach, agus ní cóir a leithéid a bheith ar chlúdach leabhair mar sin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a fheiceann laidín stuama a leithéid bíonn iontas air ar dtús, ach tar éis tamaill tagann gruaim ar a chroí agus dímheas, ní amháin don teanga ach don saol atá fite fuaite leis an teanga agus an saol polaitíochta chomh maith in a gceaptar gur Gaeil níos fearr muid ná an lucht atá gan Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá leabhar eile agam anseo agus sílim nach bhfuil sé ar eolas ag an gComhlucht Oideachais cé chaoi a litrítear &ldquo;comhlucht&rdquo; i gceart de réir an chaighdeáin.  Níl fhios fiú amháin ag an gcomhlucht seo cad a chiallaíonn an focal &ldquo;comhlucht&rdquo; agus cén chaoi é a litriú.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfadh an tAire a rá nach bhfuil sna pointí sin ach pointí pedainteacha. Mura mbeadh ann ach sin ní chuirfinn am an Tí amú lena leithéid, ach tá sin le feiceáil mórán chuile áit sa tír seo.  Ní botúin litrithe amháin atá i gceist, ach gur comhartha iad gur cuma leis na húdaráis pé cruth atá ar an teanga.  Mar a dúirt mé go minic as Béarla, is é an dearcadh atá ar na húdaráis ná, &ldquo;if it is Irish that is wanted any old rubbish will do&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Má théann an buachaill óg amach ar na sráideanna, rud nach féidir leis a sheacaint, feiceann sé comharthaí sráide, na plátaí iarainn atá greamaithe do na ballaí agus ainm na sráide orthu.  Tá mé ag rá i ndáiríre go bhfuil níos mó ná 50 faoin gcéad de na comharthaí sráide sin lochtach ó thaobh Gaeilge de.  Tá cuid acu comh lochtach sin go bhfuil sé cinnte nár leag oifigeach nó feidhmeannach <Col N="1055" /> ar bith súil orthu tar éis iad a bheith péinteáilte: &ldquo;Fire it out and fit it up, any old slobber will do&rdquo;.  Mura mbeadh ann ach sin, cosnaoínn sé airgead.  Má táimíd chun comharthaí bhóthar Ghaeilge a bheith againn, ba chóir iad bheith ceart, agus mura bhfuil fúinn ach ráiméis atá in ainm a bheith mar Ghaeilge a chur suas mar ainm sráide, b'fhearr dúinn an t-airgead a spáráil dúinn féin agus gan é a chur amú.  Sin é an timpeallacht Gaeilge.  Dá gcaithfeadh duine ón taobh seo den Teach anuas ar an chineál ráiméis sin, sé an freagra a gheobhfadh sé ón taobh eile ná &ldquo;Sure you are not an Irishman at all; sure you do not want the Irish at all&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is cás linn an Ghaeilge ach teastaíonn uainn go mbeadh beagán measa ag an Rialtas, ag na daoine atá i gcúram na ceiste seo, ar an teanga, an rud atá ina gcúram.  Is cuimhin liom roinnt blianta ó shin go raibh páipéar litreach, notepaper, ag an Roinn Oideachais&mdash;ag an Roinn Oideachais, murar miste leat&mdash;agus sé a bhí clóbhuailte ar an bpáipéar sin ná ráiméis, agus d'fhéadfadh Béarlóir fháil amach gurbh é a bhí i gceist ag an duine a chum agus a chuir an ráiméis sin i gcló ná &ldquo;Any reply should be sent to the Secretary&rdquo;.  Sin an rud a bhí i gceist aige; ach sé an chiall is túisce a d'fhéadfadh Gaeilgeoir a fháil as an bpraiseach a bhí clóite ná &ldquo;It would be a crime to send a bird-reply to the Secretary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Baintear marcanna ó scoláirí mar gheall air séimhithe nó síníthe a fhágáil amach ó aiste, ach tar éis iad bheith ina stát seirbhísí nó ina nAirí féin, is cuma leo sa diabhal síníthe nó séimhithe nó rud ar bith eile seachas beagáinín slabar a fhoilsiú agus dallamullóg a chur ar na daoine.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil rud ar bith eile atá ann seachas snámh in aghaidh easa do na múinteoirí agus do Ghaelgóirí bheith ag iarraidh an taoide a chur siar, mar adúirt duine éigin níos luaithe.  Ní ach ag snámh in aghaidh easa atá siad má bhíonn orthu coimhlint agus troid in aghaidh rudaí mar sin ó thaobh an Rialtais agus ón taobh oifigiúil.  B'fhearr dóibh éirí as an iarracht agus a saoil a chaitheamh <Col N="1056" /> ar rudaí a bheadh fiúntach ar bhealach éigin eile.  Is fuath liom é sin.  B'fhearr liom gan focal amháin Gaeilge bheith agam riamh dá mb'éigean dom dallamullóg dá leithéid a chur ar na daoine.</P>
    <P>Failtím go teoranta roimh an mBille.  Níl locht le fáil agam ar an mBord seo.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh siad obair fiúntach.  Feicimíd é sin de réir a saothair.  Ní maith liom an Bord seo a dhamnáil roimh ré, ach mar adúirt mé cúpla uair roimhe seo, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon bhealach eile leis an Ghaeilge a shábháil nó a chur chun cinn seachas comhluadar nua Ghaeltachta a bhunú as an nua.  Is trua liom é sin a rá, ach tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil an misneach beagnach imithe as na Gaeltachtaí atá ann faoi láthair.  Tá fhios agam go maith go séanfadh an tAire an méid sin&mdash; níl an dara rogha aige ach an méid sin a shéanadh.  Ar aon nós, tá an misneach beagnach imithe uathu, agus ní i dtaobh easba eacnamaiochta, tá siad i bhfad níos fearr ó thaobh monarchana agus obair, agus tá airgead i bhfad níos fairsinge ins an Ghaeltacht anois seachas mar a bhí deich nó 20 bliain ó shin.  Ach ó thaobh labhairt na Ghaeilge agus a gcroí bheith fite fuaite leis an Ghaeilge agus leis an saol a bhaineann léi, tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil a misneach caillte, go bhfuil an saol Béarla ag brú isteach orthu, agus nach féidir le hiarrachtaí atá déanta ag an Roinn seo nó an Roinn siúd, nó an t-údarás seo nó an scéim siúd, an saol sin a chasadh siar.  Ach dá b'fhéadfaí an spiorad comharchumannach a úsáid i gcúrsaí dá leithéid, nó comhluadar nua a bhunú, b'fhéidir an láithreán nua cúpla míle acra, talamh mar sin a cheannach ar shlí ar bith agus é a fheabhsú agus a leasú, agus comhluadar nua a mhealladh isteach ins an láithreán sin ó chuile áird den tír, comhluadar a bheadh comhaonta, daoine díograiseacha chun comharsanacht nua a bhunú, b'fhéidir go mbeadh toradh suimiúil ar an iarracht sin.</P>
    <P>Dá gcaithfí airgead ar scéim mar sin, ó thaobh títhíochta, monarchana, curadóireachta, foraoiseachta agus mar sin de, mura mbeadh ann ach Gaeilgoirí díogaisacha, cúpla míle <Col N="1057" /> dóibh agus trí prionsabal an chomharchumainn a chur i gcrích acu&mdash;iad fhéin a chothú iad fhéin a chaomhnú mar comhluadar, agus spiorad a leathnú amach san tsean-Ghaeltacht, agus misneach a thabhairt ar ais atá á chailliúnt in aghaidh an lae&mdash;ní fhéadfadh iarracht mar sin nó tuairim mar sin bheith níos amaidí ná a lán iarrachtaí dá bhfacamar go nuige seo. Ach go dtí go mbeidh iarracht mar seo a mhusclódh suim an phobail, go dtí go mbeimid toilteanach airgead a chaitheamh agus b'fhéidir botúin a dhéanamh, nílimíd sa Teach seo ach ag cur i géill agus ag ligint orainn.  Seo an fáth nach gcuirim inniu ach fáilte theoranta roimh an iarracht seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KitAhern" hpid="Mrs. Ahern Mrs. Ahern">

      <P>Tá déistean agus ionadh orm tar éis éisteacht leis an Teachta Ó Ceallaigh labhairt amach chomh nimhneach faoi mar is gnáth leis a dhéanamh in ionad moltaí de shaghas éigin a dhéanamh agus ní luafaidh mé ach dhá cheann, sé sin, gur ceart Gaeltachtaí nua a bhunú agus gur ceart roinnt comharchumann a bhunú.</P>
      <P>Dúirt sé go bhfuil an teanga róchrua agus go bhfuil sí níos deacra é a fhoghlaim ná an Béarla ná an Fhraincis.  Níl sé sin fíor ach an oiread. Ó thaobh daoine áirithe tá bréag-ghalántacht ag baint le foghlaim na Fraincise. Caitfidh mé a adhmáil nach raibh aon duine sa bhunscoil liomsa nár imigh ón scoil le líofacht Gaeilge a bheith aici.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil scoláirí an lae inniu chomh éirimiúil agus bhí scoláirí na linne sin.  Buíochas le Dia nach bhfuil an dearcadh céanna ag Teachtaí eile sa Teach seo is atá ag an Teachta Kelly.  Daoine mar é ag clamhsán agus ag gearán faoin teanga a thugann ar na daoine óga cúl a thabhairt leis an teanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is mian liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille.  Mar adúirt an tAire, tá sé bhliain ann ó mholadh gur cheart Bord Gaeilge a chur ar bun.  Tá áthas orainn go léir gur ghlac an tiar-Aire, an Teachta Ó Domhnaill, leis an moladh sin.  Ach tá áthas níos mó ná sin orainn go bhfuil an tAire chun rud a dhéanamh air, agus más maith, go deimhin, is mithid rud éigin fónta a dhéanamh ar son na teangan.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh na glúnta a thiocfaidh <Col N="1058" /> in ár ndiaidh buíoch den Aire agus den Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairimse gurb é an teanga an comhartha náisiúnachais is tábhachtaí dá bhfuil againn.  Tá seanfhocal ann ag cuidiú leis a deireann: &ldquo;Tír gan anam, tír gan teanga&rdquo;.  Tá ceann eile ann a deireann rud éigin mar seo: Tír gan teanga, níl ann ach leath-thír. Tá áthas orm a fheiceáil go bhfuil breis airgid le fáil ag an mbord.  Tá breis agus dhá oiread le fáil acu.  Tá áthas orm freisin go bhfuil clár ciallmhar leagtha amach chun an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh&mdash;ag gabháil tríd na gceantar atá tofa.  Molaim an tAire as na ceantair sin a phiocadh amach.  Cur i gcás, i Mainistir na Féile.  Tá sean aithne agam ar mhuintir Mhainistir na Féile.  Bhuaigh siad Glór na nGael na blianta fada ó shin&mdash;in aimsir Éamon de Valera, is dóigh liom&mdash;agus níor staon siad ó shin ach ag obair ar son na Gaeilge, ar son ceoil agus ar son gach a bhaineann le dúchas ár dtíre. Tá áthas orm leis gur toghadh an Daingean, mar cuireann sé ionadh ar a lán daoine nuair a chloiseann siad nach bhfuil an Daingean sa Ghaeltacht. Tá súil agam anois, os rud é go bhfuil an seans acu, go n-éireoidh leo iad féin a chruthú.  Ba bhreá liom leis dá mbeadh seans ag cuid de na breacGhaeltachtaí eile an rud céanna a dhéanamh.  Caithfimid leathnú amach ón nGaeltacht.  Ní féidir falla a chur timpeall na Gaeltachta.  Is mithid go ndéanfaimis iarracht ar an nGaeltacht a leathnú.</P>
    <P>Is ciallmhar leis go bhfuil na cláracha a bheidh ar siúl sna ceantair sin bunaithe ar thuairimí muintir na gceantar, mar is ag muintir na háite is fearr a fhios cad a oireann don áit in a gcónaíonn siad.  Is maith an rud leis an plean drámaíochta mar níl gléas níos fearr chun labhairt na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn ná an drámaíocht.</P>
    <P>Is deas an cuimhne leis coistí Gaeilge a bhunú sna h-iarscoileanna, sna coláistí oiliúna agus sna h-ollscoileanna. Ó thaobh na dian chúrsaí do dhaoine fásta dhe, ní dóigh liom gur cheart iad san a choimeád sna ceantair fhorbartha.  Is dóigh liom gur ceart na cúrsaí sin a leathnú ar fud na tíre. De réir mar adúirt an Teachta Begley, <Col N="1059" /> ba cheart dul siar go dtí sean scéim na dtimirí Gaeilge&mdash;fir an rothair a rinne obair comh h-iontach sin ar son na teangan.  Ag cuimhneamh ar sin dom déarfainn gur cheart rang Gaeilge sa tseachtain a bheith ins gach sráidbhaile, mar a múinfí an teanga, filíocht, dánta, amhráin agus mar sin de.  Is dóigh liom dá ndéanfaí é sin nach fada go mbeadh toradh le feiceáil.</P>
    <P>Taobh amuigh den scéim don GAA is dóigh liom gur cheart cuimhneamh ar Mhacra na Tuaithe agus na daoine óga sin agus ar na heagraíochtaí deonacha eile nach bhfuil baint mórán acu leis an nGaeilge.  B'fhéidir go bhféadfadh an bord iad san a ghríosadh&mdash;Bantracht na Tuaithe, Muintir na Tíre agus na dreamanna eile mar iad.  D'fhéadfaidís san roinnt ama a chaitheamh leis an nGaeilge leis dá n-iarrfaí orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá scéim an-dheas gur mhaith liom a mholadh leis.  Tá sé ar siúl ag Comharchumann Íde sa bhFaing.  Is amhlaidh a chuireann siad cúrsaí samhraidh ar siúl sna sráid bhailtí mór thimpeall.  Tá sé sin an-tábhachtach, mar tá a lán daoine, mar adúirt duine éigin eile, nach acmhainn dóibh dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus b'fhéidir nuair a bheadh na daoine óga seo ag obair ar ball go dtabharfaidís aghaidh ar an nGaeltacht.  Ach is dóigh liom gur bhreá an rud dá bhféadfaimís cabhair a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a chuireann ionadh orm go minic gurb iad na scoláirí is fearr a fhaghann na scoláireachtaí chun dul ar an nGaeltacht.  Is é mo thuairim gurb iad na daoine laga go mbíonn an chabhair ag teastáil uathu.</P>
    <P>Bhí daoine ag caint mar gheall ar RTE.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil a chion déanta ag an radio ná ag an dteilifís ar son na Gaeilge.  Is beag rud a chuaigh i bhfeidhm ar mhuintir na hÉireann chomh mór is a chuaigh &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo;.  Is amhlaidh a mhúscail sé sin suim an ghnáth duine agus cuireadh in iúl don duine sin go raibh a lán Gaeilge aige.</P>
    <P>Roinnt blianta ó shin bhí sé de onóir agam Oireachtas na Gaeilge a oscailt&mdash; tá sé suas le fiche bliain anois, déarfainn. Dúirt mé an oíche sin nach raibh aon droch-Ghaeilge ann.  Mar dá olcas an Ghaeilge atá ag duine is fearr í ná <Col N="1060" /> Béarla.  Níl Béarla ró-chruinn á labhairt ag daoine agus níl éinne ag tabhairt amach faoi.  Sula bhfágann mé &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; is dóigh liom gur cheart moladh a thabhairt do na cláir eile Ghaeilge a bhíonn ar an teilifís, &ldquo;Amuigh Faoin Spéir&rdquo; ag Eamonn de Buitléir.  Cláir mhaith eile &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Radharc&rdquo;.  Ach ní dóigh liom gur féidir le h-aon cheann acu teacht suas le &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom&rdquo; chun suim an ghnath dhuine agus labhairt na Gaeilge a chothú ar leibhéal an pharóiste.</P>
    <P>So bhliain 1970 do chuir an Tánaiste, Seoirse Ó Colla, coiste ar bun chun dearcadh an phobail i leith na Gaeilge a thomhais, agus do chuir sé áthas ar gach duine sa tír seo a chlos go raibh deá-thoil don teanga go foirleathan. Tá an taighde go léir déanta anois agus an t-am chun gnímh tagtha.  B'fhéidir gurb é seo an cath deireannach ar son na Gaeilge agus ar an mbord seo agus ar chéim seo an lae inniu a bheidh bás nó beatha na teangan ag brath.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt duine éigin tá an taoide linn agus ba cheart é ghabháil ina lántsruth. Tá athbheochain na Gaeilge agus leathnú na Gaeilge ag brath go mór mhór ar na múinteoirí Gaeilge, agus ón dtaobh sin ba cheart dos na daoine atá ag dul le múinteoireacht, nuair a bhíonn siad tréanálta, Gaeilge líofa cruinn a bheith acu agus thar sin ba cheart an croi a bheith san áit cheart acu agus creideamh na Gaeilge a bheith acu mar muna mbíonn sé sin ann déanfaidh na múinteóirí sin níos mó damáiste ná maitheas don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Le fiche bliain do cuireadh an bhéim ró-mhór ar scríobh na teangan agus ar an ngramadach.  Ba cheart i rith na mblianta sin go mbeadh an bhéim ar labhairt na Gaeilge agus sin é an fáth nach bhfuil labhairt na teangan chomh leathan agus ba cheart é bheith.  Do thaispeáin &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom&rdquo; go raibh foclóir leathan Gaeilge ag gach duine faoi bhun 60 bliain ach is é an rud atá le déanamh ag Bord na Gaeilge anois ná seift a aimsiú chun an foclóir sin a úsáid.  Sin an t-éacht atá le déanamh acu agus is mór an obair í.</P>
    <P>Tuairim eile atá agam gur ceart teacht ar ghrá don teangan tríd an Bhéarla mar dhein Tomás Dáibhis agus Na hEireannaigh Óga. <Col N="1061" /> Dúirt an tAire féin gur cheart do na Teachtaí Dála deá-shampla a thabhairt, agus creidim an méid sin leis.  Ba cheart d'aon duine go bhfuil focal Gaeilge aige nó romnt Ghaeilge aige, í úsáid agus í a labhairt chomh minic agus is féidir mar is fánach a bheith ag tnúth leis na leanaí í do labhairt nuair nach dtugann na daoine fásta an deá-shampla.</P>
    <P>Bhí duine éigin ag trácht ar théacsleabhair agus sé mo thuairim go bhfuil an iomad teacsleabhair againn agus ba cheart cloí le ceann nó dhó, ceann ina bhfuil caint na ndaoine mar a bhíodh againn nuair a bhí <i>Séadna</i> mar bhonn againn agus dá mbeadh <i>Séadna</i> ag gach duine sa tír seo bheadh dóthain Ghaeilge aige i rith a shaoil.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag caint ansin faoi na ranganna Gaeilge dhearmadaigh mé a rá gur cheart iad a mheascadh leis an chaitheamh aimsire, sé sin ba cheart roinnt cheoil agus rince agus amhráin a bheith sna ranganna sin leis.  Déantear sin de ghnáth in aon áit ina mbíonn ranganna Gaeilge mar a bhíonn sna coláistí faoin nGaeltacht nó faoin nGalltacht leis.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na téacsleabhair is dóigh liom gur ceart cloí le canúint an cheantair mar má chaillimíd canúint an cheantair caillimíd a lán de shaibhreas na teangan, múnlaí agus cora cainte agus ní ceart aon tseod ná saibhreas mar sin a chailliúint.</P>
    <P>Ar an mbord seo Gaeilge tá súil agam go mbeidh roinnt ban mar is os na máithreacha a fhaghann na leanaí labhairt teanga agus is dóigh liom go dtuigfeadh na mná conas tabhairt faoi múineadh leanaí agus go mbeadh smaointí nua éigin le tabhairt acu don bhord nua.  Mar adúirt a lán daoine a bhí ag caint níl sa Bhille seo ach gléas chun an teanga bheo a chur ar fud na tíre.  Seachas na mná ba mhaith liom daoine a fheiceáil ar an mbord go bhfuil a ndáiríreacht agus a gcumas taispeánta acu agus cruthaithe acu go dtí seo, daoine go bhfuil toradh a gcuid oibre le feiceáil ina gceantair féin.  Ba cheart ár mbuíochas a ghabháil leis na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge go léir ar nós Conradh na Gaeilge, Gael-Linn, Glór na nGael agus go deimhin a lán eile ba liosta le háireamh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> Mar focal scoir, tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an mBille seo an priomh-aidhm atá mar bhun leis a aimsiú, sé sin an Ghaeilge bheo a leathnú ar fud na tíre.  Ná bíodh sé le rá ag na glúnta a thiocfaidh inár ndiaidh gur theipeamarne orthu agus nar chuireamar an teanga chucu leis an iarracht atá ar siúl againn anseo inniu.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo agus ba cheart dom a rá nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar mo mhian agam ach déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall agus ní féidir le héinne níos mó a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an mBille, bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht sa Teach seo inné agus beagáinín inniu. Tá aiféala orm nár chuala mé ráiteas an Aire ach léigh mé go cúramach é idir Bhéarla agus Ghaeilge.  Déanfaidh mé tagairt do ráiteas an Aire níos déanaí ach ba mhaith liom anois cúpla focal a rá ar an méid a chuala mé ó na Teachtaí eile.  Aontaím go hiomlán leis an méid adúirt an Teachta O'Toole maidir le phonetics agus grammatical purists.  Ba mhaith liom dul níos fuide ná sin agus a rá go bhfuil a lán de na daoine seo seanaimseartha ag múineadh an aosa óig.  Tá a lán díobhála déanta ag na daoine seo cé gur cheap siad go raibh a mhalairt á dhéanamh acu.  Chuir mé spéis sa méid adúirt an Teachta Briscoe cé gur admhaigh sé nach raibh Gaeilge ar bith aige féin ach dúirt sé go mba cheart úsáid a bhaint as an teanga.  Tá an ceart go hiomlán aige sa mhéid sin.  Is minic a bhíonn daoine cosúil liom féin faiteach Gaeilge a labhairt roimh daoine áirithe, agus chomh fada agus a bhíonn an scéal amhlaidh ní éireoidh le feachtas na teanga.  Má thugann daoine cosúil liomsa deá-shampla beidh mé ag súil go leanfaidh daoine eile mé agus go mbainfidh siad úsáid as an mbeagán Gaeilge atá acu.  Molfaidh mé teanga ar bith.  Is cumarsáid atá i gceist agus má thuigeann daoine eile thú níl sé mí-cheart focail Bhéarla a úsáid.  Chuala mé féin go minic fear as Chonamara agus é ag iarraidh &ldquo;20 fags agus bosca matches&rdquo;.  Tá samplaí eile.  Chuala mé duine ag rá: &ldquo;Tá mé ag dul síos an road ar mo bhicycle&rdquo;. <Col N="1063" /> Sílim gurb é sin an chaoi a d'fhoghlaim na cainteoirí dúchais a gcuid Gaeilge.  Ní Gaeilge nó Béarla é sin, ach tá sé soiléir agus tuigeann na daoine é.</P>
    <P>Similarly it would be no harm&mdash; indeed, it would be a very good thing &mdash;if people with a little Irish used whatever Irish they have where possible even when speaking in English.  In that way they would expand their vocabulary and perhaps in time that of others.  The major difference idir Gaeilge agus Béarla is the fact that English is a practical language in everyday use.  Ní féidir an rud céanna a rá mar gheall ar an Ghaeilge, and the lack of practicality where Irish is concerned is the biggest single problem which must be solved before the language can be saved.  It must be given a practical value for ordinary people.</P>
    <P>All parties are at one in their desire to revive the language, and so this debate is not politically divisive.  That is as it should be.  I criticise the brevity of the Minister's speech because, in my view, he had a golden opportunity to tell the House and the country his plans for reviving the language.  A great deal of lip service has been paid to reviving the language but very little has really been done.  Some would hold that there is a clash between the aim of a united Ireland and the revival of the language.  I do not share that view.  It has been argued that if Irish were to become an important part of the cultural life of this part of the country that would widen the gap between us and the people in the North. There is plenty of room for cultural diversity.</P>
    <P>When I refer to lip service I am not talking about the present Government. I am talking about our performance since independence.  Compulsion is now gone and it is generally agreed that that is a good thing.  Deputy O'Toole referred yesterday to fanatics.  Fanatics and compulsion put many people off the language.  They engendered resentment against the language.  Most of the resentment is now gone and there is more goodwill.  That is something I heartily welcome.  Coming in here this <Col N="1064" /> morning I was studying the bilingual road signs.  Some of the translations are laughable&mdash;Bessboro Road, Bothar Besbra.  There is no consistency.  One can get different versions in Irish on the same road and another version on the bus.  There has been an amateur approach.  We have not shown ourselves to be really serious about reviving the language.  However, there is a better atmosphere at the moment and, because there is, revival has a much better chance of succeeding.</P>
    <P>The language will have to be made of practical use, and this is where industry, commerce and advertising could come in.  Advertising can be very effective.  There is one advertisement at the moment for a certain brew&mdash;I must declare my interest in the company&mdash;which is now becoming a sort of slogan: Tá sé ag teacht.  It is a witty advertisement.  More such advertising would be a good thing.  There could be some incentive given to promote such advertising.  Revival will come about by encouragement and not by compulsion and commercial people will respond if they have a financial incentive.  If we spent a million pounds a year in that area it might be more effective than the large amount of money that has already been wasted.</P>
    <P>Radio na Gaeltachta is mainly listened to by those who are enthusiastic about the language.  This station was originally set up for the Gaeltacht area but I think it should be called Radio 2, the Irish speaking station.  Its name suggests to my constituents that they have no right to listen to it, that it is for the Gaeltacht area.  This station should also be developed in a way in which it would be of more interest to people in other areas.</P>
    <P>I know it would not be a commercial proposition but we should have a good daily newspaper in Irish. Such a newspaper would be of real value to the language.  Indeed, more politicians would speak Irish if we had an Irish daily newspaper.  The only people who speak Irish in this House are those who are directly involved with the Gaeltacht.  The only Minister who is asked questions in Irish is the Minister for the Gaeltacht, which is a pity.  The Minister was quite right in <Col N="1065" /> circulating his speech in English and Irish.  If he had not done so it would not have been reported in today's papers.</P>
    <P>Our daily and weekly newspapers should be given an incentive to use more Irish, such as captions over photographs and in other ways that would be easily understood by everyone. Our newspapers are penalised at present by the amount of VAT on them.  One of the reasons why the VAT cannot be removed is that we cannot discriminate between Irish and EEC newspapers, but there should be an incentive scheme for newspapers that publish a certain number of articles in Irish.  For instance, if 20 per cent of the contents of newspapers were printed in Irish they should qualify for a grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta, which should be called Roinn na Gaeilge.  There should be a system of communication in Irish on radio, in newspapers and in advertising,</P>
    <P>In Canada, which is a bilingual country, most goods are packaged in both languages.  I do not want to add unnecessarily to the costs of industry, but the co-operation of industry should be sought to do this on a voluntary basis at first.  All these things would help to make Irish an everyday language.  I do not want to go into the realms of the ridiculous by suggesting that we should have a full Irish television service.  I do not believe it is possible, because films are not made in Irish, but I hope that RTE 2 becomes a bilingual station.  A programme which has captivated many people is &ldquo;Trom agus Eadtrom&rdquo; and it has won many people over to the language.  I hope that RTE 2 will show popular programmes in both Irish and English.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is an active Conradh na Gaeilge group and I have a very good relationship with them. A sub-group of them started a naíscoil cúpla bliain ó shin.  Anois tá bunscoil ann ar feadh bliain.  Is é seo an dara bhliain.  During a by-election in the constituency they asked me and other candidates to talk to them.  They asked me what I thought was wrong with the language.  I told them that the language was always associated with a certain <Col N="1066" /> type of music, attitude and dress which was off-putting for many people.  I do not want anyone to think I am criticising traditional Irish music and culture, because I like it; but you can have enough of that.  Young people would like to hear their kind of music in Irish. If the French had continued with the sort of culture they had 200 years ago their language would not be too popular today.  Today there are pop songs in French, English and German.  That is an area in which Bord na Gaeilge could get involved to encourage and even subsidise an agency to promote popular music in Irish.  Many believe it should not be in Irish because it is not fíor Gaeilge, not true Irish.  I am very much opposed to that.  We will have to have popular music in Irish.</P>
    <P>In my constituency all the young people and many others listen every day to Radio Dublin, Alternative Radio Dublin and the third one Big D where there is music non-stop.  There are odd news flashes and weather reports.  They are very enthusiastic about these stations.  It would be suicidal for a Deputy from my area to be critical of them.  If a radio station carried Irish pop music it could be popular.  That is not impossible.  If you can get young people to sing good attractive Irish songs with a beat you are on the way to reviving the Irish language.  I would not underestimate that.</P>
    <P>There should be a much more determined effort to encourage the use of the language in every day life.  It is not feasible at the moment because there is not a practical way of using it. Another area which needs looking at is the whole question of publications in Irish.  I do not mean official publications. I mean having good novels and biographies translated into Irish. I know that in translation they sometimes lose their effect.  If we had a wide-ranging selection of books in Irish, that would be a great step forward. I would not even object to pornography in Irish.  I am not advocating it, but I am being practical.  It is not traditionally Irish and that is the way it is seen.  Pornography is on sale and sells well.  Many people are making money out of it.  That would probably revolutionise the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought of saying that before and I decided I would not because it might be misunderstood.  In the whole area of publications there is a big void to be filled.  So far as I know there is no comprehensive Irish encyclopaedia.  I remember hearing the Minister for Education being asked if he would commission one and the answer was in the negative, probably on financial grounds.  That would be a very useful thing to have and I believe people are available to provide it.  Admittedly, expense would be involved but, if we are to have a living language, that is the type of thing we need.</P>
      <P>Much can be done to popularise the language and bring it into use in everyday life.  Very little Irish is used in this House and in the other House, and by members of local authorities.  That is a pity.  I understand it very well, because you could be talking until the cows come home in Irish and you would not get through to anybody.  That is why I believe strongly that means of communicating to the public in Irish should be available.</P>
      <P>I hope when Bord na Gaeilge are set up they will address themselves to this task and have adequate financial resources. It is customary to think in terms of State money all the time.  I suppose, at the end of the day, the State will have to provide whatever money Bord na Gaeilge want.  I would hope major industries would be interested in funding a foundation for the revival of the language.  In Britain many foundations for all sorts of things are funded by big industries or by philanthropic wealthy people.  I should like to see wealthy people here who got such a boost in recent months funding a foundation for the revival of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, I believe the revival of the language is an all-party aim. There are political differences and I suppose political points will always be scored.  I should like to see as far as possible a determined continuous effort <Col N="1068" /> over a prolonged period to get the language moving again.  That would need all-party agreement, and that would not be impossible.  As is common in the case of most statutory boards, Members of the Oireachtas are percluded from membership of Bord na Gaeilge.  That is a pity.  I understand it is because it is traditional.  I have not thought out the implications of this, but perhaps there should be an equal number of nominees from both sides of the House on Bord na Gaeilge so that people would be prodding us to make more use of the language.  I raise that as a matter for serious consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker who was Chairman of Bord na Gaeilge resigned with Senator Mulcahy when this Bill was circulated.  That was the proper thing to do because of the provision that no Member of either House of the Oireachtas could be a member of this board.  To have persons of the distinction and calibre of Senator Whitaker on the board is very good.  I am sorry the Minister found it necessary to include that provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Níl mórán eile le rá agam, ach ba mhaith liom go n-éireodh le Bord na Gaeilge san obair atá le déanamh acu chun an teanga a athbheochaint.</P>

Daoine ag caint agus ag baint úsáid as an teanga, sin é an rosc catha ba mhaith liom a chloisteáil.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh meas níos mó ag na daoine a bhfuil éifeacht agus líofacht acu sa Ghaeilge ar iarrachtaí na ndaoine nach bhfuil acu ach beagáinín Gaeilge.  Is mór an dualgas atá ar an ghlún seo cúram a thabhairt don teanga agus teanga bheo bhríomhar a thabhairt do na glúnta atá ag teacht.  Bíonn daoine ag déanamh machnamh ar sin ach ní fhanann siad ag machnamh fada go leor, mór an trua é.  Tá cúram ar an Teach seo an teanga a shlánú agus í a choimeád.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis an Bhille seo agus le Bord na Gaeilge mar is orthu siúd átáimíd <Col N="1069" /> ag bráth.  Mar a dúradh leis na blianta, sé an locht is mó a bhí ann cúram na teanga a bheith i lámha roinnt áirithe daoine.  Tá dualgas ar gach duine iarracht a dhéanamh an teanga a úsáid.  Tá an dualgas sin ar na meáin chumarsáide, ar theilifís, radio agus na nuachtáin.  Caithfidh siad sin na gnáth daoine a mhúscailt agus a spreagadh chun úsáid a bhaint as a gcuid Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar an dteilifís, ba mhaith liom níos mó clár dhátheangacha a fheiceáil, cláir spéisiúla, mar measaim go mbrathann a lán daoine ar theilifís chun oideachas a fháil, chomh maith le caitheamh aimsire.  Ba mhaith liom Bord na Gaeilge a fheiceáil ag ceannacht altanna ó thíortha iasachta agus fotheagraíocht Ghaeilge á chur orthu. Bheadh suim ag daoine sna rudaí sin. Molaim freisin do Bhord na Gaeilge féachaint an féidir leo árdú airgid a fháil ar aon nuachtáin agus tréimhseacháin as ucht scéalta, cúrsaí reatha, a fhoilsiú tré Ghaeilge.  Taithníonn le daoine mion-altanna spéisiúla.  Ní léadh gnáth dhuine altanna troma as Ghaeilge.  Is breá leo altanna beaga bríomhana, altanna a cuirfeadh ag machnamh iad, nó b'fhéidir altanna grinn.  Sa chaoi sin, in aineoinn na rudaí atá ina choinne, tiocfaidh an Ghaeilge chuig na daoine.  Chuala mé daoine ag fáil lochtana ar ghramadach, ar litriú, ainmneacha bóthar agus mar sin de, ach má osclaoínn daoine a súile feichfidh siad gnáth-théarmaí in úsáid, agus b'fhéidir seach núsáid á dhéanamh as na téarmaí sin.  Sin é an rud is fiú, gnáth nithe Gaeilge i mbéal na ndaoine.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Milk Products Scheme: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Bruton on Tuesday, 18 April 1978:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann requests the Government to immediately avail of the EEC aid which is available for the purpose and introduce a comprehensive <Col N="1070" /> scheme for the provision of milk and milk products in schools. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;approves the Government's decision to seek to have the EEC subsidy for the supply of milk and milk products under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1080/77 made available for existing school meals schemes&rdquo;. </P>

      <P>If implemented this motion would, in addition to fulfilling the primary purpose at which it is aimed, help even in a small way to reduce the milk surplus at home. We hear much these days of the various mountains of agricultural products in the EEC.  It should be our aim to help to reduce these mountains.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal briefly with the need for the scheme we are advocating. We hear a fair deal from the Minister for Health about the various health problems and we are given some advice on how to deal with those problems. Nobody can deny the enormous benefits this scheme could have for our school-going children.  The principal of a large school during the past three months spoke to parents about two major problems confronting our school-going children at the moment.  The first one is late viewing of television, which we are not discussing tonight. The second one is the question of children going to school after a very poor breakfast, which we are discussing tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raised his eyebrows at me last night when I quoted some figures taken from a private survey carried out in a couple of our schools. He may ask me what authority I have to carry out such a private survey.  Firstly, I am a parent and, secondly, I am chairman of the vocational committee in Wexford and a member of two boards.  I mentioned those facts to Deputy Bruton before he spoke last night because I felt they should be brought up in this debate. <Col N="1071" /> This debate, if it does no other good, has demonstrated a problem with our school-going children.</P>
    <P>I stated here last night that up to 25 per cent of the children attending our schools go to school after a very poor breakfast and a small percentage go with no breakfast at all.  We quantified the number of children who came to school without any breakfast.  This was in the region of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent.  Deputy Bruton gave that figure but he did not tell the House that at least 20 per cent of our children across the country go to school with a very poor breakfast of tea, bread and butter.  I am glad to see that the <i>Evening Herald</i> have taken up this story and checked it.  I wonder if the Minister has seen it.  They have given more figures than we gave last night.</P>
    <P>This article says that the House was told last night that every 30 children out of 100 go without breakfast while 40 per cent have only tea, bread, and butter before leaving for school. It says that the problem of hungry children is nationwide.  There is a lot of information in this article.  The writer has checked the facts with the principals of certain schools.  It also gives another figure which seems to me to be rather high.  The writer of the article maintains that up to 7 per cent of our children from poor areas have to go hungry to school and stay hungry all day.  The Minister should look into some of those facts before the end of this debate.</P>
    <P>Those children would benefit greatly from milk.  Milk could be regarded as a medicine to hungry children.  It has a high nutrient content.  I would like to stress that we should help children to acquire a taste for milk at a young age.  If they acquire a taste for milk they will continue to drink it thereby benefiting their general health.  It is right to describe milk as relatively inexpensive, particularly when we compare the price of it at 8p a pint with the price of minerals at 20p for a small bottle.  I believe that parents give their children too much trash for their school lunches.  They give them biscuits, chocolates and minerals, which are <Col N="1072" /> not healthy foods.  They cannot be compared with the benefits children would derive from half a pint of milk a day.  People sometimes talk about milk being a complete food.  I do not agree with that, but I consider it is a great basic food.</P>
    <P>There are a few other products, apart from milk, which can come under this scheme, one of which is yoghurt I understand that while cheese does not qualify a small effort by us would allow it to qualify.  Yoghurt is a relatively new milk product in this country and contains a very high percentage of milk and fruit.  It is a little expensive but I believe it will qualify under this grant.  If it was introduced to our schools it would become very popular and would be very widely used.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night spent some time talking about the amount of milk we consume in comparison with other EEC countries, but he did not tell us that we are one of the lowest as far as the consumption of cheese is concerned. Cheese is a very good non-fat food.  It would be widely used if a taste were developed for it.  I believe that if the Minister introduced this scheme the EEC would have no objection to having cheese come in under it.</P>
    <P>Milk is a very perishable commodity. Some people ask why children do not bring it to school in a bottle. Unfortunately, if the temperature is not right the bacteria count in the milk will rise rapidly with the result that it develops a bad taste.  We should not encourage children to bring milk to school in bottles.</P>
    <P>The EEC aid would also permit us to instal proper equipment in the schools.  That is an important point. The Minister expressed the view last night that cold milk was not good for children but it is possible to heat it, to use it to make cocoa or to give children sweetened milk.  I understand that there is electricity in all our schools and that coolers, sweeteners and fridges which operate on electricity can be bought under this scheme.  If those machines were installed in schools our children could be offered a high standard product and they would then be encouraged to drink the milk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> It should be remembered that in the production and processing of milk a high labour content is involved.  It starts in the milking parlour, goes to the creameries and from there is delivered to the schools.  There is labour involved at all stages.  If this scheme was introduced I have no doubt that we would get a return in that direction.  It should also be remembered that farmers have a great interest in such a scheme.  I told the Minister last night that his amendment was an attempt to drag a red herring through our motion.  That amendment requests the EEC to pay for a scheme that is already provided for and in existence.  The Minister is begging for subsidies for that scheme.</P>

      <P>What is the motion tabled by the Deputy's colleagues about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We want the scheme put into operation properly.  One of the reasons the EEC scheme exists is to use up the surplus milk.  We must remember that our farmers are being asked to pay .9p per gallon to subsidise this scheme and they are watching the Government's operation on this issue.  We have not heard any Member from the Government side on this issue, and that is unfortunate.  The EEC have asked all farmers, whether they are liquid milk producers or commercial milk producers, to pay the levy.  On that basis a farmer producing 110 gallons per day is being asked to contribute £1 per day to the scheme. I am aware that the milk producers intend pressing the Government to introduce this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin sales area, which has a consumption rate of approximately 110,000 gallons per day, in 1977 there were 116 million gallons of surplus milk.  That milk was not just surplus in the months of June, July and August; it was surplus all the year round.  The milk is of a very high quality and is subjected to stringent tests twice weekly.  It is available for this scheme. Therefore, the Minister cannot make a case that the milk is not available or that the milk available is not of high enough quality.  Farmers have already contributed, between 16 September 1977 and 31 January 1978, £1,473,000 <Col N="1074" /> in levies and it is estimated that they will contribute approximately £7 million to this fund.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the Government will be asked to try to reduce this milk surplus.  There is a subsidy available to the Government to reduce that surplus but they are not availing of it.  They are failing in their duty to the farming community and to our school-going children.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for the Government to be begging for subsidies to support the existing scheme.  The Minister has already told us that the existing scheme is only being used by 27 local authorities out of a possible 49.  He also told us that it would be difficult to implement such a scheme but he should remember that he can avail of the management boards of all schools. There should not be any problem about the administration of the scheme. There may be a certain amount of waste but in a scheme such as this it is difficult to avoid having waste.  There is a demand from all schools for a better deal for the school children, many of whom must leave home as early as 7 a.m. and do not return home until 5 p.m.  The introduction of the scheme suggested in this motion would be a stepping stone to better things in all our schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  The EEC have decided to make available some of the money collected by way of levy towards the cost of providing milk for school children.  The levy was originally collected to try to increase the sale of milk and milk products.  When it was introduced many Members asked that the money collected here be spent here and we are now being given an opportunity to spend some of that money in a practical way by giving milk to our school children.  We would be making our children accustomed to milk, something which would be of great benefit in the long term to our milk producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our duty as a milk-producing nation to ensure that every effort is made to use this money for the purpose for which it was allocated.  It is our duty to do everything in our power to promote the sale of milk and <Col N="1075" /> milk products throughout Europe and to co-operate in any scheme that has that object in view.  There is no better way to promote a long-standing demand for milk products than to start with the children.  As far as I understand it, the amendment proposes that this money be devoted to the free school meals scheme already in existence in some areas.  Most of the areas which will benefit from that suggestion are the larger towns and city areas.  We have a duty to cherish all of our children equally and to ensure that every child in even the smallest schools benefits from the money which has become available.  This money has been collected, by and large, from people in the rural areas.  There is a great need for school meals, especially in rural areas and milk is an ideal form of school meal.  As has been mentioned by the previous speaker, many children in rural areas leave their homes at about 8 o'clock in the morning to go long journeys to school with as little as a cup of tea and a slice of bread inside them and they are out until 5 o'clock in the evening.  If money is specifically laid aside to provide milk in these schools, it is our duty to provide it.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable and unjust to allow this benefit to a percentage of our children only.  All our children are entitled to this benefit.  To suggest that it is an impossible scheme to carry out is wrong.  Nowadays milk is delivered in even the most remote rural areas.  I live in a rural area with a small school and I know that milk lorries deliver milk from house to house and that the dairies would be willing to deliver milk to the school.  Nowadays milk is available in packets so that bottles would not have to be collected.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that it would cost money to have milk delivered to the national schools in all areas.  I know there would be some cost, but in my area there are two firms that would be delighted to deliver milk to the local school.  It is evading the issue to say that the scheme would be impossible to administer.  No practical person and no principal in any school would accept that it is impossible to administer.  The milk is available in <Col N="1076" /> these areas.  There may be one area in a thousand where milk is not delivered. There is not a lot of cost attached to delivering milk and this would be a method of using money that was allotted for this purpose.  I know there is probably a greater need in built-up areas for a better school meals scheme and that this depends entirely on the amount of money available.  But the people who live in rural areas are entitled to their share of the available money, and I will not accept for one minute that people in large built-up areas where these schemes are available are the only people who should benefit from the money provided.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for us to ensure that there is an increase in the sale of milk and milk products.  The Minister said yesterday that we have the highest milk consumption per head of the population of any country in Europe. I accept that, and I am glad to hear it. The Minister also suggested that it was not possible to increase the consumption of milk by any appreciable amount.  I do not accept that.  Many of our children attending national schools could do with milk.  It would be a great part of their diet, and it would undoubtedly help to increase the sale of milk and milk products in the future.  Our consumption of milk may be the highest in Europe but many children have not much consumption of milk or anything else.  They go long journeys to school on buses.  They go out for many hours with very little food of any kind.  We have a duty to these people.  Poverty is as well known in rural areas as in urban areas.  I have known children from very poor families who go to school and are out for seven or eight hours with very little food.  When money of this kind is made available it should be used in every school.  I accept there might be a little cost in some cases.  I have business connections with people doing milk rounds and I know that they would be prepared to drop off milk to schools even if they had to go a little out of their way to do it.  I do not think there is any problem about the cost of delivery, of collection of empties or anything like that.  I do not believe there is a principal teacher in any <Col N="1077" /> school who would not lift the telephone and order that milk for that school.  I do not believe there is one member of a school's committee who would not lift the telephone and order that milk for that school.  I find it very difficult to believe that the scheme I am suggesting is unworkable.  I do not accept it.  I do not know what is the real intention, whether it is to use it as a partial saving on the present scheme or to add it to areas where the benefit is at present being felt.</P>
    <P>I have made my views quite clear, but I say quite definitely there is a need for this kind of service in all areas. I know it will be said to me that local authorities can take this up if they so wish.  We should encourage all local authorities to give this kind of service in every school in the country.  I am not saying that every pupil attending those schools is the type of person who would need the kind of service about which I speak.  In all of the rural schools with which I am familiar and I know many of them&mdash;there are some pupils whose parents are unable properly to prepare them for a long day at school.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take another look at this scheme.  I know he is a practical man.  I do not believe that the implementation of this scheme is impossible.  I cannot accept that, because it is the simplest thing in the world in most rural areas to have the required number of bottles of milk delivered at the door any morning of the week.  We have a duty to do this. Our milk producers are being asked on this occasion to provide the money for doing whatever can be done by way of advertising in the promotion of milk as a staple food.  It has been said that we cannot put it any further than the present consumption.  If that be the case then the campaign being carried on by An Bord Bainne and others must be utter nonsense because I see advertisements regularly coming on the screen saying: &ldquo;A pint a day&rdquo;; &ldquo;Drink more milk&rdquo; and so on.  The advertising agencies who arrange such publicity are not fools.  It must be possible to increase sales within our own areas.  An Bord Bainne have done a wonderful job of selling most of our <Col N="1078" /> milk and milk products, a very small proportion of which go into intervention because we have, in them, an organisation, that has sold our products in no uncertain fashion throughout Europe and indeed the world at large. But, if we are to get the kind of support from Europe that our dairy farmers and industry need to increase production&mdash;which must be done if we are to survive as a milk-producing country&mdash;we must co-operate in the schemes being promoted by Europe in order to increase milk sales in this area.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do now what we ask, and make this milk available to all our children equally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If ever the Minister for Social Welfare knew he was wrong about anything he knows he is wrong in his attitude to this scheme.  The proof of his incorrect approach is the emptiness of the benches behind him and the fact that for the first time in weeks of private Members' Business, no speaker from that side of the House other than the Minister was prepared to come in to defend the Government's amendment.  I do not blame them for refusing to come in to defend the indefensible.  The simple fact of the matter is that the Minister for Social Welfare never wanted to introduce this scheme in the first place and, until Deputy Bruton flushed him out, never realised that this scheme was available or that he was responsible for it.</P>
      <P>The Chair may recall that on the first attempt made by Deputy Bruton to raise this matter in the House the Minister abdicated all responsibility and claimed that a multiplicity of his colleagues might be involved but that his interest was secondary only.  I would remind the House of the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for Social Welfare on 1 December last when I suggested in the House that the present school meals scheme was unsatisfactory, was not working as extensively as it should and needed to be expanded.  The Minister, in his reply to the debate, at column 651, Volume 302, of the Official Report said:</P>
      <P> As Deputies know, my Department only come into this at second hand. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> Deputies did not know that and it was the first that Deputies were told about it.  Later on the same day&mdash;Deputy Bruton having unsuccessfully sought to get the Government to answer this and eventually going directly to the Taoiseach's office to ask that some Minister with responsibility for the introduction of this scheme should take it up&mdash;the matter was arranged for the adjournment debate of that evening.  The Minister now sitting here, apparently then reluctantly being forced into accepting the fact that he had responsibility for the non-implementation and non-administration of this scheme, said, at column 657 of the Official Report when you, Sir, said that this matter was to be raised:</P>
    <P> I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, is the Minister involved in this.  To whom has the question been allowed? </P>
    <P>I went on to remind the Minister that he had mentioned earlier in the day that this debate was coming up on the adjournment and that now he would have an opportunity of dealing with it.  He&mdash;I almost said&mdash;gracefully declined.</P>
    <P>At column 659 of the same debate the Minister, having been flushed out by Deputy Bruton, at that time said:</P>
    <P>... I make a submission that it is clear that the European Community are involved in this and that is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </P>
    <P>&mdash;that was a second colleague on whom he tried to pin the blame.  The Minister then went on to say:</P>
    <P> Milk is involved in this and that is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture. </P>
    <P>He had tried to pass it on to him earlier.  Then the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P> Schools are involved and that is a matter for the Minister for Education, </P>
    <P>and eventually admitted reluctantly:</P>
    <P>and in a very remote way the Minister for Social Welfare may or may not be involved. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" />&ldquo;May or may not be involved&rdquo;&mdash;he is not involved now because he has refused so far to introduce the scheme. Of course he was the Minister responsible, the Minister who had done nothing about it.  Then, when Deputy Bruton asked him:</P>
    <P> What are the Government for? </P>
    <P>at column 660, the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>. . . As the local authorities are involved this is a matter for the Minister for the Environment. </P>
    <P>The Minister was running out of colleagues rather fast at that stage.  Eventually the House agreed to allow the matter be deferred for a week to allow the Government to decide whether the Minister for Social Welfare should or should not be responsible for the scheme initially being handled by his Department.  The present scheme traditionally has been handled by his Department. Deputy Bruton asked on that day, quite clearly, whether the Government had any form of collective responsibility or could decide, if this Minister was not prepared to accept responsibility, whether any other man would take it on.  Of course none of the rest of them did because they knew and knew quite rightly, that this is the Minister responsible.</P>
    <P>Here now we see the Minister's real attitude to social welfare and trying to help young children.  Here we have the traditional approach of his party to social welfare.  The Minister declines to introduce the scheme proposed by Deputy Bruton, and his amendment to the motion must be quite the worst amendment tabled by this Government since coming into office.  Deputy Bruton's amendment suggests that the EEC subsidy for milk and milk products should be introduced on a nationwide basis.  The Government amendment is that the House should welcome the fact that this Minister for Social Welfare is asking the EEC to make the subsidy available to the existing school meals scheme.</P>
    <P>We all accept that the existing scheme is unsatisfactory.  It is not working as extensively as it should.  We all know very well that milk forms <Col N="1081" /> part of the existing school meals scheme.  The Minister suggests in his amendment that the House approve the Government decision to seek to have the EEC subsidy for the supply of milk and milk products made available for the existing school meals schemes.  The Minister's amendment asks the House to approve of that decision.  On 1 December last at column 651 of Volume 302 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P> My information is that the scheme is not very satisfactory.  It is very limited and it is not a very high quality scheme. </P>
    <P>This is the scheme he is now asking the House to approve by asking the EEC to subsidise it.  We all agree that the present scheme is unsatisfactory.  It is limited to urban and Gaeltacht areas.  It needs to be revised.  It is a direct insult to the intelligence of this House for the Minister to state categorically last December that the present scheme is unsatisfactory and today ask the House to vote for his amendment seeking approval of his decision to ask the EEC to subsidise&mdash;to use his own words&mdash;that unsatisfactory scheme.</P>
    <P>We all know it is wrong that rural areas are debarred from introducing the present school meals scheme.  That prohibition is long standing.  It is patently absurd.  I am a member of a local authority, the county council of County Dublin.  Under the Minister's definition that is a rural area.  What does that mean?  It means that the present unsatisfactory&mdash;I use the Minister's own words&mdash;school meals scheme cannot be provided for children in such populous areas as Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Lucan, Dundrum, Swords, Santry, in an area with which the Minister may be familiar, Darndale, because he passes it on his way home.  It is a large corporation estate built in the county, as is the area just before it.  The local authority statutorily charged with administering those areas are debarred by law from introducing even the present limited school meals scheme for the children in those areas.  No one, not even the <Col N="1082" /> Minister, would have the temerity to stand up here and say that there are literally thousands of children who attend schools in those areas who would not benefit from the introduction of a school meals scheme.  But we cannot do it.  In Cork the local authority is debarred by law from introducing a school meals scheme for the overspill from Cork city.  The same situation obtains in Limerick, Clare and Galway.  The Minister proposes to do nothing about this and he asks the House to approve of his doing nothing about it.</P>
    <P>If we compare the time children today are away from home attending school with the time their parents were away from home attending school we find that children today are away from their homes for a far longer period than either their parents or even the children of a decade ago. There are reasons for this, the main reason being the ruthless phasing out of rural schools.  Children now have to travel longer distances to school.  More children are attending post-primary schools&mdash;this is a welcome development&mdash;and in some cases, with the help of free transport, they travel 30 or 40 miles to school.  They have to leave home before eight o'clock in the morning and they do not return home until six o'clock in the evening.  Would these not benefit by the introduction of a scheme to provide them during the day with milk and milk products?  Is the Minister suggesting that these children, away from home for the bulk of their waking hours, would not benefit from such a scheme as that suggested by Deputy Bruton and others?  In effect, the Minister is saying in his amendment that they would not benefit.</P>
    <P>There has been a change in the social structure in recent years.  Necessity has led to the working wife, the wife who goes out to work when her husband goes out to work at eight o'clock and does not return home until six o'clock in the evening.  Perhaps the Minister agrees with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, about these wives.  She is faced with the burden of trying to provide a dinner or some substitute meal for her children in the evening.  Would her children <Col N="1083" /> not benefit by the introduction of the proposed scheme?  The children are there.  The Minister may not be aware of them, but they are there.</P>
    <P>There are 800,000 children at school at first or second level education.  The present limited scheme applies only to urban areas and only to children in primary education.  There is no scheme of any kind for children in second level education.  We have been encouraging parents to allow their children to attend post-primary education. We have been encouraging them to give their children all the post-primary education they can because of present unemployment problems. We know there are children of parents with low incomes attending post-primary education, children who in former days would not have done so.</P>
    <P>I know from my four years as a member of County Dublin Vocational Committee&mdash;two of those years were spent as Chairman&mdash;how many of these children go home hungry from school in the evening.  I know how many arrive at school hungry in the morning.  But my committee in County Dublin are debarred by law from providing any sort of school meal., subsidised or otherwise, for these children. We visited different centres in England to examine the schemes operated by the educational authorities there.  We were unanimous&mdash;I include members who belong to the Minister's party in that unanimity&mdash;that the introduction of at least a snack lunch would be of great benefit to the children from homes in the lower income categories. They have no money to buy food.  The children of the better off sections have money, money they do not always spend on food, money they may spend, to the Minister's disapproval, on cigarettes or other things.  They can arrive home hungry.  Would they not benefit from the introduction of a scheme such as that proposed by Deputy Bruton and others?  Would they not benefit from milk and milk products, especially yoghurt, which was mentioned by Deputy Treacy, and which could be provided so easily?</P>
    <P>If the Minister will extend this <Col N="1084" /> scheme to County Dublin I guarantee my local authority will implement it at primary, post-primary and vocational level.  Deputy D'Arcy referred to <i>The Evening Herald</i> and in the article in this evening's <i>Herald</i> there is quoted a comment attributed to Dublin city's chief school attendance officer, Mr. Brian Doolin.  Mr. Doolin maintains that up to about 7 per cent of children from poor areas have to go hungry to school.  Last night when Deputy Bruton suggested that the figure might be 4 per cent the Minister suggested that 4 per cent was a rather high estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anything about the adequacy of Deputy Bruton's figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Doolin went on to say: &ldquo;But no meals are provided for children attending post-primary schools.  One vocational school headmaster recently carried out a head count and found 22 pupils had had nothing to eat that day.&rdquo;  I am prepared to accept that information because it corresponds with my experience as a former chairman of the vocational committee in the county.</P>
      <P>The Minister also suggested that the introduction of a scheme to allow for milk or milk products in Ireland would be largely irrelevant because of the fact that we were already the highest consumers of milk in the EEC.  I do not see the validity of that argument except that it seems to indicate that the Irish like milk better than their European counterparts.  If they do and if it were offered to their children, is it not likely that their children would also be inclined to drink that milk if they got it at school at midday?  I would also have thought that the introduction of the scheme in a country with as high a producing capability of dairy products as this would have been an encouragement to other EEC countries to do likewise and to increase the annual consumption per head in those countries.  That would have had a spinoff for Irish farmers, but the Minister is not too worried about them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that the introduction of a scheme to allow milk and milk products for children, even in the <Col N="1085" /> existing areas where there are food schemes at present, would help to eliminate the problem of malnutrition which does exist in a certain small section of our population.  I would have thought that the elimination of malnutrition and the provision of a food as beneficial as milk would have been directly interesting to the Minister for Health if the Minister for Social Welfare was not interested.  In this case the Minister for Health also happens to be the Minister for Social Welfare.  He decided initially that he was not responsible for this scheme.  Now he cannot go back on that.  Now he cannot wear his cap as Minister for Health and say that he wants to encourage his colleague the Minister for Social Welfare to introduce this scheme, as he is one and the same person.</P>
    <P>In the same article to which I referred, Mr. Doolin said:</P>
    <P> Their parents just cannot afford to buy food as they struggle to pay heating costs. </P>
    <P>He went on to criticise, and I believe rightly:</P>
    <P> I have seen tiny tots shivering with the cold while trying to sip ice-cold milk in the middle of winter. In one school the teachers tried to warm the milk a little by putting the bottles against the radiators.  The whole thing is barbarous. </P>
    <P>Of course it is.  There is nothing to stop the introduction of this scheme and the extensive supply of milk and milk products to schools, and for that milk to be heated and provided for the children in a variety of drinks such as cocoa, drinking chocolate, coffee and so on, all the different drinks which adults often have as snacks during the day and which keep them going if they are unable to have a proper lunch.  We all know that these drinks would have to be beneficial for young children, especially for the young children referred to by Mr. Doolin, the children of deprived parents who have not the money for their lunches.</P>
    <P>The scheme could be introduced in this city, which is commented on in tonight's <i>Herald</i>, and in every other <Col N="1086" /> city and village in Ireland if there was a political will on the part of the Minister and his party to do it.  What is wrong is that there is not that will. The Minister is depriving 800,000 children of the benefits of a scheme that could be introduced.  He is, in a spin-off way, as Deputy D'Arcy said, depriving the Irish farmers of the benefits which would come to them through their children and their neighbours' children being helped from their contribution. So far they have paid £1.5 million into the EEC levy.  Deputy D'Arcy estimates that it will amount to £7 million in a full year.  That money is recoverable and could be put to great social benefit by introducing this scheme.  Unfortunately, the Minister has not the political will to do that. Instead he belatedly introduced an amendment to suggest that we should use this EEC money, to which Deputy Bruton drew his attention in the first place, merely to subsidise the acknowledged unsatisfactory scheme which is at present in operation.  In defence of his inactivity in this area he announced &mdash;in this regard the present Minister must hold the record&mdash;that yet another working party has been set up to examine this matter.  I quote the Official Report of last night's debate:</P>
    <P> I hear different reports about the existing scheme, whether it is satisfactory or not satisfactory.  Very early in my examination of the different social welfare services I set up a small group in the Department to look at the existing scheme to see if it was satisfactory, if it was giving value for money, if it could be improved and generally to look at it and see what we should do about it. That group are looking at this matter. </P>
    <P>There must be more groups, working parties and consultative bodies in the Department of Social Welfare than there are problems, and we all know the number of problems there are in those two Departments.  If this Minister has been busy in one thing it has been in the setting up of groups to examine something, which neatly kicks it for touch.  A long time ago I suggested to the Taoiseach that the Irish rugby <Col N="1087" /> team could do with a good touch kicker.  There are a number of qualified people sitting on the Ministerial benches, and the Minister is ahead of everybody else in that regard because he has kicked for touch every suggestion that has been put to him, every constructive idea and everything with an element of controversy attaching to it.</P>
    <P>As a justification for his refusal to extend this scheme into rural areas the Minister gave the excuse that only 49 of the 89 local authorities that are entitled to implement the admittedly unsatisfactory scheme do so at present.  The Minister was being unfair to those listening to him who do not understand the financial structure of local authorities and how they operate.  We all know that there are about 90 urban authorities and, of course, the Gaeltacht authorities that are entitled to operate the scheme.  Not many others know that many of those authorities are town commissioners and urban councils bereft of finance and unable to spend money on anything. The majority of urban councils and town commissioners would find that if they wanted to introduce a scheme to buy a new street cleansing vehicle for their town it might put up the rates by something like £5 in the £.</P>
    <P>The urban authorities do not operate this scheme.  They never operated it because they never had the money to operate it.  The urban authorities in all the major centres operated it.  They complained about it. They asked to have it improved, but it has not been improved.  The major rural authorities have consistently asked for the power and the legislative right to implement this scheme, and it has been consistently refused to them, and refused to them again by this Minister.  It is quite unfair for a Minister to suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very difficult for me to reply to this debate because there have been no contributions, with the exception of the Minister's contribution, from the party with a very substantial majority of the seats in this House.  It seems to me to be indicative of that party's concern in matters of this sort that the Minister did not think it fit to seek support from any colleague of his for the stand he is taking in this matter.  Although this debate has gone on for two days, no <Col N="1090" /> Fianna Fáil speaker, apart from the Minister, has seen fit to defend the Minister's stance on this matter.</P>
      <P>It is clear that Fianna Fáil do not believe the Minister is adopting the right position on this issue.  They know the Minister is backing a loser in this case and they do not want to back a loser.  They want to leave him in the lurch to defend an indefensible position which he has been forced to adopt by the Government, whether with his will or against his will I do not know. He has been left to defend it alone. His own Party have shown no willingness to put in a speaker to defend the position he is adopting in this debate, a fair contrast with other debates in this House when they have been falling over themselves to get in, and insisting that there should be two Fianna Fáil speakers for any Fine Gael speaker in any debate, so that they would have equality of hearing with the total Opposition.  They insisted on that when the new Dáil was elected.</P>
      <P>Now in a debate on an important matter affecting children, many of whom, as has been demonstrated without any serious contradiction from any quarter&mdash;up to 10 per cent perhaps in the case of some schools; an average of between 2 and 4 per cent across the country&mdash;are going to school without any breakfast, without any nourishment when a scheme is proposed with the aid of the EEC, with 50 per cent of the cost paid by the EEC, to provide nourishment for the poorest of the poor, children who are not being properly fed by their families, there are no Fianna Fáil speakers to defend the position adopted by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I am left in the position of having to reply to one speaker only.  I am not replying to a debate.  I am replying to one speaker who spoke on the matter only because he had to and who has responsibility for this matter because he was forced into having responsibility for it as a result of a succession of Parliamentary questions and adjournment debates.  He is the Member of this House to whom I must reply in this debate.  He made a few points.  They deserve to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> First he pointed to high existing consumption of milk and implied that there was no room for increased consumption of milk, that this scheme would not bring about increased consumption of milk.  Quite clearly it would.  There are many children, as has been demonstrated already and accepted by him, who do not get any milk at all for their breakfast.  Those children would certainly consume extra milk per day if this scheme were made available.  There are many other children who cannot afford to buy some of these milk products, yoghurts for instance.  If this scheme was available to them, they would consume more milk or milk products than they are consuming at present.  As the result of the introduction of this scheme there would definitely be a net increase in the total amount of milk and milk products consumed.  Nobody has seriously suggested otherwise.</P>
    <P>This has been claimed not only by me but by the interests who are concerned with the promotion of milk consumption, the milk bottlers and the milk distributors.  They have stated clearly that they believe that if this scheme were introduced it would involve a considerable increase in the consumption of milk.  That disposes of the Minister's first argument that, because there is already a high level of milk consumption over all, over the whole community, a special scheme for making available free or subsidised milk in the schools would not lead to an increase in milk consumption. Clearly it would, and the Minister is wrong on that point.</P>
    <P>In passing he referred to the problem as to whether teachers would administer the scheme.  I do not think there is any doubt that teachers would if they were approached in the right manner and if the Government were serious about introducing the scheme. Teachers would co-operate fully because nobody realises more than teachers the extent to which under-nourishment and inadequate nourishment can diminish a child's ability to concentrate on his or her lessons.</P>
    <P>I checked this matter with a number of teachers before this debate, and <Col N="1092" /> they pointed out to me that there are a number of children in their schools and, indeed, in every school who cannot concentrate on their lessons because they have inadequate nourishment before they go to school in the morning.  They have no breakfast, or a breakfast which was unbalanced or inadequate.  Those teachers realise that this is the case and they realise that they cannot carry out their work to its fullest extent, and in the most effective manner possible, because a significant minority of children are insufficiently nourished.</P>
    <P>It would mean a lot to those children and to others, too, who might be in need of nourishment to be able to avail of hot milk for their 11 o'clock break.  We all need our midmorning break.  Every business executive expects his secretary to bring him a cup of tea or coffee during the morning. Anybody doing a hard day's work deserves that break, and nobody works harder than children who have to rise at 7.30.  They have to work a great deal harder in the morning than, say, many Members of this House. Why, then, should the children not be given some sustenance at that time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister raised the issue of collecting money if there were to be a charge to the children and he foresaw some difficulty in this regard. He sought to imply that we were advocating a charge for milk for the children.  That is not so.  We would much prefer that a free scheme be introduced.  Although the scheme would be financed by the EEC to the extent of 50 per cent the Minister seemed to think that there would be difficulty for him in raising his share of the cost.  It was only in that context &mdash;that the Minister found himself short of money&mdash;that I was suggesting one possible way, albeit not the most desirable, of making up the amount the Minister would subscribe from apparently his very limited coffers for social welfare.  I suggested that it might be possible to charge some of the children, but I am not arguing that that is the only way in which the overall cost of the scheme to the Exchequer could be met.</P>
      <P>One could introduce a charge in selected schools, for instance.  We have heard in the past of the idea of educational priority areas.  There are schools in which educational and social problems are more acute than in other schools.  If the Minister could not find the £6 million for a start perhaps he could introduce a scheme into those schools where the need was greatest.  That could be done as an initial measure this year with the intention of extending the scheme to the other schools later when, hopefully, he would have the necessary money.</P>

I am trying to help him find a way out of his dilemma so that he can go back to the Minister for Finance, who seems to be able to stop the Minister for Health and Social Welfare from doing everything that should be done.  But the Minister does not seem to be very receptive regarding help from this quarter.  Perhaps it comes ill to him to take help from <Col N="1094" /> anybody since he is such an independent-minded man, but he needs help in the area of health and social welfare if we are to have regard to his record so far in terms of doing anything in these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been interrupting.  I shall now put forward another argument that the Minister may use in his dealings with the Minister for Finance, that is, if it is that Minister who is the problem.  Perhaps, though the Minister for Health and Social Welfare does not really care. However, my argument is that there is a balance-of-payments element in this case.  Under the milk levy scheme we will be sending from this country as much as £4 million or £5 million each year as a result of the 0.9p being deducted from every gallon of milk produced here.  That money will be going to the EEC and one of the ways it will be used is in providing a free milk service in the schools of the member states.  We will not be getting a penny under that heading unless we introduce the scheme I am calling for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount may be as much as £7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so.  If the Minister were to provide this scheme he would have to spend £6 million to provide the service in national and post-primary schools but he would be getting an additional £6 million from outside.  That would represent a net gain in our balance of payments.  Unlike many aspects of Government expenditure, for instance, the generalised inflation of the economy by the removal of car tax or the encouraging of people to purchase imports, the money would be spent on Irish children for the purpose of supplying them with Irish products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested that there might be involved administrative and other costs in the disposing of the milk to the children.  Let me repeat again that under the EEC scheme money can be made available for the provision of equipment for this purpose. <Col N="1095" /> There can be provided means for storing milk, for heating milk and so on, so that there would be no significant cost involved.  The scheme could be self-operating if the necessary equipment were installed.</P>
    <P>We could expect, too, that the milk distributors would be prepared to go a considerable way towards meeting the administrative costs of the scheme. It would have a considerable attraction for them because they would have guaranteed consumption compared with the situation in shops when they may have to take back quite an amount of the milk they deliver any day because of it not being sold. Therefore they could be expected to be generous in relation to their contribution to the scheme.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most disquieting aspect of this debate has been the Minister's admission that four children out of 100 are in need of special milk.  He was referring to what I said regarding two or four children out of every 100 going to school without breakfast.  In relation to my proposal the Minister said that there must be a better way of looking after those children.  I asked the Minister &ldquo;had he found that way&rdquo;.  He answered: &ldquo;I admit I have not and I admit that there are statistics which are disconcerting in this area.&rdquo;  The Minister admitted that there was a problem of under-nourishment in our schools, that he did not know the answer and that even though the EEC were prepared to provide an answer and were prepared to pay half the cost of that answer he was not prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to portray in the House that there were needs in the social welfare area more urgent than the needs of children going to school without adequate nutrition.  He said that if he had money he would spend it on something else and would not spend it on school milk, on providing adequate nourishment for children who need it, those who have not had any breakfast before they go to school or who have had a grossly inadequate breakfast.  If the Minister does not believe that that is a high priority in <Col N="1096" /> social welfare I question his priorities and his right to hold the office he has. If he does not believe that a serious problem of that nature exists and if he is prepared to reject an offer from the EEC towards the only solution&mdash;he admits he has not got any other solution&mdash;which has yet been proposed to meet that problem I do not believe that he has a very active social conscience in this field.</P>
    <P>How will the Minister use the money? He will use it in what I can only describe&mdash;I have no wish to be uncharitable&mdash;as a mean minded way.  He will use the money made available by the EEC presumably to reduce the cost to the Exchequer of existing schemes, instead of providing milk for school children.  He will not provide a single extra pint of milk under the amendment which he has proposed.  He will substitute EEC money where the Irish taxpayers money is already being used. If that is not a mean minded way of using this scheme to deal with what we all agree, including the Minister, is a genuine social problem of under nourishment among the minority of children in our schools I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on this debate last night I asked the Minister what has happened to his application for aid from the EEC under this scheme.  He said that the Government's decision to use the EEC money on a scheme which has been provided already and as a result of which no extra milk will be provided, was approved.  He did not tell me what had happened to the application.  I asked him when it was submitted but he did not answer that. I asked him when a decision will be taken but he did not answer that either.  I do not believe he is serious about getting money for the Irish taxpayers, because he was not prepared to answer the questions I asked him.</P>
    <P>There are agricultural arguments in favour of introducing this scheme in addition to the social arguments I have already given.  As an agricultural country we have an interest in supporting any measures which include the consumption of milk.  We have a duty to set an example to other countries in the EEC, which are not as agricultural <Col N="1097" /> as we are, on ways in which milk can be used.  We want other countries to spend money to encourage the consumption of our milk products in their markets, but the Government are not prepared to take this relatively small step to increase consumption when they can do it with aid from the EEC. How can we tell the Germans that they should reintroduce a daily door to door milk delivery so that the consumption of Irish milk products can be indirectly encouraged throughout the Community when they know that the EEC offered us £ for £ to provide milk in our schools and we refused to do it?  I do not believe we will be taken very seriously in the councils of the EEC when we talk about our anxiety to deal with a problem of agricultural surpluses and the need for incentives for production and more consumption of Irish agricultural products.</P>
    <P>We will not be taken very seriously when it is made known that the EEC offered us this money and we refused it.  We are saying to the EEC: &ldquo;You can keep your money.  Admittedly our farmers are paying £4 million, £5 million or £7 million towards this fund but even so we do not want any money out of it for school milk.&rdquo;  The attitude seems to be that the EEC can keep their money, that we do not want it.  That seems to be the attitude of the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare in regard to this matter.</P>

A survey prepared for the bishops on the meaning of poverty showed that 2.9 per <Col N="1098" /> cent of the families surveyed had no breakfast and that 40 per cent of the families surveyed had a breakfast which was considered inadequate, consisting of bread, butter and tea.  Those children had nothing else before going to school and probably did not get anything at all until the evening when they came home to dinner.  Although those figures are available the Minister refuses to avail of EEC money to provide milk for those pupils this survey has shown to be inadequately nourished.  The cumulative figure contained in the bishops' statement indicates that 43 per cent of our children either have no nourishment before they go to school or are inadequately nourished, but the Minister refuses to avail of the £ for £ scheme from the EEC to provide milk for those children.</P>
      <P>The last point I want to make is a general one which I put to the Minister in a non-partisan manner and I hope he will accept it in that light. One of the facts which came home very forcibly to me in doing my research for this debate is the inadequacy of the figures in relation to nutrition in the country.  Various figures have been quoted.  I have quoted the best figures available to me, which the Minister has not denied, but there seems to be no authoritative figure produced by his Department for the level of nutrition of school children or of anybody else in the country.  I ask the Ministers to at least consider commissioning a survey on nutrition in our schools to see exactly the full extent of the problem so that we will not have to rely on estimates from one source or another but that we will have official information. When the Minister has done that I believe that we will find we are right in advocating a school milk scheme.</P>

      <P>In seeking to raise this matter on the adjournment I wished to set the record straight, as I could not accept the reply given by the Minister last Thursday to my Question.  The Minister stated last Thursday that the helicopter licence <Col N="1101" /> applied for in December 1977 was refused for the same reason that the previous application was refused by the last Government in May 1977. Prior to the refusal in May 1977 I introduced a deputation from Gael West Helicopters Limited to the then Minister, Deputy Fitzpatrick, in connection with the application, and while he could see their point of view he was emphatic that there was no way on the evidence available to him that he could grant it.  After explaining this, our views were similar.  As a result of this refusal, of which the Fianna Fáil party were aware, Gael West Helicopters had discussions with Deputy Barrett then spokesman for Transport and Power, and Deputy Gallagher, then shadow Minister for Fisheries, with a view to ascertaining Fianna Fáil policy on the granting of helicopter licences.  As a result of this meeting with the two spokesmen, Gael West Helicopters received a letter dated 3 June 1977 from Dáil Éireann. The following are the contents of the letter;</P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the recent deputation from your company which was received at Leinster House by my colleague Mr. Sylvester Barrett, Shadow Minister for Transport and Power, and myself.  We discussed your application for a helicopter licence in order to enable your company <i>inter alia</i> to provide a service relating to the development of the Porcupine Bank.</P>
      <P>As we informed you, we were sympathetic to your case but would need clearance from our Front Bench on the policy aspects of the matter.  I am now very pleased to inform you that Fianna Fáil in Government will grant you a helicopter licence forthwith.</P>
      <P>In taking this decision, we are conscious of the following benefits arising from the granting of the Helicopter licence:&mdash;</P>
      <P>  (i)  the development of an air charter service with very real benefits to tourism by facilitating tours from centres in the U.K. for holidays or week-end trips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> (ii)  the development of scheduled air service Castlebar/Dublin and Castlebar/Shannon.</P>
    <P>(iii)  the provision of training for Irish personnel as pilots and engineers at the school of Aviation in Rotterdam, in accordance with undertakings given by your Associate Company Schreiher Airways Limited.  </P>
    <P>Above all, the granting of the helicopter licence will be a further significant step in helping the people of Mayo and the West generally to help themselves, by becoming involved in servicing the oil exploration operations and developing air services. </P>
    <P>The letter is signed by Deputy Denis Gallagher.  I believe that the spokesman wrote the letter in good faith, but that they were either misled by their own front bench or that there was a deliberate attempt by the Fianna Fáil party to woo votes in the West at a crucial time for them, as their Minister has now refused the application with no variation in the reasons given then.  Will the Minister explain the reason why his party changed their policy on this issue?  Did Fianna Fáil deliberately try to mislead Gael West, who if they were foolish enough to accept the contents of the letter could have invested a lot of money, because they could have gone ahead and purchased a helicopter?  I only hope that the same fate does not await a lot of pre-election commitments from the Fianna Fáil party.</P>
    <P>I would ask that the remainder of my time be given to Deputy Fitzpatrick, who was then Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When I was Minister for Transport and Power I received an application from Gael West for a helicopter licence.  I sought the advice of my Department and I was assured that the matter was considered in depth.  My Department advised me that it would not be in the interests of the country to grant this licence because there was an Irish helicopter company giving the required services. <Col N="1103" /> My advice was that the granting of this licence would probably put the other company out of business and that we would end up with no proper helicopter service.  I refused to grant the application and so informed the applicants.  I then received a number of high-powered deputations both political and clerical asking me to reconsider my decision.  I did not grant the licence because I thought that I as Minister for Transport and Power would be behaving irresponsibly if I granted that licence.</P>
      <P>I learned subsequently that two front bench members of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Sylvester Barrett, as he was then, the present Minister for the Environment, and Deputy Denis Gallagher, as he was then, the present Minister for the Gaeltacht, received a deputation and that they were to communicate with the company, Gael West Limited.  I was shocked when I received a photostat copy of the letter just read out by Deputy Mannion to the effect that a deputation was received by Deputies Gallagher and Barrett, that they told the deputation that they would bring this matter before the front bench of the Fianna Fáil Party and communicate with them.  That letter read out by Deputy Mannion is the result of the consideration of the deputation's request by the front bench of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard that letter as a piece of political gimmickry, of dishonest electioneering.  It would be bad enough if it ended there.  It would be better if that letter was over the hand of a back bench Member of Fianna Fáil or even one spokesman.  But here we have a letter, coming from the Fianna Fáil Party, saying that the matter had been considered by the front bench, presided over by Deputy Jack Lynch, the present Taoiseach&mdash; honest Jack Lynch&mdash;pledging in black and white on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party that when they were returned to power they would immediately grant this licence.  That is a document that binds every member of the present Government and the Taoiseach, undertaking solemnly to grant this <Col N="1104" /> licence when they were returned to power and giving the reason for doing so.  It is a shameful performance, a disgraceful performance.  It is a performance of which the present Government should be thoroughly ashamed.  Not alone is an explanation needed from the present Minister and the two Ministers who met the deputation from Gael West Limited but an explanation is needed from the Taoiseach because he is involved in this and he must accept responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>Today here on the Road Transport Bill we had an example of Fianna Fáil putting down a reasonable amendment to the Bill, refusing to have anything to do with Deputy Peter Barry's Bill, and then introducing another Bill in the same terms when the election was over.  This is an example of the depth to which the Fianna Fáil Party stooped in order to get back to power.  It is an example of the dishonesty to which they have stooped in order to get back to power. It is an example of the <i>bona fides</i> of their manifesto.  They can stuff that letter in their manifesto for posterity to see.</P>

      <P>I am glad to get an opportunity this evening to set out in some detail my policy in relation to helicopter licensing.  My prime concern, as Minister, is to ensure the safe and orderly development of Irish aviation. The responsibility is mine as Minister for Tourism and Transport. This demands, when considering air service authorisation applications, that close attention is paid to the specific needs and requirements of the aviation market.  It is necessary, on the one <Col N="1105" /> hand, to ensure that the enormous investments of authorised companies are not needlessly and senselessly put at risk, with loss not only to the companies involved but to the country as a whole.  The risk most clearly arises when the market is small, when there is keen competition by air companies for a level of business capable of supporting one operator only.  At the same time it is necessary to make sure that the demands for air services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am considering the granting of financial assistance for the improvement of the pier at Union Hall, County Cork and my Department have requested an engineering report on the pier from the Office of Public Works. Until such time as this report has been received and examined in my Department it is not possible to say what improvements, if any, will be authorised.  I understand that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have provided an ice store at Union Hall which they consider adequate for the present needs of local fishermen.</P>

      <P>I presume that the question refers to fishery harbour centres as provided by the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968. A site suitable for development into a fishery harbour centre should, as far as possible, possess the following main requirements:&mdash;</P>
      <P> (1) Convenient distance to fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>(2)  Good location in regard to existing or planned communications to a potential fish market.</P>
      <P>(3) Adequate and suitable space both on the sea side and the land side for development of an efficient fishing station.  This should include suitable areas for fish processing and auxiliary industries, boat building and repair, offices and shops, traffic and parking space for lorries and other vehicles, garages, and so forth.</P>
      <P>(4) Attractive residential location for the fishermen and their families and for fish traders and other groups engaged in the fishery and ancillary industrial enterprises.</P>
      <P>(5)  Safe access from the open sea in all weather and at all stages of the tide.</P>
      <P>(6) Safe natural or artificial shelter in the harbour at all times for all the vessels likely to use the harbour.</P>
      <P>(7) Reasonable initial cost of obtaining adequate depth of water in the harbour approach and at the quays.</P>
      <P>(8) Low cost of maintaining adequate depth of water in the approach and at the quays.</P>
      <P>(9)  Suitable ground conditions at the site for adequate arrangements of breakwaters, basins, quays and shore facilities, and so forth to be constructed in one unit or in stages, according to a general plan.</P>
      <P>(10) The site should be unrestricted for acquisition of the land required for the fishing port project. </P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's policy concerning development of &ldquo;script&rdquo; writing by children in primary schools is largely contained in the following extract from the <i>Teachers' Handbook</i> issued in 1971 in connection with the New Curriculum for Primary Schools:</P>
      <P> The use of print script during the early years is considered worthwhile, because the child avoids the difficulty involved in learning diverse shapes or different letters of the alphabet, and perhaps more important, because it enables the closer integration of the beginnings of reading and writing. From the outset, children can compare their own work with the printed word, and detect errors, particularly in letter formation. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is advisable to select one system of handwriting for use through the <Col N="1019" /> school.  When children have mastered the beginning of reading and writing to a degree where the use of print script no longer brings special advantage, the question of transfer to cursive writing may be considered.  Some schools never make such a transfer, since the fluency and grace of well-shaped print script allow for speed and for style in handwriting.</P>

      <P>The use of calculators at the certificate examinations was allowed in 1974 and 1975.  Their use was not allowed in 1976 and following a review of the matter by the Syllabus Committees in Mathematics and Physics, this position was maintained for 1977 and will be maintained for 1978.</P>

      <P>Second level schools make their own arrangements for holidays subject to my Department's requirements for examinations and the minimum number of days of opening.</P>

      <P>At the outset of this Question Time the Taoiseach said that the Government Press secretary was the best possible liaison between him and the Press, that he felt it right that he should be at the Ard Fheis and that the former Press secretary was in attendance at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis.  Would the Taoiseach accept that the former Press officer or, to be more <Col N="1020" /> precise, the head of the Government Information Service, did not attend or liaise with the Press at a Fine Gael Ard Fheis because of the view that this would be improper?</P>

      <P>The Deputy was kind enough to tell me that he was going to raise this matter, and that is why I came into the House to acknowledge a correction if it was to be made.  I regard the attendance of the Head of the Government Information Service, or the Government Press Officer as the case may be, at an Ard Fheis of the party of which the Taoiseach was the leader, as completely acceptable.  When the question was put down I made enquiries as to whether this happened before and I was informed from what I would regard as reliable sources that the former Head of the Government Information Services during the period up to the change of Government attended a Fine Gael Ard Fheis.  The leader of the Fine Gael party tells me that that was not so, and I accept that completely.</P>
