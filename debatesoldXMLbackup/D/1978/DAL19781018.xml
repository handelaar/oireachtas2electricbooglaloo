      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 5 (resumed), 6, 8 (resumed), 4 and 7. Business will be interrupted at 3.30 p.m. to take Nos. 6, 8 and 4, if not already reached by then.  It is proposed to interrupt business at 6 p.m. to take No. 7, if it has not been reached by then.  If No. 7 has been finished before 7 p.m. it is proposed to return to the business which will have been interrupted at 6 p.m. Private Members' Business, No. 16 (resumed), will be taken between 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m.  In case this seems complicated, in effect I am asking the House to take the EMS motion now and continue until 2.30 p.m. when questions will be taken.  Then, because there is urgency about a number of the other items, such as No. 7&mdash;the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill &mdash;it is proposed to carry on with this and other Bills at that time.  I understand it is possible there will be more speakers on the motion than would permit us to conclude it by 2.30.  In that event, we will resume the debate on the motion tomorrow morning.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Conclusions of the Presidency presented by the Taoiseach to the Dáil on 18th day of July, 1978, following the meeting of the European Council in Bremen and, in particular, the conclusions on closer monetary co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with this matter under three basic headings. First of all I will deal with the method whereby this decision, which I have already described as the major economic decision we have taken since our entry to the EEC, is being taken by the Government on behalf of the people. The second heading is the possible consequences for us of joining this monetary system in the event of Britain also going in; and finally the situation in the event of Britain not going in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the first heading, I have said that the major problem we are facing at the moment is that the debate is being carried on in the dark because we have not been given proper quantitative data by the Government on the consequences of the alternative courses that might be taken or the effect on us of the alternative courses others might take.  It was well within the Government's competence to have given us something more than abstract arguments, which are all we have had from the Government.  All the Minister for Finance has told us is that on the one hand there are five unquantified factors and that on the other there are four unquantified factors.  The House and the people are entitled to a clear quantified statement by the Minister on the implications this will have for our economy.  It is well within the competence of the economists, using computers and economic projections, to <Col N="523" /> produce quantitative statistics as to the effects a particular course might have on this economy in relation to the movement of its currency <i>vis-à-vis</i> other currencies. Why has the Minister not produced figures which will give us something to get our teeth into instead of the abstractions he has given us?</P>
    <P>I suggest there is an element of undue haste in the manner in which a decision is being taken.  There is a degree of haste in it which justly can give rise to concern. We have been told it will not be possible to make a clear assessment of the relative merits of joining or staying out until 20 Novemeber, at which time there would be clear indications of the transfer of resources and the form of such transfer to enable our economy to bear the shock resulting from our being linked to stronger currencies, when we would be allowed to move only within a band relative to such stronger currencies&mdash;that we will not know whether it will be a good thing or a bad thing until 20 November when the Minister will be made aware of the exact nature of the transfer of resources.</P>
    <P>We have been told also that a final binding decision on the whole matter will have to be taken within less than a fortnight afterwards, on 4 December.  Is that adequate time to allow for consultations with the various interests in our economy?  Is it adequate time to allow even the Government to assess the relative merits of the different courses of action that can be taken?  I do not believe the Government themselves realise the enormity of the decision that is being taken or of the need to consult with the various interests in our economy who will be affected in different ways by a change in our currency rates to an incalculable extent.  There is no evidence that the Government are engaging in serious consultations or that they will be engaged in such consultations with the various interests in our economy between 20 November and 4 December.  We have not been told that the NESC will be consulted or that the social partners will be consulted.</P>
    <P>All we have been told is that a White Paper will be published, but there has <Col N="524" /> been no guarantee that there will be any dialogue on its contents.  We have not been told there will be an opportunity for such dialogue in the brief span between 20 November and 4 December.  I question whether this debate, during which we will have set speeches from either side, is the right way for this House to consider such a vital question.  The only way in which such a debate can be conducted is through a form of dialogue in which we could reach the nub of the issue in a more informal format than is possible in this debate.  We will not get anywhere near the truth in this debate because of its format, regardless of its length.  I have raised very serious points about the way in which this decision is being taken and the opportunities for consultation and factual hard assessment of the implications.  The lack of such consultation and assessment is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to discuss the consequences for our economy in the event of Britain also joining the EMS.  The first question one must ask in this connection, and one that the Government have not yet answered, is: if Britain goes in does it mean we will retain our one for one link with sterling?  Even in the context of our becoming members of the EMS alongside Britain, do the Government envisage that there might be a departure of the punt from the £?  That question should be answered clearly because it conditions the whole assessment of the situation.</P>
    <P>In the event of our breaking the link with sterling, even in the context of Britain and ourselves being in the EMS or Britain being outside and Ireland in, is it the Government's assessment that the punt will appreciate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the £?  So far the debate in public fora has been predicated largely on the assumption that the punt will strengthen <i>vis-à-vis</i> the £ but I do not believe that that is necessarily a valid assumption.  We must recognise that Britain has very substantial resources of national gas and that it is able to meet its own energy needs from within its own economy.  We are not.  Notwithstanding the inherent obsolescence of much of the British economy and, relatively speaking, the inherent capacity for modernisation of the <Col N="525" /> Irish economy, the availability of domestic energy resources within Britain, resources that are not available here, could result in the punt actually depreciating <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling in the event of a float occurring between the two currencies. The Government should give the House the benefit of their best assessment of what is likely to happen in such circumstances.  It is not enough to go into this float situation without the possibilities and the Government's predictions being spelled out to the House in advance of our floating independently <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to refer to in relation to our joining the EMS is the implications this will have for our control over our own economic policy.  Will it mean that in future budgets will have to be devised by the Minister for Finance in consultation with his colleagues in Europe or will he be free to present his budget in his own way, with whatever degree of stimulation of demand or dampening down of demand in the economy that he might wish to follow? Will he have to consult with his colleagues in Europe before he presents his budget to the Dáil?  In other words, will we have a situation where people in Europe will know the contents of our budget before the Members of this House?  What effect would that have on the much vaunted secrecy of the budget which is part of our constitutional system?  What effect would it have on the sovereignty of this House <i>vis-à-vis</i> economic policy?</P>
    <P>We have been told that in return for the acceptance of loans to support our currency&mdash;this is different from the transfer of resources issue with which I shall deal later&mdash;the Government may accept as part of such medium-term financing the possibility of conditions being imposed on our economic policy.  I have asked the Government, and I repeat the question now, what conditions would they be prepared to accept and what conditions would they not be prepared to accept?  That should be spelled out clearly to us.  We cannot afford just to have a vague idea that there will be reasonable consultations, that the Government will do their best to reach an accommodation, that they will draw <Col N="526" /> up their economic policy but that, of course, ultimately they will make up their own minds.  The country is entitled to know now what conditions we will be prepared to accept and what conditions we will not be prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>For instance, if the European Community were to tell us that the only way they would accept our budgetary strategy as a basis for continued loan support for our currency would be that we would cut social welfare, I ask the Government would such a condition be accepted?  We are entitled to a clear and unequivocal answer as to the type of conditions the Government would be prepared to accept and the type of conditions they would not be prepared to accept.  The House and the country are entitled to that answer before the decision is taken.  If conditions are accepted in return for a loan in support of our currency, will they be published and will they be debated in this House?  Will legislation be necessary to enable such a loan to be accepted?  If there is to be legislation I would be a lot happier because there will be a possibility to discuss the conditions in a Committee Stage context.  However, if there will not be legislation we must know now what conditions will be accepted.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the impact that joining the EMS will have on exchange control.  At the moment if an Irish investor wants to invest in Germany he has to pay a 40 per cent dollar premium to get his funds out of this country into Germany.  This applies to all investments by Irish people in companies in the centre of Europe, in the economic core of Europe, in Germany, France and Belgium.  It seems likely, although it has not been spelled out, that one of the results of joining the EMS would be that such exchange controls would be out of order.  This might come immediately or in the short term as a consequence of joining the EMS.  The result would be that it would be 40 per cent more attractive for Irish people to invest in Germany and France than it is at the moment. At present the only alternative to investing in Ireland for Irish people is to invest in the United Kingdom unless they want to pay a 40 per cent dollar premium.  In the event of it being open to <Col N="527" /> Irish investors to invest in the Continent of Europe, do not the Minister and the Government foresee the possibility of a substantial outflow of native capital to the Bourse in Paris or to the stock market in Germany, more dynamic economies than ours?  If that should occur what effect would it have on employment here?  That question has not been answered.</P>
    <P>In the event of the rate of the punt departing from the rate of the £, there is the possibility that the British might impose exchange control and a dollar premium on investments by British people in the Irish economy.  We know how much UK investment there is in our economy, particularly in the older institutions such as insurance companies and so on.  These institutions date prior to independence and they have continued with substantial British investment. All of us know how important that is.  In the event of exchange control being imposed between this country and Britain, is there not the possibility that UK investors will start to sell off their investments in order to avail of the premium they got before the exchange control was imposed?  Would this not lead to the possibility of an outflow of capital with possible dire consequences for employment?</P>
    <P>Another question has not been answered properly, namely, what will happen in the event of our deciding that the loans being made available in support of our currency are not sufficient and that we have got to devalue?  That is on the assumption that we are a free floating currency <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling and that we have the right of autonomous decision as to our rate.  With whom will we have to consult before we do this?  It is spelled out fairly clearly in the annex to the Bremen Summit statement that such consultation will be necessary.  Will we have to get permission before we change the rate of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the order of currencies and set a new band for our economy?  Whose permission do we have to get?  In the event of our having to get permission from the Council of Ministers is there not a possibility of the Minister for Finance going round the <Col N="528" /> European capitals cap in hand asking the various Ministers for permission to devalue the Irish currency?  In that event is there not a possibility that the intentions of the Government will leak from one or other of the chancellories that he will visit on his mendicant tour and that the result of that leak will be massive speculation against the Irish punt which will force us into an even larger devaluation than might have been intended originally?  This is the danger of having to consult with anyone about the rate of our punt in advance of making a decision on the matter.  The precise method of consultation and the precise guarantees as to the secrecy of such consultation prior to our departing from our rate within the band must be clearly spelled out to the House now.</P>
    <P>The next point is the transfer of resources which we are told are to be the <i>quid pro quo</i> that we will get for joining the band of stronger currencies and therefore having our currency appreciate. As a result of that appreciation we will lose the competitiveness on export markets that our exporters, mostly private entrepreneurs, have up to the moment by virtue of the fact that our currency is at a lower rate now <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European currencies than presumably would be if it were tied in to a &ldquo;Tunnel&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Snake&rdquo; in which the strong currencies were also involved. Our exporters have a competitive advantage at the moment, by virtue of being linked with sterling which is relatively lowly valued <i>vis-à-vis</i> these other currencies, which we would lose presumably if we joined the EMS.  Our private entrepreneurs working in the marketplace are men who must make their own way, who must be prepared to take a loss, who must allocate their resources and if they mis-allocate them they will bear the consequences; in return for the private sector losing their competitiveness we are told that the <i>quid pro quo</i> will be the transfer of resources from the strong economies of Europe. How will that transfer of resources be made?  Presumably through the Government. The money will not go direct to the private sector who will be suffering the direct loss of competitiveness.  It will go to the Government who will give the <Col N="529" /> money out presumably as some form of political largesse, saying: &ldquo;Look at what we have got for you now.  We have transfer of resources.  We have more money to give out.&rdquo;  It will be given out, not on the basis of an optimum distribution of resources based on the marketplace and on the hard-headed calculations of men who must make or lose, who must stand or fall on their own decisions; it will be given out on a political/bureaucratic basis through various funds operated by the Government.</P>
    <P>I question whether that is the best form of distribution of resources in terms of the need to expand the productive capacity of our economy.  I question whether the <i>quid pro quo</i> we are getting, even if it is £ for £ equal to what we will be losing in terms of competitiveness will not lead to a net loss, because there will be a less good allocation of resources through the transfer payments system, by virtue of its being a bureaucratic allocation, than there is through the existing system of improved competitiveness for our private sector exporters of resources.  I would like that structural point to be dealt with.  It is a very serious point because it will mean greater public sector control of our economy if more and more money comes into our economy not in the form of better export prospects for our private exporters but in the form of money to the public sector.  That will mean a shift towards the public sector away from the private sector as a direct result of joining the EMS.</P>
    <P>There is another issue in relation to transfer of resources.  Will the transfer of resources be in the form of loans or grants?  If it is in the form of grants there will be no problem; the money comes into the Irish economy and stays there unless we waste it.  If, on the other hand, the much vaunted transfer of resources in return for our losing export competitiveness and losing money into the order books of our exporting companies is not to be grants from the Germans, the French or the European Community but instead loans, is that acceptable? Are loans a fair return for the loss of export orders?  Are we not already too heavily borrowed overseas and have we <Col N="530" /> not already got too many external debts to repay and too much interest to be paying out of this country every year without accepting as part of an alleged bonanza further loans with further interest repayments?  Is that the consequences we are going to face?</P>
    <P>How optimistic are the Government about this transfer of resources?  Do they really believe that the German taxpayer is prepared to pay more taxes to give more money to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to disburse to the Irish economy?  Is the Minister not aware that the German Government are facing a general election in the very near future?  Will they be prepared, in the face of a general election, to tell the German taxpayer: &ldquo;We want you to pay a higher rate of tax so that we can help boost the economic policies of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in Ireland&rdquo;? Are the German taxpayers prepared to buy that sort of package in return for what they are told is a theoretical benefit to them of better exports&mdash;probably a real benefit but not a benefit that can be sold in a general election?  Of course they will get certainty as to exchange rates.  They will get much greater opportunities of exporting to the Irish economy as a result of our joining the EMS and the fluctuations of our punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the mark being restricted.  It will be much easier for German exporters who want to plan an export programme into Ireland to do so.</P>
    <P>Of course the German economy will be benefiting and the Germans will have every right to make such transfers to us but I should like to know if our Government are optimistic that the German Government will be able to sell that relatively abstract concept of improved competitiveness and improved export opportunities to the German electorate in the face of an imminent general election? Will the German Government be able to sell that to the extent that the German electorate will be prepared to fork up more taxes so that money can be paid over in the form of transfers to us? How optimistic are the Government about that?  Do they think that the <Col N="531" /> German electorate will buy that sort of a programme?</P>
    <P>If our decision on this matter is predicated on some decision that may be taken in the Bundestag as to the transfer of resources surely we are not leaning on a support that is all that reliable.  If it is not going to come from increased contributions&mdash;indeed, resulting from increased taxes being paid by the Germans, the French or other stronger currencies&mdash;is it going to come from the existing Community budget, as the British want?  The British do not want the German taxpayers to pay out any more money to finance transfers to them and us as a return for our joining the &ldquo;Tunnel&rdquo;.  The British want the money to be taken out of the common agricultural policy.  They want the support to agriculture reduced so that this money can be made available for transfer.  That would not be acceptable to us but I should like to know if that is the price we will have to pay to get the British in.  Would the Irish Government be prepared to use their veto in the Council of Ministers, under the Luxembourg compromise, to prevent any diminution in the strength of the common agricultural policy as part of a compromise that might be entered into to get the British into the &ldquo;Tunnel&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We should be given a clear and definite assurance on that point.  I should like to know if our joining will lead to any change in the method of calculating MCAs.  At present a margin is allowed for variation in the movement of MCAs by virtue of the fact that our currency floats but if it ceases to float within the wide bands it has been floating up to now will that lead to a change in the method of calculation?  What consequences will that have for our economy? Will there be a new base on which agricultural prices will be calculated?  At present we are using what is known as the agricultural unit of account and this is based on the strong currencies.  The new ECU is based on a basket of all the currencies, strong and weak, and I should like to know if the ECU, which will be a consequences of us joining the EMS, will also become the basis for <Col N="532" /> agricultural prices?  Will a softer currency be used for agricultural prices rather than the harder currency that has been used up to now?</P>
    <P>I should like to know what effect that will have on us.  Will it mean that Ireland, instead of having a negative MCA, as at present, will have a positive MCA in future?  Will it mean that the Germans will have a permanent advantage over us because they will have an even bigger positive MCA and we will never be able to bring them back to competitiveness? In that even we will never be able to achieve the situation where they will be paid the same price as we are.  What way does the Minister see that evolving.  We have had many questions raised by Mr. Blake, the IFA economist, at a recent conference in Loughlinstown about the possible impact our joining the &ldquo;Tunnel&rdquo; would have in the event of our currency appreciation <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling and the inflation rate staying high within the Irish economy.  He felt that this would have a serious effect on our processing industries.  Is there a likelihood in the event of the Irish currency strengthening <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling that there would be an incentive to people to export cattle live, as against dead, over and above the present incentives that exist?  What effect would that have on employment in the meat trade?</P>
    <P>If the British currency devalues <i>vis-à-vis</i> our currency in this context, what effect will that have on those commodities which are not covered by an MCA?  The MCAs will give us protection, a sort of automatic adjustment, which will allow, in the event of the currencies fluctuating, the difference to be filled up.  Presumably they will still be there and, therefore, they will still be a sort of cushion for us but there will not be a cushion for us in relation to all agricultural produce. Competitiveness will be open to serious undermining as a result of the British currency depreciating <i>vis-à-vis</i> ours in respect of some commodities.  In that event what will happen, for instance, to exports of horticultural products to Britain which are not covered by an MCA? More important, what will happen to exports of canned beef?  At present we suffer a serious problem in relation to exports of canned beef because there is no <Col N="533" /> MCA on canned beef whereas there is an MCA on carcases.  Therefore, the incentive is for Irish processers to kill the animal and export the carcase to have it canned in Britain because of the lower rate of the green £ there <i>vis-à-vis</i> the green £ here.</P>
    <P>In the event of this existing divergence being accentuated by a depreciation of the British pound as well as the British green £ <i>vis-à-vis</i> our currency this will presumably add further to the disadvantage of the canned beef sector of our economy, the area of meat processing with the greatest added value and the greatest employment content.  Are the Government prepared to contemplate with equanimity a development of that sort which would worsen the situation in the canned meat sector?  That sector, as we all know, is already facing serious problems in the existing situation.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of how we are going to afford thi situation.  The main condition that has been underlined, perhaps not sufficiently, is the need to control inflation in our economy.  We are told that we must get inflation down to the level of the strong currencies if we are to be able to survive in an economic monetary system with them.  I should like to know what measures the Government have in mind for reducing inflation.  As my colleague, Deputy Kelly, pointed out in the course of a recent radio interview, the results of the last budget were to fuel the flames of inflation and wage demands rather than dampen them down.  Certain fiscal measures they took made it highly unlikely that the 5 per cent which they were seeking in the last wage agreement would be achieved.  It was not achieved and the wage agreement was far more inflationary than that.</P>
    <P>That was a direct result of the financial policy of the Government in the last budget, raising expectations, getting rid of taxes and giving people to believe that there was money to be got if they looked for it.  Before the election we were told that Fianna Fáil had clear policies for price control.  After the election they sent submissions to the National Prices Commission but they have not been heard of since.  There has not been any change in our system of price control.  In fact, the <Col N="534" /> much vaunted ideas the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy had prior to the election about how price control could be improved have disappeared. They were sent to the Prices Commission but we heard nothing since.  Indeed, we had the situation recently of him telling the oil companies to reduce their prices and they telling him that they would not.  That is all we have had from the Government in terms of improved price control.</P>
    <P>The only measure that will have a direct bearing on inflation is something that will dramatically increase inflation, namely, the removal of the food subsidies as is contemplted by the Government at present.  If they are seriously contemplating that in order to pay for their profit and promises of the last election, have they considered the effect that would have on domestic inflation and the effect increased domestic inflation will have on our relative competitiveness within this much stricter economic monetary system than has been the case in the past?  What institutional procedures have they in mind for bringing about a reduction in inflation in our economy?  If they are going to go about this major decision in our economic policy in the way they are going about it now I do not believe they will get or deserve the co-operation of the trade unions because they are not telling the people the facts.  I strongly urge trade unions to co-operate to the fullest extent in strengthening our currency and reducing inflation because it is in all our interests to do so, but we can only reasonably expect the trade unions to co-operate if they are given the facts and are taken into the Government's confidence.  There is no evidence that the Government are taking anybody into their confidence about this major decision they are about to take.</P>
    <P>They have not published a quantitative data about the effect this will have on the economy.  So far as we are aware they have not set up consultative procedures with the social partners about this issue.  They are prepared to publish a White Paper on a take it or leave it basis and leave it at that.  Yet they expect the social partners to take action which will lead to sacrifices by <Col N="535" /> their members to reduce inflation.  I ask the House if that is a reasonable proposition to put to the people.  I ask the Government to seriously consider if they are going about this in the right way.  Are they not retaining information that should be given to the people?  If they take the people into their confidence they will get a positive response but if they do not, the consequences for our economy in the long term will be very serious.</P>
    <P>Two other very important points I would like to deal with relate to the situation that will arise in the event of there being different currencies in Northern Ireland and the Republic.  In the event of our departing from sterling this will mean that the Irish punt will not be capable of being used in Northern Ireland.  If one wants to go to the North one will have to buy sterling at a different rate of exchange.  Economic transactions between the North and the South will be interfered with.  Out of social visits and economic contacts come an identity of interests ultimately leading to political co-operation and, we all hope, to unification.  What consequences will such a departure have on the prospects for increasing harmony and interchange between the two parts of this island?  The Government have not seriously addressed themselves to that problem.  One might argue that that is a more important issue than all the economic arguments I have been dealing with so far.  Most of us are in politics to bring about reconcilation in this island. We all want to see that although we all have a different way of going about it. We in Fine Gael have a different approach to the problem than some people on the other side.  What effect would a departure from sterling have on that prospect?  I believe it would have a very bad effect and I do not believe these effects have been fully considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  If we have a different rate of currency from that obtaining in Northern Ireland, does that mean that live cattle movements, which are free at present, across the border will have to be restricted?  If so, that will <Col N="536" /> have a major effect on the agricultural economy in border areas.  Will such restrictions be introduced?  We should have a very clear statement on that.</P>
    <P>The other point deals with domestic industry.  We all know that most of the foreign industries based in Ireland, by virtue of being attracted from Europe, Japan, America and so on, have markets outside the sterling area.  In the event of our currency appreciating <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling, I presume that the effect on these foreign industries will not be very great because they are already exporting most of their products outside the sterling area.  Most native industries&mdash;I am open to contradiction on this&mdash;rely much more on the UK market than the foreign-based industries.  I believe that our economic salvation rests on native entrepreneurs and not on foreign entrepreneurs but the consequences on Irish industry of our currency departing from the one-for-one relationship with sterling&mdash;and it is presumed that our currency will be strengthened <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling&mdash;could be very serious.  I would like to know if the Government have done any assessment on the relative effects of this change on different types of industry within our economy.  Will it lead to a greater reliance on foreign industry and a lesser reliance on the development of our traditional industries? Have they examined the consequences of this move in terms of the control of enterprises within the country? Have they seriously addressed themselves to these problems?</P>
    <P>I have asked a number of what I believe are pertinent questions which have not yet been answered.  I believe the Government can obtain the co-operation they need when making this major decision if they are prepared to come clean with the people and answer all the questions that are being raised in this debate and which will be raised in the months ahead.  I am not satisfied that the arrangements they are making are sufficient for such consultation or making available such information.  I hope when the Minister replies to this debate that he will be able to answer fully and comprehensively the questions I have raised, and if he is not able to do so that he will make other arrangements to ensure that <Col N="537" /> they are answered publicly and in time to enable the people to assess the Government's decision clearly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion which is being discussed at such an early stage in the life of this Dáil.  I appreciate that, since the meeting in Bremen took place after the Dáil went into recess, it was not possible to have this discussion earlier.  I was surprised at the number of Opposition Deputies who claimed there was no discussion on the question of the monetary union and that there was no previous information in relation to this matter, because I am a member of the Joint Committee on Secondary European Legislation and the 14th report published earlier this year covers this subject very broadly.  Members representing each party in this House are also members of that committee.</P>
      <P>The Seanad, shortly after the publication of that report, on 5 July last, discussed at considerable length the implications of the European Monetary Union and the movement towards a European Monetary System.  That report is given in Volume 89 of the Seanad Official Report for Wednesday, 5 July 1978.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development gave his views also at that stage on the general background to the discussions which were taking place. Nevertheless steps have taken place since that time.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the Taoiseach's statement and the very comprehensive one also of the Minister for Finance.  In the Taoiseach's statement there is one very salient point of which we must take note:</P>
      <P>In 1972, gross domestic product per head in this country was about 64 per cent of the average for the Community. In 1976 it was 60 per cent. This decline&mdash;which is on the basis of figures corrected for purchasing power parities&mdash;contrasts with the rise which has taken place in the major central economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that statement the Taoiseach made it very clear that there is a problem, a divergence, that we are not keeping pace with developments in Europe and that <Col N="538" /> something further needs to be done to strengthen our position within Europe. Many of us will have some conviction that our link with sterling has had something to do with that.  Certainly our over-concentration on the British industrial situation and at times our mimicking of the steps being taken there cannot have been helpful to us in developing our resources, policies and growth rates within Europe.  There is a clear need for growth if we are to create jobs.  This is one of the very clear-cut and specific targets of this Government, as outlined, as seen by any backbencher here and must surely be seen by the Opposition front bench.  We must go for growth if we want to have the jobs, and we have a major problem in their creation. Consequently the Taoiseach has set the scene for a further step in policy, one which would be taken as one of tremendous historical importance.  Of course, ultimately we want to arrive at a position of parity in a variety of ways with our partners within the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in what was likewise a very comprehensive and detailed report, outlined as clearly as he could possibly do at this point in the negotiations the standpoints, views and factors which influence the decision under consideration.  I was rather amazed at Deputy Cluskey last evening when he described the Taoiseach's and the Minister for Finance's approaches as romantic.  One would find very few documents less romantic than those dealing with such a complicated, technical matter as the European Monetary System.  These are heavy, weighty matters necessitating a great deal of consideration and thought.  The Minister for Finance has indicated clearly that credit supports will be required, that the resource transfers of the order of £650 million over five years are part of his objective and that a significant expansion of the regional fund, of FEOGA&mdash;and particularly the guidance section of FEOGA&mdash;and of the social fund will be necessary.  We are inclined to gloss over these.  But when we consider the influence the social fund has had already on our economy and job creation, further when we examine the benefit that an organisation like AnCO <Col N="539" /> has had already from the social fund, and also the Department of Education, we can see how these broad measures can have a major effect on the day-to-day affairs of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe that the documents presented are very useful.  Certainly I appreciate them.  The issues arising here are basic, such as the future of the European Economic Community.  There is the question of the economic, monetary and political union within the Community. There is the whole question of the diverse nations within the European Community working closely together in a common purpose.  Some arguments put forward by Opposition Deputies remind me of the situation approximately 200 years ago in the United States of America when broadly similar arguments were made about the coming together of their various states, questions such as those dealing with the public <i>versus</i> private business with their attendant fears and concerns.  We can think back even 100 years ago when there was an equivalent situation in which the smaller states within Germany were considering the coming together of their monetary systems to make a stronger economic union within the various parts of that country.</P>
    <P>I doubt if anybody would disagree that, as a nation, we have participated fully in the EEC to date.  Not alone were we enthusiastic entrants but we have been enthusiastic participants since joining. This was true of the Fianna Fáil Party.  At that time, indeed, the Fine Gael Party backed the same enthusiastic entry to the EEC.  Indeed, the people, in the subsequent referendum, showed their enthusiastic desire to be more closely involved with the peoples of Europe.  We have been good participants which cannot be said of all countries.  Certainly we have not had a dog-in-the-manger attitude towards the EEC and this aspect is recognised amongst our partners.  If we examine results to date it can be seen that in agriculture we have reaped considerable benefits.  The benefit from the FEOGA guarantee section alone in 1977 was £245 million.  The guidance section of FEOGA amounted to £7.5 <Col N="540" /> million in 1977.  Hence the reason for the Minister for Finance indicating very clearly that this guidance section necessitates very substantial transfers in any arrangements that might be made.  Even in relation to agriculture we know that the direct, visible benefits were part only of the total scene.  The major benefit to our agricultural economy was the stabilisation of prices and the provision of economic prices for our farming community. This has had a dramatic effect on growth and improvement within that community.  Nobody can deny that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the social fund, during 1977 we had a direct transfer of £19.7 million.  Our benefit from the regional fund was £12.6 million, making a total under those direct headings of £285.5 million.  In that sense we appreciate that the regional fund has not been what many of us would have wished and we appreciate that it must be developed significantly.  Nevertheless, we have had some very direct and beneficial results from our membership of the EEC following that historic and difficult decision for our country at that time.</P>
    <P>If we look at economic development in general we find that it has become easier to attract industry.  Membership of the Community has helped growth in agriculture, it has also reduced our dependence on the UK and their markets and we have seen an increase in exports to the EEC.  Against this background we have two major decisions to make: the first is in relation to the question of the direct elections to the European Parliament which must have considerable influence on the future of that Parliament as on our future as a member of the EEC; secondly, in relation to the question of closer monetary union by way of the European Monetary System through which we must face up to the co-responsibility with our partners within the EEC for the development of all the peoples and countries within the EEC.</P>
    <P>The European Monetary System has very serious implications for us.  We are regarded as one of the weaker currencies and there is always the danger of the creation of a two-tier system, which has been suggested in the past, within which <Col N="541" /> we with other weaker countries would be on the lower level.  We would not support or welcome this as a future direction for the EEC and consequently I welcome the consideration of a system which would involve all partners within the EEC.  If we take a simplistic view of the implications of the European Monetary System we would think in terms of our output, our productivity, our competitiveness, our enterprise or ability to reduce inflation, our ability to reduce imports and increase exports and in simple terms like strengthening the £ in our pockets and improving our balance of payments.  Naturally we feel we must do all these things if we are to be a stronger and a healthier economic people within Europe.  We have reservations about such a major step and people will say: &ldquo;Let us do it when we are strong enough.&rdquo;  There are fears of the possible effects of the EMS.  Fears were expressed already during the debate about our inability to export given certain developments.  There are fears of increased imports, particularly if the United Kingdom do not come in on a parity basis with us and there is the whole question of our relationship with sterling.  If the UK come in with us will they devalue and will they keep parity with us?  What will be the effects on prices, jobs, on prospects for growth and consequently on further job creation? These are the things about which the ordinary people wish to know.  In this context if we look at agriculture the picture is very comforting in many ways because 90 per cent of our agricultural produce is covered by the common agricultural policy and by the MCA system.  The MCAs more or less shelter us in agriculture, particularly against any decisions which the UK might make, as 90 per cent of our agricultural produce is covered by the common agricultural policy and MCAs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to another group of products which are not covered by MCAs.  This group represents 10 per cent of our total agricultural produce and this 10 per cent, which includes fruit, vegetables, sheep meat, potatoes and processed meats, needs clear safeguards particularly in a situation in which the UK would operate at a different <Col N="542" /> rate from ourselves.  In the event of Britain not going in, consideration should be given in relation to these products, to the creation of accession compensatory amounts to cover a period of years.  Something like that was done when we joined the EEC in the first instance, particularly in relation to these commodities.  These were the transitional compensatory amounts which became known subsequently as compensatory amounts and they extended over a five-year period.  Should it happen that Britain decides not to go in this 10 per cent group should be given some definite safeguard and I would suggest that accession compensatory amounts be considered here.</P>
    <P>We are also aware that farm inputs, like agricultural machinery, to the extent of £50 million per annum are imported from the UK, that nitrogenous fertilisers are imported from there, and that especially with the North Sea oil production this would mean a disadvantage to Nitrigin Éireann Teo., and that this is a question which must be considered in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>As far as food prices are concerned, Deputy Bruton raised the question of the effects of MCAs.  It is true that at the moment the MCAs are having very little effect because the gap is very small and consequently the recent rate of MCA is £1.20 per hundredweight liveweight and 2.3p per pound for sides of beef.  This gap is very small and represents only approximately a 3.3 per cent monetary gap, but in 1976 and 1977 according to the Eleventh Report of the Developments in European Communities, the monetary gap was very substantially greater and at one time it was around 27 per cent to 30 per cent.  That meant that there was penal charge on agricultural exports of over £100 per beast as a result of the MCA.  This led to changes in the green £ and caused certain disturbances from time to time which were sorted out afterwards.  There was a very strong lobby to have the MCAs stabilised.</P>
    <P>The EMS would not have any great immediate effect on the MCAs but ultimately it must surely lead to a stabilisation of the MCAs and in the long term to the possibility of new proposals for dealing <Col N="543" /> with the whole question of MCAs, so I do not see the danger which Deputy Bruton saw in the short term in relation to MCAs.  As I see it, there will be no change in 90 per cent of food prices as a result of the European Monetary System.  They would continue on the plateau which they have reached at this stage, depending on the annual price reviews as they are at present.  The balance of 10 per cent is unlikely to increase in price as a result of the EMS, unless we devalue our £ on entry into the EMS, which is an unlikely occurrence.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it looks as if food prices should not be directly affected.  To the ordinary consumer this is a major question and it is important to give clear assurances at this stage that as a result of the EMS there would be no direct adverse affects on food prices.  In the EMS the Irish £ would be supported by the joint reserves and therefore, it is likely that devaluations and scope for devaluations in the green £ would be much less than was the case previously. Consequently, there would be fewer and smaller increases in the future in respect of food prices to the consumer.  I cannot foresee any scope for hidden increases in the cost of food or household goods.</P>
    <P>Another feature that should be pinpointed is that there would not be repetition of the rounding-up that occurred in the case of decimalisation.  Regardless of what may be said from official quarters, the consumer knows very well that there was a rounding-up to a considerable extent at the time of the change to decimalisation.  It is important to make clear that there is no mechanism involved here that would allow for a similar situation.  Our currency would remain the same.  We would have the same £ in our pocket.  That assurance should be given to the consumer.  While talking with people in my constituency on this matter I have been asked what will happen to the £, whether it will be discontinued as a unit of currency and whether we will be passing around ECU's.  It is only between the central banks that ECU's will be used, at least in the short term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> I agree with Deputy Bruton that we must be vigilent lest the UK seek a reduction in relation to the CAP.  I agree also that we must ensure there is no fundamental change in respect of that policy, a policy that is of vital importance not only to our agricultural industry but to our economy as a whole. However, it would not be the first time for Britain to seek a change.  On other occasions she has sought a change in the CAP for one reason or another.  I am sure that our other EEC partners are well aware of the importance of the CAP and of the fundamentals particularly of that policy to the weaker economies especially, economies such as ours which are very dependent on agriculture. Therefore, I would not share the Deputy's fears in that respect and I doubt if the officials concerned would share it either.  They know where they stand but I agree that the matter is one about which we must be continually vigilant.</P>
    <P>In the industrial area we would have, within Europe, less freedom to vary our monetary value as a competitive mechanism and as a means of increasing our exports and reducing our imports. From that point of view the situation would be somewhat more difficult but on the other hand there is the consideration that our industrial exports to the EEC are increasing.  People concerned with this aspect of the EMS, to whom I have spoken, are of the opinion that this union would have long-term benefits for the industrial sector.  However, if the UK decide against joining the EMS, industrial exports to the UK and industrial imports from there would need to be protected against undue fluctuations between sterling and the EMS.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of Northern Ireland and emphasised that this would be a sensitive area especially in the event of Britain not joining the EMS.  Deputy Barry said that we must not set back by one day the movement towards the unification of the country.  Even as a backbencher I am confident in assuring the Deputy that there is no possibility that Fianna Fáil will ever take a step that would delay the unification of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton expressed fears that through the EMS we would create yet another divide with Northern Ireland.  We know that the North is integrated economically and monetarily with Britain but let us look at what is happening.  Since we joined the EEC our growth rate has been greater than that of Northern Ireland.  Our rate of inflation is lower.  The 1978 forecast is that the inflation rate for the UK and Northern Ireland is 9.5 per cent while for us it is 8 per cent.  Here I cannot avoid digressing <Col N="546" /> and smiling somewhat on recalling Deputy Bruton's remarks about inflation because he and his Government were in office at a time when there were extremely high rates of inflation but within a very shot time the present Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development have succeeded in reducing the rate to 8 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>By way of reply to Deputy Bruton, I assure him that we are not creating a divide and that the evidence shows we are building a more attractive alternative to integration with Britain so far as the people of Northern Ireland are concerned.</P>
      <P>We owe it to our people to go forward within Europe and the EMS is one further means of ensuring growth and stability in our economy.  The people of Northern Ireland may well be looking to us at this time to provide the leadership and the direction that is required.  Our Government are prepared to provide that leadership and direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of youth, the Taoiseach told us that the Community faces a massive increase in the number of young workers.  He reminded us that a recent survey showed that although people under 25 constituted 30 per cent of the work force they represent 44 per cent of the unemployed.  I was glad to note that at the Bremen Council the <Col N="547" /> Taoiseach stressed the need for speeding up the special measures that have been under consideration for dealing with this problem.  It was encouraging, too, to hear from the Taoiseach that the council agreed to ask the Council for Labour and Social Affairs Ministers to devise special measures to combat youth unemployment within the framework of the European Social Fund.  This is a very fine aspiration.  I would like to see it turn into real action.  The Joint Committee on Secondary European Legislation, of which I am a member, have looked over various proposals and have made amendments and alterations to them for the improvement of youth employment within the EEC, particularly with reference to the Irish problem but I see no definite arrangements coming forward from the Community.  I welcome the stress the Taoiseach has put on this aspect in his representations at the Bremen Council and also in his report to the House.</P>
    <P>I note the strong positions that have been taken by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  I believe we will have further quantification of the measures that are proposed and the effects of them.  We need clear guarantees in certain cases in the event of Britain not going in.  They affect particularly the 10 per cent of agricultural produce, which is not covered by the common agricultural policy, and our industrial exports. I know that the negotiations are still proceeding and, consequently, neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance are in a position to put all their information before the House.  I regard the information which has been provided as quite comprehensive.  I have every confidence in the Government and in our negotiators in this respect.  I also believe that our people have every confidence in those negotiators.</P>

      <P>We have become very familiar in the last seven years with a form of speech which has become almost universally known as Euro jargon.  It has become virtually impenetrable to the people who put us here and indeed to many of us.  There is <Col N="548" /> another kind of jargon, that of professional economists, and this also, given the slightest provocation, ascends into some stratosphere of meaninglessness for people other than those professionally engaged in it.  One of the problems we face is that we are trying to talk rationally and in a way which will make sense to us, to our constituents and supporters, about a topic which combines both of those forms of jargon at possibly the highest level, the Euro jargon and the economic jargon.</P>

      <P>I will leave the culinary details to Deputy Kelly.  This is a challenge to us because between now and the end of the year as public representatives we have the task of making some kind of sense to each other and to the people about the issues involved in this potential decision.  I believe some trends are emerging in this debate, which will percolate into the public conscience, and this debate, although based on very incomplete and so far inadequate information, has been a step in the right direction in bringing people to an awareness of what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather intrigued by the closeness of the November discussions and the December deadline in relation to what we are discussing.  I have a mental image of this tiny infant, the European Monetary System, there in its crib with the smiling parents Chancellor Schmidt and President Giscard gazing approvingly over it and there ranged on one side are the three wise men, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, who have come from afar to adore it while the rest of us play the role of the shepherds standing around on the margins wondering what is to happen next.  We need to proceed from this rather simplistic view of it to a more <Col N="549" /> sophisticated assessment of what is involved.</P>
    <P>I see three main reasons why the European Monetary System has got to its present stage of development and planning.  The first&mdash;enough attention has not been paid to it in some of the speeches up to now&mdash;has been the need to provide a zone of monetary stability in the short and medium term against the vagaries of the dollar up and down the international exchange markets. This, in effect, is a defensive, a reactive aspect of the proposal.  It is reacting to something over which it has no control and over which it wants to have more control.  Naturally it has positive aspects but it is something which has been forced on the European Economic Community to some extent by the breaking up of so many of the economic moulds, certainly on the macro-economic level by the breaking of the sort of stability that most of the economists, including many of those who are educated by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development believe will be with us until the end of our days.</P>
    <P>We have now had to come to terms with the realisation that that kind of stability is not necessarily on for the future.  Hence the EMS and its predecessors the Werner plan and other devices, all of them attempts to stop the rot, to at least provide some sort of an enclosure within which currencies with performances relative to each other can be predicted with some accuracy and within which they can be protected from raids from outside.</P>
    <P>I believe the second main element is the need to rationalise and harmonise farm policies within the Community.  In a general sense this is an acceptable aim. The third main reason&mdash;this is the most positive reason&mdash;is that if the European Monetary System is to make sense in the long term it must involve some progress towards full monetary union.  That prospect must be part of our debate.  I would like to hear more from the Government side, particularly from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, about the Government's long-term thinking about the possibility of monetary union.  Mr. Horst Schulman, who is President Schmidt's <Col N="550" /> senior economic advisor, has said he does not envisage full monetary union before 1990 at the earliest.  That is not too far away for us to be talking about it and looking, even at this stage, for a response from the Government about what it might entail.  I have a rather open mind about it.  It will obviously involve some loss of sovereignty.  I am not sure how real that loss of sovereignty is and we would need to discuss it in more detail.</P>
    <P>One might almost argue that the move towards monetary union has the same kind of risks and the same kind of advantages as the original movement towards, and eventually into, the EEC. We have to&mdash;and this is one of the risks&mdash;accept the fact that the stronger European nations, in particular the Federal Republic of Germany, are not interested in the EMS or in monetary union any more than they were interested in the creation of the EEC in the first place out of a spirit of benign maternalism towards the weaker nations of the Community.  They are interested in these things because they are industrial nations, they are exporting nations, they are expanding nations.  For their industries to grow and expand it is essential for them, as it is for us, that they should export.  Their export prospects are threatened by instability, by exchange-rate fluctuations and by poverty in the poorer countries of the Community.</P>
    <P>The challenge to us in this situation is that we should accept and recognise that it is fundamentally self-interest on the part of the strong nations which prompts this attempt to create economic and fiscal stability in Europe.  We must respond to that challenge by insisting that, if we accept, it will be on the basis of our own ability at some stage to turn back that tide and to make use of that economic stability and economic capacity for our own benefit and for our own exports rather than simply as a captive market for the more highly industrialised nations of western Europe.</P>
    <P>The essentials of the European monetary system have been well stated by Mr. Schulman.  I can do no better than quote what he said in a BBC radio <Col N="551" /> discussion which was reported in <i>The Listener</i> of 5 October.  He says:</P>
    <P>You have to reach an agreement on two or three essentials if you want to operate a European monetary scheme.  You have, first, to agree on the kind of exchange-rate system that you want to operate.  In Bremen, we said that we wanted to have a system that is at least as strict as the snake. Obviously, it does not make much sense to set up a new scheme which is less strict than the snake; otherwise, you might continue with what you have at present.  Secondly, such a scheme will only be viable if there is a greater convergence of economic policies and of economic performance than we have had in the last few years.  In particular, what is needed for the successful working of the scheme is that inflation rates converge in a downward direction, in the participating countries.  Thirdly, in order to make such a scheme credible, you have to set up certain support mechanisms&mdash;financial facilities&mdash;so that the interventions that are needed to maintain the rates within more or less narrow margins are available.</P>
    <P>Before returning to that key definition of what is needed on an international agreement basis to set up a European monetary system, there is a fourth essential which we should look at briefly. Here, again, I would like a positive statement from a Government speaker.  Will the European monetary system, as it is envisaged at present, to take effect from early next year, involve legislative changes which will have to be brought before this Parliament; if so, what are those legislative proposals and when will we have an opportunity of discussing them?  It is important that this should be stated at this point so that we may be prepared for any legislative and constitutional changes that may be necessary.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to what Mr. Schulman said.  The first of his three essentials is self-evident: you need a system which is at least as strict as the <Col N="552" /> Snake.  The second one is critical, and much more critical than many speakers to date have pretended.  Inflation rates, he points out, should converge in a downward direction in the participating countries.  There is a need for a greater convergence of economic policies and of economic performance than we have had in the past few years.  Other participants in this radio discussion that I was quoting from were rather sceptical about the willingness of the politicians&mdash;effectively, this means the politicians of the Governments of any of the countries involved&mdash;to take this second essential seriously.  Sir Jeremy Morse said in the same discussion:</P>
    <P>I am rather sorry to see that, in the Bremen communique, there was an excessive emphasis on monetary steps, with the problems of drawing the economies together in budgetary practice, fiscal practice, industrial practice, unemployment, inflation, and all that, thrown away in the last paragraph, rather lightly.  There is a good deal of emphasis on the exchange-rate mechanism and all this discussion about parity grid versus baskets, etc.  I hope the mistake will not be made of pushing too far on the exchange-rates and not going on with the other things.</P>
    <P>There is a very real danger here, especially for an economy which is as vulnerable as ours.  That is, that people will be led to believe that the European Monetary System, the control of the exchange rates, is some kind of magic device which will get us out of all our difficulties. To contrast the respective roles in the European Monetary System of the exchange-rate mechanism on the one hand and the economic performance, domestic and political policies on the other, is much the same as contrasting, for the purpose of somebody who wants to reduce weight, a corset and a diet.  If we concentrate on the exchange-rate mechanism we are saying that if we cram everything into a corset we will lose weight, but everybody knows that the only effective way to lose weight is on the basis of a diet.  Of course, at best it is only a short-term proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> Another commentator in the same debate, Professor Jerry Quinn, writing in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i>, made much the same point.  He was reminding people that domestic economic policies and domestic political and fiscal policies will have a much greater effect on the future of the monetary system, on whether it lasts or not, than we suppose. It will involve a great deal of deep thought.  The Taoiseach did refer to this matter in some detail in his speech, particularly on pages 16 and 20.  On page 16 he said:</P>
    <P>We here, as a nation, must ourselves make an immense effort. That is the basis of the programmes on which the Government are working. We must expand our economy by our own efforts and make investment here attractive and profitable.  That is the reason why we are committed to a level of expenditure which creates for us possibly the highest public sector borrowing requirements in the Community. And that is why we tolerate a deficit on our current balance of payments which is also extraordinarily high by Community standards&mdash; though not when measured in relation to our reserves.</P>
    <P>These two, the level of public borrowing and the deficit on our current balance of payments, are precisely the things which are threatened by accession to EMS unless action is taken.  The action the Taoiseach proposes is contained largely in his speech where he notes:</P>
    <P>The Government will have to operate fiscal and monetary policies which will sustain growth, encourage employment and keep down costs. The social partners will be under an inescapable obligation to complement these efforts.  In particular it will be essential to ensure that the rate of increase in incomes does not outstrip productivity.</P>
    <P>Later he returns to this theme and says:</P>
    <P>In particular, we cannot maintain and increase employment if we pay ourselves more than our production warrants and allow our costs to get <Col N="554" /> out of line with those of other countries within the system.  That is why the forthcoming negotiations on wages and the economic and financial policies of the next year will be crucial.</P>
    <P>I would draw these passages to the attention of every trade union and every housewife because they are the &ldquo;small print&rdquo; of the EMS and it is small print which holds little consolation for them because it is based first on an idea of restraint and, secondly and more important, on an idea of restraint which is extraordinarily narrow in its scope and implications. What the Taoiseach is saying is that wage earners and their families should bear the burden of restraint alone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  What the Taoiseach said is that there is a limit to the increase in living standards that can take place governed by productivity.  Anything beyond that is simply inflation.  Is the Deputy saying that more inflation is good for us, because that is what he implies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputy Horgan to elaborate on this and get it right for the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only begun to make this point.  I hoped to have elaborated on it but I doubt very much if anything I say will be to the Minister's satisfaction.  I shall do my best to elaborate what I mean and why I think it important that this small print of the EMS should be widely discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that inflation takes place and also that it can take place in such a way as to reduce real purchasing power of wage earners and their families other than through inflationary increases in wages.  What seems to me to be indicated here is that if there is a growth in inflation which reduces the real purchasing power of wage earners and their <Col N="555" /> families, through no fault of their own, they are now expected to make good the deficiency at their expense by increased productivity.  We do not find in the Taoiseach's speech any reference to productivity in other sectors.  There is no reference to the productivity of shareholders, to the productivity of the persons who would have been liable to wealth tax and the productivity of their assets.  There is no reference to the productivity of the person whose liability is now going to be tapered off almost to nothing under the capital gains tax or to the productivity of their capital gains. There is no reference to the productivity of the farming community.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued to hear at the recent seminar on the EMS at Loughlinstown House the chief economist for the Irish Farmers Association argue that the productivity of Irish farmers was lower than that of their Continental counter-parts and that the answer to that in terms of the EMS was a transfer of resources to the farming community.  I find it strange, to put it mildly, that any shortfall in productivity should be regarded in one sector as a recipe for increased productivity and in another sector as a recipe for increased resources. What is sauce for one must be sauce for the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not make that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that but I believe there is a considerable danger&mdash;and this is the point I have been making in the past few minutes&mdash;that resource transfers will tend to favour one section of the community more than another. Secondly&mdash;and there is some evidence of this in the lack of detail in the Taoiseach's speech&mdash;productivity is being very narrowly defined and confined effectively to work rather than capital. That is the problem we must face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would advise the social partners, or at least some of them, if they are coming to these negotiations to take full account of that fact and also to use their bargaining power which will be considerable in <Col N="556" /> this situation to look for not just appropriate financial rewards for their members&mdash;and I am talking particularly of trade unions&mdash;but for the kind of structural changes that are needed in this society, structural changes, which despite the opposition of the present Government, were begun by the previous Government and which the present Government have now begun to dismantle.</P>
    <P>There are some other dangers in the EMS which should be mentioned and when I say that, I am not speaking from a position of total hostility to it but simply outlining some things to which we must pay attention.  I see these dangers mainly as transitional but of course they could be very serious in the short term.  The first is that of transfers.  It is absolutely essential to realise that the European Monetary Fund if and when it is established&mdash;I believe the timetable for its establishment is about two years after the inauguration of the EMS itself&mdash;will not be a mechanism for effecting transfers of resources within the Community. It will be a mechanism for preventing fluctuation of exchange rates but if we are looking for transfers we shall have to look to the existing transfer mechanisms of the Community or call for the creation of new ones if these are not regarded as adequate.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach pointed out that in 1972, GDP per head in this country was about 64 per cent of the average for the Community and in 1976 it was 60 per cent.  I am not quite sure where the Taoiseach got these figures but, if he got them from the reports of the regional fund, the dates he chose are intriguing.  According to the reports of the regional fund, in 1973 GDP per head in this country had fallen to about 52 per cent of the average for the Community, and in 1977 it was no more than 48 per cent.  This decline over a longer period is, in fact, even sharper.</P>
    <P>There is a case for transfers and there is a case, without running the risk of being accused of being anti-Irish, for wondering whether the Government which we have, and up with which we will have to put for some time in the foreseeable future, have got the right end of the stick in their bargaining approach <Col N="557" /> to this question.  One might argue as well that we have a special need for transfers because of the failure in particular of the Fianna Fáil Government, when they negotiated our entry and since then, to offset even under existing transfer mechanisms the foreseeable ill-effects of our joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>We have gained enormously in agriculture and many farmers deserved an enhanced level of income.  One could argue first that the gains in agriculture have been more than counter-balanced by the losses in industry, and particularly in our traditional industries, and secondly that the effect of this failure of inflow to match losses has been aggravated by the secondary failure to redistribute in any socially progressive sense some of the major benefits of the common agricultural policy.  While we wish our negotiators well that is why, on the basis of their track record, we should like some more evidence that they know precisely what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>There is another major danger to which I do not think enough attention has been drawn, that is, the danger to an open economy such as ours of the out-flow of capital.  Deputy Bruton already spoke in terms of the link with sterling and the particular problem in relation to capital flows between this country and Britain.  I want to deal with it on a slightly wider level rescinding from the question of whether or not we maintain the sterling link.</P>
    <P>Capital is vital to us and, unless we create the kind of conditions which will encourage capital by our own independent policies, we will be considerably at risk and even more so in a situation in which two things are happening: a situation in which inflation is increasing and, according to the latest report from the United Kingdom firm Reward Regional Services, inflation in this country has been higher than that in the United Kingdom in recent months and the gap between Irish and United Kingdom prices has widened.  Also, the favourable downward trend in unemployment which was experienced during September has been sharply reversed in the first week of October.  The 531 people who became out of work, not counting the extra new women claimants, <Col N="558" /> represent a number substantially above the rate of increase which one would expect to result from normal seasonal redundancies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>And earlier too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>And perhaps earlier too. One can say that, up to the end of September, the seasonally adjusted unemployment figure is down less than 10,000 for the nine months starting in mid-December last.  This is substantially away from the Government's targets, however they are defined.  We on this side of the House reserve the right to define and to put flesh and bones on the Government's ambiguities about targets in relation to employment, just as they no doubt reserve the right to put their own construction on them.  The electorate will decide in the end.</P>
      <P>We need to create conditions for investment and for capital.  On the evidence of the latest statistics.  We are not creating that situation.  The mini-consumer boom inaugurated by Fianna Fáil is now lessening and, once the situation turns around, it could become very nasty indeed.  At the same time, we are going into a European Monetary System which will facilitate the free movement of capital to areas in the Community where its location is more attractive and more productive.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>In fact, unregulated growth could well accentuate regional differences by pulling investment and labour even more irresistibly towards the central areas.</P>
      <P>I do not quite understand why he said that in the face of the fact that the European Monetary System is designed, among other things, to make capital movement easier and is doing this precisely for the reasons that the main factor affecting the vagaries of the exchange rates between the member countries was erratic capital flows between one country and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are moving into a system in which it will be easier to move capital away from the less favoured areas and we are doing so at a time when our Government's <Col N="559" /> economic policy, to put the very mildest construction on it, does not tend towards making this country one of the more favoured areas for investment.</P>
    <P>I now want to talk very briefly about the question of the link with sterling.  Mr. Jenkins put it rather fetchingly some time ago when he described a nation's exchange rate as its virility symbol.  He has chronicled in some detail his own problems in trying to persuade a rather chauvinist British Government to devalue when he felt they ought to devalue.  I do not think we should be looking at our exchange rate in that sort of way, but simply in terms of the hard economic realities of life.  When we look at the economic realities of life, when we look at the patterns of our trade, it seems to me on purely pragmatic grounds that the question of breaking the link with sterling is not so much whether but when and how often.</P>
    <P>All sorts of options stretch before us into the foreseeable future.  Britain and Ireland can go into the European Monetary System at par.  We can go in not at par.  Even if we go in at par, we can fluctuate within whatever narrow limits the European Monetary System allows.  If we are inside at par, whether or not we went in at par, and the United Kingdom decides to leave, another situation is created.  It is even theoretically possible for us to remain on a par with sterling even while they are perhaps outside the area.  We have, I think, to be intensely realistic about this because of the very distinct possibility that, even if Britain does go in&mdash;and there are no substantial signs she will&mdash;the United Kingdom authorities will maintain a substantial degree of cynicism about the value of the EMS and will pull out as soon as they think it is suitable to do so. Only on Tuesday Francis Kearns, the economic correspondent of <i>The Guardian</i>, put the situation like this:</P>
    <P>Having started off moderately enthusiastic about the scheme Mr. James Callaghan seems to have had second thoughts.  He will have to make up his mind before the European Summit on December 4 and 5. <Col N="560" /> The safest bet is that we will join but how long we will be able to stay in remains a wide open question.</P>
    <P>That is as straight from the horse's mouth as anything from any Government spokesman on this side of the Irish Sea.  We must be prepared.  If we go in with Britain, assuming parity with some slight differences, we have to accept the very high probability that the link with sterling may be broken and may, indeed, at a certain point be reneged on.</P>
    <P>In this context, I have been fascinated by the new found interest that the present Government have in the effects of the link with sterling on our economic system.  I do not have a copy of the Minister's speech yesterday but, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, he says &ldquo;But the effects on the Irish economy of the trend in the British economy between 1973 and 1976 gave rise to serious misgivings about the continuance of one-for-one parity with sterling&rdquo;.  Later on, he says:</P>
    <P>The major criticism of the sterling link is that it has been largely responsible for our inability to insulate ourselves from the adverse effects of British economic and monetary policies and this criticism reached a peak during the period of high inflation in 1973 to 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make about what the Minister said yesterday is that he carefully avoided making this criticism his own.  But he wants in some sense to have the benefit of making it his own without actually claiming it for himself.  He and the Government really must say whether they believe this now and, if they believe it now, did they believe it then because then, to my recollection, we were not told that the link with sterling was the fundamental reason for the trend in our inflation rate situation?  In fact, we were told so often about the economic short-comings of the previous Government that it is extraordinary the Minister did not even put in a small saver to his speech yesterday to indicate that he and the present Government felt at that time that there were some other factors relating, for example, to the alleged mismanagement of the economy, factors which were responsible for our inflationary tendencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is only part of a trend because in some of the first and major economic speeches here the Taoiseach and, to some extent, the Minister were honest enough to admit, first of all, that there had been a world recession, which they had ignored when they were in Opposition and, secondly, the economy and the graph of employment was in better shape than they pretended to the electorate. <Col N="562" /> That is all for another couple of years' argument and the next few years' argument will include an argument about the consequences of any decision to join the EMS and, in particular, the consequences of any such decision on our domestic economic policies.  If the Government are looking to the EMS strait jacket or corset to redeem them from the gargantuan overeating of the last 12 months they will not get a great deal of help from this side of the House in their endeavours and, indeed, the famous manifesto, which must have looked to some like the entrance gates to paradise, now resembles nothing so much as something out of &ldquo;Jaws&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fact is, whether we go in or whether we stay out, whether we break the link with sterling or whether we do not, we will still have the same needs as heretofore.  We will still require the fastest growth rate in Europe.  We will still require the greatest relevant number of new jobs, especially for young people. We will still require the greatest increase in enterprise and the greatest need for capital transfer.  If I seriously believed that the Fianna Fáil Party policy either on the domestic or on the international level had any real prospect of meeting these needs I would not be sitting on these benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time we have to take decisions in relation to our international relations both in the economic and in the political spheres.  Sometimes these decisions derive entirely from our own prior decisions but, as often as not, indeed almost always, the decisions we have to take from time to time derive from movements that have occurred within a general group of nations, be it in Europe or elsewhere.  So it was that, when we approached the question of joining the European Economic Community in 1972, and indeed, as we had done earlier, we were in fact responding to positions that had emerged in Europe for reasons mostly, let it be said, based on economic and political conditions in Europe after the war.  We had a choice of staying outside all this, of isolating ourselves&mdash;some might say protecting ourselves; some might suggest securing <Col N="563" /> ourselves&mdash;but, whether it was protecting ourselves, or securing ourselves, it would have been in isolation. We had that choice.  We also had the choice of taking a positive and confident decision that we would at least participate in this new development and, by doing so, secure our political and economic future in a new European environment and, in turn, in a new international environment.  The people supported the Government at the time in taking a positive decision to involve themselves in this new European dimension. In taking a positive decision it was our object to try to influence decisions which would inevitably influence us. There were some few who argued we should stay out and who questioned, as is being done again now, the motives of the comfortable capitalists whom one can paint in really dramatic strokes, such as Germany, the Netherlands or Belgium, and who tried to frighten the Irish people into reacting against these things.  There is evidence that they are doing the same now.  It is true that other European countries are not very often motivated by concern about our interests as a nation; they are motivated by their own interests within the European framework.  We are part of that framework and we would be very foolish to give a negative response to any new proposals that emerge.  We should not say that we will not participate simply because a proposal emerges from France or Germany and they have not given any thought to our interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously we have benefited from our membership of the EEC, if only to the extent that we are now involved in the decision-making processes of that Community. We are no longer in the role of simply reacting to decisions taken elsewhere.  It is obvious that the Government and business people are fully involved in promoting our interests within that European framework.  It is also evident that the decision we all took in 1972 has been generally to our national advantage economically, politically and psychologically.  Now we come to a situation where another decision has to be taken and we have in a sense the <Col N="564" /> same kind of options as we had in 1972: do we stay outside and criticise from a distance, albeit in a low and weak voice, or do we get right in there in a mood of positive confidence in our capacity as a nation to influence directions within the EEC?</P>
    <P>Sometimes we tend to underestimate the role Ireland has played and will continue to play in influencing directions within the Community.  We can only do that if we are confident of our own capacity at home and, based on that foundation, confident of our capacity in Europe.  Our greatest advantage in Europe is based on our own discipline as a Government or as a people and on our clear perceptions of where we are going and how we continue to go there.  I do not want to compare the position of Ireland in the EEC with that of some other country but it is fairly clear that the more consistent one's approach in the area of economics, agriculture or any other area, as expressed by the various Ministers representing this country, the stronger is our position as a Government and that of the Taoiseach or Ministers representing us.  As of now that position is quite strong, based on the consistency with which we have approached our opportunities and obligations in Europe.  As a small country, the one thing we need and have always sought is discipline and consistency in Europe.  We are no longer satisfied with reacting to directions that may come from Europe as to how we should control our inflation rate or balance of payments or borrowing.  These are obligations that we as a Government have imposed on ourselves and we have on that basis said &ldquo;These are our programmes. Please let us know the framework within which these programmes may be implemented&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We welcome any moves which are designed to create stability and discipline in Europe or between Europe and its partners in the rest of the world.  We need to have the security of the European and international framework, both politically and economically, to guarantee our own national aims.  That in a sense explains the positive attitude of the Government towards this scheme. That is not to say that we are blindly <Col N="565" /> committed to the new monetary system. While we remain fully conscious that non-membership of this system could result in a diminution of our influence within the EEC, not only in the monetary field but also in such vital areas as the common agricultural policy and budget preparations, this Government have been conducting a very full examination at home and at Community level into all aspects of the scheme as it affects our national interest and as it will affect our economic association with our partners.  That is clear from the speeches made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and it will also be made clear by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>We made it very clear from the start, in negotiations with our partners and discussions with the Commission, that our interest as a small nation committed to Europe and to its stated aims must be protected if we are to participate effectively. In other words, the conditions must be right, not because we say they must be right but because it is part of the European obligation that they should be right.  Hence we can argue not just on the basis of our own special case but on the basis of the case which Europe has set for itself.  If we were to respond to some of the arguments about staying outside at this stage, it would be seen as a sign of economic and political weakness and that would not be in the interests of our future, either nationally or internationally.  We hope that the economic conditions within the Community and the economic proposals associated with this scheme will be such as will enable all the member states to participate fully and effectively in the scheme from its initiation.</P>
    <P>Full account must be taken of the discipline which membership of the scheme will impose on a small country such as Ireland.  In this context the demands which we have enunciated in regard to the concurrent studies must also be respected.  It is important for the credibility of the EEC that this scheme should succeed, but its success will depend on the creation of a system and an economic climate which will allow all member states not only to enter the scheme but to remain within it.</P>

      <Col N="566" /> Deputy Horgan touched upon the question of Britain opting in and jumping out again.  One could suggest that this could happen in regard to any country.  I would suggest that any country, be it Britain, Ireland, France or wherever else, would be very reluctant to engage in the jack-in-the box, in-and-out behaviour that Deputy Horgan was suggesting Britain would probably follow in future.  First of all, it would obviously lead to a very serious blow to their political credibility not to speak at all of their economic interests.  I think that, for once, it is unfair to the British to imply that their interests would be simply in pursuing that kind of a stop-go position in Europe.  I believe that they have too keen an awareness of not only what their own interests are but also what the attitude of others towards those interests will be, to pursue that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>When this was launched at the European Council one of the most basic concerns, if not the basic concern, of the heads of Government there represented was that this should be a lasting and secure system.  That is not to say it should be rigid, but it should be sufficiently flexible to make it lasting and secure.  Therefore I feel that some of the dangers that are being pointed out to us are not likely to be as real as is being suggested now.  While we may have some expectations regarding the benefits which this new monetary system could bring to us, the benefits are based simply on securing monetary stability within Europe, thereby ensuring that a small open economy such as ours, which is so dependent on international trade, will have a guarantee of regular markets at secure prices which in fact have not been always available to us over the last number of years in view of the monetary instability.  Even if it did give us that degree of European monetary stability, that in itself would not of course be the only answer from our point of view because the most important part of the answer could only be supplied by ourselves.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of our own programme for economic development, far from looking at this as a panacea, we would, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, have to see it as an opportunity within which we <Col N="567" /> could, by an effective disciplining of ourselves, realise our economic potential. So, rather than excusing us from our obligations it would impose on us greater obligations for instance, not to pitch our demands, our expectations, beyond our capacity to compete with other countries with whom we would be linked in this system, not just to think in purely narrow national terms but now to think, as we will be obliged more and more to do, in terms of our economic and monetary linkage with our partners in Europe and, through Europe, with our partners in the rest of the world.  It would in fact highlight the need for greater discipline in the broadest and most positive sense of the word.</P>
    <P>I am sure no member of the Government has suggested that we have presented this as a panacea for ills.  We have never so suggested.  It will involve a discipline for each member state in Europe and particularly for us as a small country which depends so much on international trade.  For that reason it would also involve an obligation of trying to seek out a common purpose in Europe amongst our community of nations. It would involve an obligation for us to seek out the common purpose at home.  For that reason I was a little disappointed by some of the latter remarks of Deputy Horgan when he not only cautioned but told the social partners, if I may use that phrase, that they should behave in anything but a partnership sense when it came to looking at this question, that the social partners should make demands which would guarantee a, b or c.</P>
    <P>It is not with that kind of approach that we will make any progress in this or any other areas.  The social partners are partners not just with themselves but with the whole community and for that reason the discipline imposed will be a very considerable discipline but a discipline in the positive sense.  This, if it is nothing else, will be new when it is adopted, as it seems almost certain it will.  There are some systems we adhere to here that are not very new.  Some we have inherited such as some structures in trade unionism and otherwise.  It seems <Col N="568" /> to me sometimes that in our approach to some opportunities in the future we tend on occasions to think in terms of demanding the guarantees we had in the past.  I would hope that for all the round and euphemistic phrases that are used, like &ldquo;the social partners&rdquo;, we will really see what that means in this day and in the future as distinct from, as was suggested&mdash;I am not saying encouraged&mdash;by Deputy Horgan, trying to create sectional interests in a country which frankly can do very well without them.  In that context, the judgment on us from the outside, which I have had some opportunity of observing over the last 12 months or more, is very positive. It is a judgment which shows, in a sense, a greater awareness abroad of what we as a small confident country can do in Europe and internationally than we ourselves are prepared to imagine or acknowledge that we can do.  The judgments we impose on ourselves at home are the sectional interests, judgments or criticisms.  I do not expect the Opposition suddenly to rise to their feet and say to the Government &ldquo;that is a great job you are doing&rdquo;.  But I do expect that, at least in approaches of this sort we would not seek out, as I detected in the contribution by Deputy Horgan, reasons for highlighting other sectional interests rather than finding a common interest which will be so vital if we are to succeed in this new era of economic and monetary discipline in Europe.</P>
    <P>The present time in Europe is both a testing and relatively exciting time.  For a considerable time we were all asking, &ldquo;what is happening in Europe?&rdquo;  There was no new initiative being taken.  There is no political will or economic capacity to do a, b or c.  It is fairly evident now that things are happening.  Whether we always agree with what is happening or not seems to be the only question.  We will be having direct elections fairly shortly.  We have been talking about it for so long that people tend to minimise the significance of it.  Suffice it to say that it will be significant.  The whole enlargement process is under way.  That is rather significant.  Now we have this. It is fairly obvious then that in all of this one has to see that Europe itself is ready <Col N="569" /> and prepared and that means that all of these will demand a prior consolidation and strengthening of the community if it is to adjust successfully to the new dimensions which will emerge in Europe. It has been suggested and agreed at the level of the Council of Ministers and also at the level of heads of Government that henceforth when we think into the future in Europe we must think not just in terms of nine countries but in terms of 12 and perhaps even more.  Therefore, it is necessary to lay the foundation, if no more, for the enlargement of the Community and for monetary stability within the Community which self-evidently will have some weaker members than the average of the present membership.</P>
    <P>This will be all the more important if the enlarged Community is to continue to move forward towards the ultimate economic and political objectives which we have all set for ourselves.  This Government, individually and collectively, can never be accused of being starry eyed about Europe.  The development of economic and political institutions in Europe provides guarantees for these institutions which the kind of loose framework of a common market, that might sometimes be more acceptable to less enthusiastic Europeans, would not provide.</P>
    <P>Our guarantee is in political and institutional development.  Some spokesmen, as distinct from countries, from time to time seem to imply that we should have a looser kind of framework. We have never gone for that, not because we are starry eyed in regard to Europe but because this is an important element in the whole process of the move towards European integration.  For that reason this decision of the Bremen meeting will be, likely, a significant step in the political as well as the monetary development of the Community.  The decision to proceed with the EMS cannot be seen except in the broader political perspective.</P>
    <P>There may be some who suggest that it was some rather remote keen brains in Germany or elsewhere who saw this as a means of securing their interests and controlling inflation.  In the final analysis these decisions are made at political <Col N="570" /> level.  This emerged from heads of Government, who have a very keen awareness first of all of the political interests of their own countries but collectively of Europe.  Having had the opportunity to attend the European councils in the last 12 months, I have to acknowledge that there is a keen awareness at heads of Government level of the need for cohesion within Europe, and the basis of the EMS proposals is that the Community will move towards greater cohesion.</P>
    <P>I see the decision to proceed with EMS in this broad political perspective and therefore it will be necessary for us to continue to demonstrate our seriousness and enthusiasm, which we have always displayed, towards European integration.  We must recognise the significance of the proposed monetary system as a step towards that goal.</P>
    <P>Some people have been suggesting that this is not the result of any groundswell within the Community but merely the intellectual conception of a small number of individuals.  Such people will also say that these proposals contrast with the apathy that is being experienced in other areas.  As far as the first argument is concerned, that this is the brainchild of some rather remote but powerful individuals, the fact is there has been a strong commitment towards economic and monetary union in the Community during a number of years, particularly since 1972, and this can only be seen as a very important step in the general direction of economic and monetary co-ordination in Europe.</P>
    <P>For instance, last December the European Council responded favourably to the Commission's five year programme to relaunch economic and monetary union, and they gave a much needed kick forward to the overall EMU objective, embracing the achievement of a greater degree of economic convergence in the Community and the development of regional and social policies which will affect a genuine redistribution of wealth within the EEC, and particularly because of its potential in the transfer of resources and the promise which EMU holds in relation to the closing of the major gaps in levels of economic development in the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> We have always favoured moves towards the development of EMU and we see this proposed system as being the first real step forward towards this goal. For this reason we have pointed out the need for balanced economic development in Europe.  We do not believe that a monetary system on its own can guarantee monetary stability unless there is to be a political commitment to guarantee economic stability and to create a co-ordinated programme within Europe which among other things obviously will involve elimination of regional imbalances and the creation of conditions in which periphery regions can develop to the maximum extent.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, consistently we have pointed out the need for an effective regional policy so that the centre must not be allowed to continue to gain by comparison with the periphery, if not at its expense.  Ireland's position in this is fully understood.  It has been stated consistently in recent times.</P>
    <P>I hope this new system can as well contribute to global monetary stability which is in the interests of primary producers in small and major countries and the developed world.  The fact that the Community is endeavouring to create its own monetary stability is to the advantage not only of the Community but its partners in the developed and developing worlds.  It is evident that this is not a plan for Europe in isolation. The fact that the Community initiative in the monetary area was on the agenda for the summit of the western economic powers in Bonn drew attention to the great degree of interdependence which exists, economically and politically, throughout the world.  It emphasised that what we are trying to achieve in Europe in terms of discipline and co-ordination can be guaranteed effectively only if it is part and parcel of an overall economic and monetary discipline in the world generally.</P>
    <P>In this context the EMS is part of an overall international package that, when we talk in terms of a new economic order in the world, demands that the developed countries behave responsibly in the exchange rate area by not allowing <Col N="572" /> their currencies to float completely independent of one another.  From what I have said it is obvious that it is part of an overall picture in Europe but it is also part of an overall package in the world. The more orderly development of international trade which we hope the EMS will facilitate should be of considerable benefit to the developed and the developing world and particularly to the small open economies which depend so much on the growth of trade for their industrial and economic development.</P>
    <P>Above all else, as a small export-oriented country which regards protectionism as a special enemy, Ireland especially supports moves towards a better alignment of international currencies as part of the development of international trade and the development of economies. The position with regard to EMS clearly involves a political decision and, as our relations abroad are guided clearly by the economic interests of our people, when the decision on this occasion comes to be made it will be equally guided and informed.</P>
    <P>Despite the stormy sea of monetary instability in recent times Ireland has managed to stay afloat.  Our expectation is that EMS, as a system that is both wide-ranging and flexible, will facilitate stability not just in the exchange rate but also in other economic areas.  It is our expectation also that it will provide the climate internationally that will ensure that the smaller, weaker countries of the world will have a better guarantee that exchange rate fluctuations which have posed problems for them will not undermine their programmes or cut across the co-operation between the rich and the poor which, I think, is becoming a more clear characteristic of international co-operation.</P>
    <P>Whether we talk in terms of what must be done at home, what must be done within Europe or what must be done in conjunction with our partners &mdash;all of which I have endeavoured to do&mdash;it is obvious that the one thing the EMS system needs is a high degree of solidarity and co-operation.  Everyone must co-operate to make the system work.  As Davis put it, &ldquo;None can be safe or sound but in the other's weal&rdquo;.  It is self-evident that if we enter the <Col N="573" /> system&mdash;and this applies also to other small member states&mdash;we will be better placed to protect our own interests and, as I said at the beginning, we will be able to influence decisions that will effect us in any event.  A greater cohesion within the European Community implies greater security for the less-developed economies in the Community.</P>
    <P>Obviously each country must take its own decision.  For one reason or another there has been here a particular interest, if not concentration, on what position the British Government are likely to take.  Quite clearly if the Government here decide to participate it is obvious that we hope the British Government will make a similar decision.  We have no desire whatever to see a situation where monetary divergencies should become a barrier between us and Northern Ireland for instance, and for that matter with Britain which remains a major trading partner.  So far as the North is concerned it is fairly clear that the Government's policies have been directed towards removing barriers rather than erecting them.  So far as our relations with Britain are concerned, we have always made it clear in the formulation of our Northern policy that what we want to see is an even fuller and more harmonious relationship than that which has developed in recent years.  Accordingly, it is self-evident from the political and economic points of view, because both are interrelated, that it would be very much our wish that both Britain and Ireland would join the system together on appropriate conditions.</P>
    <P>The creation of such a zone of monetary stability, by leading towards a process of integration within Europe, would benefit both parts of this island. Within the larger area of co-operation and increased prosperity which an evolving Community would provide, it would also contribute to an environment where the people of the North would come to perceive the common interests they share with us.  Indeed, our partners in Britain and elsewhere would become much more conscious of the interests we share in common disciplines and in common programmes.</P>
    <P>Our success so far on the economic front has brought with it a new mood of <Col N="574" /> confidence.  This new mood may not be always accepted here at home; I believe it is always acknowledged, though not publicly, and certainly it is perceived clearly from abroad.  This has led to a greater awareness of our potential as a people and to a new willingness to explore how that can best be realised in the future not just within this State but in the island as a whole.  The Government consider that the proposed new monetary arrangements in Europe can help to consolidate these developments.  Nothing is going to change, nothing will be imposed unless by agreement.  We have made that very clear.  However, we believe that certain inevitable developments that are occurring&mdash;not all of which are promoted here as in this case&mdash;create a climate which, by responding at the right time and in the right fashion, can create conditions for new prosperity and progress for all of us.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there can be no looking back.  Our confidence in our capacity to achieve and maintain economic development is a keystone in our policy generally and also in our policy towards the North of Ireland, as I pointed out recently.  It is our hope that both parts of Ireland will be able to join the system together, but whatever may be the decision the Government feel confident that through discipline and foresight we can chart a course towards greater prosperity that will be to the benefit of all our people.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to engage in speculation but if Britain were to decide for one reason or another against participation&mdash;and I sincerely hope she does not choose this course&mdash;our decision would have to take account of that groundswell of confidence in our own economy and in our political capacity. Certainly it will not be based on any timorous attitude towards new opportunities. If it should happen that we were to enter and that Northern Ireland were to be excluded at that stage from the new currency area, we can only say that we would make every effort to ensure that any consequential administrative arrangements would be kept to the minimum necessary.</P>
    <P>In this context the House can be assured that the current pace of <Col N="575" /> development in cross-Border economic activity will be maintained and the Government are committed to ensuring as far as they can that the fruits of economic success in a new area of economic and monetary stability in Europe will extend to all people in this island.  It is a question of new options and new economic and political conditions in Europe and in the world. As we have proved in recent times, by responding positively to these options there is a very fruitful place for us in Europe and, through Europe, with our partners in the developing countries and in the rest of the world.  While the examination and studies are continuing the important thing is that we have a political will at home and abroad and a political capacity and respect that will enable the Government to take the right decisions.  It would seem that this move towards a European Monetary System is very much in line with the approach which our Government have followed in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have proved by their speeches to the House that this debate was very largely premature. There is no harm, when there is so little legislation, in the Dáil spending a few days debating in a very general way the implications of allying ourselves with a new European Monetary System, but it is evident that the Government so far have not thrashed out privately and in their own Departments the implications of this system, have not yet started asking themselves some questions which are important, whether or not the British join this system as well, and which are absolutely crucial if it should emerge that the British decide not to join and we are left with the option of staying in or going out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to do the best I can with the hints which I see in the speeches, but I detect something less than unity of view between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance on a very important matter, namely whether Ireland will commit itself to entry into this system irrespective of the British decision.  I could not help noticing yesterday that <Col N="576" /> the Taoiseach was very indignant at a suggestion by Deputy P. Barry that he had said that irrespective of the British decision we were going to join.  He denied that he had ever said such a thing.  He asked for chapter and verse and I have to concede that he did not get them; nonetheless, I am on the side of Deputy Barry in this matter.  There is no question but that the impression was created from the Government side in the middle of September that their decision in principle was made in favour of joining irrespective of whether the British decided to do so.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach was at pains yesterday to disclaim any determination of his own to join this system irrespective of what the British did.  To do so he was prevaricating, something of which he has been guilty in this House on numberless occasions.  He did not invite Deputy Barry to correct himself by recalling that it was the Minister for Finance who said it.  I had that impression when I read the Taoiseach's speech and tried to compare it with the Minister's speech.  I could see something clear to anybody used to the Fianna Fáil mentality, that the Taoiseach's performance has given rise to misgivings, and to misgivings in his Department as to the advisability irrespective of what the British may do, of joining this system.  I will give chapter and verse on this matter tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions 1 and 2 together.  The price increases referred to by the Deputy in Question No. 2 were recommended by the National Prices Commission and then accepted by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The July report of the commission, a copy of which is in the Library, estimates that these increases, if approved, would add 0.7 per cent to the increase in the consumer price index.  I should point out that several of the increases recommended by the commission had already been implemented before the consumer price index for mid-August was taken.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the implication in the Deputy's questions that there is an upward move in the level of inflation which will lead to double digit inflation in 1979. The Government's policy as indicated in the White Paper, &ldquo;National Development 1977-1980,&rdquo; and repeated in the Green Paper, &ldquo;Development for Full Employment&rdquo;, has been to achieve a substantial reduction in the rate of inflation in the period from 1977 to 1980.

Would he agree that the lagged effect of these price increases must surely be a figure of approximately 9 per cent for the November figure? Leaving that aside, if Government intentions in relation to phasing out food subsidies or raising indirect taxation on other items are carried through is it not obvious that we would have an inflation rate after the budget next year of more than 10 per cent or leading towards that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions No. 14 to 17 together.</P>
      <P>Persons covered by medical cards may obtain prescribed medicines free of charge.  In the case of coeliac disease this includes certain gluten-free foods and, of course, drugs needed for heart conditions are covered.</P>
      <P>Persons with limited eligibility are entitled to claim a refund of the cost of prescribed medicines in excess of £6.50 for a calendar month.  This scheme also covers foods prescribed for persons with coeliac disease and drugs for heart conditions. Next April entitlement to the latter scheme will be extended to the remainder of the population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the great expense incurred and the long-term treatment involved for patients suffering from heart disease would the Minister not consider that it might alleviate some of the anxiety and distress caused them by (a) the rather cumbersome and over-elaborate method of explaining the cost of the drugs and (b) the anxiety in the initial stages of the disease itself and the anxiety overall associated with it? Would it not be more facile for the Minister to give <i>carte blanche</i> to patients suffering from heart disease rather than <Col N="592" /> having to pay for the majority of their drugs and seeking reimbursement in a rather over-elaborate fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation at present is as I have outlined to the Deputy. Of course people who are entitled to the general medical services get everything free of charge.  As and from next April the remainder of the population will be able to get all their requirements free of charge subject to the £6.50 per month.  I am not aware that it is all that cumbersome a scheme.  As the Deputy knows, the situation is that an individual purchases his requirements and then gets a refund.  If there is any way in which that refund scheme could be expedited I would certainly be glad to examine that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that people suffering from coeliac disease are in need of a constant special diet and consequently are involved in constant heavy and special expenditure? Would he not accept that for that reason this disease ought be included on the list of long-term illnesses which would entitle them to full consideration for the special cost involved rather than having to go through the unsatisfactory procedure of seeking refunds if they are within the eligible categories as outlined by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that it would be better for these unfortunate sufferers if the disease were included on the list of long-term illnesses.  Of course there are many diseases competing for inclusion on that list and which we are just not able at present to accommodate. The long-term illness scheme will be reviewed again before the end of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether at this point there is any possibility of giving priority to two or three of these diseases which apparently cause most social as well as individual distress?  I agree that a case can be made quite properly for the inclusion of all of these diseases that will be the subject of a review.  I agree with Deputy Boland, and perhaps other Deputies, that the sufferers <Col N="593" /> of coeliac disease and their families appear to be subject to particular pressures.  Would the Minister give any indication of his view on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very expensive to include one of these diseases in the long-term illness scheme.  There are other groups equally insistent that other particular ailments should be included.  I would ask Deputies to leave the matter over for the present.  I will be looking at the long-term illness scheme generally between now and the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we would be reviewing the scheme with a view to disimproving it.

Of course, any representations which Deputies, Senators or indeed particular organisations wish to make will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a need to improve the position in relation to the prevention and control of drug abuse and illicit traffic in drugs.  The Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, was passed by the Oireachtas for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparation of regulations which will enable the Act to be brought fully into operation is at an advanced stage and I <Col N="599" /> intend to make the regulations and the commencement order for various provisions of the Act in the next month or so.</P>
    <P>So far as peddling of drugs is concerned the Act makes provision for penalties of up to a £3,000 fine or 14 years' imprisonment, or both, at the discretion of the court.  These would seem to be sufficiently penal to procure the objective.</P>
    <P>I should say also that there is no evidence available to me to justify Deputy Byrne's contention that there is a widespread increasing problem of drug abuse in this country.</P>

      <P>Predecessors of the Minister have always referred to the chief medical officer of the corporation. Recently the CMO indicated that there would appear to be an increase in the incidence of certain illnesses among people living in high-rise dwellings in Dublin. Bearing this in mind why have not the Department communicated with the CMO with a view to obtaining a satisfactory and comprehensive answer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is due to the fact that in these larger complexes there is an underground central heating mechanism in operation.  Having regard to the CMO informing the Minister of an increase in ill-health among people in high-rise dwellings, would he not initiate an inquiry into the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct. Dublin Corporation's medical officer of health is firmly of the opinion that high-rise units in themselves do not contribute to ill-health and he is not aware of any increased incidence of illness among people living in such buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to intervene in the medical argument but is the Minister not aware of reports of a high incidence of nervous disorders among people in high-rise complexes abroad?  This evidence was one of the main reasons for high-rise development being discontinued in other places.  On the basic evidence available from abroad and also from the cases related to Deputies in their constitutencies, is the Minister not aware of the apparently high incidence of alleged mental depression arising from such considerations as distance and the sense of isolation experienced in high-rise buildings?  Would the Minister be prepared to initiate an inquiry with a view to ascertaining an accurate picture of the situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that the Deputy will accept that in this matter I must be guided principally by the Dublin medical officer of health who is the medical scientific man on the spot and he does not accept that high-rise buildings of themselves are responsible for any specific level of illness.  Those of us who are familiar with the area concerned are aware that for a long time it was a most unpopular area and one from which many tenants were anxious to be transferred.  I am not sure that that continues to be the case.</P>

Agreement has, however, been reached with the Eastern Health Board for the provision of a cardiac ambulance service in the Dublin area, shortly.  Arrangements are at present being made for the training of the ambulance men in the use of the special equipment to be installed in the ambulances.  In the meantime an ambulance service for medical emergencies, including cardiac cases, is being provided in Dublin by the fire brigade ambulance service.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's suggestion that hospital interns might travel with ambulances to accidents I am advised that it would be difficult to arrange that the interns would be immediately available to accompany the ambulances, particularly in areas such as Dublin where the ambulances are not stationed at hospitals.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>During the recent dispute which affected the telephone system my Department kept in touch with hospital authorities and health boards regarding the effect of the dispute on their services.  There were very few instances reported of difficulties in contacting ambulance services.  A particular problem arose in relation to the Eastern Health Board ambulances stationed at James's Street for a short period due to accidental damage to telephone cables.</P>
      <P>The general situation was kept under constant review by my Department with a view to taking appropriate action when the need arose and the same approach will be adopted should there be any further disruption of the telephone service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this problem is twofold, that if there is any disruption of the telephone service between the ambulance service and the person who needs this service or between the local doctor and the ambulance service, it may be impossible to obtain this service?  This was the case in many areas of the country when entire exchanges were out of order for months. Is the Minister not aware that many Members of the House have had examples of people having to travel seven and eight miles to a telephone before an ambulance could be obtained?  Would he not consider the suggestion that in any future disruption of the telephone service <Col N="609" /> use might be made of the radio links used by the Garda between their local Garda stations and their headquarters so that the ambulance service could be provided?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of Women made recommendations on the provision of day care for children of working mothers.  The Minister for Labour is responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the recommendations made by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health, I have a responsibility for the care of children of families in need of special support.  Accordingly, health boards support the provision of nursery and day care facilities for children of these families. <Col N="611" /> The categories normally provided for are children of single parent families; children whose mothers have been deserted or widowed and have to find employment because of economic necessity; and children of parents who, because of illness of similar circumstances, are not able to cope with the children at home without special support.</P>
    <P>The number of nursery centres and crêches being provided or supported by the health boards is now 66 as compared to 31 in 1975.  In addition, health boards give a variety of supports to pre-school playgroups run by community groups.</P>
    <P>The policy of encouraging and supporting voluntary groups to provide day care facilities, for the categories of children I have mentioned, will continue. In the Eastern Health Board area, nurseries will in future be provided in each new major health centre and the board will, where necessary, provide small revenue grants to pre-school playgroups who up to now have been relying solely on local authority and community support.</P>
    <P>Facilities provided with the support of a health board are subject to inspection and monitoring by officers of the board. The question of establishing and implementing minimum standards for all nursery centres is one of the matters being considered by the Task Force on Child Care Services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In other countries at the beginning of the development of those things, because of the changing pattern of both parents going out to work, there was great abuse in regard to the provision of crêches.  Will it be long before the study group are likely to report to the Minister so that he can take action in the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not terribly worried about those because I am sure they are well run.  What about the private ones that are now being set up all over the place?  Obviously, children separated from their parents in this way are particularly difficult and the level of care would have to be particularly high. Instead of that it seems that anybody that can provide a room for the children feels they are able to supervise.</P>

      <P>I know I am somewhat out of order but I am subject to your direction in this matter, Sir.  It has to do with a special notice question on the school transport strike, particularly the all-out strike in Donegal.  I did get your disallowance notice this morning.  The reason given was that the matter had been dealt with by way of a written reply to Deputy Horgan's question No. 514 of yesterday.  I was not even aware of it nor was it available.  However, I did find the question and it does not seem to be the same question.  Deputy Horgan asked the Minister what he intended to do to prevent a recurrence of the school transport strike, whereas my question asked what the Minister was doing in the matter and to intervene immediately to bring the current strike to a halt.  I am sorry I had to raise this matter here but the Chair is aware that I was only in a position to give him a short note on what I am saying during Question Time.</P>

    <P>The legislation will enable the Minister for Health to prohibit particular kinds of advertising and sponsorship, to restrict expenditure in these areas, and to control the form and content of tobacco <Col N="650" /> advertising.  It also provides for the furnishing, to the Minister for Health, of information necessary for the purposes of the Bill.  All this is contained in the key section, section 2.  The other four sections of the Bill contain the short title, definitions and provision for expenses and penalties.</P>
    <P>I shall endeavour to outline for Deputies the general background against which this legislation is being introduced, the need for it and the general lines along which I propose to proceed with its implementation.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that throughout the modern world Governments everywhere are increasingly concerned with the rising cost of health services on the one hand and the fact, on the other, that increasing expenditure is not matched by a corresponding improvement in general health and well-being.</P>
    <P>This contrast clearly arises from the pattern of modern living and points us in the direction of emphasising prevention as strongly as cure.  For this reason our health policy increasingly seeks to build up and develop the preventive function side by side with the curative one.  An essential element of this policy is to support those in the community who are anxious to maintain good health when they have it, and to procure acceptance of the view that each of us has a personal responsibility to act in a way that will maintain, as far as possible, sound physical and mental health.</P>
    <P>In the current year we have undertaken a number of campaigns designed to emphasise the preventive approach and support those who are anxious to maintain and improve their own health. These include a national hygiene campaign, a national fitness campaign, and, currently, a campaign designed to impress upon people the need for moderation in the consumption of alcohol&mdash;the first step in a determined attempt to reduce the impact of excessive drinking on the health and welfare of the individual members of the community.</P>
    <P>In attempting to implement such a positive health policy, we immediately come up against the problem of cigarette smoking and the widespread, intensive, glamorous advertising of tobacco products.  A positive campaign to <Col N="651" /> promote good health can only be of doubtful value in an environment saturated with the advertising of tobacco and alcohol&mdash;advertising which continues to grow in volume and sophistication.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has been particularly concerned with the menace of cigarette smoking in recent years.  As far back as 1975, it stated in a report that &ldquo;smoking related diseases are such important causes of disability and premature death in developed countries that the control of cigarette smoking could do more to improve health and prolong life in these countries than any other single action in the whole field of preventive medicine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In May of this year, the 31st World Health Assembly called for higher taxes to be levelled on cigarette sales and for restrictions to be imposed on tobacco promotion in the mass media.  The Assembly blamed tobacco smoking as a major cause of chronic bronchitis, emphysema and lung cancer and as a major risk factor in heart attacks, some pregnancy related disorders and other serious health problems.</P>
    <P>The Assembly also called on member states to strengthen health education programmes about smoking as part of general health education and urged comprehensive measures to control smoking by increasing taxation on cigarette sales and restricting, as far as possible, all forms of publicity for promotion of smoking.  It underlines also the rights of non-smokers &ldquo;to enjoy an atmosphere unpolluted by tobacco smoke&rdquo; and asked the World Health Organisation itself to co-operate with member states upon request in developing measures to control smoking publicity in the media.</P>
    <P>There is no need, however, for me to rely on any international authority to justify this legislation.  Our own domestic situation clearly demands that we act.</P>
    <P>The need for action can clearly be understood if we look at our own figures for deaths and illness which can be directly attributed to cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>In 1975, there were 1,191 deaths from lung cancer and associated conditions. At a conservative estimate, 70 per cent <Col N="652" /> of these deaths are attributable to smoking and we can take it, therefore, that at least 800 of those deaths were caused by smoking.</P>
    <P>But smoking is also a major factor in relation to two other important diseases. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema caused 250 deaths in 1975 in the active age group, 35 to 64, and it is calculated that at least 175 of these were attributable to smoking.  Coronary heart disease caused 9,795 deaths in the same year.  There are a number of factors associated with such deaths but it is accepted that cigarette smoking is a major causative factor and over 1,000 of these deaths can be attributed to it.</P>
    <P>Let us clearly accept, therefore, that in 1975 at least 2,000 Irish men and women died because they smoked.  And there is no reason, unfortunately, to believe that the number will be any less for 1978.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths caused by smoking related diseases, however, is only part of the total picture.  Large numbers of those who are hospital patients require treatment for diseases which are, to a greater or lesser extent, associated with smoking.  It has been estimated, for example, that as a direct result of smoking, over 6,500 people between 25 and 74 required hospital treatment in 1977 and that they spent over 100,000 bed-days in hospital in that year.</P>
    <P>The hospital admission figures are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg.  There are no reliable statistics about the number of persons who have to consult their general practitioner because of illnesses which are attributable to smoking. In the absence of detailed statistics, it is necessary to estimate the extent to which such illness requires the services of general practitioners.  One estimate suggests that, in the general medical services, over 70,000 calls on general practitioners are the direct result of smoking.</P>
    <P>Smoking related diseases cause deaths, long hospital stays and illness requiring consultation with general practitioners. The cost of treating these diseases has, conservatively, been put at about £15 million a year.  There are other costs which it is more difficult to estimate.  It has, for example, been <Col N="653" /> calculated that the total number of working days lost through tobacco associated illnesses would cost up to £30 million per annum.  These figures are difficult to calculate exactly and we are continuing our efforts to estimate them more precisely.  It is, however, clear beyond any dispute, that in dealing with the cost of smoking related diseases, we are dealing with a very substantial cost, not only in the direct charge to our health services, but in the social and other costs which of necessity arise through the illness of those who smoke.</P>
    <P>While the economic cost is something which we must take into account, it cannot reflect the amount of anguish, sorrow and hardship which smoking related deaths and illness give rise to for so many people.</P>
    <P>One can state calmly, factually and without emotion, that in our modern community cigarette smoking is responsible for a considerable amount of illness and a large number of deaths.  For the Government to permit the advertising of tobacco products to continue uncontrolled on a widespread scale in this situation would be simply irresponsible.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline for the House how I propose to proceed with the implementation of this legislation when it has been enacted.  First of all, to ensure that the Oireachtas is fully informed of what is happening, it is provided in subsection (3) of section 2 of the Bill that regulations made under the legislation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practical after they have been made and such regulations may be annulled by a resolution of either House.  I intend also to try to reach agreement with the tobacco manufacturers about the content of the regulations.  It is my intention to consult with them and give them an opportunity of putting forward their views upon the detailed provisions of the regulations before they are made.</P>
    <P>The controls which it is intended to impose upon the advertising of tobacco products here might, in certain circumstances, operate to the disadvantage of the Irish tobacco industry in competition against imported products.  More liberal codes are operated in other countries and this could create a situation in which <Col N="654" /> persuasive advertising of foreign brands would appear in foreign publications on sale here, particularly those which come from the United Kingdom.  I intend to ensure that the Irish industry will not be placed at any disadvantage in this way.  I believe that those concerned in the UK will respect the statutory standards imposed here but if some do not, measures will have to be taken to deal with such a situation.</P>
    <P>The aspects of this legislation, perhaps, which have attracted most comment and interest among the general public, certainly among those interested in sporting and athletic activities, are the provisions dealing with sponsorship.  I would like to make it clear that it is not my intention to interfere with existing sponsorships to any great extent for the present.  I realise that precipitate action in this area might cause serious problems for sporting bodies and organisations generally.  Accordingly, it would be my intention to begin by controlling the volume of sponsorship and preventing the undertaking of new sponsorships except in very special circumstances. I will also go carefully into the extent of the sales promotion of tobacco products engaged in during the event sponsored.</P>
    <P>The regulations also will provide for the control of the total amount spent on advertising and the nature and content of such advertising.  The advertising of tobacco products in cinemas will be phased out almost immediately.  All forms of outdoor poster and sign advertising will be phased out by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that CIE has already taken the initiative in restricting, prior to phasing out, tobacco advertising. I shall be asking them to consider increasing the availability of non-smoking areas on trains and buses and to intensify the efforts they are already making to persuade their customers that they should observe these non-smoking areas.</P>
    <P>Those who travel abroad will have noticed that Aer Lingus in common with other European airlines have now provided non-smoking areas in their planes and passengers are specifically requested not to smoke in those areas and this request is normally complied with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> Aer Rianta have, I am also glad to say, recently provided no smoking zones in the arrival and departure lounges of our airports.  I shall be writing to hoteliers and restaurant owners asking them to ensure that in their dining rooms, non-smoking areas are made available for those persons who do not smoke and who do not wish to have smoking thrust upon them.</P>
    <P>Health boards will be asked to ensure that smoking will not be permitted in the hospital wards and to make it clear to visitors that they should not smoke in the wards.  I shall be asking other Departments to co-operate in restricting areas in which smoking may take place and in ensuring, as far as possible, that the norm should be that in the majority of offices smoking will not in future be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I hope those who smoke and who wish to continue to smoke will not feel that they are being unduly discriminated against.  I am not entitled, and I have no wish to interfere with the right of any citizen to decide whether or not he or she will smoke.  I have, however, a duty to consider also the rights of those who have decided that they do not wish to smoke and who regard an environment free from smoke as something to which they have a right.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I regard this Bill as an important piece of legislation. While it is limited and specific in its intent, its existence and its passage by the Houses of the Oireachtas will be evidence of a more general change in our approach to the health problems with which we are faced.  It will, in my view, make clear the Government's intention to take positive action to protect the health of our people when it lies in their power to do so.</P>
    <P>The passage of the legislation will enable all those engaged in the administration of our health services to talk with conviction and credibility, especially to young people, about preventive medicine and positive health, and will place us among the leading European nations in the spreading international effort to prevent death and illness <Col N="656" /> from smoking related diseases.  It is in this spirit that I commend it to Deputies for a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>I shall listen carefully to the views of Deputies on these proposals and consider any suggestions they may wish to make for their improvement or for the better regulation of the situation generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of what the Minister has said goes without saying, so to speak.  The danger and injury to health and sickness due to tobacco smoking are fairly well proven and known to all of us.  It is no harm, I suppose, that the Minister should set them out again this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In this measure he is taking upon himself very wide-ranging powers to control advertising, placing of advertising, the degree of sponsorship and other matters concerned with promotion of tobacco products and brands.  In that respect I do not suppose there can be any objection to this very worth-while goal which is, as he has taken pains to point out, part of an overall policy of publicity and public relations which he has engaged in over the past year in order to promote the general health of the nation and encourage people, apparently through his personal involvement in the campaign, to adopt a healthier lifestyle.</P>
      <P>There is an old saying that charity begins at home.  When Governments and people in public life express good intentions, one of the best ways for them to give good example is to practise what they preach.  There is nothing in this Bill to suggest that the Government, through the Minister for Finance, will take one penny less in revenue from excise duty raised on the sale of tobacco or tobacco products, or to suggest that, if they feel this is such a wrong and harmful activity, they will not allow the State's activities to be funded from moneys raised through the sale of tobacco or tobacco products, or alternatively, that they intend to tax them so heavily, as was suggested by the 1977 report of the Medico Social Research Board, that they will be less attractive to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he has the power in this Bill&mdash;but it is not spelled out in the Bill&mdash;to make regulations governing <Col N="657" /> outdoor advertising, indoor advertising, advertising in the media and in cinemas, degrees of sponsorship and displays of outdoor signs to promote the sale of tobacco products.  Over the past eight or nine years on various occasions here and in other places, I have objected to Bills being published which are so vague as almost not to disclose what their intent is, and which give to a Minister and his successors, which is often the most worrying part of it, very wide-ranging powers, almost <i>carte blanche</i> powers to do what they will by way of order or regulation.  That is not good legislation. It gives too much power to a Minister to act in any way he might decide either now or afterwards.  There might be a Minister who wanted to carry things to an extreme.  Therefore I am not happy because this Bill does not state clearly what the Minister intends to do. He told us more in his speech introducing the Bill this afternoon than is contained in the Bill, the explanatory memorandum or anything published in connection with the printing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The most important section of the Bill is section 2 which gives the Minister power to make regulations.  A degree of doubt has been built up, not consciously I am sure by the Minister, as to whether, when the Bill becomes law, existing sponsorships by tobacco firms will be allowed to continue.  Many of the organisations who benefit from those sponsorships are now in a dilemma because they cannot plan for the future with any certainty.  They do not know whether or not they will be able to enjoy the fruits of such sponsorship in time to come.  Before the Bill was published it was indicated that it would contain a provision stating that existing sponsorships would not be interfered with and would be allowed to continue.  I was not surprised when the Bill was published to see no mention of existing sponsorships.  Subsequent to a statement by me calling for clarification, the Minister went out of his way at a public function to suggest organisations need not be afraid of losing existing sponsorships as a result of the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>While some of us may not agree with tobacco firms sponsoring events, we <Col N="658" /> have to agree that a number of very worth-while sporting events have grown to a magnitude they would not otherwise have achieved without the level of sponsorship they were given by tobacco firms.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that it is not my intention to interfere with existing sponsorships to any great extent for the present.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how the Minister will provide for this in the regulations made under section 2.  If he does not make provision for it no undertaking is given, and there can be no certainty in the minds of people enjoying those sponsorships that they can continue to enjoy them.  On the other hand, I cannot see how the Minister could build in a section which allowed existing sponsorships to continue.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of an Irish open golf event which has been sponsored by one major Irish tobacco firm over the years.  It is now of worldwide importance and one of the premier golfing events on the European circuit.  Sometime this year this was described by a leading Irish journalist as being sponsorship at its very finest.  Under this Bill that organisation may be notified by the Minister next year that they can no longer enjoy the sponsorship which has brought them worldwide repute and provided so much enjoyment for so many people.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the Minister can provide for such a situation in the Bill or in the regulations because then it would appear as if he were clearly discriminating in favour of tobacco firms already sponsoring events and giving them an unfair advantage against firms who were not.  In the case of organisations who are running events, some of them enjoy sponsorships and some of them do not, if the Minister were to make regulations which had the effect of allowing existing sporting or other organisations to continue to enjoy existing sponsorships, while preventing other sporting or cultural organisations from applying for sponsorships, it would appear as if the Minister were discriminating as between one group and another.  Therefore he would have to have regard to Article 40 of the Constitution which provides:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
    <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say it is his intention to phase out or stop outdoor tobacco advertising and to stop tobacco firms sponsoring events and, at the same time, he will not interfere with events which are being sponsored at present.  That is all very well as far as good intentions are concerned, but how enforceable is it under the Constitution and under the law?</P>
    <P>Is this part of a big public relations exercise to suggest smoking is injurious to the health?  If a tobacco firm are told they can continue to sponsor a golfing event but they may not sponsor a water skiing event next year, I do not see why the water skiing organisers cannot say: &ldquo;Under the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution we are equally entitled to receive consideration for sponsorship from any commercial firm, and we have the same right to sponsorship as a golfing organisation who already enjoy sponsorship and are allowed to continue enjoying sponsorship under the Minister's regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister intends to make regulations providing for the continuation of existing sponsorships, while militating against the creation of new ones, he will have to pay very careful attention indeed to the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution because of possible legal actions arising out of his regulations, legal actions which might make a laughing stock of the Bill and the Minister's regulations.  From that point of view I should like the Minister to dwell at some length in his reply on whether or not there has been attention paid to this particular aspect in the formulation of the Bill or in the consideration of the regulations.</P>
    <P>So much for organisations.  I can see considerable worry and upset where sporting organisations are concerned should precipitate action be taken <Col N="660" /> prohibiting sponsorship by tobacco firms.  I am not here to hold any brief for these firms but we are examining legislation and it might legitimately be argued that there is discrimination.  Suppose an American firm arrived here anxious to manufacture brands of tobacco which are not sold here at present, and they wanted to promote their product and get a share of the market, but discovered they were prohibited by this Bill from engaging in sponsorship whilst existing firms engaged in sponsorship prior to the passing of the Act were allowed to continue that sponsorship, the position could be a very serious one.  I am informed that that firm could have a very interesting tour through the courts since it would be open to them to challenge the law.  That is something that should exercise the mind of the Minister in making regulations.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of organisations which might feel deprived of finance from tobacco firms because those firms did not have sponsorship prior to the passing of this Act, and from the point of view of firms which might feel there was unfair trading advantage as between them and old established firms, it is very important that the Minister should explain to us how he envisages getting over the difficulties inherent in the provisions of Article 40, to say nothing of the attitude of the courts from the point of view of both natural and social justice.  If this Bill is to have any real effect these points will have to be clarified.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he intends to introduce control of the level of advertising. From the wording of the Bill I take it the expectation is that over a period of time the amount of advertising will be controlled so as to reduce interest in tobacco products.  I suppose that is quite laudable but I cannot see that it will be enforceable.  The Minister referred to the position of the Irish industry as opposed to the foreign industry, particularly that of the UK, and he suggested that those concerned in the UK will possibly respect the statutory standards imposed here and, if they do not do so, he says measures will have to be taken to deal with that situation.  In effect, he will tell the manufacturers operating here they <Col N="661" /> can spend only a certain amount on advertising in any one year.  He may suggest the type of advertising.  That would be all very well if no one else was selling these products other than those manufacturing here and if there were not firms manufacturing here the same brands of cigarettes as those sold in the United Kingdom and in the USA.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting he will restrict the amount of advertising by the three firms manufacturing here?  They would, of course, have the same restrictions imposed but their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK and USA manufacturers would be disadvantageous because newspapers and periodicals in which these foreign firms advertise the same brand names of cigarettes and tobacco circulate widely here.  What the Minister suggests would discriminate very heavily then against the domestic manufacturers because they do not engage in manufacture elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean wholly owned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They do not advertise to any degree in the United Kingdom, for example, and consequently they do not have the benefit of what one might describe as the overspill advertising in British publications circulating here.  This kind of thing was done in regard to British Unit Trusts. They are not allowed to advertise here but they get over that by inserting in the advertisements in the financial papers and magazines which circulate freely here a saver saying that the particular advertisement does not apply to people living in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one Irish firm which does not have the benefit of overspill advertising from the United Kingdom or the USA. It relies almost wholly on advertising in the media here.  Any restriction, therefore, will be patently unfair to this firm because it does not have the benefit of the overspill from foreign publications. The Minister says that if UK firms do not respect the statutory standards measures will be taken to redress the situation.  Will he have little men at every point of entry, armed with scissors, cutting out every advertisement from every <Col N="662" /> newspaper, magazine and journal coming in here carrying tobacco and cigarette advertising?</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister should clarify the position of the Irish firm <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other firms which enjoy the benefit of overspill advertising.  It is a large concern.  It employs many people. It is engaged in other facets of Irish industry apart from the tobacco industry. It would be a pity if the effect of this Bill were to hurt one wholly-owned Irish firm much more severely than international firms in a better position to bear the brunt of any such hurt.</P>
    <P>I complained at the outset about the lack of information in the Bill and the widespread powers which it gives to the Minister to make regulations.  I also notice that the Minister proposes to take powers to make regulations which might then be annulled within 21 sitting days. That annulment would not have any effect on any deed or lack of deed caused by the making of the regulations.  I object to that sort of provision when it is unnecessary and it is totally unnecessary in this case.  That subsection should provide for a draft of regulations to be laid before the House and provide also for consultations with the industry and with the organisation which is being sponsored.  If the Minister is to make regulations which appear suddenly to interfere with a planned sponsored event, which might be of disastrous consequences to the cultural or sporting organisations which had anticipated large-scale sponsorship, there should be a proper opportunity beforehand for these organisations to consult with the Minister and put their point of view as to why they had invited particular firms to sponsor them.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting anything very revolutionary.  Section 2 (12) of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970 states:</P>
    <P>An order shall not be made under this section without prior consultation by the Minister with such persons as appear to him to be substantially interested in the general subject-matter of the order unless, in the case of an order under subsection (11) of this section, it is, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary to make the order without such consultation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> It is provided in the Consumer Information Bill enacted earlier this year that an order shall not be made under the Act without prior consultation by the Minister with such persons as appear to him to be substantially interested in the subject matter of the order.</P>
    <P>A fair amount has been achieved by the Minister's predecessors by way of consultation with the tobacco industry and related interests in having advertising phased out from television and various other places.  It would be fairer to suggest that with the enactment of this legislation there would also be consultation, both with the firms and with the organisations which were to enjoy sponsorship or which enjoy such sponsorship at present, in cases where the Minister proposes to see the level of sponsorship reduced or obliterated completely. I suggest that there should be contained in the Bill a revised subsection allowing in a statutory way for that consultation to take place.  I appreciate that the Minister said it is his intention to consult with manufacturers about the contents of the regulations.  There should also be the intention to consult with the sporting or cultural organisations which may lose their sponsorship before regulations are made affecting such sponsorship.  It is only proper that this consultation should be provided for in a statutory way, as was done in the Consumer Information Act and the Merchandise Marks Act.</P>
    <P>If the Minister believes as firmly as he apparently does that it is harmful to have the present degree of tobacco advertising and sponsorship and if he intends phasing that out, then I contend and genuinely believe that the people who should not be hurt by that are the sporting or cultural organisations at present enjoying the benefit of sponsorship. In most cases the reason why these organisations are getting sponsorship from the tobacco firms is that they have not the financial resources to stage the events from their own funds and because over the years they have not received from whatever Government the sort of assistance needed to enable them to operate these events.  Sometimes they are <Col N="664" /> of international consequence and sometimes they are no larger than a village fete or carnival.  One is not less important than the other because they provide enjoyment and entertainment and improve the general ambience of life.  If they are being helped to do that by the tobacco firms because they cannot provide enough from their own resources, then it is more shame on the State for not engaging more in the provision of financial assistance.</P>
    <P>If we are really serious in suggesting that the lifestyle of the country will be improved by stopping advertising of tobacco products and stopping sponsorship by tobacco firms, then we should also be prepared to say that the State will make good the money lost to these organisations.  I do not know the amount of money put into such organisations at present by the tobacco firms and perhaps the Minister would give some indication of that figure.  I invite the Minister seriously to consider this idea. Many more people would believe in his earnestness in the introduction of this Bill were he to say that in relation to the phasing out of sponsorship of existing events he would envisage the replacement of that sponsorship by a Government subsidy or by the sponsorship of a State body or Government-funded body concerned in a direct or indirect way in promoting the general health and well-being of the nation.  If this Bill is operated seriously&mdash;I was going to say &ldquo;ruthlessly&rdquo; but I do not think that would be fair&mdash;then in the short term the ones who will suffer are those voluntary groups putting on sporting and cultural events.  I think that would not be the intention or desire of any Member of this House.  I would have much more enthusiasm for this measure if the Minister were to say that while phasing out sponsorship by tobacco firms he would phase in alternative sponsorship by the State or by State organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the growth during the past few years in the provision of non-smoking areas in public places.  That is a much more practical way of bringing home to people the dangers and annoyance to non-smokers from smoking than many of the other things which have been done during the <Col N="665" /> past year.  I am in a rather unique position to comment on this.  For five-and-a half years I was in the ranks of the non-smokers. From their viewpoint I was able to see quite clearly the things which dawned on the Minister at a later date when he joined those ranks.  At the end of that five-and-a-half years&mdash;I do not know if it was by coincidence or otherwise&mdash;I found myself regularly sitting here opposite the Minister listening to him speaking in relation to various pieces of legislation in the health field. Soon afterwards I discovered that I was once again in the ranks of the smokers so I can now look at this legislation from the point of view of someone who is a considerable number of years without smoking and who at the same time understands how a smoker might view the provisions set out in this Bill.  I want to say that as someone who smokes I see no objection to the idea of restriction on advertising or restriction on sponsorship. I have a personal point of view in that it has always puzzled me why tobacco firms engaged in the business of sponsoring horse races or golf events and so on because if I smoke brand &ldquo;A&rdquo; and spend my afternoon looking at a race meeting sponsored by brand &ldquo;B&rdquo; I will still smoke brand &ldquo;A&rdquo; on my way home. I presume it is part of the general attempt to develop a good corporate image of being a firm interested in society and interested in keeping its brand name forward.</P>
    <P>I can accept that there is expert advice that the more the names of the brands are phased out from sponsorship or from advertising the better chance there is of encouraging people, especially young people, not to smoke or not to begin smoking.  I can see that there is a very laudable aim contained in this Bill but I am upset at the confusion that has arisen as to whether or not existing sponsorships are going to be allowed continue and if they are going to be allowed to continue as opposed to sponsorships yet to come I am intrigued to know how that can be achieved in view of the constitutional difficulties.  I am also very upset to think that sponsorships might be phased out and it will have the effect in the short term only of hurting the sporting organisations.  Let <Col N="666" /> me refer again to the 1977 report of the Medico Social Research Board.  When they advocated higher taxation as the means of reducing tobacco consumption, they suggested on page 74 of their report that alternative leisure activities will require developments such as better sports facilities.  This is when they were suggesting that there should be a means of attracting young people into worth-while projects.  I accept that the Minister's intention is to make the nation healthier by decreasing the interest in tobacco products by striking at the advertising and sponsorships but this may also, in the short term, be hurting some sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has tried already but I think he should have discussions with the Cabinet and with the Minister for Finance to see if on a reasonable basis, as tobacco sponsorship is phased out of sport or out of cultural events, it might be replaced on a guaranteed basis&mdash;not just on a hit-and-miss  basis&mdash;by a Government grant or by sponsorship by a State organisation. This is certainly something which the Government ought to consider and which would be well worth while.  I know there are other suggestions such as those in the British Press which will continue to be imported in here under the difficulties which I outlined and on which I would like to hear from the Minister. There are suggestions that there might be a tax levied on each packet of cigarettes or each piece of tobacco product which would go directly into a sports or cultural fund to be used by some of the organisations.  I do not know how popular that would be here or how acceptable it would be.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered that aspect of finding alternative funding for the sponsored events.  Perhaps he would comment on that in his reply.</P>
    <P>I welcome the intent of this Bill.  I am curious to know what form the regulations will take and I am curious to know what provision will be made for allowing existing sponsorships to continue without being accused of being unfair to organisations that do not enjoy sponsorship at present.  I am also genuinely concerned that nothing contained in this Bill when enacted would discriminate more <Col N="667" /> heavily against the wholly Irish-owned firms than it would against the other tobacco products but in so far as it aims to make the nation a healthier place and consequently a better place it would receive my support.  There are a few amendments that I would like to table on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the whole purpose of this Bill and concur with the Minister in his plea for greater emphasis to be placed on health education and on the preventive aspects of health. Contrary to what many may think, he is doing a good job in this respect.  I am conscious of the fact that it is not costing money.  I have maintained for a long time that in the field of health extra money does not necessarily mean more health.  The evidence is there to date.  In 1972 we spent £63 million on the health services and in 1978 this has jumped up to £340 million&mdash;this in a matter of six years.  It is correct and fair to say that the health of the community has not improved in the meantime.  One could throw more and more money into health and one would not necessarily have a healthier society but if one takes the proper steps in the proper directions and in the proper fields one could achieve a much healthier society.  If we make serious attempts to eliminate detrimental factors, such as smoking, we can improve the health of our community immeasurably. I cannot agree with Deputy Boland in saying there are so many faults with this Bill that it is better out.  I say we have to start somewhere.  We must take some steps on the road to improving the health of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is beyond doubt now that cigarettes are a major source of ill health and mortality in Ireland.  It has also been established that cancer of the lung is on the increase both in men and in women and the consequences of this disease are really disastrous.  To see people with it and to know that one must tell them that they have only a couple of years to live is very sad.  It is sad to know that the clock cannot be turned back and that the damage has been done by cigarettes. The evidence is irrefutable in this matter. <Col N="668" /> It is very serious.  To think that these people have been exploited and used by tobacco companies is reprehensible.  In situations such as this we are obliged to take measures to try to protect our people Besides the cancer with its high figure that the Minister referred to, which itself is a conservative figure because of the fact that I have known patients who have died of cancer of the lung and it has not been put on the death certificate and there are many more cases such as this.  The enormous amount of ill health as a result of cigarette smoking in the form of bronchitis, emphysema and bronchial asthma is really sad.  This smoking habit which results in chronic pulmonary ill health is responsible for personal misery, misery in the family, disability, lost working days.  In purely economic terms the cost to the State is phenomenal as the Minister has rightly pointed out.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that the figures he has made available to us are on the conservative side.  The Department have done the best they could with the figures they had, but the situation is a lot worse than the Minister has described.  We have the serious disability of thousands of our people suffering from coronary heart disease directly attributable to cigarette smoking.  We know the effects of cigarette smoking on the baby in the womb.</P>
    <P>We are obliged therefore to call a halt to the manufacturers who have used every means known to them to promote their products.  They have been ruthless, unscrupulous, without any regard to the damage they have done to our people through their subtle advertising.  They have instilled the idea in young people's minds that cigarette smoking is associated with all sorts of athletic prowess and physical good health.</P>
    <P>We have got to stop them in their tracks.  We must not show mercy to them.  Deputy Boland said that we should not be unfair to Irish cigarette manufacturers.  What have those people done?  They have not invested any money in research.  I have questioned them over the years and they have evaded my specific question, &ldquo;How much money have you invested in research?&rdquo;  They have instilled fears in <Col N="669" /> their employees that their jobs will be at stake if cigarette advertising is to be stopped.  The employees have come to me and said they would be out of jobs if I were to advocate legislation against cigarette advertising.</P>
    <P>Now that advertising has been banned from television the cigarette manufacturers have employed other means.  They have worked scientifically and have got their messages across on television by sports promotions.  Although they may not advertise on television they have been putting up the biggest posters possible at televised race and other sports meetings.  They have exploited television by every means at their disposal and they will continue to do so unless effective action is taken.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been severely watered down from the Minister's original concept of what is needed, and I am not casting any reflection on his integrity. His intention originally was that all tobacco company sponsorship of sports would end, but the vested interests have used their powers and have said: &ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go and no further&rdquo;.  They have money and power at their command at the highest levels, at banking level, and they can use that power. Deputy Noel Browne introduced a Private Members Bill to try to get tobacco advertising stopped and it was finally decided by the Minister that each cigarette package should contain a note of warning.  However, the manufacturers ensured that the warning could not be read readily because of the type face they used.  The warning also read that &ldquo;Smoking can damage your health&rdquo;. There is no doubt that smoking is injurious to health.  The American Surgeon General has decided that it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so and I hope the Minister will tell them that the type face used in the warning must be absolutely clear.  These vested interests are using all means to hoodwink the House and the public.  As I have said, they have promoted advertising aimed specifically at the young people, the result being that there are more and more young people <Col N="670" /> smoking.  Deputy Boland told us he would never be enticed to use one brand instead of another.  The fact is that most of the brands are produced by one company, so there is not a thing to that argument.</P>
      <P>We must reckon the enormous cost to the State in human terms and the enormous revenue the State has got from tobacco and is continuing to get.  The State has been using that revenue for its own purpose, and that is wrong in itself. I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill but I should like him to go to the Minister for Finance and advise him that the total revenue from tobacco duty be devoted to the establishment of a national sports council who would ensure forthwith that sports sponsorship by tobacco companies would end and that the promotion of physical health would be pursued at every level.  That is what is needed.  If the reply of the Minister for Finance is in the affirmative then we will know there is serious intent behind this Bill.  Without that intent the Bill is useless.  The Minister for Health is in conflict with the Department of Finance whose job it is to collect the revenue from cigarette duty.  The Minister must say: &ldquo;To hell with cigarettes and their manufacturers.  We will use this money for a purpose&rdquo;.  Then the Bill will have teeth and purpose.  Then the Government will show their sincerity&mdash;I do not doubt the Minister's personal sincerity.</P>
      <P>We all know that the survival of the newspapers depends on cigarette advertising and that it would be disastrous if our newspapers were to be affected adversely. Therefore, I should like to see some means being provided to compensate them.  We have been given the phrase &ldquo;to restrict advertising and control expenditure&rdquo;. That is ambiguous.  How do you do it?  Will the Minister go on last year's budget?  How will it be decided?  I do not wish to cast any reflection on the Minister's intelligence but I am afraid they will hoodwink him on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the provisions in this Bill that the Government will permit advertising and this nullifies the purpose of the Bill.  There are various other measures that the Minister might consider within the framework of the Bill.  We should consider encouraging the insurance industry to offer special incentives to those in charge of businesses and public buildings who forbid smoking on their premises.  The insurance companies could offer a reduction in the insurance premium.  This could go a long way towards curtailing or eliminating smoking in public buildings.  The owners of cinemas might be offered a similar incentive <Col N="672" /> on condition that they forbade smoking on their premises.</P>
      <P>We should create as much inconvenience as possible for smokers, not to restrict their freedom but in their own interest when we know smoking is so damaging to their health.  This is nothing new or innovative on my part.  People are not allowed to smoke in cinemas in the United States; there is an interval during a film show and if people wish to smoke they must do so in a restricted area.  Such measures might be of help in encouraging people to give up cigarette smoking.  With regard to the matter of reaching agreement with the tobacco manufacturers on the content of the regulations, this appears to me as if we are once again playing into their hands. They will decide what form will suit them; otherwise the regulations will not be implemented.  That means the vested interests in the tobacco industry will take over.</P>
      <P>In the light of all of these points I wonder if we are achieving anything by the Bill?  Can we amend it even now to make it more effective?  Can we get the co-operation of the Minister for Finance to ensure that the Bill is effective and that the cultural and sporting organisations who will suffer as a result are compensated or helped in some other way?  I do not agree that there should be a lapse of time before sponsorship stops.  I do not think those involved in the tobacco industry have any interest in sports or in cultural activities.  They are not benevolent societies.  That is not their purpose.</P>
      <P>When will the provisions of the Bill be implemented?  Will it happen this year? The misuse of drugs legislation was passed more than a year ago and I was surprised to learn that it will require a set of regulations before it can come into effect. I should like the Minister to tell me if the regulations with regard to the Bill before the House will be made this year or will it be another two or three years? Will we get the same reply as we got to-day with regard to the Misuse of Drugs Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be made this year, as soon as the Bill is passed.  They <Col N="673" /> will become effective immediately after that.</P>

      <P>Because of my ignorance regarding the matter I did not ask the same question when we were dealing with the legislation on the misuse of drugs and I was astounded to hear that the provisions of that Act have not come into effect.  Have we an assurance from the Minister that this Bill will be implemented by the end of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that the regulations will be made almost immediately the legislation is passed.  I have indicated that some of the points in the legislation are in operation already. There will be no delay.  The Deputy need not worry about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Understandable concern was expressed by Deputy Boland about magazines and newspapers imported here which contain cigarette advertising and I suppose that is a fair point.  I wonder if the Minister has taken the initiative in consulting with his opposite number in Britain on what measures they propose taking with regard to restricting cigarette advertising? I feel sure he will get full co-operation from the Minister there; in fact, he may succeed in persuading Mr. David Ennals to introduce more effective measures in Britain.  I should also like to know from the Minister if he has consulted the Ministers of Health in the other EEC countries with regard to this matter.  Perhaps he will explain to us if the EEC propose bringing into effect any directives, recommendations or orders with regard to cigarette advertising in the EEC.  If that is being done, this Bill may be superseded by regulations or directives that will be more effective.  The Minister knows that the Brussels bureaucracy is much more powerful now than Dáil Eiréann.  The Minister should have some information on what steps are being taken in this direction by the EEC.  They have been leading the field in so many areas akin to this and it may be that they have some proposals on this matter also.  I would not be too alarmed if that were the case.  In fact, I should welcome any such directives or <Col N="674" /> proposals.  I would be very glad if the Minister could persuade his colleague in Britain to adopt the necessary measures to restrict cigarette advertising in newspapers and magazines that are imported here.  This is a very important point.</P>
      <P>We should aim to eliminate cigarette smoking completely.  I do not think it is an impossible task if it is approached in the right way.  We should allay the fears of employees that they might lose their jobs if this happens.  It is a very real fear and we should do something to help in such a situation.</P>
      <P>Another point that should be considered is the state of ill-health that results from smoking.  I can envisage the day when it may be decided by a Department of Health that those who damage their health may have to pay for the consequences.  If ill-health is brought about deliberately by the individual concerned then the individual may have to pay the cost.  As the Minister knows, the cost can be phenomenal in hospitalisation and disability.  Self-inflicted illnesses by persons in their right senses should not be the concern of one's neighbour.  I can see this happening in this country and indeed world-wide with escalating costs of health services.</P>
      <P>I was wondering if the Minister and his Department could try to establish a closer liaison with the Department of Education in bringing to schools a programme of health education with regard to smoking.  More and more young people are smoking at eight, nine and ten years of age and we are encouraging it in no uncertain way.  Could the Minister under the provisions of this Bill bring this &ldquo;No smoking&rdquo; campaign into the schools and explain to them the detrimental effects of smoking and have this as part of the health education which is badly needed at primary school level?  If we could get to them at that age we would achieve a lot and I would like to see this as a really determined plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has succeeded in many ways, because I find that people smoking in my presence always refer to the Minister and apologise for smoking. Women are smoking more and more and I hear them saying, &ldquo;We are not one of Charlie's angels&rdquo; because they are <Col N="675" /> smoking.  His campaign is having an effect and does not cost any money and that is why I am in favour of it. However, I would like to see the Minister carrying it one step further by instituting a &ldquo;No smoking&rdquo; week in encouraging people to overcome cigarette smoking.  Let us have some research into how this could be done.  It is important to rid the community of this obnoxious habit.  There are all sorts of gimmicks, gadgets and drugs to help people give up smoking and we should try to find some way to help people who are afflicted with the obnoxious habit.  We are not trying to curtail their freedom, but we could, for instance, encourage insurance companies to offer a rebate to people who do not smoke.  We could go one stage further and in addition to having &ldquo;No smoking&rdquo; zones in planes and so on have one hour on flights when there would be no smoking whatever.  There are many small ways of encouraging people to give up cigarettes.  Having a &ldquo;No smoking&rdquo; zone is not effective in itself.  I would like to see cinemas and other public places having all sorts of ways to discourage it and to make it appear that it is a habit offensive both to health and socially.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister whether the help of the World Health Organisation is being sought by his Department.  The World Health Assembly said in May of this year that the WHO would be willing to assist Governments in any way possible by way of promotional activities to carry out a &ldquo;No smoking&rdquo; campaign and they have great means at their disposal for doing this.  I ask the Minister to look into this to see what can be done.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the original intention of the Minister has been watered down.  I have not got concern or sympathy for our Irish manufacturers and I am satisfied that there should be a determined attempt to stop smoking altogether.  Consultation with the Minister's British colleague might help to stop cigarette advertising appearing in Irish newspapers.  It can be done very easily and I do not think it would involve cutting out pages and so forth because we can tell British publishers that <Col N="676" /> magazines and so on coming into this country should not contain such advertising. The same effective measures have been taken with regard to football pools and contraceptives.  There was no lack of determination on the part of the authorities when contraceptives were advertised in British periodicals; they could not come into this country and neither could magazines advertising football pools.  The British publishers adjusted things accordingly and there is no reason why that could not be done in this case.</P>

      <P>Yes, a very limited welcome.  The Minister probably knows that this has been the subject of controversy for a very long time.  I think I started asking questions in the early 1950s.  Certainly in 1957 I was given an answer by the then Minister, Deputy MacEntee, and his case then was that, in view of the incomplete and insufficient knowledge, he would not do anything about it but he would keep the matter under observation.  Subsequently Ministers of all parties right up to and including Deputy Corish in the last Government were unwilling or unable to do anything about it.  I put the present Minister in the unable rather than the unwilling category because I suspect he has paid a lot of attention to his Department. He is very interested in trying to operate as a conscientious Minister.  I do not think this Bill is a significant advance in the very long struggle against this most powerful vested interest, the cigarette manufacturing industry.</P>

      <P>It is true of Deputy O'Connell and myself that we accept that we are not killjoys who want to stop people enjoying themselves and those who get pleasure out of smoking because all of us accept that pipe smoking and, for those who can afford it, cigar smoking is not believed to be a serious danger to health.  It is only cigarette smoking that is the serious danger and most of our criticism will be limited to the question of the sponsorship and sale of cigarettes as tobacco products.</P>
      <P>I asked many questions about this through the years and in 1964 I introduced a Bill which got a reading.  It was discussed for three or four days but was negatived in February 1965.  I got virtually no support for it.  If my recollection is correct, Deputy Tully was one of the few people who supported me. However, the consistency and the universality of the failure of the different Ministers in the three major parties, the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, is of great significance.  They all came to know, as much as I did, about the dangers of cigarette smoking and yet the issue which I believe determined this matter was that of revenue.  That is not a cynical comment; it is a realistic one. The influence behind each of the Ministers, the one piece of policy on which there was all-party agreement, was that the revenue from cigarette smoking was such that the several Ministers for Finance would not permit their Ministers for Health to deny them access to that source of revenue.  There may be variations of that analysis but broadly speaking it is true.  That is why I say that the Minister for Health knows this situation better than his predecessors, better than Deputy Childers, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy MacEntee and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has up-to-date information of such a kind that there is no denying the fact that cigarette smoking is everything I claimed it was 25 years ago but even more than that.  At that time I restricted myself, based on very fine research work carried out at Oxford, to stating that the impression I got from that research work was that in respect of lung cancer cigarette smoking was a <Col N="678" /> very serious causative factor.  The then Minister for Health was within his rights in saying that the evidence then was not convincing.  He was also within his rights in saying that when there was more convincing evidence he would do something about it but he did not do anything. However, this Minister cannot say that. The Minister's speech is remarkable in so far as he has made such an overwhelming and unanswerable case for the total suppression of any kind of advertisement.  The Minister has painted a picture of social and physical devastation and told us of the enormous amount of human distress which occurs as a consequence of cigarette smoking but having itemised all those devastating truths as the Minister responsible for health, preventive medicine and the other aspects of medicine, he claimed credit for the almost irrelevant campaigns he has introduced in relation to national fitness and moderation in relation to the consumption of alcohol.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not making any serious attempt to deal with either alcohol or a fitness campaign because both demand the expenditure of money. The fitness campaign demands the expenditure of money in the provision of playing facilities for youngsters while in relation to alcohol there is a need for the total suppression of advertising but the Minister is not going to do that either. The pattern of this speech is reflected in the Minister's superficial approach to his very serious responsibilities.  Very serious proposals are required from him.  They are very difficult proposals and I do not wish to minimise the attempt by any Minister to take on the great beer barons or the tobacco moguls.  A very formidable task faces any Minister for Health in any society.  Most of them have had their troubles but it is wrong of our Minister to create the impression that he is in fact doing something about the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>And in legislating the Minister enunciates his proposals to do something about a problem.  That is the purpose of legislation.  In all these important issues the Minister has indulged in a <Col N="679" /> very elaborate public relations activity. That is one of the depressing features of modern politics and the last election saw that.  We had an increasing development of American-style politics where a lot of money was spent obfuscating the real issues and effectively misleading the people into thinking that what they are being told is something which is really going to mitigate their problems or deal with the issues most of them face in their lives.</P>
      <P>This problem is at least 25 years old. The Minister read his own unanswerable litany of the indictment against cigarette smoking in any society.  I would like to read part of it again.  He told us that the 31st World Health Assembly said that &ldquo;Tobacco smoking is a major cause of chronic bronchitis, emphysema and lung cancer and is a major risk factor in heart attacks, some pregnancy related disorders and other serious health problems&rdquo;, and they called on all members to take action. He reminded us that&mdash;</P>
      <P>In 1975, there were 1,191 deaths from lung cancer....70 per cent of these deaths are attributable to smoking.</P>
      <P>He said that in 1975 250 deaths in the active age group 35 to 64 were caused by chronic bronchitis and 175 of these were attributable to smoking.  He went on to say that&mdash;</P>
      <P>Coronary heart disease caused 9,795 deaths in the same year.  There are a number of factors associated with such deaths but it is accepted that cigarette smoking is a major causative factor and over 1,000 of these deaths can be attributed to it.</P>
      <P>Let us clearly accept, therefore, that in 1975 at least 2,000 Irish men and women died because they smoked.  And there is no reason, unfortunately, to believe that the number would be any less for 1978.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been estimated, for example, that as a direct result of smoking over 6,500 people between 25 and 74 required <Col N="680" /> hospital treatment in 1977 and that they spent over 100,000 bed-days in hospital in that year.</P>
    <P>The hospital admission figures are, of course, the tip of the iceberg...in the general medical services over 70,000 calls on general practitioners are the direct result of smoking.</P>
    <P>He then told us that the total number of working days lost through tobacco associated illnesses would cost £30 million and the cost of treating the diseases would be £15 million to £45 million. Leaving aside distress, suffering, disability, lost man working days, cost to the State, cost to the services, avoidable occupation of hospital beds, clinics, out-patient departments, general practitioners' time and services, £45 million would be spent on something which is totally avoidable.</P>
    <P>Having given us that recitation of horror&mdash;as Deputy O'Connell said, lung cancer is a particularly horrible disease&mdash;the Minister then went on to tell us that he is going to do little or nothing about it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;All forms of outdoor poster and sign advertising will be phased out by the end of the year&rdquo;.  That is a positive achievement and I congratulate the Minister on taking the decision to do that.  Presumably that includes all forms of advertising in the cases mentioned by Deputy O'Connell at sports venues of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister because that was one of the previous ways in which they got round the advertising prohibitions.  Also welcome are the proposals in relation to CIE&mdash;asking them to do what they can to stop cigarette smoking on trains and having no smoking areas&mdash;Aer Lingus, hoteliers, health boards and hospitals. This is long overdue but it is welcome that the Minister has taken the decision to use these powers, that the Minister for Finance cannot interfere with their implementation.</P>
      <P>This is my case.  Those proposals are minimal.  They are relatively ineffective in their overall effect on the very powerful advertisements which the Minister is going to continue to allow, because this Bill is going to prohibit only particular kinds of advertising and sponsorship. Was the Minister compelled to bring in a Bill of this kind because of the 16th report on misleading and unfair advertising of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities? When he talks about particular kinds of advertising I presume he is talking about advertising which would be misleading, that is, the advertising used all through the years which was grossly misleading, thoroughly dishonest, highly immoral, most improper, but in the pursuit of profits perfectly permissible in our western capitalist societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> Certainly with regard to the GAA, which has such a very high standing in our society and which represents so much of the valuable activities of young people in the whole of Ireland, rural and urban&mdash;a magnificent organisation, very well organised and controlled&mdash;it has always struck me as short sighted to say the least, and irresponsible, at the worst, that they have allowed themselves, for the sake of sponsorship, to give youngsters, young sportsmen, the idea that this fine organisation has considered the whole question of cigarette smoking and has subscribed to the propaganda suggesting that it was not really a bad or dangerous thing.  Certainly for years I have had to put up with that&mdash;that they could safely smoke cigarettes.  This is what sponsorship by the GAA and other athletic bodies has subscribed to over the years.</P>
    <P>I notice that the British Amateur Athletic Association decided recently to drop the idea of accepting sponsorship.  I believe the GAA should also drop all question of sponsorship and decline to involve themselves.  Of course the whole idea of sponsorship is a completely fraudulent claim by these tobacco companies that they have the slightest interest in the welfare of the different organisations, whether it be a golfing association, the horse racing industry, the GAA or any of the other athletic institutions with which they get involved and for which they sponsor different activities.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there are tax rebates on the funds spent on advertising. in fact, as with all advertising, it is the consumer who pays.  It does not cost the Mr. Carroll's, the Mr. Player's, the Mr. Wills, the Mr. Gold Flake, or whoever they are, a penny to sponsor these various athletic activities.  On the contrary, they simply use it as a very valuable and effective advertising device, getting round&mdash;as Deputy O'Connell said&mdash;the ordinary newspaper advertising, ending up with the support of people who should know better and who should not have anything to do with them at all. Further, it is quite wrong that an organisation like the GAA, a golfing association or racing people should go looking for this kind of sponsorship or <Col N="683" /> that we, the State, the community, in various ways, directly or indirectly, should provide for these things.  In the first instance it is a fraudulent, non-existing generosity.  But even if it was not it is most improper that we should permit this continued sponsorship.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say that he will restrict expenditure in these areas. That means nothing at all: take six pence off, a shilling, or five shillings, a £ or £1,000&mdash;if he would stop expenditure in these areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I pointed out to the Minister recently&mdash;I do not know whether it was a most insolent rebuff to his undertaking to do something about this&mdash;week after week, both the <i>Sunday Press</i> and <i>Sunday Independent</i> carried enormous technicoloured advertisements by the tobacco companies. That seemed to me to be flouting the indication given by the Minister that he was opposed to this kind of thing and that we were opposed to this kind of thing in here.</P>
      <P>The level of expenditure at present is much too high.  I am afraid the Minister must face the fact that merely restricting particular kinds of advertising, limiting expenditure by unstated amounts or controlling the form and content of tobacco advertising means nothing.</P>

      <P>And do nothing at all if you equally wish.  The Minister has a responsibility to us to explain the reasons for the vagueness of the Bill. Indeed, any attempted indictment of the Minister's inertia and inaction in this has really been taken from the Minister's own statement.  Something that intrigues me is the enigmatic and curious behaviour of virtually all Deputies with the exception of a few&mdash;Deputy O'Connell and people like that&mdash;and the positive hysteria there is about the idea of drug addiction, the proposals to establish all sorts of repressive laws, regulations, institutions and prohibitions against drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> We heard it today in the House in relation to marijuana.  There has been a real witchhunt over the years in relation to young drug addicts.  As far as I am concerned I take up no moral attitude whatever about cigarette smoking. Cigarette smokers are people attempting to deal with their neurosis, people with an emotional problem, and they deal with it by taking a suck on a cigarette. The origin in Freudian terms would be the child who sucks on the breast and the more agitated he is the faster he sucks and so on.  Cigarette smoking can be related back to a very primitive need in an individual and for that reason I would never judge them; one is answering a need, as somebody else needs a drink and somebody else needs heroin and somebody else needs marijuana. There is a hypercritical attitude among many Deputies to the youngster who finds that he needs to solve his problem in these ways that are not socially acceptable and there is a totally complacent attitude by the same Deputies in relation to cigarette smoking.  As we have seen, it costs us an enormous amount of money. The Minister's latest figure is something in the region of £45 million, and it is probably more than that.</P>
    <P>I will digress for a moment to deal with something raised by Deputy O'Connell in relation to expenditure.  I refer to an answer I got yesterday from the Taoiseach's Department concerning advertising costs and so on in relation to cigarette smoking.  The Taoiseach said that the information requested was not available since no official series are compiled relating to advertising expenditure on particular commodities.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave the impression that he knew how much money was being spent, although on occasions I have asked the Department of Health how much they spend and I have never got anything more than what they call a guess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill I will be entitled to get this information from the tobacco companies.  In advance of the legislation I have already obtained these figures from the tobacco companies.  I know them exactly now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well that it is not information supplied to the normal statistical service of the Government.  It is specific information given to me in pursuance of this Bill and the Central Statistics Office would not be aware of it.  There is nothing mysterious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why Deputy O'Connell and the rest of us should not have had access to that information. That is a reasonable comment to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with the hypercritical attitude of society to this question of drugs.  It involves my profession.  I have frequently been somewhat amused to see one of my colleagues advising somebody to give up one or the other of these drugs while he is busily sucking away on a cigarette unable to deal with his own problem.  In relation to our attitude to cigarette smoking the Minister says&mdash;and this again is where the <Col N="687" /> strange ambivalence exists, as expressed by the Minister and as applies to most of the community&mdash;that he hopes those who smoke and who wish to continue to smoke will not feel that they are being unduly discriminated against, that he is not entitled and has no wish to interfere with the right of any citizen to decide whether or not he or she will smoke.</P>
    <P>That is a fair and liberal statement, but is it not true that we take this power in certain circumstances where we are dealing with what is not a socially accepted drug, like marijuana?  We say &ldquo;You may not&rdquo;; indeed, some people say that people should go to jail for smoking marijuana.  That is absurd.  The case against cigarette smoking is completely unanswerable, supported by evidence from all over the world, from all the reputable research bodies in the world, the United States, Russia and Europe.  Yet the Minister makes the extraordinary statement that he does not wish to appear to be discriminating against those who smoke cigarettes. Why are we content to be so specific about one and withhold any kind of restriction or limitation from the other, or feel that we must?  Possibly the answer is in the reply to a question on the amount of excise on cigarettes.  In 1950 it was £13.5 million and in 1977 it was £77.6 million.  This must be the reason why this Bill is so completely inadequate in its objective.  Years ago the Government were unwilling to do anything about it, using the excuse that they did not know enough.  The Minister is giving us much the same answer to-day, but he is going to a little more trouble to disguise the inertia which he shares with these other people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard worse, from more reliable people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty about this whole tobacco debate all through the years has been not only the enormous vested interest but the vested interest as it applies to the newspapers.  Just as they build up control in various athletic bodies, quite <Col N="688" /> obviously they exercise enormous control through advertising revenue in the newspapers.  The result of that is that the policy of the editors, whatever the working journalist may feel, is that not a lot will be said about the real tragedy to so many people of the cigarette industry.</P>
    <P>The issue has been played down.  I recall many other issues down through the years that were given the headlines in the <i>Evening Press</i> or the <i>Evening Herald</i>. For instance, when something happened in Summerhill we were made aware of it. We read of the vandalism or of the young thugs.  The newspapers concentrated on issues about which they could become hysterical safely.  It was considered all right to hunt people who did not really matter&mdash;the young and the underprivileged.  Such issues were safe targets for the newspapers but we can be sure that this horrible story the Minister has told us will not make the headlines, this story of death, of suffering, loss of parents, loss of other loved ones, disability, the number of beds occupied unnecessarily, the working days lost to the country and so on.  Such a story would interfere with the revenue in respect of the mass circulation of the newspapers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot accuse me of concealing the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had done my humble best to deal thoroughly with the Minister in this regard.  The harsh reality is that the press are very powerful.  If they were to turn the great guns, the golden pens of these remarkably talented men and women in journalistic life in Ireland against cigarette smoking to anything like the extent to which they have turned them against other issues down through the years, the Minister would have no problem in respect of his efforts to persuade people to give up smoking, these efforts he is making in this rather indefinite and equivocal way in the Bill.  We will not have the support of the newspapers because they are as much blackmailed as is the Minister in terms of revenue.  The revenue to the Exchequer as a result of cigarette sales is of the order of £79 million while revenue to the newspapers is of about the same <Col N="689" /> amount.  Consequently, the newspapers have a vested interest in remaining silent. Newspapers have a powerful influence for good but it is a power that they chose not to exercise.</P>
      <P>The Minister has produced a particularly brilliant indictment of the whole question of cigarette smoking but I collected a few points which, at the risk of boring the House, I should like to put on the record.  My investigations indicate that the total incidence of lung cancer in any country is related directly to the amount and duration of cigarette smoking, that many tests have shown that the lung function of cigarette smokers is impaired in every known respect compared with non-smokers.  In addition combined recent evidence strengthens the view that cigarette smoking is a major factor in both fatal and non-fatal myo-cardial infection, acting both independently and synergistically.  The incidence of peptic ulcers is twice as high in smokers compared with non-smokers and in respect of pregnancy there is a significantly higher perinatal death rate compared with non-smokers.  That is the gory record of the cigarette industry in our society.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his predecessor endeavoured to deal with the problem by way of a counter-advertising campaign but it was futile for them to try to outdo the great tobacco baronets with their unlimited expenditure.  It is very difficult to understand why the Minister who has the backing of a majority of 20 in Government&mdash;something which was not enjoyed by his predecessor&mdash;did not clamp down on cigarette advertising. Instead, a lot of money has been spent uselessly without the slighest hope of influencing even a minority of cigarette smokers.  I might add that watching the advertisements sponsored by the Department there were times when I did not know whether they were in favour of or against smoking because of their being so equivocal and, to me anyway, confused.  The money spent in this way by the Department in 1976 was about £115,000.  In 1977 the figure was £350,000 while the last figure I have for the amount spent by the cigarette people in this way is £4 million or almost ten to one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> One of the interesting developments in cigarette smoking has been the tendency on the part of doctors to give up smoking. It is not definite whether this is because they know what it is like to die of lung cancer or whether they belong to a &ldquo;higher educational group&rdquo; as they are described in the survey.  I am not sure whether that is true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am not a doctor, the Deputy need not apologise to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to find that people in the lower educational categories tend to smoke more than others.  As an ex-smoker I appreciate the difficulty of giving up cigarettes and also of resisting the temptation to smoke again.  Nicotine can be described as one of the dependent drugs.  It develops to that stage.  Associated with withdrawal are such symptoms as anxiety, fatigue, irritability and nervousness.  The unfortunate people who are doing their best to control their neurosis, which is what cigarette smoking is, will reach for a cigarette when they are upset or disturbed or under pressure.  I would be delighted to give the Minister the highest praise for this Bill if it was not so copiously festooned with those provisos and escape clauses.  I am afraid I am too long in politics to take the goodwill expressed by Ministers at any particular time in relation to any Bills they might introduce.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for coming into the House to support me with the devastating collection of facts he has made available to us in which he built up a completely unanswerable case after 25 years since I began talking about this in 1953.  It is some help that the Minister has brought in this documented case against cigarette smoking but I am very disappointed that he has not had the courage to do more than that.  I believe if he got sufficient encouragement from his colleagues that he would have given us a worthwhile Bill. This Bill, as I said in my opening remarks, is all shadow and there is no substance in it.  It certainly will not achieve the objectives I have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If the criterion laid down by Deputy Browne concerning neurosis is that if one is a smoker one is a neurotic it is better to declare ourselves on this point initially.  I welcome this Bill and I am grateful to have the opportunity of speaking about what I consider are the advantages in it.  I also hope to offer some constructive criticism with regard to what the present position is.</P>
      <P>I believe the Bill was produced in good faith, that it is based on a certain degree of hope and that for its implementation a certain degree of charity is required.  Perhaps too much charity is required when one considers the failings of human nature.  While the Minister must be lauded for his efforts to have a healthier population there is a certain amount of conflict in his approach. When one looks at the massive programme for physical fitness, which he has launched, through involvement in sport and physical fitness and one takes that in conjunction with this Bill it shows a certain degree of conflict to me.  I believe the Minister has got a very favourable response to his massive campaign for physical fitness.  There are some people who are not fit to take the exercise he is urging them to take but in their enthusiasm to satisfy him they are doing things which they normally would not do and possibly should not do and are likely to do harm to themselves.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House in its simplistic form is doing two things.  It is trying to curtail the advertising of tobacco and tobacco products.  There is also a proposal to curtail sponsorship by cigarette companies.  Since this debate began I have listened to many speakers give their views on sponsorship.  The conflict comes in where, on the one hand, the Minister is telling the people to participate in sport and exercise themselves and on the other hand, he is now saying that certain types of sport which up to now have received sponsorship and those which in the future might come into existence because of financial aid from tobacco sources, will no longer receive this.  He is saying: &ldquo;Thou shalt not take part in that sport because the finance to provide that facility will not be there.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> I hope the Minister will be able to provide the sponsorship which he is now saying should not be provided by the tobacco industry.  Up to now he has had a very cheap ride in asking the people to go out and participate in sport.  This has cost neither him nor the Government anything.  Now, if the idea to urge people to participate in sport is not to come from sponsorship by the tobacco industry we now have to ask if the Minister will provide the kind of sponsorship which those people were providing.  If he is prepared to do that I believe that what he is now trying to do will succeed and his campaign for a healthier nation will also succeed.  I hope he will be able to tell us if he is prepared to put his money where his mouth is in regard to sponsorship.</P>

      <P>Section 2 is a definition section and it contains a definition of the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Minister would get his Department to look at the Bill from the point of view of whether the wording is uniform.  My eye lit, for example, on section 28 (3) in which there is a reference to an &ldquo;official&rdquo;.  It may not be a point of much substance but the usage in the Bill should be uniform.  If there is a difference of any significance between &ldquo;officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;official&rdquo; it might be well to express it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Notwithstanding subsection (2), the Registrar may, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, give a certificate to a society entitling it to be treated, for the purposes of this section, as an agricultural co-operative society.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed is in response to representations received from Bord Bainne with the support of the Department of Agriculture.  It was represented that the definition of &ldquo;agricultural co-operative society&rdquo; in subsection (2) might not be held to include An Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited as their members are not engaged in farming nor do they derive the principal part of their livelihood from farming.  The members consist mainly of agricultural cooperatives who themselves would fall within the relevant definition.  The IAOS is a similar organisation that would be covered by the arrangement that is proposed in the amendment.  It has been drawn up on the lines of section 220 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, as it is not the intention of Part II of the Bill to cause any difficulties for promotional or umbrella organisations of the kind I have mentioned which do not accept deposits.  It has been decided to accommodate their exclusion on the lines which they have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the purpose of the amendment is to try to shore up what seems to be a weakness in the section, as I pointed out in the debate on Second Stage, in regard to the use of the word &ldquo;insubstantial&rdquo;.  It seemed that perhaps the power which was being given to the registrar was expressly intended to empower him to exercise a discretion in regard to what was substantial and what was not.  It did not occur to me that it might have a specific purpose in regard to one body, such as the Minister has mentioned.  The Minister's amendment does give the registrar a dispensing power in regard to the criteria which the <Col N="694" /> section contains.  There is no limit on the dispensing power.  It is not even required that the body which he should be dispensing should have any agricultural complexion to its activities, even to the extent that Bord Bainne has.  If the Minister's amendment becomes law I am not going to oppose it, but I should like him to think about it.  If the amendment becomes law it will empower the registrar to create an artificial constructive agricultural co-operative and not subject it to any requirement that the body being exempted should have any agricultural operations at first, second or at any hand.  I wonder whether the Minister would consider extending this amendment, perhaps on Report Stage, so as to impose some kind of limit on the exercise of this otherwise general dispensing power contained in the registrar's discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's argument pre-supposes that the registrar will deliberately go out of his way to find societies which have nothing to do with agriculture in order to exempt them. That is not the case at all.  He is only going to use the power in a case such as Bord Bainne or the IAOS, and only after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, which, in practice, means with the agreement of the Minister for Agriculture.  There is no question of non-agricultural societies being exempted. The registrar is there to exercise his powers in the public interest.  He would not be serving the public interest if he used the power in the way in which the Deputy suggests he might use it.  That would be an abuse of his power and would not have the consent of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be an abuse of the power.  The law reports, as the Minister knows, are full of examples of perfectly respectable administrative organs and authorities of all kinds, including people of at least the same dignity as the Registrar of Friendly Societies who have exceeded their powers, not in the letter but in the spirit because the statutory provision under which they were operating was not drawn tightly and clearly enough to <Col N="695" /> show them what they were entitled to do. I accept that the representation made to the Minister is <i>bona fide</i> and I am not expressing any suspicion about it. However, it would have been a better drafting and legislative job had the dispensing power been more tightly drawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (3) (a), line 46, to delete &ldquo;after consultation with the Central Bank&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subject to approval by the Central Bank.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My reason for introducing this amendment is that it relates to the time limit on both the acceptance and the holding of deposits by the larger existing industrial and provident societies.  The Minister still retains a direct power after consultation with the Central Bank.  He may, by regulation, extend the period of five years to such further period or periods as he considers appropriate, having regard to the public interest.  The purpose of my amendment is to reduce to a greater degree than is now contained in the section the power and ultimate responsibility of the Minister.  In a Bill of this nature I consider it undesirable that there should be a reserve power of such strength residing directly with the Minister.  It is quite conceivable that a society may, after putting forward a scheme to the registrar, find itself in some difficulty and may then decide how best to twist the arm of the Minister.  It may not at all be in the best national interest that the arm of the Minister should be twisted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sorts of hard luck stories are trotted out&mdash;hundreds of depositors who are going to lose a fortune and the society decides to chance its arm.  Admittedly, the Minister has the power to consult the Central Bank, but there are consultations and consultations.  I propose to place that power more firmly within the confines of the Central Bank <Col N="696" /> while at the same time the Minister naturally in the whole context of this Bill &mdash;since it is not an amendment of the 1971 Act&mdash;would still be obliged subject, to approval by the Central Bank, to extend that period in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Central Bank would also have considerable regard to the public interest, but the kind of thing I have in mind is where one of the societies wrote to Deputies on 16 October&mdash;I do not propose to give the name of the society but I shall pass the letter over to the Minister afterwards &mdash;saying:</P>
    <P>RE Industrial and Provident Societies Bill</P>
    <P>The above Bill proposes to stop societies such as ours taking deposits. These societies probably now have over £20 million in deposits and employ a considerable number of people. They mainly lend money for leasing, house deposits and commercial properties.</P>
    <P>Many of the depositors are from the United Kingdom where most of the societies have offices.  In the United Kingdom the new Banking and Credit Union Bill of July 1978 command 7303 proposes to licence institutions such as ours and provide for a protection deposit fund.  The British have no intention of closing us down.</P>
    <P>We are writing to ask you to have the bill amended to bring it more into line with the British Bill which has been carefully researched.  Credit institutions from other member states of the EEC will have an automatic right of establishment.  The first directive of last year is a start in this direction (77/780/EEC).</P>
    <P>Why should we be forced to move to Britain or Northern Ireland and eventually return as British companies under EEC law?</P>

      <P>No, I keep the few overdrafts I have elsewhere.  That letter to me is reminiscent of the kind of expressions we had when we were being berated in the previous Government and asked to pay back the money to the Irish Trust Bank, that type of special pleading.  The temptation is there for the Minister to say &ldquo;I shall give you another 12 months&rdquo; or &ldquo;I know there is a general election coming up.  We will give you another two years in which to bring forward another scheme of closure and cessation of business.&rdquo;  It is a great thing these days when somebody comes to you and says: &ldquo;I am in serious trouble &mdash;can you do anything?&rdquo; to be able to reply: &ldquo;There is the Director of Public Prosecutions; we dare not interfere.&rdquo; That is why we have a Director of Public Prosecutions.  Likewise in these days of planning applications one can say &ldquo;It is a matter for An Bord Pleanála.&rdquo;  In relation to a Bill of this nature the Minister or any Deputy in Opposition should rightly be in a position to say &ldquo;It is a matter for the Central Bank.  If they want to give you an extension of 12 years, by all means let them.&rdquo; It will be their decision and we shall not be involved in it in a political context.</P>
      <P>I fully support the Bill.  We shall be taking all Stages of it today, I would hope.  That is the only amendment I wish to suggest for consideration by the Minister.  Perhaps he might even look at it on Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, there is very little difference between what is in the Bill, &ldquo;after consultation with the Central Bank&rdquo; and what the Deputy proposes &ldquo;subject to approval by the Central Bank&rdquo;.  In practice there is really <Col N="698" /> none because, speaking for myself, if I were in this position at the end of the five year period I would not make any decision one way or the other on any such request without the advice of the Central Bank and, in fact, I might say in such a matter without following their advice, because I would regard them as the proper people to advise me in respect of it.</P>
      <P>While the amendment is of no great practical significance I feel I should not accept it because the proposed change would effectively and, in my opinion, quite unjustifiably subordinate the office of the Minister to the Central Bank.  I am responsible for legislative initiative so far as societies are concerned.  In the matter of regulations which impinge on or qualify legal requirements, I think I should also be the overriding and decision making authority.  The Minister of the day is directly accountable to the Oireachtas in the matter of legislative changes and the sort of decision involved here.  The Central Bank is not. Because of their recognised responsibility for the banking sector a special consultative role has been written into the Bill for the Bank where a time extension arises.  The Bank however might not be the only agency which would have a valid opinion to express regarding such a request.  The Registrar of Friendly Societies might have an opinion and one would expect him to be consulted also as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether these societies will still be operating at the end of the five year period.  Naturally, I would hope there would not be any still taking deposits or holding them at that time. Certainly the registrar will seek to encourage societies to take one of the various steps open to them after the passing of this Bill in order to arrive as speedily as possible at a situation where it would not be any longer necessary for them to take or hold deposits.  I hope the registrar will be successful in taking most, if not all, of the societies into that position and that at the end of five years there will be none left in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, by any chance one or two will still hold deposits at the end of the five years, I think the principal consideration at that stage in deciding whether or not to allow <Col N="699" /> an extension of the winding down period so far as deposits were concerned would be the protection of the depositors themselves.  One's natural inclination would not be to extend the period.  If it could be shown, and the Central Bank so advised, that a cessation of activities so far as deposit taking was concerned at the end of five years was likely to lead to insolvency or a failure of the society to repay the deposits which it had, then the Central Bank would be likely to advise, and the Minister of the day would be likely to accede to that advice, that some extension should be given.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of any great importance to anyone other than the depositors.  It is not a situation in which one could envisage the proprietor of one of these banking societies seeking to have an extension for reason of profit, because at that stage there would not be any profit in it for them.  Almost daily I find myself called on to make decisions which are a great deal more difficult and on which, potentially at least, I would be open to a great deal more pressure than the sort of situation Deputy Desmond envisages here.  I would not regard it as a serious difficulty at all.</P>
    <P>In practice the Central Bank will be fully consulted as the section envisages. It may well be that, by the end of the five year period, all the societies carrying on quasi banking activities at the moment will have been diverted away from those activities and will have made alternative arrangements for funding and so on.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only the first of a few such instances in the Bill to which I want to draw the Minister's attention. Section 5 is one of the sections which the offences section at the end of the Bill mentions.  It is one of the sections mentioned in section 28.  The opening words of section 28 (1) are that a person shall be guilty of an offence if he contravenes section 5.  I want to make the point briefly that the drafting of that section is too broad.  I have not abridged it in any sense.  I just stopped at the words &ldquo;section <Col N="700" /> 5&rdquo;.  As it stands, the Minister will find he is possibly laying himself open to a criminal prosecution inasmuch as presumably a regulation under paragraph (c) of subsection (3) can be laid before this House and the other House only by himself and, if he fails to lay this regulation as soon as may be after it is made, he is contravening the section.</P>
      <P>I am as alive as anyone else to the absurd position in which the Minister would find himself if that were taken literally in the way I have outlined it.  As we go through the Bill, the Minister will find there are several mandatory provisions in the sections which are referred to in section 29 in the context of their possible contravention.  Here is an instance in which potentially he might be caught.  There are other instances which I will point out as we go through the Bill, in which the registrar is under a mandatory duty of one kind or another and the section which imposes that duty on him is one of the sections caught by the offences section, section 28, and by the provision that anybody who contravenes this, that or the other section is guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>What is wrong is nothing in section 5. I have no objection to that.  The point I am making may show the Minister that the drafting of section 28 needs to be improved.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a better example because it is less absurd and more specific.  Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>The Registrar shall not give permission under this section unless he is satisfied that it is in the interests of the public or of the creditors of a society or of the orderly and proper regulation of the business of the society to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> A registrar who gives permission, notwithstanding the fact that he is not satisfied, or, as is more usual in such an administrative context, notwithstanding that he has no evidence before him on which he could possibly be satisfied, is, I think we will have to say, in contravention of section 6.  I quite realise that the people being aimed at in the offences section are societies, their officers, their committee members, and so on.  If so, that section should say so.  As it stands, a registrar who neglects his duty and gives permission, notwithstanding that he is not satisfied because he could not be satisfied, is in contravention of the section and would make himself theoretically liable to prosecution.  I am certain that is not the intent of the Bill and it should be cleaned up.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister thinks I am posing an absurd situation I want to assure him that if he wants me to&mdash;and I am certain the draftman will easily have access to them&mdash;I can produce at least a dozen Irish cases over the past couple of decades in which administrative authorities, of which this registrar would be one, have found their acts or decisions invalidated because, although on paper they purported to be satisfied with something, or although they declared themselves as having considered this, that or the other, arguments produced by the party affected by what they did, showed they could not have been satisfied about anything because they never directed their minds to it, never considered it, neglected to consider the very matter which the statute required them to consider.</P>
    <P>In other words, I am not positing a malicious or malignant registrar.  Not at all.  What I am positing is a registrar who, perhaps through stress of overwork or misconstruing his functions, has not in fact directed his mind to the factors which would enable him to satisfy himself about this or that.  A registrar who without so satisfying himself gives permission is clearly in contravention of his duty under section 6.  That is a common occurrence in the world of administration, but it is a criminal occurrence here, it seems to me, as section 6 stands in conjunction with the offences section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose on a strict reading of section 28, by stretching the matter rather a long way, one could say Deputy Kelly is right.  It is quite obvious section 28 refers to subsection (1) and not the subsidiary matters.  The offence is set out in subsection (1): raising funds except under and in accordance with the written permission of the registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The mandatory nature of the conduct which is required by subsection (1) is expressed in the very same words as in subsection (2): the society shall not raise funds, and the registrar shall not give permission.  I know what the intent of the Bill is.  I am urging the Minister as we go along to ask the draftman to look again at the offences section.  It is not a clean job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This also is one of the sections which section 28 envisages.  While the same problem does not arise under it, it would be well, if that is the Minister's intention, to signal, perhaps not in the Bill but in some other appropriate way, that as it stands a society which allows the deadline of subsection (2) to pass is in contravention of section 7 and an offence would appear to have been committed.  Does the Minister intend that merely letting the deadline pass should be a criminal offence?  If that is the intention, I have no objection, but I am not sure that is the Minister's intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with that but, if I were told the material of an offence was concealed somewhere in section 7, I would have thought that it was in subsection (3).  Perhaps the Minister intends it should attach to subsection (2) as well.  I have no objection.  I just direct the Minister's mind to what is going on.</P>

      <P>The same consideration arises here under subsection (2) because again the registrar could conceivably be in contravention of this section if he has given a permission without consultation with the Central Bank.  That is also a fairly common occurrence.  Certain cases reach the Law Reports but there are many cases that do not get that far, cases where the statutory authority required to consult the other person takes the consultation for granted.  Consultation does not take place and, if it does not take place here, the nominal effect of section 28 is to make the registrar guilty of an offence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> In page 8, to delete lines 12 to 19 and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  If any person who is an officer, member, agent or servant of the society refuses to answer any question put to him by the inspector with respect to the affairs of the society, the person shall be guilty of an offence under section 28.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Arising out of a Supreme Court case in 1971 in <i>re Haughey</i>, it was felt necessary to amend subsection (2) to provide that failure to answer questions put by an inspector carrying out an investigation into one of these societies should not be regarded as contempt of court and should not be reported to the High Court, but should instead be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a minor offence triable summarily in the District Court in respect of which evidence would be given in the District Court and a decision by a district justice.  The Supreme Court felt that if a matter such as this were referred to the High Court there was no limit on the penalty the High Court could impose and therefore the person who was reported had a right to a trial by a jury.  Since there is no provision in the High Court to try criminal cases such a person would have to be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  It was found that the procedure was defective and it is proposed to get over the difficulty by making it a minor offence subject to the penalties laid down in section 28.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That explanation is not entirely convincing and it is as well to get this clear.  It does not say that failure to answer questions, and so on, shall be a minor offence.  It talks about an offence under section 28 and in that section the discretion resides purely in the State&mdash;I presume in the Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;to decide whether to prosecute summarily or before a jury.  In an extremely serious case where an attempt might be made to conceal a major fraud it may very well be that the offence would appear to the State to warrant trial before a jury and that would remove the ceiling in terms of penalty.  I see the point of the amendment.  I raised <Col N="705" /> this matter on Second Stage and I certainly agree with the form in which it stands.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  If any person who is an officer, member or agent of the credit union refuses to answer any question put to him by the inspector with respect to the affairs of the <Col N="706" /> credit union, the person shall be guilty of an offence under section 28.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The very last provision in this section provides:</P>
      <P>Where the Director of Public Prosecutions institutes proceedings consequent on the receipt by him of a report under paragraph (a), it shall be the duty of all officers, members and agents of the credit union (other than a defendant in the proceedings) to give him all assistance in connection with the prosecution which they are reasonably able to give.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, no sanction is provided for a breach of that duty, while the Bill in other places makes it an offence to withhold information or obstruct or fail to assist inspections.  This duty appears to hang in the air.  There may be provision in some other statute. It does not seem to be anything but a nominal paper breach of duty to refuse to give the DPP the help mentioned here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned this section several times.  What I have been saying relates to paragraph (a) of sub-section (1).  I wonder if the Minister would get the draftsman to look at the very first line in section 28 (1) which states:</P>
      <P>A person shall be guilty of an offence if he&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entity envisaged as committing an offence throughout this section is a person.  I know that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; can be interpreted to include a juristic person, in other words, not a natural person.  Many of the duties, the breaches <Col N="707" /> of which are made offences by this Bill, are duties laid upon society, which is also a person in a sense.  Some of the kinds of offence mentioned in section 28 specifically are ones which it requires a natural person, a man or woman, to commit.  Perhaps the opening words of that section might be expanded.  The 1893 Act, which is to be construed as one with this, provides in section 63:</P>
    <P>Every offence by a society under this Act shall be deemed to have been also committed by every officer of the same bound by the rules thereof to fulfil the duty whereof such offence is a breach or, if there be no such officer, then by every member of the committee of the same, unless such member be proved to have been ignorant of or to have attempted to prevent the commission of such offence.</P>
    <P>That is not quite the same as saying that an offence by a society must be deemed to be an offence by the persons composing it.  It just says that an offence by a society shall be deemed to have been also committed by every person of which the section specifies, except in so far as he can exculpate himself.  The onus is displaced.  Where we are talking about offences which are committed in terms of the sections here, by societies, it would be clearer if the opening words of the section were expanded so as to make it plain in terms that everyone can understand that the person here envisaged is not simply a person in the broadest sense but one of the special kinds of juristic person to which the Bill is supposed to apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been long established that in legislation the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes all legal entities.  I think the Interpretation Act of 1938 bears that out.  My recollection is that it does.  The fact that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; as used here encompasses bodies corporate is proved by the opening of subsection (3) of this section which states:</P>
      <P>Where an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate or by a person purporting to act on behalf of a body corporate....</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress I wish to refer to the portion of the Bill which seeks to curtail sponsorship by the tobacco industry.  I wish to point out to the Minister that I am in full agreement with him on this point provided that innocent people for whom sponsorship in sport provided a sporting outlet are not victimised.  If the Minister sought to curtail or refuse moneys from these sources he himself should see to it that the shortfall would be made up by direct sponsorship by him or his Department. Having got this undertaking I would be in full agreement with the Minister.  In the absence of such an undertaking grave doubts will be cast on the success of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great play has been made of the fact that tobacco companies have no interest whatever in the sport they sponsor, let it be horse racing, show jumping, golf, water skiing, motor racing or any other sport.  I would not be one bit worried or concerned about what motivates such <Col N="709" /> people to give money.  It is a question I would not give any thought to as long as the people who participated in that sport were the beneficiaries.  The fact that a particular tobacco company has a genuine interest in a particular sport and because of that genuine interest provides sponsorship for that sport in no way minimises the adverse effects which the product of that tobacco company may have on people's health.  But what motivates those people ought not worry us at all.  Personally, I do not think the question arises.  There has been a substantial involvement by tobacco companies in many aspects of sport and the sponsorship thereof for many years. This sponsorship has served to provide facilities and a chance for involvement by people in sport which otherwise would not be possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne has stated that the Minister cannot hope to succeed when he takes on the massive vested interests of these people.  I do not think that this is so.  The Minister in his wisdom would not seek a confrontation with these massive vested interests, and they are massive interests.  It is a question of producing a Bill which will make the involvement of these people as sponsors redundant and again it comes back to the provision of the moneys which these people would provide if it were acceptable. Otherwise the approach is a negative one and it is in conflict with the Minister's stated policy concerning involvement by the general public in outdoor activities, pastimes and leisure time sporting activities.</P>
    <P>Apart from that negative approach we are also entering the realm of prohibition and we all know what history and experience has taught us in that field. Prohibition, in the sense that it is generally understood, has not worked.  I attended a boarding school where cigarette smoking was prohibited and in fact this prohibition was nothing more than an incentive to smoke and not be caught smoking.  Human nature being what it is, it was natural to react in that way to that kind of situation.</P>
    <P>While the Minister, as has been stated here, has outlined in what can be regarded as a detailed litany of disaster what the effects of smoking are&mdash;and I <Col N="710" /> think most of these ill-effects have been well documented and categorised and are well known to the smoking public&mdash;the fact is despite all their knowledge they cannot give up smoking. So the logical approach would be a massive educational campaign.  There are literally tens of thousands and possibly hundreds of thousands of people here, and I am one of them, hoping that some day somebody will tell them how to give up smoking.  That is the kind of public we are dealing with.  They are just waiting for someone to come along and say: &ldquo;this is how one gives up smoking.&rdquo; So far as I know the Minister was a smoker at one stage so I would ask him how he gave up smoking.  He will probably tell me that he gave it up through strength of character or strength of will and so on.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Hospital Appointments: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to fully implement the arrangements for a federation as <Col N="711" /> negotiated between the Western Health Board and the management of Portiuncula hospital in regard to the Roscommon County Hospital, thereby ensuring a full scale maternity unit in the county and, to this end, to take whatever steps to ensure that such appointments of professional staff as are necessary to honour the agreement, be made without further delay.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Mrs. Burke.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I finished last night I was referring to the unfortunate position that arose because of statements made locally in Roscommon suggesting that a civil servant had refused to obey a ministerial directive.  I suggested it was a pity that the position had not been clarified and a contradiction published by the Minister as soon as the statements were made.  I am unhappy that although the Minister's speech last night went some way to explain the position, it did not clearly indicate that he could not have given a directive in this case because it was not within his compass to do so.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the staff involved, a clearer indication should have been given at a much earlier date of what the position was because it was unfortunate that the staff should have been involved in an argument to ventilate local view-points. I hope I will have another opportunity to deal with that.</P>
      <P>The words of this motion have been taken from the Minister's letter of 24 March 1977 in which he undertook to provide for a federation between the Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula. In accordance with the terms of that federation there was to be an appointment of an obstetrician/gynaecologist.  The unhappiness and the public protest were caused because that undertaking has not been implemented.  The Minister now says he is trying to implement it.  That is not the undertaking that was given.  The undertaking was that the appointment would be made and that is what the motion has asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to refer specifically to the outrageous personal <Col N="712" /> attacks made on me last night by Deputies Boland and L'Estrange. Deputy Burke is my colleague in the constituency.  She is respected by all and sundry.  She has headed the poll consistently in the constituency and I ask her personally to dissociate herself from the intemperate remarks by those two Deputies.  They were a disgrace to their party and to their constituents.  I know Deputy Burke, a respected and honourable lady, will dissociate herself from those remarks.  The irresponsible contributions last night of those two Deputies reflected on themselves, on their party and on the motion.  The jokes by Deputy L'Estrange about draining the Shannon and other remarks by Deputy Boland brought the debate to a low level and I hope that when Deputy Burke is replying she will dissociate herself from those remarks and earn the respect of her constituency.</P>
      <P>Nobody has been associated more closely with or has had a greater personal interest in this hospital than I, and I can go back to my birth in this hospital 33 years ago.  Naturally one would have a close relationship with the hospital in which one was born.  I am the first Deputy from Roscommon town to be elected in 54 years.  Prior to my election to the Dáil I was deeply involved in this hospital, even prior to my council election in 1974, but particularly since the FitzGerald Report in 1968.  I was among the first to launch a campaign against that report and I fought consistently during the years about any downgrading of Roscommon County Hospital.  I worked for the improvement of that hospital, prior to my election and since my election.  There is no Minister more approachable in matters of this kind than Deputy Haughey.  He has met me and my colleague, Deputy Doherty, on occasions too numerous to mention, to discuss the whole future of the hospital in federation with Portiuncula.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's commitment to this federation which he outlined so clearly last night.  I have the fullest confidence in the manner in which the Minister is handling this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer again to my personal involvement in this hospital.  My parents owe their lives to the fact that this <Col N="713" /> hospital was operating effectively and was in a position to treat their complaints over the years, particularly since they became elderly.  I will continue my campaign within Fianna Fáil, with the support of Deputy Doherty and of the people of the constituency who sent me here.  This hospital was totally neglected by the previous administration.</P>
    <P>To deal specifically with the maternity side of the hospital, at the moment we have 25 maternity beds with all the ancillary services necessary for safe deliveries, including nursing and medical staffs.  We are looking for a qualified obstetrician/gynaecologist to work in that unit with the midwife-nurses and the trained backup nursing and medical staffs.  I would have complete confidence in a maternity unit which would have an obstetrician/gynaecologist.  I hope the negotiations that are proceeding and will proceed with Comhairle na nOispidéal will come to fruition and I am reasurred by the Minister's statement that he will not stand in the way and that he will make the necessary funds available.</P>
    <P>Since the appointment of this Government many major programmes have been implemented in the Roscommon hospital.  Since the last election we have sought and have obtained the permanent appointments of a surgeon and a physician to that hospital.  We have also obtained major improvements in the hospital which have enabled us to provide a first class service in the medical and surgical wings.  There was the permanent appointment last October of a consultant physician, Mr. McHugh, a few months after the appointment of this Government.  A consultant surgeon, Mr. Michael Relihan, was appointed on 1 November 1977.  At the time, the CEO reported:</P>
    <P>Most favourable comments from the patients and their relatives as well as the family doctors in County Roscommon have been received for the very substantial increase in the workload of the hospital in Roscommon. In the current financial year many improvements have been carried out at the County Hospital, Roscommon, including the provision <Col N="714" /> of a new accident department, operating theatre and coronary unit as well as an arrangement for the supply of sterile goods from the Hospitals Joint Service Boards.</P>
    <P>Without doubt it is an excellent hospital which has been improved to a great extent since June 1977.  That is what I had been fighting for over the years&mdash;the upgrading of this hospital.  The hospital has been upgraded and I am proud to be associated with the improvements.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession details of the number of admissions and operations but I will not go into that because of my limited time.  The existence of this hospital has saved many lives, victims of serious car accidents, in the last few months.  As late as last weekend, five young men were involved in a serious car accident.  Unfortunately one of them was fatally injured, but the other four are making satisfactory recoveries in the hospital.  We are very thankful that this hospital was there to save the lives of these young people and many more people. The former Minister for Health, Mr. Seán Flanagan, had a serious accident and due to the work of Surgeon O'Hanrahan, Dr. Walls and others he made a very satisfactory recovery.</P>
    <P>I do not know why Deputy Mrs. Burke is playing politics with the lives of the people of Roscommon.  I am surprised that she is using this opportunity to try to embarrass the Government or the Deputies from the constituency.  She is not helping the situation.  This Private Members' motion is faulty in its presentation. The way in which it is proposed is incorrect and, under Standing Orders, I shall ask later if it can be taken as it stands.  I shall seek clarification on the matter in a few moments.</P>
    <P>I am surprised and disappointed that my colleague, Deputy Burke, should come here and use the opportunity to embarrass the Government or to play politics with this important issue.  This issue is above and beyond political consideration. So far as I am concerned, my political future is of no consequence so long as Roscommon County Hospital has the necessary services.  So long as that happens I shall be content to carry on with my other work and go out of <Col N="715" /> this House but while I am in the House I shall fight for the services in the Roscommon County Hospital.  I am quite hopeful that I shall have the backing of the Government and the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputy Burke about the inactivity for four-and-a-half years when the former Minister for Health, Deputy Corish, did not bother to examine the situation to see if there could be a solution to the federation discussions that were taking place.  It was a period of total inactivity so far as the hospital in Roscommon was concerned.  Deputy Mrs. Burke is a member of Fine Gael and she must take responsibility for the inactivity of the former Minister for Health so far as Roscommon was concerned. I know that she will accept that responsibility.  So far as Deputy Corish was concerned, Roscommon was totally irrelevant because he knew there were very few votes there for his party.  The supporters of the National Coalition were not able to persuade him to supply the necessary finances to support any federation proposals.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputy Burke said last night in relation to the major developments that are taking place in our constituency.  These developments will provide more jobs, more investment and more confidence in the future.  If there are more births in the area this will strengthen our hand when we are fighting for this appointment in Roscommon. I am delighted that she has recognised the major contributions of the Government in the development of the area in the past 16 months.  I am working not only for the future of the hospital but also for the economic needs of the area.  It is gratifying that Deputy Burke has accepted what has been done in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Last night Mrs. Burke quoted from newspapers.  I am not going to indulge in petty politics here.  I am not going to comment on what journalists wrote in certain newspaper on a certain date. The people will judge what has happened. I have been outspoken with regard to the hospital but this is because I am fighting for the people of Roscommon. If journalists do not quote me correctly <Col N="716" /> that is their business.  I am a politician and I do my business.  If I am misquoted so be it, but the people will judge the situation as it arises.  I am not going to delve into papers of a few years ago or to comment on what was said by Deputies then.  I shall not even refer to the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of January 1977 when an article stated that Mrs Burke reassured the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am glad to say it will not be closed but will be upgraded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer again to an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 26 August 1978.  Deputy Burke did not quote me fully or correctly in her contribution last night.  The sub-editors in the <i>Irish Independent</i> are responsible for the headlines they use.  The headline they used in this case was: &ldquo;Deputy to Challenge Powers of Hospital Body in Dáil&rdquo;. That is not what I said.  I said that I would ask the Minister for Health to amend section 41 of the Health Act, 1970 and I am repeating that request to the Minister now.  He should bring in the necessary amending legislation to change section 41 to enable him to have the ultimate say in relation to the appointment of specialists in hospitals throughout the country.  Basil Chubb, Chairman of Comhairle na nOspidéal, is not the Minister for Health.  I would ask <Col N="717" /> the Minister to ensure that he alone has the ultimate say.</P>

      <P>Last night Deputy Burke stated that there were no women on Comhairle na nOspidéal but I beg to differ with her.  There is a lady on the board; she is from Drogheda and is a Reverend Sister.  I hope she is doing a good job on the board.  I agree that there should be more women on the board but I would again point out that Sister Bosco McNamara from the Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is a member of the present board who will cease to hold power on 30 September 1978.  I hope that the new comhairle will have not only women but a fair representation from areas throughout the country and a fair geographical spread of interest.  I hope, too, that it will not be stacked with high-powered and highly-paid medical specialists having very vested interest in ensuring that they will not have single obstetric units because of the small <Col N="718" /> amount of money involved in comparison with a very big unit.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the proper spread of interests is represented in this new comhairle which will take up office in 1979.</P>
      <P>I make no apology for stating here as I have stated outside this House that I have no faith in the present Comhairle na nOspidéal because that comhairle tried to close the surgical end of Roscommon County Hospital in 1975. They were prevented from carrying out that outrageous policy at the time. Please God, their views concerning the appointment of an obstetrician/gynaecologist in Roscommon will also be vetoed and we will succeed in having this very important appointment made in the not-too-distant future.  I have complete confidence in the Minister because he is most able, alert and active.  He is certainly an outstanding Minister who has the best interests of the people of this country and of Roscommon at heart.  I have no doubt of his integrity as far as this is concerned and I know he will ensure that every consideration is given in relation to the appointment in Roscommon.  He said in his statement last night:</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to make it clear that I subscribe fully to the proposed federation between Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, and the County Hospital Roscommon.  I am anxious that the arrangements under the federation should be implemented as soon as possible.  So far as I am concerned there will not be any obstacle placed in the way of their implementation.</P>
      <P>I welcome that as a statement of policy from the Minister for Health, from his Department and from the Government. He went on to state that agreement was reached on the establishment of joint departments straddling the two hospitals in surgery, medicine, radiology and so on and he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> These arrangements would involve the consultants in each specialty in the two hospitals providing consultancy cover for both hospitals on a continuous basis and with the Portiuncula consultants providing services at Roscommon County Hospital as required.</P>
    <P>I ask him to provide the same joint departments of surgery and medicine at the moment and the joint departments of obstetrics and gynaecology between the two hospitals.  With that we would have a top-rate service for the people of part of County Galway and the whole of County Roscommon.  The appointments should be made as quickly as possible because delay in the appointment of this specialist service is damaging to the possible and proposed federation between the two hospitals.</P>
    <P>Recently I had a public debate with the people in Portiuncula Hospital and I asked them to honour an alleged agreement between the Western Health Board and themselves and to bring the necessary negotiations to a fruitful conclusion. I ask anybody in a position of influence to ensure that these negotiations will continue and will have a satisfactory outcome.  I ask the movers of this motion what agreement they are talking about. It is vital that we know because quite a lot of negotiations have taken place.  The wording of this motion is ambiguous and dangerous to the possible conclusion of an arrangement between Portiuncula and the Western Health Board in relation to the facilities at Roscommon County Hospital.  Are they referring to an alleged agreement which took place on 30 September 1976 between the Western Health Board and the authorities in Portiuncula which was not ratified by Deputy Burke's Government between that date and 5 July 1977? After all the pressures that came from Roscommon County Council, the local health committee, the Western Health Board and all the councillors, Deputy <Col N="720" /> Corish was not prepared to meet the health board or to ratify that agreement.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's statement last night that he would meet the Western Health Board in due course after they have discussed the situation with Comhairle na nOspidéal.  I ask the movers of this motion if they are referring to that alleged agreement or to negotiations which took place recently which would result in the non-appointment of an obstetrician/gynaecologist in the maternity wing of Roscommon County Hospital.  I will not support any move, irrespective of who makes it, to deprive Roscommon County Hospital of an obstetrician/gynaecologist.</P>
    <P>The motion states:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to fully implement the arrangements for a federation as negotiated between the Western Health Board and the management of Portiuncula hospital in regard to the Roscommon County Hospital, thereby ensuring a full scale maternity unit in the county and, to this end, to take whatever steps to ensure that such appointments of professional staff as are necessary to honour the agreements, be made without further delay.</P>
    <P>Many agreements and discussions have taken place.  The last agreement, negotiation or discussion which Comhairle na nOspidéal will support would deprive Roscommon County Hospital of an obstetrician/gynaecologist.  I hope that Deputy Burke is not suggesting that we do not have an obstetrician/gynaecologist in the County Hospital in Roscommon.  If she is suggesting that I ask her not to go back to the people of Roscommon because they want that service there.  Otherwise I ask the movers of the motion to amend this resolution in some way which will ensure that it is quite clear and without doubt or ambiguity what their intentions are.  I doubt their intentions and I question <Col N="721" /> their integrity.  In June of last year when I was elected to this House in Roscommon I knew their intentions as far as Roscommon was concerned.  They were ambiguous and they lacked the integrity and sincerity which would result in a satisfactory conclusion of the proper services in Roscommon County Hospital.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the movers of the motion are referring to a proposal put forward by the authorities of Portiuncula Hospital on 4 May 1978 to the Western Health Board. The authorities of that hospital proposed the non-appointment of an obstetrician/gynaecologist in the maternity wing of Roscommon County Hospital.  It is those negotiations that the movers of the motion are in favour of.  I hope the Government will not accept any such proposals because they would mean that an obstetrician/gynaecologist <Col N="722" /> would not be appointed in Roscommon County Hospital.  I am for such an appointment in Roscommon and I am against a motion like this which seeks to damage our county hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>My support for the federation between the Portiuncula and Roscommon Hospitals was based on my concern for the mothers and children of Roscommon and surrounding areas.  For too long we have had to live with certain ailments and tragedies because the necessary and vital services for mothers and children were not available.  It is important to note that we never had an obstetrician/gynaecologist in County Roscommon and that it was not until 1968 that a maternity wing was provided at the county hospital.  Once that wing was erected it was only natural that the people of the county, and those with a genuine interest in having the proper services made available, would seek to have the proper staff appointed.</P>
      <P>In the course of his contribution last night the Minister expressed his concern about this matter.  He was concerned to the extent that he was prepared to go to all reasonable and realistic lengths to ensure that such a desirable and important service would be provided, if possible. This statement was positive and left no doubt in my mind that the Minister was genuinely concerned about the care of those requiring obstetrics and gynaecological services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be mentioned that we do not have a paediatric service in Roscommon, a service which is of vital importance.  While mothers are well cared for in modern times children must also be put on equal footing to ensure that their health after birth is looked after.  In the days after birth it is important that problems are detected so that remedial action can be taken.  It is only natural that the people of County Roscommon were disappointed at the decision of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  It is not my function to defend Comhairle na nOspidéal and I am concerned with the need for a proper service.  I understand the reason why Comhairle na nOspidéal <Col N="723" /> was established.  It consists of experts in the medical field whose advice we value. While I may not agree with the decision Comhairle na nOspidéal reached in relation to Roscommon County Hospital, I must support the Minister when he says that we cannot dispute their medical opinion. We must value their medical advice.</P>
    <P>However, there is a difference between medical opinion and social justification, a view which the Minister has made known here and outside.  I am satisfied that if it was economically viable the Minister, and other Ministers, would provide maximum services of the highest standard everywhere.  We must take into consideration that it is not possible to have everything throughout the country.  On social grounds, there is a justifiable case to be made for that appointment.</P>
    <P>Some of the proposals suggested by the federation have been provided.  There is a surgical registrar, a medical registrar and an anaesthetist in the county hospital.  This is a significant improvement. I am glad to tell the House that all the personnel in that hospital are valued very highly by the people of County Roscommon.  It is only right that on their behalf I pay a tribute to the staff for the service they are giving to the county.</P>
    <P>Although they are giving a maternity service at present, they would like to know that there are specially qualified people on hand to deal with this work. They feel that patients at risk can be isolated through their general practitioners and advised where to go.  That is causing the problem.  The county hospital in Roscommon could be providing a better maternity service if qualified and skilled personnel were available.  Because this personnel is not available, expectant mothers have to travel quite a distance over some bad roads, often at unusual hours of the night, and this can be quite upsetting.</P>
    <P>It has been said that it would be nice to have all these services at our doorstep.  I do not think the people of Roscommon wish that to be the case. They merely wish that the federation would be implemented in full.  I appreciate <Col N="724" /> the views of an Comhairle on medical grounds but I differ with them on social grounds.  I believe the people in Roscommon have the same entitlement to the best possible services as the people in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the less well off people in our community.  In today's society the responsibility and function of any Government Minister or politician should be to ensure that the least well off members of our community are afforded protection by the Government and the agencies of State.  In Roscommon we have a medical card population in the region of 60 per cent. They are entitled to the best possible services and to the same services as those who can afford them.  Even if they cannot really afford it, many men make every effort to get the money to pay for the best service available.  Many women who go to Roscommon Hospital to have their babies are not medical card holders.  Some women have great faith in that hospital.  It would be a pity if medical card holders were forced to accept less than the best service to which they are entitled, simply because they could not afford to go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is significant to note that protracted negotiations are still taking place.  The Minister has made every effort within the legal limitations imposed on him to bring about a suitable and acceptable solution to the problem in Roscommon. He has devoted a great deal of time to me, to Deputy Leyden, Deputy Burke and other public representatives in our constituency, to argue the case for the appointment, but the advice given to him through Comhairle na nOspidéal does not consider the appointment in Roscommon Hospital desirable on medical grounds.  This is the Minister's dilemma.</P>
    <P>I agree with this motion in principle.  It would be wrong to suspect or accuse Deputy Burke or Deputy Boland of putting down this motion for political purposes. They put it down to get the help which is needed, but I accept that there is a certain amount of political play in the motion as it stands.  It is only natural that Opposition Deputies get their pound of flesh out of an issue, such as the <Col N="725" /> county hospital in Roscommon, which has got considerable publicity at local and national level.</P>
    <P>As this motion is worded it cannot in all fairness be supported by the House. While, as I said, I agree with it in principle, I also agree with the Minister.  The motion requires that the Dáil command the Minister to do something he has no statutory power to do.  I do not wish Deputy Boland to take any personal offence at what I am about to say, but as shadow spokesman for health I expected more of him.  I expected him to know the legal responsibilities of a Minister in this regard.  If he had known, the motion would have been worded differently.</P>
    <P>It would be regrettable if Deputy Burke and I, two Deputies from the same constituency, with the same aims, had to divide on this motion because it was incorrectly worded.  That is the case with this motion.  It would be even worse if we had to divide on it having regard to the fact that we are and have been at one on this issue both at local authority and health committee levels and at all the public meetings we attended.  It would also be regrettable if we had to come to Dublin and divide on the motion although we have the same aims.  It would be regrettable too if the people of Roscommon thought that the motion was proper and just when it is not and does not reflect the actual position Deputy Burke or Deputy Boland want to achieve.</P>
    <P>The natural temptation is to make that little bit of political play to embarrass Deputy Leyden and myself, but I am not concerned about any embarrassment it might bring me.  I am concerned about how existing negotiations will progress, how, at some time in the future, the possibility of that acceptable solution providing proper services can be found by the Minister. Certainly the Minister, as he has said time and again, is trying to seek that acceptable solution in the best interests of mother and child.</P>
    <P>As a backbencher it is a pity I have to tell Deputy Boland that he should have known more when putting down the motion.  I am quite sure he has read the Health Act and that he is aware of <Col N="726" /> section 41 of that Act.  It would be a pity that he be allowed leave this House this evening without knowing he had made a mistake.  It would be an even greater pity that Deputy Mrs. Burke would not be informed of this fact also.  Deputy Burke may have meant well but the way in which this motion has been framed can be described as being divisive.  Certainly I do not want that.</P>

      <P>The Minister, both in his capacity as shadow Minister for Health, prior to the last election and since he became Minister for Health, has displayed the same continuity in his interest in the people of Roscommon and in this particular appointment to the county hospital.  There has been no change whatsoever in his attitude; I stand here as a witness to that.</P>
      <P>I regret that the whole tone of this debate has not been as serious as I would have liked.  I could name various villages and townlands in County Roscommon.  I might read well.  People in Roscommon might feel they were going to have a gynaecologist in every townland.  Deputy Mrs. Burke did that last evening: I will not do it.  Indeed she included Clondra, which is in County Longford, not in County Roscommon. She may not have known but the Minister announced recently an expenditure of £5 million for Mullingar Hospital which will cater for the needs of Longford and Westmeath.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion it is not the function of the Minister to tell Deputy Boland or Deputy Mrs. Burke how to put down a motion.  The fact that they have put it down so badly means that one cannot amend something that is wrong, fundamentally wrong.  It is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that negotiations are still progressing I should like to think we would make every possible effort to bring about a reasoned and sensible approach to this whole matter, that we would concern ourselves with and take the advice of the medical people.  Indeed, there is divided medical advice.  The Minister acknowledged that fact last evening.  It is acknowledged by the Western Health Board.  Furthermore, it is acknowledged by the people in Roscommon close to this matter.  I, too, acknowledge that there are divided medical views and opinions on this matter.  Regardless of the fact that there may be divisions on the medical views, nevertheless all of the medical people are placing their priorities correctly.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to debate the medical justifications or otherwise, but I am in a position to argue the social need, requirement and justice of having the service in Roscommon.  Certainly I am not going to use the County Hospital in Roscommon or the case for the provision of the proper obstetrical and gynaecological services there as a political football.  They deserve more than that.  The people in County Roscommon who will benefit from the service deserve more than a lot of trash and nonsense at local or national level when such an important matter has to be decided.  For that reason I would ask the two Deputies who put their names to the motion to accept that I agree in principle but I cannot support it because of the illegality of the way it is set out.</P>

    <P>The Deputies have said that we are playing politics with this motion and that we did not understand section 41 of the Health Act.  Surely the present Minister, who is regarded by Fianna Fáil as being a responsible person, should have known the facts when he wrote a letter to Dr. H. Gibbons, TD, which was published in the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> on 1 April 1977, which stated that the Fianna Fáil spokesman for health, Mr. C.J. Haughey, TD, had given a firm under-taking that the next Fianna Fáil Government would fully implement the arrangements for the federation of Roscommon and Ballinasloe hospitals as already negotiated.  The announcement was made at a Roscommon-Leitrim Fianna Fáil constituency dinner in Roscommon last Friday night by Dr. Hugh Gibbons, TD, when he read a letter which said:</P>
    <P>Dear Hugh,</P>
    <P>Following our recent discussion on the situation in county Roscommon and the need for a full-scale maternity unit in the county, I have carefully considered the matter.

      <P>Deputy Colley, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on finance, was the chief speaker at the dinner.  If those Ministers are that responsible they should have known that this could not happen.  The original proposal referred to by Deputy Leyden contained in the Fitzgerald report which was published in 1968 was accepted in principle by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Seán Flanagan.  If that proposal had been accepted then, it would have meant that the surgical and medical services and the accident service provided by Roscommon hospital would have been withdrawn.  It seems ironic that Mr. Seán Flanagan was subsequently treated in Roscommon hospital.  Had the services been withdrawn I would hate to think where Mr. Seán Flanagan would be to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Minister, the late Mr. Childers, nominated Comhairle na nOspidéal on foot of that report, and this is the body that we are now trying to get rid of in section 41 of the Health Act. Before the Coalition Government took office in 1973 I was very concerned that the surgical, medical and accident department services of Roscommon hospital would be completely wiped out. very day of the week serious accident cases are being treated in Roscommon hospital and the surgeons and staff of the hospital work hard for 24 hours a day and deserve every credit they can get.  The Coalition Government took office in 1973 and only then did negotiations start between the Western Health Board and various other interested bodies and from these negotiations the proposed federation emerged.  Up to this time in line with Fianna Fáil policy the <Col N="732" /> surgical and medical services of Roscommon hospital had been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I congratulate and compliment the Western Health Board on their efforts to have a surgeon and a physician appointed to Roscommon hospital.  These posts were approved by the National Coalition Government and the date for their appointment was fixed before the last general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it reasonable to expect people to travel distances of up to 90 miles to the various hospitals, to Ballinasloe, Portiuncula or Galway as the case may be? There is no public transport for our people to these areas. Medical card patients in particular will find the situation very difficult.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that it was not a question of salary so far as the appointment of an obstetrician/gynaecologist is concerned but there are other more important aspects to be taken into consideration. What about the lives of mothers and babies?  I fear very much for expectant mothers who, because of icy roads perhaps, cannot be taken by car to hospital.  These are the sort of problems that should be taken into account.  I urge the Minister to have section 41 of the Health Act amended and to ensure that an obstetrician/gynaecologist is appointed at Roscommon, at least for a trial period of two years as was suggested in relation to the federation.</P>
      <P>Much play has been made of this issue in so far as the meetings of Roscommon County Council were concerned. Last evening I was reminded by the independent Fianna Fáil representatives from my area that I am not a member of the council.  However, I would remind these two gentlemen that had they lived up to the agreement entered into in regard to co-option, I would be a member of that body.</P>

      <P>The motion asks the Minister to ensure that such appointments of professional staff as are necessary to honour the agreement be made without further delay.  It is within the compass of the Minister to take those steps by way of amending legislation. We were loath to suggest that amending legislation be introduced but last night we suggested two alternatives that would have the effect of achieving the federation.  It is wrong to say, therefore, that what the motion seeks cannot be implemented by the Minister. Deputy Leyden said in an interview which he is now trying to deny but which was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 26 August, that as the Government have a 20-seat majority there should be no problem in amending the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not require 16 minutes for what I have to say.  The hardship caused to the children, particularly in Donegal, is very real.  What worries me most is that school transport has not been operating in Donegal since Monday week, although it has been operating spasmodically in other parts of the country.  Efforts are being made to try to overcome the disadvantages of the strike by getting as many children as possible to school but some children have no means of getting to school, even on a temporary basis, and they are being deprived of their schooling.  What bothers me most is that, if the majority of the children are avoiding the worst effects of the strike through the extra efforts of their parents, the Department are, directly or indirectly, saving money in that they do not have to pay for transport during the strike.  Obviously there is no urgency on the part of the authorities to come to terms with the cause of the strike and bring about an early settlement.  I am sure the Minister of State will not deny that that is a factor which could create, and may well have created a situation in which the strike may last longer.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured in various ways to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister and the Department so that they might start trying to settle the strike not only in Donegal but everywhere else as well.  In the last analysis the losers in this situation can only be the children who are being deprived of their schooling. The children who are managing to get to school are only doing so through the expense and inconvenience of their own parents and the parents of neighbouring children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State not to look upon this matter as one that can be left to find its own solution as a result of lack of pressure in the situation outlined by me.  It is a very serious and urgent situation.  There is no substitute for the intervention of the Minister.  It is his responsibility.  I see the Minister of State shaking his head.  I hope he is not denying that it is the responsibility of the Department because it truly is.  If the Minister and the Department do not <Col N="739" /> move, who is going to move?  Without going into the merits or otherwise of the claim of the contractors, the Minister may have an answer to a few relevant questions.  Do CIE, for whom the Minister ultimately pays, get as much or more for their direct service than those who work for them under contract?  I suspect that the contractors have the worst runs and get the worst money. Even if that were not true, it is true that CIE, unfortunately, can have their losses replenished from the taxpayer's pocket. Since CIE have to be subsidised, the contractors should be paid more.  I do not make that observation from any specific knowledge that I have, nor am I in a position to get that knowledge, as is the Minister.  The Minister should consider the matter.  It has been reported that the transport operators have been offered a 6 per cent increase, an offer which does not meet the reality of the situation at present.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State and the Minister for Education to come to grips with this matter.  CIE and the contractors are only at variance in doing the work of the Department for the children. There is no way in which the Minister and his Department can opt out and stand aside and say that this is a matter between the contract operators and CIE. It is nothing of the sort; it is a matter of the children's welfare and education and the Department of Education.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to bend their energies in the direction of getting these people together&mdash;if necessary knocking their heads together&mdash;and getting the strike settled. It cannot be regarded with equanimity. There may be a temptation to do this because the Department are saving money while the strike goes on.  That may not come into the Minister's calculations but it relieves him of the urgency if most of the children are getting to the schools and are not lacking education because of the strike; the strikers are short of money that they would be paid and therefore the Department pay out less than heretofore.  That is why I believe it was urgently necessary to bring the position publicly to the <Col N="740" /> attention of the House.  On that basis I put it to the Minister&mdash;the children first, last and all the time.  I shall finish at that. I know Deputy Enright also has a word to say and the few minutes left of my time with the agreement of the Chair I am happy to give him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware CIE are the agents of the Department of Education and they have made a 6 per cent increase in their offer to the minibus owners.  CIE offered the 6 per cent because the consumer price index has risen by 6.2 per cent between mid-May 1977 and mid-May 1978.  The position as regards those undertaking school transport is that their insurance increased last March in some instances by between 35 per cent and 50 per cent.  We all remember the furore there was when one company increased premiums.  The vast majority in the PAMBO suffered such increases.  CIE increased their own rates as we know by about 20 per cent in May of this year.  Those two figures alone prove that the minibus owners find it uneconomic to undertake the work and discharge these duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a strike in Donegal in this connection.  I am from the Laois-Offaly constituency and all across that area the majority of those engaged in school transport runs have not tendered for renewal of their contracts yet.  In fact CIE are doing the job themselves at present at a cost double and sometimes treble the cost when it was done by private operators.  The Minister can check these figures which can be vouched for.  I want the Minister to be fully aware that it is not enough to say that CIE are his agents.  I believe that is what he told the private bus owners on Tuesday, 3 October, when he said he had no power to interfere with the administration of the transport system or impose any amendment of the terms of the contract documents. If I employ somebody to do a job he is my agent and I should be in a position to ensure that the terms under which I employ him to do something are properly carried out.  The Minister cannot escape by saying CIE are agents for him.  It is on the Minister's shoulders that responsibility rests and on nobody else.  I ask the Minister to do his duty in this <Col N="741" /> matter and see that the thousands of people providing school transport at an economic rate get fair play.  At present they are not getting it; it is not an economic proposition for them.</P>
    <P>These contracts come up for renewal each year and are tendered for.  If the tenders are not competitive they are out. The operators must be competitive and the operation must be economic.  We must ensure they get fair play.  I want an assurance from the Minister that those involved in the Donegal strike and those who have not tendered but have been carrying on this service for years will not be victimised when the present situation is cleared up.  It is important that the Minister should say this in the House. These people want to be met half way. Otherwise, the school transport system which is now creaking badly&mdash;it has ceased in some places&mdash;will be in a very serious position.  The present position must be cleared up as soon as possible. That is essential.  It is completely unsatisfactory with CIE providing the service in some cases, other people in other places, and it is not adequate for the children.  We must try to ensure that the services the children get are not adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I speak also on behalf of the private bus owners, their wives and families, all endeavouring to live by providing these services.  None of them makes a lot of money; they are barely able to keep going. I believe they should get the increase they are seeking.  Six per cent is not enough.  I do not think the reference to the consumer price index is justifiable. When this matter was being dealt with in the Central Statistics Office there was reference to the reduction of road tax.  In fact, school transport services do not benefit from the reduction in road tax.  I believe they have a genuine case and that the Minister should meet them fairly on this important issue immediately in conjunction with CIE so that a reasonable agreement can be worked out.</P>

Why was the period May to May chosen when the consumer price index was at its lowest and when two of the items responsible <Col N="742" /> for bringing down the index at that time were the removal of rates and the removal of car tax, neither of which have any bearing on the cost of running a bus?  If you were to use the CPI, why was not the August to August figure chosen which would be the most up-to-date one and which was 8.2?  CIE applied for price increases last February or March and these were granted.  Will the Minister say if they applied for an increase in the price of their school transport service then, whether it was granted and if so what percentage was allowed to CIE in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity of putting on the records of the House the position regarding the Department and CIE as its agent and the school transport scheme. The position that obtains now is the position that obtained in 1968, 1969 and 1970 and in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977. Apparently it was not challenged by anybody in 1974.  Because of the displeasure which PAMBO felt with CIE they took issue with CIE and made representations to my Department as they had made representations to my predecessor.  The position was explained then as I am about to explain it now.</P>
      <P>CIE administer a school transport scheme as agents for the Minister for Education.  This has been the arrangement since the inception of the scheme. CIE arrange to provide conveyance to their schools for children eligible for free transport.  Where special services are necessary they either employ buses financed by the Department of Education, with ownership vested in the company, or contract with private transport operators to supply vehicles and drivers to do the work.  Where school services are provided by private owners, contracts are negotiated annually by CIE with each individual contractor.  One standard form of agreement is used by CIE for all contracts for this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education are not involved in the negotiation of contracts with private operators.  This is a matter purely between CIE and individual contractors and, I repeat, this has been the case since the inception of the scheme. <Col N="743" /> CIE went about negotiating the school transport contracts in the usual way this year and concluded agreements with the great majority of contractors in the course of the summer vacation.  A small number of contractors around the country were unwilling to do so because of their dissatisfaction with certain elements of the contract.</P>
    <P>At the commencement of the present school year, here and there around the country individual transport operators who normally provided school transport failed to resume the service.  Following discussions with CIE others agreed to accept the contract as negotiated.  A few private operators dropped out of the school transport business and alternative arrangements had to be made for the transport of those children to school.  At the end of September the situation was that by and large the scheme was operating normally.</P>
    <P>In Donegal, while services continued to be provided, 27 of the private contractors engaged in school transport work did not enter into formal agreement with CIE in respect of the current school year.  However, they were among those who continued to bring children to school.  It is not correct to say that in Donegal children are not being brought to school at the moment.  CIE and the Lough Swilly service carry 60 per cent of the students to school at the moment. Ninety-four contractors, 48 of whom are on strike at the moment, to use that term, carry the balance.</P>
    <P>The position obtaining in Donegal now is that only 48 contractors are not working in accordance with the terms of the scheme offered to them by CIE.  If all the children affected were to stay at home the number affected would range somewhere around 2,000.  But I understand the parents of those children have made other arrangements and the bulk of them are going to school.  Therefore, it is not right to say Donegal children are not going to school because of the disagreement which has arisen between CIE and the people they employ.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright indicated that people have not accepted the contracts.  I should like to tell Deputy Enright that <Col N="744" /> 1,016 contractors have signed contracts with CIE in respect of the scheme and are operating in accordance with the terms of the agreement drawn up between themselves and CIE.  Since 3 October&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am indicating to the House that at the moment 1,016 private contractors have accepted the terms of the agreement offered to them by CIE.  In Donegal, half of the 94 private contractors who were unhappy originally about the terms offered to them have resumed operation in the past week and are now transporting children to school.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, aware that the term of office of boards of management of national schools is three years and that as most boards were constituted in October 1975, new boards will need to be established in October 1978.  I understand that the Minister at the time did agree to a review of the situation after experience had been gained of the operation of the boards for the first three years.  It was not apparently envisaged that this would necessitate any hold up in the reconstitution of the boards after the expiration of their first term of office. The INTO requested a postponement of <Col N="616" /> the review until January 1979, and my Department indicated in reply that it had no objection to that provided the other parties concerned agreed and that the reconstitution of the boards went ahead as planned.  Under the existing constitution, the principal teacher is a member of the board and in the larger schools there is a second teacher representative elected by the staff of the school.  As I have indicated previously on a number of occasions, I am in favour of teacher representation on boards of management of our schools.</P>

      <P>The statistical information requested by the Deputy in so far as it is available is set out below.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to furnish information regarding the staffing of each maternity unit as where the units are located in general or district hospitals some of the staff only devote part of their time to the maternity unit.  Furthermore, the information is not available in respect of private hospitals and homes.</P>
      <P>There are no identifiable catchment areas for maternity units as generally patients are free to choose between a number of hospitals or homes.  It is not possible to answer the Deputy's query regarding the units continuing in existence as many of them are privately owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that maternity services should be available for all expectant mothers.  The organisation and development of maternity services in each health board area are determined in the light of identified requirements.  In the programme <Col N="619" /> of general hospital development at present being implemented provision is made for maternity units in the planning <Col N="620" /> of the hospitals except in relation to the Dublin area and also, to some extent, in Cork, where the specialised maternity hospitals generally provide the service.</P>

Completion of development <Col N="632" /> works that had been planned to improve the position in the two areas, consisting of a major extension to the Galway exchange and the provision of additional circuits to Galway, were delayed.  The extension to the trunk exchange will begin to be brought into service next month and it is expected that additional trunk circuits will be provided within the next six months.

    <P>1.  Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council sought £34,786,000 and £16,809,000 respectively for expenditure in 1978 on commitments and for new works to start in the year.  The overall allocations notified to cover both commitments and new works were as follows: Dublin Corporation £28,500,000; Dublin County Council £10,300,000.</P>
    <P>2.  Allocations notified for commitments include provision for (a) debit balances on the local authority housing capital account at 31 December 1977, (b) expenditure in 1978 on completed schemes, (c) dwellings in progress at 31 December 1977, and (d) expenditure in 1978 on schemes contractually committed in 1977 but not started until 1978.</P>
    <P>3.  The additional allocations notified to authorities in September 1978 were made for commitments and also for new work in the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>4.  The Public Capital Programme provision for local authority housing in 1978 is £80.77 million.  In addition housing authorities are authorised to spend 10 per cent of their Local Loans Fund allocations by way of working overdraft.</P>
    <P>5.  The total authorised expenditure levels of some authorities may vary to some extent during the year on account of savings and the redistribution amongst other authorities of such savings.</P>
    <P>6.  Figures in the table have been rounded to nearest £1,000.</P>

      <P>Appended are the details sought in relation to (1) the Employment Incentive Scheme, operated by my Department; (2) the Work Experience Programme, operated by my Department, and (3) the Community Youth Training Programme, operated by AnCO.</P>
      <P>In addition information is supplied in relation to the Ballyfermot Employment Census for which money was provided through my Department.</P>
      <P>The Employment Incentive Scheme&mdash;The Employment Incentive Scheme was introduced on 28 February 1977 and was intended to encourage employers through payment of premiums to recruit into permanent employment unemployed adults and school leavers who represent an increase over the existing level of employment. The premium, which is £20 per week for an unemployed experienced worker and £14 per week for a young person under 25 years of age entering permanent employment for the first time, is payable for up to 24 weeks.  Originally the premium for young persons was £10 and was confined to young persons under 20 years of age.</P>
      <P>(i)  Expenditure to date: Up to 6 October 1978 a total of £3,518,084 has been expended on the scheme.  Of this £2,721,934 was expended in 1978.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Numbers employed: Up to 6 October 1978 premiums have been paid in respect of a total of 10,212 employees. The figure for 1978 is 7,775.</P>
      <P>(iii)  Numbers under 25 years: Up to 6 October 1978 premiums have been paid in respect of 3,489 young persons under 25 years of age entering employment for the first time (2,807 in 1978) but in addition a significant proportion of the 6,723 experienced adults in respect of whom premiums were paid were under 25 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> (iv)  Number of permanent jobs created, and (v) average duration of jobs: It is assumed that the bulk of the jobs in respect of which the premiums have been paid are permanent.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Plans for continuation: The question of extending the scheme beyond the end of 1978 is at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Work Experience Programme&mdash;The purpose of the Programme, which was introduced on 3 September 1978 is to give school leavers and other young people an opportunity to learn about the work environment and to get practical experience of a range of different jobs.</P>
    <P>(i)  Expenditure to date: There has been no expenditure under the programme to date.  £600,000 has been allocated for 1978.  Refunds of payments made by employers to participants are issued at 4 weekly intervals.  The first refunds will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Numbers employed: 368 young people were participating in the programme in the week ending 13 October 1978.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Numbers under 25 years: 368. The scheme is confined to young persons under 25.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Numbers of permanent jobs created: The scheme comenced on 3 September 1978.</P>
    <P>(v)  Average duration of jobs: A programme for a young person is designed to last for six months.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Plans for continuation: It is proposed that the Work Experience Programme will be continued.</P>
    <P>The Community Youth Training Programme&mdash;The aim of this programme, which is run by AnCO and commenced at the end of 1975, is to provide unemployed young persons, particularly school leavers, with opportunities to undergo training and to participate in work projects of benefit to local communities.</P>
    <P>(i)  Expenditure to date: £1,625,948.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Numbers employed: To date, a total of 2,518 young persons have been employed in projects under the Programme.  There are 818 currently employed.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Numbers under 25 years: Varies <Col N="644" /> from time to time, but based on an analysis of non-skilled trainees in training at 31 August 1978, 85 per cent were under 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Numbers of permanent jobs created, and (v) average duration of jobs: Because the programme is concerned with projects work of three to four months duration, permanent employment opportunities have not been created.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Plans for continuation: Plans for 1979 indicate a level of activity 15 per cent higher than 1978.</P>
    <P>Ballyfermot Employment Census&mdash;The proposals in relation to this project resulted from discussions between the Employment Action Team and the Ballyfermot Employment Action Group.  It is a community based survey relating to unemployment problems in the Ballyfermot area, and it provided for the employment of young people on census-type work.</P>
    <P>(i)  Expenditure to date: £9,500 out of an allocation of £10,000.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Numbers employed: The maximum number employed was 33 at any one time.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Numbers under 25 years: 32.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Number of permanent jobs created: As the scheme consisted of a survey of current unemployment problems in the Ballyfermot area, the young persons' employment was necessarily of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>(v)  Average duration of jobs: Four weeks.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Plans for continuation: The survey has been completed and the data is currently being processed.</P>

      <P>(a)  The total authorised allocated to the 38 vocational education committees this year was £46,393,571 for their ordinary schemes and £8,394,300 for the nine regional technical colleges; (b) The allocations were made on 28 September 1978, and 6 October respectively; (c) The amount allocated to each vocational education committee and each regional technical college is, as per attached schedules.  The amounts allocated to the committees do not include a sum of £300,000 provided for the promotion of youth and sport activities in the various committee areas; (d) Each of the 38 vocational education committees operates its own scheme which involves in general the financing and development of education within its own area.  This includes the payment of its employees, the maintenance of schools and classes, the administration of colleges of technology and regional technical colleges, where applicable, and the making of provision for scholarships and grants.  They are also deeply involved in the organisation of pre-employment courses and apprenticeship courses and in the promotion of youth and sport activities; (e) It is my intention to continue to make adequate financial provision to committees for the operation and development of their schemes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy presumably has in mind the Government's special programme for the creation of 5,000 jobs for young people announced in the budget.  The current expectation is that target of 5,000 jobs will be fully achieved by the end of the year and that there will be no shortfall.</P>
