      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In relation to the Road Traffic (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1978, which has been introduced in the Seanad, this party recognise that there is an urgent need for it and think that it would be a pity if its enactment were delayed until after the summer recess. Therefore, this party and, I understand, the Labour Party would be prepared to facilitate the passing of this Bill through the House next week before the summer recess.</P>

    </table>
    <P>On Committee Stage I made the point, which has been borne out by a number of newspaper references in an extremely interesting article&mdash;which we should all read&mdash;in last week's <i>Economist</i> of the coming revolution of the taxpayers.  I am sure they are dramatising the situation but in that article they say that in 20 years' time the taxpayers will resort to violence if they do not get their way.  More and more people are sucked into the tax net every year or even into the marginal tax net, which is far more expensive than the ordinary one, because of inflation and stable tax bands.  The Minister argued on Second Stage and also on Committee Stage that he has increased the allowance dramatically for people paying income tax.  That is true of the marriage allowance, which has been increased quite considerably. It is the bands which should be increased if we are really sincere about <Col N="1544" /> not taking a larger slice of peoples' incomes than before.</P>
    <P>I put down my amendment to try to get the bands to bear some relation to the value of money.  I suggest that over a four-year period they should be increased annually by 25 per cent. This means that the £500 band would now become £625 and the next band of £1,000 would become £1,250.  I believe the sense of discontent which many taxpayers feel would be offset if they were ensured of the goodwill and determination of the Government and of the Oireachtas not to see their position worsened because of the effects of inflation on their salaries.  The effects of inflation would be offset by the widening of the tax bands so that they would be increased this year by 25 per cent and by 25 per cent in the years to come.  I feel this is a worth-while reform in the tax system, which would ensure that when any extra pounds wage earners get, moves them from one tax band into a higher tax band its effect will be offset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: This amendment would have the effect of increasing the rate bands and reducing the top rate of income tax for all married taxpayers.  The cost of it, as I indicated on the Committee Stage, would be about £35 million in a full year.  When we consider what is already in the Bill in regard to increases in various income tax allowances which will cost £97.6 million in a full year. It will be clear that the provision of reliefs costing a further £35 million could not be undertaken at this time.  At any given time there will always be room for improvement of various kinds in allowances in the income tax code.  Something a person discovers as he makes improvements is that he can always be accused of failing to make commensurate improvements in other areas.  It is always possible to juggle the figures to produce a case for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we see that we are providing in the Bill for an increase of £630 in the married allowance and that that is seven times bigger than the largest increase ever given in the case of the married allowance, and that we are increasing <Col N="1545" /> the single allowance by about four-and-a-half times the increase given last year, we realise that this Bill contains by far the most generous increases in allowances affecting all taxpayers that have ever been given. As Deputies are aware, the allowances are precisely in accordance with the undertakings given in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and they are being implemented in this Bill at a very substantial cost.</P>
    <P>The increase in personal allowances, combined with a pay increase of 8 per cent, will give an increase in weekly after-tax income of £7.88p or 13.2 per cent to a married man with two children who has £70 a week, a little less than average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>However desirable other changes might be, in the circumstances it will be obvious to everyone that further improvements this year cannot be contemplated.  The attitude of the average taxpayer is that he would like to see the proposals for increases in the allowances as contained in this Bill implemented as soon as possible so that he may get the benefits as soon as possible.  What may happen later on is another matter.  Here we can deal only with the situation for this year.  Since the situation for this year is as I have described it, increases of unprecedented size way above anything ever given before, I do not think there will be any general dissatisfaction with the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>: Amendment No. 2 is in the name of Deputy O'Leary and others.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are related and, therefore, we can discuss Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 11 to 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from discussion on Committee Stage regarding the limits of income tax reliefs on premiums paid towards a pension. <Col N="1546" /> There is an overall limit of 15 per cent whether the premiums are towards a pension for one's self or for one's spouse.  There is a further limit in the part of the Bill that we propose to delete which states that although the overall limit is 15 per cent there is also a limit of 5 per cent on deductions in respect of contributions in respect of the spouse.  Given that there is an overall limit, I do not see much point in having a subsidiary limit in respect of contributions concerning a spouse.  I do not think the Minister was able to give a cogent reason for this on Committee Stage. However, he may have had time to consider the matter since then and I should like to hear his views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: As the Deputy has said, this was mentioned on Committee Stage.  The position is that if the amendment were accepted the only limit applying in cases of this kind would be the 15 per cent.  That would mean that the limitation of 15 per cent would apply to provision for annuities for widows and for children.</P>
      <P>The limit of 5 per cent to which the Deputy referred was introduced as a relieving measure but also it was kept at that limit as an anti-avoidance measure.  The primary purpose of the provision is to enable a taxpayer to make arrangements for a pension or annuity on retirement.  If we were to take away the limitation of 5 per cent, it is clear that very generous arrangements could be set up, for instance, in respect of young dependants with, of course, a tax relief in respect of those arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>:  The overall limit of 15 per cent would still apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>:  Yes, but since the 5 per cent would not apply it would mean that in regard to provision made for young dependants a full 15 per cent could be devoted to the provision of very generous annuities for young dependants.  Clearly we are talking here of people who are very well off but they are precisely the people who would avail of this if they were given the opportunity because they would get very generous tax deductions in <Col N="1547" /> respect of arrangements of this kind.  I do not think that is the intention of the Oireachtas.  Much more in line with what I would presume to be the intention of the Oireachtas would be that a taxpayer primarily would make provision for his own retirement and, in conjunction with that, he would make provision for his wife and children in the event of his demise.</P>
      <P>It is sufficiently clear that the existing arrangements of a 15 per cent limitation and 5 per cent in the case of the widow and dependants meets the normal requirement of the normal taxpayer and that the abolition of the 5 per cent limitation would not be of real benefit to the ordinary taxpayer. The only people who would benefit would be those of considerable wealth and income, although the people most likely to gain are those with considerable wealth but not necessarily an enormous income.  If they were to devote all of the provision they were making from income in respect of superannuation for, say, their children, they could arrange for generous payments without having to make arrangements for their own retirement because of the level of their own wealth.</P>
      <P>It was not the intention of the Oireachtas to facilitate cases of this kind by allowing tax relief in respect of such premiums.  I believe that the existing limitations of 15 per cent and 5 per cent meet the requirements of the ordinary taxpayer for whom this provision is intended.  There would not be any advantage to the ordinary taxpayer in abolishing the 5 per cent limitation as proposed in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I cannot follow the Minister's argument.  Basically, he is saying that it is perfectly all right for a person to allocate 15 per cent of his earnings towards creating a pension for himself.  If he is trying to create a pension for his children or wife he may set aside only 5 per cent.  The distinction does not make any sense. There is as much possibility of avoidance of tax in respect of the creation of a pension for one's self as there is in the creation of a pension for one's children or wife.  Why should one <Col N="1548" /> be allowed to be more generous to one's self by going all the way up to 15 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will appreciate that these arrangements are normally made together.  It is the one arrangement of the pension for the person and his dependants.  If one is doing that, then the amount one has to pay in respect of the pension for dependants is much smaller than the amount one has to pay for the pension for one's self.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept that that is likely to be the case.  I cannot see why a man who wants to devote 15 per cent of his earnings towards creating a pension for his wife and children should be told that he may not do so, while a man who decides to make no pension provision for his wife and children can, if he wishes devote up to 15 per cent of his earnings towards the creation of a pension for himself. There does not seem to be any justification for that distinction.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a passing reference to anti-avoidance measures, but the potential for avoidance of tax is just as great in the case of a pension provision for one's self as it is in the case of a pension provision for one's wife and dependants.  Therefore, there does not seem to be any justification for the existence of the part of the Finance Bill which this amendment seeks to remove, nor has any justification been adduced by the Minister in his reply.  I expected some reason to be brought forward in his reply.  I feel that this amendment should be pressed.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>:  I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 40 and 41, in column (3) of the Table, to delete &ldquo;935&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;955&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a deceptively simple but fundamentally important amendment.  It refers to that portion of the table in section 5 of the Finance Bill which establishes the appropriate tax-free allowance for widowed persons.  There <Col N="1549" /> were a number of amendments on Committee Stage which were designed to improve the lot of widowed persons in particular and there was a great deal of argument about them, most of which was rejected by the Minister on the grounds that the increases being given in the Bill were substantial and that any further increases would involve the Exchequer in too substantial an outlay.</P>
    <P>In the course of that discussion the Minister went to some length to defend what he had done.  Specifically, he went in some detail into the background of the decision to give widowed persons a certain tax-free allowance and to distinguish that allowance from tax-free allowances payable to other persons.  In describing an argument which was made by single people at column 787 of Volume 307 of the Official Report, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In so far as children are concerned there are special allowances to cater for them, and as an individual the single person should not treat it in the same way as the widowed person. That is the argument made with perhaps increasing frequency.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>That argument has not been accepted, as is evidenced by the fact that the differential in favour of the widowed person as against the single person has been maintained.</P>
    <P>Later on, at column 788, he said:</P>
    <P>The approach that we have at the moment and have had for a number of years is to give a widowed person an allowance which is bigger than that of a single person but to give it on a permanent basis.  In the long run this may well be the most satisfactory thing from a widowed person's point of view.</P>
    <P>During the discussion on Committee Stage I pointed out to the Minister that, although he had given the same extra allowance of some £200 to the widowed person and to the single person, the fact that he was applying the same figure to a different base line, £665 in the case of a single person and £735 in the case of a widowed person, <Col N="1550" /> meant, and could not mean otherwise, that the differential he was claiming had been maintained was, in fact, being eroded.  In other words, in real terms, in terms of the purchasing power of a widowed person compared to a single person, under this Finance Bill the widowed person is approximately 3 per cent worse off than the single person.</P>
    <P>As reported in Volume 307, column 945 of the Official Report of 13 June I said:</P>
    <P>The Minister argued that between last year and this year the differential between the widowed person and the single person has been maintained. This statement is true only in a sense which means nothing in real terms to the widows.  It is true only in the sense that the same extra allowance of £70 has been given to the widow as to the single person.  It is not necessarily true that because the same allowance is being given to each, the differential is being maintained.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 946 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Has the Deputy available what he says I said on the last occasion because I have no recollection of saying what the Deputy says I said.</P>
    <P>I then commented:</P>
    <P>I took a note of what the Minister said as he spoke and the words he used were &ldquo;the differential has been maintained&rdquo;.  The Official Report is not yet available.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy is mistaken, although I cannot swear to it.</P>
    <P>He want on to say:</P>
    <P>My recollection is that what I said was that the increase was the same for the widowed person as for the single person.</P>
    <P>He was then asked by Deputy Quinn whether he would accept the statistical and factual analysis of what I had said and his only reply was:</P>
    <P>I can give the Deputy all sorts of statistical analyses which would produce surprising results.</P>
    <P>Later at column 949 the Minister said: <Col N="1551" />  ... if my recollection of what I said on the last occasion is incorrect and Deputy Horgan's turns out to be correct, I shall apologise to him.</P>
    <P>At column 951 I said I was sure the widows of Ireland would rather action than apologies.  I now put it to the Minister that he did say what I said he said and that, not only was his recollection incorrect on that occasion, but the analysis on the basis of which he maintained that the differential had been unchanged is also incorrect.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason we put down this amendment.  It increases the tax free allowance for widowed people by, as far as I can recall, about £20.  It is the absolute bare minimum needed to restore, in real terms, the differential between the tax free allowances of widowed persons and single persons.  If the Minister really believes and maintains that the level of the differential which existed last year should be carried forward into this year, he has no option but to accept this amendment which I urge him to do on behalf of this party.</P>

      <P>: I support this amendment.  Relatively the position of the widowed person is worsened in the allowances set out in the Bill.  Their real value is not maintained.  A case could be made for even more generous allowances for widowed persons.  Our case has been confined to the criticism that their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> single persons appears to have worsened. I am not clear whether the Minister denied this, or agrees with it, or accepts our case.  The provisions for widowers are not of a piece with the kind of concessions made to other categories of taxpayers.  At this point there is no need to make the general case about the real need for generosity towards this category of taxpayers, both men and women.  A great deal of family responsibility devolves on their shoulders.  That case has been made amply elsewhere.  We repeat the criticisms made on Committee Stage that the allowances do not appear to be adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>:  First of all, on the basis of the Official Report available, <Col N="1552" /> I want to apologise to Deputy Horgan in so far as my recollection of what I said earlier would appear to be incorrect. I promised him if that were so I would apologise, and I am now doing so.  I have to add that what I thought I said, and what I think I said, was that the difference was being maintained, that is, the £200, although, as reported, it is, as Deputy Horgan stated, the differential.</P>
      <P>In response to the question by Deputy Quinn as quoted by Deputy Horgan I forget the exact words but the import of what I said was that one could produce all sorts of statistical analyses which would produce surprising results.  I was saying that in a general sense.  The fact is that, if we look at the situation as dealt with in this amendment, we find that the difference between the single person's allowance and the widowed person's allowance is being maintained, that is, the difference in cash terms.</P>
      <P>I do not dispute Deputy Horgan's figures in regard to percentage changes.  One could take the situation of a married couple and talk about the difference between what is being done for them and what is being done for the single person.  One could work out certain percentages.  One could approach the matter on at least two other different bases to get different kinds of results.  What I suggest really counts with any taxpayer is what he is actually getting into his pocket. Here the position is that the widowed person is getting an increase in his or her allowance of £200.  That increase is four times greater than the increase granted in either of the two previous years.  That is what really counts with the taxpayer, I would suggest.  As against an increase of £50 in 1977, this year the increase is £200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can juggle the statistics around, the percentages, the differential arrived at by percentages, and so on, but nothing will alter that fact.  The increase this year, at a time of lower inflation, is £200 as against £50 last year.  I would be the last to argue&mdash; and, indeed, I would be very foolish to argue&mdash;that the allowance in respect of a widowed person or, indeed, the <Col N="1553" /> allowance in respect of most other categories, is as large as it should be and as we would like it to be.  I am not arguing that.  I am arguing that the overall increases in allowances for all taxpayers, as provided in this Bill, far exceed anything ever done before.</P>
    <P>The cost is very substantial, the best part of £100 million in a full year. It is what we undertook to do this year, and in the case of a widowed person it represents an increase in the allowance four times greater than that granted last year.  That is not to say that it should not be bigger in any circumstance, but it is to say that the argument in regard to disimprovement in the differential calculated on the basis of a percentage does not have anything like the same reality as that of an increase of £200 in the allowance, which is four times greater than last year.  That is what counts to a widow who is a taxpayer, and the proposal in the amendment, however attractive it may seem, does not alter the fact that the allowance provided for in the Bill is so substantially greater than what was done last year that the arguments on the percentages involved tend to become a little unreal.</P>

      <P>: I can assure the Minister he will not have the slightest difficulty in remembering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a point in favour of the amendment.  The Minister had money to disburse this year on tax allowances, and the way he can be judged is on the priorities he used in <Col N="1554" /> disposing of that money.  I should like to illustrate the Minister's priorities this year in spending that substantial amount of money by making a comparison between the increase in the tax allowance he has given to a married couple who have no children and a widowed person with six children. This year he has increased the TFA of a married couple without children by 57 per cent and of a widowed person with six children by only 9 per cent.  That is the reverse of the type of priority we should have and it serves to accentuate injustice. Deputy Horgan's amendment goes a small way towards righting the injustice created in the Bill and I therefore support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Though I accept the Minister's apology, I am more than disappointed that he has not accepted the substance of the amendment which, as Deputy Bruton has pointed out, is the absolute minimum we could look for in the circumstances.  This amendment is based on our understanding of what the Minister said on this matter during Committee Stage.  There was, is and should be maintained a special relationship between the TFA of a widowed person and a single person.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was replying to the amendment he went into some detail on the different forms of statistical analysis and he spoke of the ratio between the TFA for single and married people, but none of this was in issue on Committee Stage except, perhaps, the case of taxing married working women.  The ratio that was in issue on Committee Stage was that creating a differential between single and widowed persons.</P>
      <P>The Minister's response to the amendment was in two forms.  First, he argued that one could not make a valid case by pointing to this ratio without ignoring other cases in relation to other ratios, and I have tried to make a case for the point I understood the Minister to have made on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's second line of defence was to argue that the size of the differential involved, as extended by the marginal amendment we have put down, is irrelevant when compared <Col N="1555" /> with the total size of the increase in the TFA.  I submit that the two are important and that you cannot allow one to become so important as completely to destroy the importance of the other.  The Minister also argued that the differential between the two has been maintained with all that that implies, but there are several different ways of looking at tax-free allowances.  One can look at them in terms of percentage difference, in terms of net disposable income, and in cash terms.  I submit that of all these ways only one suits the Minister's book and that is the cash one.  I suspect that the percentage basis and the net disposable income basis go against the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that we do not regard this amendment by any means as an answer to the problem of widows, especially those with families. We argued on Committee Stage, and will again in the future, for fair treatment for people in this situation. The amendment was not designed to do more than to restore the differential in last year's scheme for allowances and the Minister has not only refused to accept the amendment but he has decided to create a situation which will erode the differential, and this is something this party will resist as, I am sure, it will be strongly resisted by widowed persons throughout the country.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I moved an amendment, supported by Deputy Peter Barry, to increase the allowances for income tax purposes in certain cases, with particular reference to an employed person taking care of somebody <Col N="1556" /> who is incapacitated.  The Minister's reply was that the cost of incorporating the amendment would be approximately £11 million and that he could not contemplate it this year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I have selected from the four allowances I sought to have increased on that occasion the one which I believe to be the most deserving of all and which also has suffered most from not having been increased in the past.  This is the housekeeper allowance.</P>
    <P>That allowance is one which may be obtained typically by a single-parent family where the parent has to go out to work and has to have some-body in to look after the house and the children.  In 1949 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacGilligan, decided to introduce a housekeeper allowance of £100 against the tax of the person concerned to entitle that person to some allowance against tax and thereby enable him or her to pay a housekeeper to look after the children and the house.  If such an allowance was not paid there might be a risk that the person might not be able to go out to work, his services would be lost to the country, he would be a charge on the Exchequer because he would have to go on social assistance rather than go out to work and the community and he or she would lose.</P>
    <P>That allowance was introduced against tax for perhaps the most deserving of all familial situations that one can envisage.  It was introduced at a rate of £100 in 1949.  It is now £165; it has gone up by £65, a mere 65 per cent in almost 20 years.  We all know what has happened to inflation since. The Minister opposite never ceased telling us what happened to inflation since 1974.  We know what happened to inflation since 1954.  Inflation since 1949, when this allowance was introduced, has exceeded by an immeasurable extent this 65 per cent for the most deserving of all cases in a family situation from the point of view of relief from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I propose increasing this housekeeper allowance from its present level of £165 to £600.  The Minister said in Committee that the overall cost of my original amendment, which would <Col N="1557" /> have covered a wider range of categories than this one would have been about £11 million.  The cost of increasing the housekeeper allowance would be substantially less than £2 million and possibly not more than £1 million.  Spending £1 million on this category of cases, clearly forgotten as far as our tax code is concerned, would be £1 million well spent.  It would not unbalance the Minister's financial package.  Given its high social value, and its limited social cost, I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: First of all, I want to correct one or two misstatements, unintentional I am certain, by Deputy Bruton.  The housekeeper allowance was not, as he thinks, introduced in 1949; it was introduced in 1920.  In 1949 it was increased from £45 to £100.  Deputy Bruton said, correctly, that since then it has gone up to £165, but the point which had arisen on Committee Stage already now arises here.  Of that £65 increase £40 took place in 1974-75 and was merely compensating for the abolition of earned income allowances, so that effectively the position is that the increase in that allowance since 1949 has been only £25.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Another view is that the experience with this allowance since 1920 is that it clearly has not kept pace with other allowances or with the increase in inflation.  One could speculate for some considerable length of time on the reason for that. That is the way it has happened.  I do not subscribe to the view that the record of increase in this allowance over the years since 1920 was a good one or that that record suggests in any way that there is some defect in this allowance by which it would not merit increases at more frequent intervals and in line with at least the fall in the value of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;but there must be some significance in the fact that successive Ministers for Finance over the years have not found it necessary or desirable&mdash;or possible, most likely &mdash;to increase this allowance commensurately with most other allowances. Other Ministers for Finance perhaps over the years have found themselves explaining to the House why this allowance was not increased in a particular year's budget, but none of them has been in the position that I am in today of being able to point out that anybody who would benefit from that allowance has benefited to an unprecedented degree on the basis of increased allowances contained in this Bill.  Therefore, even if there is not an increase in the housekeeper allowance, there is a very substantial and unprecedented increase in the allowances of the taxpayer concerned. It does not specifically meet the problem met by this allowance, but it does mean that anybody who might have benefited by some increase in this allowance is not being ignored or overlooked and is in fact getting the benefit of very substantial increases in allowances applying to all taxpayers provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of increasing this housekeeper allowance is one that obviously has to be considered from time to time, but the circumstances of the increases this year are such that it is not the most pressing matter in relation to income tax allowances for the reason that I mentioned, that anybody who would benefit from it is already benefiting to an unprecedented degree from the across-the-board allowances provided for in this Bill.  All such persons are not a priority issue this year because they are benefiting to that degree.  That is not to say that there is not a case for increasing the housekeeper <Col N="1559" /> allowance or that it will not be increased in the future, but that the case for increasing it this year is far less than it has been in any other year because the taxpayers concerned have benefited to an unprecedented degree. I do not find myself in a position to accept this amendment with the increased cost of something in the region of £2 million involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I indicated on the last occasion that the bulk of the cost would be in the housekeeper allowance. On this occasion the people concerned will be benefiting to an unprecedented degree and therefore do not need the same degree of priority that they might need in other circumstances.  I cannot accept the amendment.  I am in a considerably stronger position perhaps than my predecessor was when he failed to increase this allowance in that the persons concerned are gaining very substantially anyway in the across-the-board allowances.  I am not saying that there is no case for increasing this allowance nor that it will not be increased at any time in the future but that I cannot accept it for this year in the circumstances I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister made considerable play of the difference between his position and that of many of his predecessors in relation to this amendment.  I suggest that there are other differences which the Minister did not mention which would encourage people to take a different view of the amendment.  One of the factors that obtained up to the last four or five years in relation to this allowance was that we had a social welfare system which was considerably less well developed than it is today.  My main argument in support of this amendment is that it could have a very beneficial effect in relation to increasing employment opportunities and in allowing <Col N="1560" /> scarce money for social welfare to be diverted into other important social welfare objectives.  The reason, I suspect, that successive Ministers for Finance did not to any great extent increase this was because there was not then an increasing sector of the social welfare recipient group which might have benefited from it.  There should have been a major discussion between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare about the possible beneficial effects of accepting this amendment.</P>
      <P>One of the results of the growth of the social welfare system over the past few years has been a growth in the number of single persons with family responsibilities in receipt of allowances from the State which are barely adequate and in some cases are inadequate. These people are caught in a poverty trap, they cannot afford to go to work, they have to stay at home and live on whatever the State can afford to give them.  There are, I suspect, the better part of 10,000 people in this situation.  We are not insisting or demanding that all such people should go to work.  We are strongly in favour, especially when their children are young, of giving them the maximum State support in order to enable them to remain at home and look after their children, but as their situation changes and the children begin to grow up they should be encouraged to go to work not just for their own sake and the sake of increasing the productivity of the economy but because they could, by employing people to help to look after their children, increase the employment available in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I am sure we can find out by way of a parliamentary question we do not know how many taxpayers are actually claiming the housekeeper allowance.  I suspect the number is fairly small.  It seems to us like a good idea that it is being allowed to die and it should really be looked at now as part of an integrated approach designed to allow people who want to, to get back to work and to encourage them to create more jobs.  The present situation is that the £165 allowance may not even cover the cost of a social <Col N="1561" /> welfare stamp for a person they might employ to look after their children. The potential for imaginative and comparatively inexpensive initiatives in this field by the Minister and the Government has been completely overlooked and I would urge the Minister to look at it again, certainly between now and next year, not just in terms of the £2 million it might cost but in terms of what it might do to the social fibre of the country in allowing people who wish to, to work. One of the problems is that many of the people I am talking about would not be on the unemployment register to start with, so that simply sending them out to work would not necessarily reduce the numbers on the live register, but if it is important as the Minister maintains, to get people to work whether or not the live register is reduced as a result, this is a secondary consideration.  I would strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The main reason why the housekeeper allowance has not been increased over the years is that apart from the reasons put forward by Deputy Horgan the matter was not really raised here in a serious fashion as it has been raised under this Bill. Having listened to the Minister I feel he is sympathetic to the case being made and I am almost confident that he will do something about it next year as a result of this debate.  I redesigned the amendment to facilitate the Minister in accepting it by minimising its cost and by confining it to the housekeeper allowance alone.  I can sympathise with the Minister's anxiety not to make any change in his tax package although I feel that if ever an exception should be made it should have been made for this amendment because it relates to perhaps the case of greatest hardship and neglect in the tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not really produce any reason for the failure of successive Ministers to increase this allowance. The Minister said that there was no defect in the allowance and that one could speculate as to the reason and that there must be some significance in the fact that successive Ministers <Col N="1562" /> did not give any increase, but the Minister was evidently unable to find any reason on searching through the Department files or he would have told us the reason.  There is no reason why this allowance was not increased beyond mere neglect of the most severely handicapped section, namely, one-parent families.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that the allowances that had been given across the board in this year's tax concessions in some way helped people in this category to an extent that would justify or partially justify not increasing the housekeeper allowance.  This is manifestly not true.  The likely case in which a housekeeper allowance would be sought would be that which I have cited in this debate of a widow or widower with a large number of children.  I would point out again that this year, although there have been generous tax allowances given, in the case of a widower with, say, six children, his tax allowances have been increased by only 9 per cent whereas the tax allowances of a married couple with no children have been increased by 57 per cent.  Therefore, proportionately more of the allowances this year has been given to types of taxpayers who would never have to apply for a housekeeper allowance and far less had been given to the type of taxpayer who would be likely to apply for the housekeeper allowance.  The Minister's priorities in giving out this money are such that they strengthen the case for increasing the housekeeper allowance because it is that type of family that has been most neglected this year in the allowances and increases granted.</P>
    <P>However, I do not wish to end on a note of acrimony because I believe the Minister is sympathetic to the case made.  Indeed I am confident that as a result of this discussion he will be able to do something next year.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1563" />  In page 10, line 4, after &ldquo;company&rdquo; where it first occurs to insert &ldquo;engaged wholly or in the greater part in manufacturing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the amendment by which we sought to tighten the section which permits people to offset what we see as the unrestricted interest relief for individuals who borrow to invest in a private trading company.  The purpose of the amendment was to limit this allowance, to ensure that if the effect of the section was designed to enhance employment prospects this would not be interfered with, but rather to ensure that there were certain limits to the possibilities of the income tax relief that could be gained under the section.  As we saw it the section, unamended, would permit rather beneficial rewards to accrue to a very small number of people.  That has been part and parcel of our approach to the various sections of the Bill: if rewards and incentives are to be given to individuals in the hope that extra investment will follow and that, as a result, employment will be created, we have not been against that principle but rather sought to hedge it round with socially just criteria thereby ensuring, first, that individuals who could benefit under the various sections could not do so in an unrestricted way.</P>
    <P>Of course, at present the position is that in the case of a private trading company a person must be a full-time employee or a director of the firm and must hold at least 5 per cent of the stock before he can benefit from unlimited relief against tax on borrowings for investment in the company. Under the section full-time qualification and the 5 per cent stock limit are involved so that a part-time employee or director can benefit irrespective of his investment or of his state in the private trading company.</P>
    <P>There is the question raised in the section whether it can be decided that a company is engaged in manufacturing. The Revenue Commissioners have their criteria for so deciding.  Unamended section 8&mdash;if an amendment of the type we proposed was not accepted, and the Minister did not indicate on Committee Stage that he <Col N="1564" /> was willing to accept it&mdash;would operate in a way that an individual with an income at almost the £50,000 a year level could borrow a sum three or four times that amount at 10 per cent to invest in one or more trading companies, becoming a part-time, non-executive director in each case.  Certainly his success in becoming a part-time director would be enhanced by the kind of transaction I have mentioned. Then the interest on his borrowings would be in the order of £15,000 but, if he belonged to the appropriate band &mdash;say the 60 per cent&mdash;the real cost would be £6,000 a year only and, at the same time, he would be receiving the full benefit of the investments. Therefore in effect we would be giving a rather substantial subsidy to somebody for whom it was not in any way necessary.  It is to avoid the possibility of that type of rather hypothetical and rare situation that we put forward this amendment.</P>
    <P>As we indicated to the Minister on Committee Stage we were willing to consider any other changes he might wish to ring out on such an amendment. All we were concerned to do was to preserve the overall point of the section, to ensure that it could not be seen as yet another hidden form of assistance for those who were not in need of such.  We wanted to preserve whatever usefulness lay in the idea or attraction that employment and incentive had for such people to invest but we wanted to avoid some of the side effects we did not think were socially just.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy M. O'Leary mentioned that the benefit conferred in this section is confined to a small number of people.  The effect of his amendment is to confine it to a much smaller number of people.  I listened, I hope attentively, to what he said and I still have not heard a case for this amendment.  If we take the situation Deputy O'Leary described towards the end of his contribution of somebody borrowing, say, £50,000 at 10 per cent and investing it in companies&mdash;I did not check Deputy O'Leary's figures but I think the point of what he was saying was&mdash;such a person would be able to invest £50,000 in perhaps a <Col N="1565" /> number of companies, become a part-time director to benefit under this section and, instead of having to pay £15,000 interest would have to pay £6,000 only because of income tax relief.</P>
      <P>It appears from this amendment that Deputy O'Leary and his colleagues think that that is all right provided that the company in which the investment is made is engaged wholly or in greater part in manufacturing. That is the effect of the amendment, to confine the relief to cases where the company is engaged wholly or in greater part in manufacturing.  Therefore, the principle of somebody getting that kind of relief apparently is acceptable to Deputy O'Leary and his colleagues.  That is not the principle that is involved here.  What is apparently involved is whether it is worth while doing this in a trading company, giving this relief against a trading company which is engaged in trading other than manufacturing. The whole object of giving the relief is to encourage the creation of employment and it would appear from the amendment that the Labour Party accept that this incentive should be given for the purpose of encouraging the creation of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings us to the question which I raised on Committee Stage: is not a job a job and if such an incentive will create employment in distribution or any of the services why should we not give the incentive?  If it is acceptable to give the incentive provided a job is created in manufacturing, why not give it in the case of distribution or any other service? It seems there can be only two logical explanations for the approach which is apparently involved in the Labour Party thinking on this matter.  One is that there is something inherently objectionable in trading other than manufacturing&mdash;in other words, in distribution or other services.  That seems so unlikely that I must reject it.  The only other explanation for this stance is that investment of this kind in manufacturing may produce jobs; investment of this kind in trading other than manufacturing will not produce jobs.  I am not aware of the evidence <Col N="1566" /> for this thinking; I have no evidence of it at all.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in dealing with this matter on Committee Stage that it is quite clear, taking a general view of our situation in regard to the need to create jobs, that a considerably greater stress will have to be put in coming years on services as distinct from manufacturing, not that we have to lighten or reduce our efforts in regard to manufacturing but rather that we have to increase and intensify our efforts substantially in regard to employment in the services.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into detail as to why that is so; I would imagine that would be acceptable on all sides of the House.  If it is acceptable, what is the basis for this distinction that appears to be at the root of this amendment?  While employment in manufacturing has the great advantage that it will create a spin-off in employment or at least one job in the service industries for each job in manufacturing, the converse does not necessarily hold true, though it does hold true to some extent because there is a greater consumer demand for manufactured products if there are more people in employment in the services, but the relationship could not be shown to be one for one.</P>
    <P>The real question is: is not a job a job?  If the job is created in the service industries, are we to say it is not sufficiently worth while to give this kind of relief?  I do not know if this is what the Labour Party are saying, but I cannot accept that proposition.  The whole purpose of this section as amended is to encourage the creation of jobs, whether such jobs are in manufacturing industry or in service industries. Our need to create jobs is so great that I cannot afford to make what may be fine doctrinal distinctions between jobs in manufacturing and jobs in service industries.  As far as I am concerned, a job is a job.  To the extent that the provisions of the section as passed by the House so far will encourage the creation of jobs in any sector, I think it is worth while and we should try to give that incentive and to ensure that it will operate effectively to encourage the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> It may be that I have missed the substantive point involved in this amendment.  I do not think I have because we discussed it on Committee Stage.  If I have, no doubt I will be told so.  If I have not, then it seems to boil down to whether a job in manufacturing is the kind of one you want and if so you do not give any incentives to the creation of further jobs in service industries.  I do not accept that proposition and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to address myself to the general question raised by the Minister as to whether or not we are against the creation and extension of this relief to industry and to industrialists. It would be quite ingenuous of a Minister or of anybody else to deduce the attitude of this party to taxation, taxation reliefs and taxation reliefs for investment in general from one amendment in the Finance Bill. Certainly we can say that in the mixed economy in which we operate we are by no means doctrinally opposed to incentives and especially not to incentives which have as their objective the creation of jobs.  We believe, on the other hand, that there are incentives and incentives and that incentives must be judged on the basis of their effectiveness and of their social consequences and these are the criteria which we attempt to apply to a fully formed and framed Finance Bill such as the one before us.</P>
      <P>During the discussion on Committee Stage the Minister gave as his estimate &mdash;he insisted it was an estimate&mdash;that the cost annually to the Exchequer of this particular concession would be something less than £200,000.  I am sorry there is nobody else on the Minister's side who might be able to give us this information, but it would be interesting to find out what anticipated volume of investment or reinvestment this £200,000 relates to.  Presumably it would be related to the marginal rate of tax for the person making the borrowing and the subsequent investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the cost to the State is £200,000 or less, it does not seem likely that the <Col N="1568" /> anticipated volume of investment or re-investment would be very substantial. One of the reasons why we have put down this amendment to confine the relief to manufacturing industry is that we believe in the fundamental importance of manufacturing industry; and if there is a comparatively limited amount of investment or re-investment to take place as a result of this concession, then there is a very strong argument for concentrating it in the area of manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>Part of that argument was referred to by the Minister when he referred to the spin-off effect on jobs on the service industries and other areas based on jobs on manufacturing industry.  He argued to soften the effect of this that of course there was a reverse effect as well and that service jobs tended to create manufacturing jobs, although not to the same extent.  We hold that we must insist on the positive value of job creation in other areas as a result of investment in manufacturing industry.  That is why we want to concentrate this £200,000, this negative investment by the State, in the area where we feel it will do most permanent, long-term good.</P>
    <P>The problems of investment in manufacturing industry are very substantial. We got a particularly dramatic example of them the other day when, in answer to a parliamentary question I put down to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, the House was informed that the capital cost of each of the 800 permanent new jobs at the Alcan Development in Limerick was £350,000.  That is the size of the problem we are talking about.  It tends to underwrite the overall view of this party that the problem of providing not just jobs but enough jobs and the right kind of jobs in manufacturing industry will never be wholly or adequately dealt with by the type of concessions we are talking about here.</P>
    <P>That basically is our case.  This amendment is only an attempt to point out to the Minister and the Government that their whole strategy of incentives and initiatives in relation to industrial employment needs review. <Col N="1569" /> We have already established that the amount of State aid to industry in terms of grants from the IDA, and Gaeltarra, excluding even for the purposes of argument, Fóir Teoranta, now amounts to about two-thirds of the amount the State collects in corporation profits tax each year.  There seems to be a diminishing return from the type of concession we are giving.  The situation is so serious that it warrants a very fundamental overall rethink. Our amendment is designed to alert the Government and the public to that need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand that you can have income tax relief on the interest up to £2,000 on a loan against your personal tax but that under the provisions of this section, as it stands unamended, that loan or the money advanced or any part of the loan or <Col N="1570" /> money advanced must be repaid within 12 months of the date on which it becomes due.  If that is the case in respect of personal loans and the tax relief on interest in such cases, I believe such a requirement should not apply.  Obviously, a borrower, for reasons not foreseen when the loan was arranged, could be unable to repay and if the relief were retrospectively withdrawn it would result in a claw-back of tax relief which had been given.  This would be unfair in that it would add to an already difficult situation. If the man were not able to repay the loan on time presumably he was already in trouble.  If he also had to repay all the tax relief he got it would be unfair and add greatly to his difficulties.  It would also create problems for his creditors assuming he was in financial trouble.  If the Minister for Finance claimed back tax relief against interest given in the past this clawback would take priority over all other civil debt and could mean that the person in question would not be able to repay any of the debt due to his ordinary civil creditors, because all his remaining limited assets would be necessary to meet the repayment of tax relief on interest paid which he had been granted by the Revenue Commissioners.  All this would happen just because he was unable to repay the debt on time.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that this amendment will effect a change in the position in respect of all cases of income tax relief for interest on personal loans and where interest is being claimed as an expense under the notional system of taxation of farmers. I may be wrong.</P>

There could be a clawback on interest over a number of years either in the case of normal tax relief or in relief of loans applying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>the loan or the money advanced or any part of the said loan or money advanced is not repaid within 12 months of the date on which it becomes repayable;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the conditions applying to relief of interest for taxation purposes in certain circumstances.  The area of doubt is whether or not the condition applies to a broad category of cases, including all personal loans, or whether it applies to a narrow category of cases in respect of loans <Col N="1572" /> obtained for the purpose of acquiring an interest in a company or companies. The arguments are relevant one way or the other.  They might have stronger force if they were relevant to the wider area of cases but they are still relevant even when applied in the narrower confine.  The Minister should reply to the arguments because they are valid. They would obviously be of more public interest if they applied to the wider range of cases.  Basically, it is unfair to the taxpayer and to his creditors to claw back interest paid over a long period.</P>

      <P>: Section 8 (5) (c) provides:</P>
      <P>a loan shall not be regarded as having been made, or money shall not be regarded as having been advanced, in the ordinary course of a business if&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions are then set out and one of the conditions is the one to which the Deputy has referred and therefore, we are talking here about a very limited number of cases in which the loan is not regarded as being made in the ordinary course of business.  The most ordinary kind of case is a loan from a bank made in the ordinary course of business.  This is purely an <Col N="1573" /> anti-avoidance provision.  It does not apply in the kind of case the Deputy has in mind.  It is simply designed to determine whether or not a loan has been made in the ordinary course of business.</P>
    <P>It would be possible for a person to arrange things to get unlimited relief, or at least the relief provided in this section, simply in order to avoid the payment of tax and so it is necessary to set out certain conditions in order to determine that the borrowing is a genuine transaction.  One of the conditions is that the loan, if it is being claimed as a genuine loan for the purposes of the section, is advanced in the ordinary course of business and, in order to determine that, these various tests in clause (c) are laid down, one of which is the one referred to by the Deputy:</P>
    <P>the loan or the money advanced or any part of the said loan or money advanced is not repaid within 12 months of the date on which it becomes repayable;</P>
    <P>That is only one of the tests and it applies to a very limited number of cases.  It seemed to me from what the Deputy was saying that even the ordinary £2,000 relief would not be available unless these conditions were complied with.  That is not so.  If we are talking about the same thing the ordinary £2,000 limit applies anyway to anybody even if it has nothing to do with the course of trade.</P>

      <P>: If difficulties arise the Minister can look at this next year but it still seems to me, on a strict interpretation of the section, that a loan could be given quite legitimately in the limited circumstances envisaged in section 8 for the purchase of shares in a company in the ordinary course of business, and with no tax avoidance motive whatever, but subsequently when the loan comes to be repaid it could be deemed, solely on the grounds that it was not being repaid on time, not to have been made in the ordinary course of business.</P>
      <P>After large amounts of interest had been paid, after tax reliefs had been claimed in respect of such interest it could then be determined belatedly and retrospectively that from the outset the loan was not a loan given in the ordinary course of business and therefore that all concessions that had been granted and obtained legitimately could, by virtue of something which happened subsequently be made null and void under subsection (5) of this section.  That is the problem I see now after further discussion; not the problem I thought existed at the outset and it is not as big a problem as I thought but I contend there is still a problem. Would the Minister indicate if I am wrong?  If not, perhaps he would deal with this next year.</P>

It can only arise in the event of this complicated business of loans and associated companies and so on.  We do not think in those circumstances that the kind of problem the Deputy is talking about can arise.  In fact, I am advised it will not.  I will have a closer look at it in the light of what the Deputy has said to see if there is any possibility of this and if so we will see if we can do something about it.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" />&ldquo;(6)  Section 496 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (as amended by the Finance Act, 1974) is hereby amended by the insertion after paragraph (b) of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>`(c)  for the year of assessment 1978-79 or any subsequent year on the excess of the interest over £3,000;'.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This amendment is to add a new subsection to section 8 and seeks to amend the Finance Act, 1974, which limited the amount of interest which could be claimed against tax to £2,000. The idea was to prevent people borrowing money in large amounts as had been happening for some time, and then claiming the interest they are paying on that money against their tax liability.</P>
    <P>People who had borrowed money as ordinary mortgages on their houses were also included but at that time the cost of houses was much less than it is now.  Except for people living in very large houses very few house owners paid more than £2,000 interest on their mortgages in a year.  The cost of houses has increased enormously.  I was looking at an advertisement in a newspaper for a relatively modest semi-detached house in Dublin costing £24,500.  In order not to bring into this net people who were never intended to be caught, the figure should be raised to £3,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The £2,000 limit was fixed in 1974 when the building societies' lending rate was 11¼ per cent.  The rate of 9½ per cent which was in operation up to 1 June this year has now gone up to 11½ per cent.  If all other factors had remained static there would be no ground for raising the £2,000 limit, in other words, we would be back to where we were, other than the one Deputy Barry has referred to, that is, the rise in the cost of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are other factors to be taken into account.  The abolition of rates has been an important factor.  It is true that the benefit to the individual taxpayer will depend upon the valuation of his house and the level of rates charged in the area where he resides. <Col N="1576" /> If we take County Dublin for the purpose of illustrating this, rates for the current year are £11.65 per £1 valuation and house owners with rateable valuations of £25, £30 and £45 will benefit respectively from the abolition of rates to the extent of £290, £350 and £525.  It may be said that the house owner with a rateable valuation of £45 is exceptional, but it is not as exceptional as it might be thought.  It is important to bring it into account in order to compare the gain from that with the gain from the proposal to raise the interest limit from £2,000 to £3,000 as put forward by Deputy Barry.</P>
    <P>It would be accepted that the house owner with a house of a rateable valuation of £45 is likely to be in the higher rate of tax bracket and is probably chargeable at 50 per cent or 60 per cent.  The saving of £525 in rates represents pre-tax income of £1,050 in the case of the 50 per cent bracket taxpayer.  An equivalent saving to him by virtue of an increase in the interest limit to £3,000 would arise only if he had a loan of more than £26,000 from a building society for the purchase of a house at a cost of some £35,000, assuming the loan represents 75 per cent of the purchase price.</P>
    <P>In the case of a house owner with a house of rateable valuation of £25, his benefit of £290 from the abolition of rates represents pre-tax income of £440, assuming a marginal rate of tax of 35 per cent.  An increase of £440 in the interest limit would provide an equivalent benefit, but interest of £2,440 would service a loan of £21,200 from a building society at 11½ per cent for the purchase of a house costing over £28,000.  I think this would be an unrealistic situation for such a house owner and it is clear that the greater benefit for the majority of house owners is derived from the abolition of rates.</P>
    <P>If we look at it in this way the case for increasing the limit to £3,000 this year is not as strong as it might appear at first sight.  The substantial improvement brought about in the case of most house owners, viewed as taxpayers, from the abolition of rates has effectively altered the limit of £2,000, if we <Col N="1577" /> are thinking in terms of house purchase. It is true that the limit concerned must and will be kept under review. It will certainly be reconsidered next year with reference to the circumstances then prevailing.  In the circumstances of this year, for the reasons I have mentioned and the effective increase in the limit which has taken place in the case of borrowers for house purchase purposes as a result of the abolition of rates, the case for increasing the limit this year does not stand up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: So far this amendment has been discussed in the context of borrowers for house purchase purposes. However, it would be wrong to assume that this is the only category to which the limit of £2,000 interest for loans applies.  It applies also in the case of a farmer who opts for the notional tax system.  We all realise the desirability of farmers investing in their holdings. They must become involved in substantial debt in order to do so.  The traditional problem of Irish agriculture was that, instead of investing in their holdings, farmers were investing in the banks and leaving large amounts of money on deposit.  If such farmers are to be encouraged, not only to withdraw that money from the bank but to become involved in substantial debt in order to improve their farms, to increase productivity, to increase stocks and so on, we must do everything possible to give them the incentives that are necessary.  We must be conscious of the fact that increased productivity in the sphere of products that are processed subsequently means increased employment for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate the Minister indicated that approximately 38 per cent of tax-paying farmers are on the notional system.  The position is that, if a farmer who is assessed on the notional system is borrowing both to improve his farm by way of drainage, for instance, and to increase stock while at the same time he is borrowing for the purpose of building a new house for himself, all the loans are lumped together and if the total interest exceeds £2,000 in a year he may not claim tax relief on the excess interest.  That is not a <Col N="1578" /> desireable situation.  As has been pointed out both by the Minister and by Deputy Barry, the £2,000 limit was set in 1974 and, regardless of the calculations the Minister has made regarding house prices and so on, the situation is that the cost of investment in farms, the cost of farm buildings and the cost of such works as land improvement projects and farm roads has increased by perhaps 100 per cent since 1974.  Therefore, regardless of how interest rates have fluctuated since then, the interest would be greater because the amount borrowed would have to be much greater if a farmer wished to do the same work now as he might have done in 1974. In these circumstances he may well be in the position of being in excess of the £2,000 interest limit.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, it is in our interest to encourage farmers to borrow money in order to expand their holdings.  Irish land is seriously understocked. I understand that the added value of agricultural land in Holland is about six times as high as is the case here and that grassland in Holland produces about twice as much as is the case here.  This difference cannot be attributed to a difference in climate.  The difference is due to the fact that historically our farmers have not been in a position to invest in their holdings for the purpose of expanding them.  To this extent they need every encouragement possible if they are to achieve comparable output with their competitors on the continent.  We can encourage them to expand in such ways as buying more stock and more fertiliser and by erecting buildings in which to winter cattle.  We can give them that encouragement by providing for substantial tax relief on the interest they must pay on loans.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out already, the farmer who opts for the notional system is the one who is most intensive because he is producing more income per £ rateable valuation than the farmer who opts for the accounts system.  It follows that the farmer in the notional system is also likely to be the one who has incurred heavy debt.</P>
    <Col N="1579" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Not at all.  The position is that the people who opt for the notional system are likely to be intensive dairy producers, for example, whose rate of production is very high and consequently whose income per £ of rateable valuation is very high, too. Therefore it suits such farmers to pay a fixed rate of tax related to their rateable valuation, whereas a farmer who is not intensive, who, for example, is in dry stock production, is likely to have a low income per £ of rateable valuation and perhaps would be below the amount provided for in the multiplier of 90.  The less-intensive producer, then, is likely to opt for real profits and accounts in having his income assessed for tax purposes because on that basis he is likely to pay less tax than if he opted for the other system.</P>
      <P>Although only 38 per cent of tax-paying farmers are in the notional system, these are likely to be the ones who pay the most interest and who, consequently, are the ones concerned most with this £2,000 limit.  Notwithstanding the Minister's argument, which related strictly to house prices, there is a strong case for increasing the interest limit in terms of tax relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree, from an agricultural point of view, with the arguments put forward by Deputy Bruton. At today's rates an interest of £2,000 would mean a debt of about £18,000. An input of £18,000 is a relatively small amount in terms of investment in agriculture today.  In 1974 an input of that size would have made some impact on farm modernisation, but today it is merely a drop in the ocean. The Minister realises that 38 per cent of farmers are using the notional system; but as one moves down the line in valuation from £75 to £60, one finds the greater proportion on the notional system: one is now dealing with the more intensive farmer, the smaller acreage farmer, and it is more relevant.  Most of those are dairy men. Deputy Bruton is correct when he says that we are dealing with the more intensive man who will use the notional system more than the larger farmer. <Col N="1580" /> The Minister should take into consideration the amount of money the £2,000 will serve in 1978.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 41, after &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;up to and including the year 1979-80 only&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister on Committee Stage said that he was not in a position to accept the amendment.  Disquiet was then expressed about how long the notional assessment system was to last.  The Minister referred to discussions between the Revenue Commissioners and farming organisations. He did not tell us his exact attitude to the duration of the notional assessment system.  We were left very dissatisfied about the lack of clarity on that point.  He said that our amendment was largely decided by the election result last year.  Our speakers said that it would be preferable from the point of view of the agricultural industry if a fair system was decided one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Committee Stage many speakers expressed their fears about the effect on farming and its prosperity of the uncertainty attending the notional system. Deputies were worried about the lack of a statement from the Minister about how long the system was to last. Reference was also made to the multiplier, the lack of a clear criterion on which farmers could decide their policy in relation to their individual holdings.  It was said that this was a matter of concern to farming organisations.  We are all agreed that because agriculture is a basic industry there should be certainty about the intentions of the <Col N="1581" /> Minister for Finance of the day in regard to that industry.  There is still a good deal of confusion about what the Minister has in mind in regard to the total taxation position of farmers.  He said on Committee Stage that he believed more revenue could be raised by the dual system presently operating.  He said that any Minister for Finance had an obligation to look into the type of revenue he could raise.  Even though there might be a lack of certainty with regard to his long-term objectives, the Minister said that revenue was being raised at present by a combination of the two systems.</P>
    <P>Our amendment seeks to elicit from the Minister his exact intentions in regard to the notional system.  His decisions in this area are far more important than the opinions of the Opposition, because he is the person in the driver's seat and his decisions have the force of law.  Whatever system is adopted, it should be fair and should not penalise productive farming. It should assist the industry on which so much of our prosperity depends.</P>
    <P>The Minister could, even at this late stage, do a good deal to get rid of a lot of confusion which exists in the industry at the moment by clarifying his long term intentions in regard to the notional system of assessment. In this amendment we are seeking to discover the Minister's attitude by confining it to two years, but we are really more interested in discovering the Minister's mind in relation to the whole notional system of taxation for farming.  While some people outside farming may say that it benefits the farming community to have this choice, there are many farmers who claim that there is a good deal of unfairness built into the notional system.  It is true that the notional system is utilised more by farmers in the most labour-intensive side of the industry, the dairying side. The Minister could offset a good deal of the criticism at present levelled at the notional system if he clarified the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am afraid Deputy O'Leary is confusing the issue somewhat <Col N="1582" /> when he refers, on the one hand, to the multiplier and, on the other to the discussions taking place between the Revenue Commissioners and farming organisations concerning the right of somebody who has opted for the notional system, and would be bound for three years, to opt out in certain limited circumstances.  These are incidental matters and really do not affect the issues before us in this amendment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to put an end to the notional system of farming taxation after the tax year 1979-80.  In so far as that proposition is concerned, I rejected it on Committee Stage and I must reject it again.  As I understand it, the previous Government proposed to get rid of the notional system.  Page 18 of the Fianna Fáil manifesto said:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will retain the notional system of farm taxation and allow rates on agricultural land as an instalment of a farmer's tax bill.</P>
      <P>That was and is the position of the Government, which was endorsed by the people.  In those circumstances I am sure Deputy O'Leary does not expect me to accept an amendment the purpose of which is to get rid of the notional system after we had campaigned for and undertook to retain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree with Deputy O'Leary in seeking to have the Minister clarify the position in relation to the long-term taxation of farmers.  He has not done this despite the invitation from Deputy O'Leary.  I would not go along with the proposal contained in the amendment for the suspension of the notional system for the taxation of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This form of taxation is of benefit and is an incentive to the most intensive forms of agricultural production because it is they who are likely to be earning significantly more than their notional income according to the notional method of calculation.  Therefore, they are not penalised on marginal additions to their productions and to their income beyond that level.  It is in the national interest that farmers should be encouraged to produce the maximum, not only from the point of view that it increases their income and <Col N="1583" /> the amount they spend in their own locality in purchases of goods for their farms, in building materials and so on but also&mdash;and even more important&mdash; because increased agricultural production means more employment in the processing of agricultural goods, in creameries, in meat factories and in all the downstream industries associated with agriculture.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would argue that our tax system for farmers should be designed in such a way as to provide an option such as exists at the moment and to encourage the maximisation of production from a given quantity of land.  Land is a strictly limited resource. As Mark Twain said, &ldquo;They have stopped making it&rdquo; and we must ensure that it is used to the maximum extent.  Therefore, a system of taxation must be devised specifically designed to meet the unique quality of land use here and the production from land. Because land is a unique commodity, one that is strictly limited in supply, in itself that justifies a special method of taxation in respect of land use and, consequently, a special method of taxation for agriculture.  It was in order to meet that special case that the notional system was devised by the previous Minister for Finance and I hope it will be continued.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary was quite correct in seeking from the Minister a clear statement of his long-term intentions for the next four to eight years in relation to the taxation of farmers.  All of us recognise that farmers must plan ahead. The whole thrust of the farm modernisation scheme as introduced by the previous Government, and which is presently in operation under this Government with EEC aid, is to get farmers to draw up plans for the following six years, to get them to work out these plans in detail, to assess their likely income and the inputs that will be necessary to achieve that income in the next five or six years.</P>
    <P>The whole emphasis is on farm planning and one of the most important ingredient in any plan must inevitably be one's likely tax liability.  At the moment farmers do not know what amount of taxation they will have to pay next year if they are on the <Col N="1584" /> notional system.  There is another category of farmers, those who are below the tax threshold, with a valuation of less than £60.  They do not know their long-term position in relation to taxation. They are in a similar position to the farmers on the notional system in that they cannot draw up their plans to take account of their liability to taxation because they do not know their likely liability.  It is the right approach for a Minister for Finance, economically and politically, to spell out his intentions in this matter clearly in advance for a period of four or five years.  I hope the Minister will give an indication of where he is going so far as farmer taxation is concerned in the next four or five years.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 16, after &ldquo;C&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or (V x 90)&mdash;W&mdash;D.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out when I supported amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy Barry, the farmers to whom these amendments apply are farmers on the notional system.  They are limited in the amount of interest they can claim as an expense for tax purposes to £2,000.  If that amount had been increased it would have given them an incentive to invest in machinery, buildings and so on.  However, the Minister failed to do that.  In the light of his failure to accept amendment No. 9 we must find some other means of encouraging farmers who are on the notional system to invest in their holdings, in the purchase of machinery and new buildings.  Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 seek to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments seek to allow farmers on the notional system in substitution for claiming contractors' fees as an expense, if they do not wish to do that because they have their own machinery and have invested heavily in their farms and are not using outside help, to make a claim for depreciation in relation to the capital expense. Many farmers may not use contractors to any significant extent. During the years they may have built up their farms and be in a position to do their own work.  They do not need contractors and the concession is not of great value to them.  However, they <Col N="1586" /> would be interested in a concession in relation to depreciation of the substantial capital investments they have made.</P>
    <P>The main point is that by granting this concession the Minister will encourage that 38 per cent of taxable farmers who are in the notional system.  As I have pointed out, they are likely to be more intensive farmers and in order to encourage them to invest in farm buildings, fences, roadways, holding yards, drains and land reclamation they should be allowed to set off the depreciation of such investments against their tax.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the impact of increased investment by farmers in the notional system on farm buildings, fences, roadways, holding yards, drains and land reclamation. These investments almost exclusively involve money spent within the State.  Farm buildings will involve local contractors.  locally produced building materials and will substantially increase employment in rural areas.  It has been traditionally recognised that the greatest need for employment creation is in these areas.  In order to attract industry into rural areas the IDA have undertaken their various regional plans and have given selective rates of support towards industry in essentially agricultural regions.  Yet, as Deputy Horgan pointed out, the cost of creating a new job in industry in those regions can be extremely high.</P>
    <P>I believe, as the Minister said, that a job is a job.  A job in a local building firm, primarily dealing with the erection of farm buildings, fences and local roadways is as good as one created by the IDA in a massive industrial plant which has probably been created at great cost to the Exchequer in terms of grants and at great cost to the balance of payments in terms of imports of machinery and capital equipment.</P>
    <P>A job created by means of this amendment in services to farmers will have no significant import costs because all of the materials involved will be domestically produced.  Furthermore, it will be located in rural areas where there is a very great need for <Col N="1587" /> employment and where the infrastructural costs of new employment are not significant.  For instance, to create a job in Dublin for somebody living in Mountmellick one must provide him with a house in Dublin.  On the other hand, if a job can be created in agriculture or in an associated industry, the infrastructural costs and the cost of capital investment will be less.  Therefore, there is a strong case for supporting this amendment as it would have a significant impact on unemployment in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I would further argue that one of the major obstacles to intensification of agriculture is lack of farm buildings. Our traditional pattern is one of farmers producing cattle off grass at the end of the autumn and having to sell them at less than their value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I can see the relevancy, but I am afraid the Deputy is going into great detail on simple amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The problem has been that farmers have not been able to winter their cattle because they did not have farm buildings in which to do it.  We need to encourage investment in farm buildings so that we can have, as the Green Paper pointed out, a balanced production of both milk and beef throughout the year in order to ensure a maximum return.  The major block in eliminating an unduly high seasonality in agricultural production, which not only reduces the farmer's income but also reduces the effectiveness of our processing industries, is the lack of buildings on our farms.</P>
      <P>If buildings were provided on our farms for housing cattle indoors during the winter we would be able to produce cattle at a steady level for slaughter throughout the year and we would be able to produce almost the same levels of milk from the land throughout the winter.  This would ensure a better utlisation of the very extensive and expensive facilities for the processing of milk products.  This factor has been identified in the Green Paper as a block towards agricultural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, which will allow <Col N="1588" /> farmers in the notional system to set off as a depreciation their investment in farm buildings, fences, roadways, drains, holding yards and land reclamation, will contribute directly towards the creation of employment by direct employment on buildings and by increasing absolute production and the seasonal distribution of production.  The capital allowances proposed in the amendment is not one of free depreciation. The farmer will not be able to opt for the notional system for three years or undertake huge investments and set them off against his tax in one year.  I would not wish to facilitate that kind of activity.  The main reason the Minister introduced the three-year rule was to avoid such activities on the part of farmers.  I have drafted the amendment in such a way as to avoid that situation.  The capital allowance may only be claimed at a rate of 20 per cent per year for five years.  The farmer cannot claim 20 per cent in one year but must claim at a steady rate over a period of five years.  Therefore, the type of activity which the Minister wishes to avoid would not be facilitated by my amendment.</P>
    <P>The last measure of relief contained in the amendment relates to investment in land reclamation by farmers in the notional system.  I believe there are a million-and-a-half acreas in need of reclamation.  They are insufficiently drained.  In some cases there is not sufficient access to them, or the fencing is such that they cannot be properly cultivated.  But, most likely, the problem is that they are insufficiently drained.  Our agricultural production could be increased dramatically if farmers undertook substantial programmes of land reclamation.  By allowing depreciation to farmers on the notional system who undertake to invest in land reclamation, this amendment would assist in having more land reclamation carried out.</P>
    <P>The Government have already recognised the need for such land reclamation in the western region.  It is hoped that they will provide an additional impetus with EEC money made available for this purpose. Sometimes I am doubtful about whether that will happen or whether <Col N="1589" /> the EEC money will be used to substitute for funds which would otherwise have to be provided by the Irish Exchequer, thus saving money for the Minister for Finance.  We will discuss that later.</P>
    <P>If that is the priority, and it should be the priority, we should also use the tax code to encourage land reclamation. My amendment would have that effect.  If the farmer goes for the option of claiming depreciation, he cannot also claim contractors' fees.  It is in substitution and not in addition. Therefore, the likelihood of its being used as a significant means of reducing overall taxation is not great.  It would adjust the way in which taxation could be paid and reliefs claimed, so as to put an emphasis on what is obviously socially and economically valuable, namely, greater investment in buildings and land reclamation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>: This amendment applies only to people opting for the notional system of taxation.  As reported at column 1050, Volume 307, of the Official Report of 14 June, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The matter of allowing the fees of agricultural contractors is primarily because I believe that the operations of agricultural contractors should be encouraged.  The idea of farmers spending a great deal of money and tying up a great deal of capital in machinery for which they have relatively little use in so far as they confine its use to their own land is obviously uneconomic....</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment is an alternative to the fees claimed for contractors.  That is the kernel of the amendment.  Large numbers of farmers cannot and will not use contractors to carry out work on their farms because that is uneconomic for them. A fair number of these people are in the tax net at the moment.  The Minister is depriving them of any tax benefit.  The amendment is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also specified that the tax relief in question should go towards farm buildings, fencing, roadways, draining and land reclamation.  Most of the materials used would be home produced.  As the Minister said on <Col N="1590" /> numerous occasions, a job is a job no matter where it comes from.  The number of jobs which could be created in doing this type of work has never been appreciated.  Fencing of our farms has been neglected over the past ten to 15 years due mainly to the introduction of large machinery. Farmers should give more attention to this.  The trees grow here and the wire is made here.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton said, farm buildings have been somewhat neglected over the past ten to 12 years.  If a farmer does not maintain an existing building and erect new buildings, he will find himself left behind very quickly.  Allowing people on the notional system to claim tax relief for hiring machinery could be described as discriminatory.  I wonder has the Minister something else in mind? Is he trying to get the men who hire out machinery into the tax net?  Is that his principal motive on this issue?</P>
    <P>I always believed there should be special tax concessions for land reclamation. Approximately 25 per cent of our land is lying idle.  Every acre of land brought back into production is of benefit not only to the farmers but to the nation as a whole.  When the Minister is thinking of taxing farmers in any direction, he should give special consideration to land reclamation.  I have seen figures indicating that land reclamation can cost up to £400 per acre.  That type of figure frightens farmers.  If we had a special tax concession for one year, tremendous benefit would accrue to the nation as a whole. I encourage the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The case made for this amendment would be very compelling indeed, particularly in relation to the creation of jobs, the use of home materials and the encouragement of land reclamation, if the incentives involved were not already contained in the income tax code.  But that incentive is there available to any farmer who wants to avail himself of it.  If he goes on the accounts' system he can claim all of his allowances and reliefs on the same basis as any person engaged in trade or business.  Therefore the incentives the Deputies have been talking <Col N="1591" /> about are there in the system.  The only thing is that they are not available to those who opt for the notional system.</P>
      <P>That is what the amendment is about, not about the value of this kind of allowance because those allowances are already available.  We are really being asked should this be extended to the notional system.  One will have noted a tendency, understandable, but one which a Minister for Finance who is committed to the retention of the notional system must avoid and reject, and that is that if you think about the basis for the notional system you will find there is a restriction on the income side on the basis on which the income is assessed and, of course, correspondingly there has to be a restriction on the basis on which expenses and allowances are assessed, and unless the restriction is carefully watched in relation to the expenses side one will end up with a system in which all of the expenses and deductions allowable under the accounts system will be allowable under the notional system, but on the income side there will still be a restriction on how to assess the income.</P>
      <P>Clearly this is not feasible, and of necessity and virtually by definition, the notional system must contain only a limited number of items for deduction of fairly general application both from the point of view of trying to ensure that there is a reasonable balance between the estimated income and the items of expenses that may be claimed, and of trying to ensure that the system is reasonably simple.</P>
      <P>We must not forget that the notional system apart from anything else is of considerable advantage to a farmer who has not been keeping accounts.  It is useful to him in the sense that it should be a fairly simple system, but to the extent that we introduce more and more forms of deductions and allowances we complicate the system and get it closer to the accounts system. It is necessary to keep this in perspective and unless we restrict substantially the kinds of deductions and allowances available under the notional system we will move towards the accounts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> I said earlier that as a Minister for Finance committed to the retention of the notional system, it is essential that I do not agree to the erosion of the basis of the notional system so that we would end up with the accounts system only.  I know that is not the intention of the Deputies in putting forward this amendment, that they simply want to ensure that some of the benefits of the accounts system will be extended to people opting for the notional system without extending to them the disadvantages of having income assessed on the basis of reality rather than the notional system, and in so far as they try it is fair enough, but it is a different matter to accept it.</P>
    <P>I want to point out not only to the Deputies proposing the amendment, but to others outside the House who might be tempted to make a case based on a similar premise, the danger if one pushes too far with the allowances available under the notional system.  What one will be doing is abolishing the notional system in practice. My party and I do not intend to abolish the notional system.  We believe that its advantages from the point of view of individual farmers, the economy as a whole and the Exchequer from the point of view of the collection of tax which can be estimated reasonably in advance cannot be vitiated by the kind of things that have happened in recent years in relation to farmers' tax.  There are many arguments in favour of the notional system.</P>
    <P>My party committed themselves to retain the notional system in the election manifesto.  That was endorsed by the electorate and in pursuance of that commitment I am making the necessary provisions in this Bill and I cannot accept that the real, genuine and necessary distinction between the two systems should be eroded, because the only consequence of that would be the abolition of the notional system.  Any farmer who believes that the kind of expenses referred to in this amendment should be claimable by him can, of course, opt for the accounts system and can claim in the same way as anybody in trade or business the various allowances and expenses appropriate; but I am afraid there is a <Col N="1593" /> tendency for people, an understandable human tendency, to want to have it both ways.  It is not a matter I can simply ignore.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the most recent available figures for unemployment in the building and construction industry, with the corresponding figure for mid-July 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The latest date for which the industrial analysis of the live register is available is 16 March 1978.  The total number of persons in the building, contracting and works of construction industry who were on the live register on 16 March 1978 was 24,040 while the corresponding figure on 15 July 1977 was 23,993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>: No, I would not.  The Deputy continues to refuse to look at life and to compare like with like.  The figures establish that on 16 March of this year there were 1,500 fewer registered unemployed in the building and construction industry than on 18 March of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister not accept that the reason why this question is repeatedly put down is that claims are being made not in regard to year-upon-year improvement but in regard to the creation of 3,500 jobs in the building industry?  So, far from improvement being the case, there were more people at work in that industry in the middle of July 1977, than in the middle of March 1978.  Even if I am wrong in putting it like that the <Col N="1594" /> Minister will still agree that there is a queer difference between the 1,500 year-on-year improvement and the 3,500 we have been hearing about.</P>

The Ceann Comhairle has ruled out of order the right of Deputies to elicit legitimate information from a Minister in anticipation of a forthcoming debate.  I respectfully suggest that that is the whole purpose of Question Time.  I have witnessed on numerous occasions the Ceann Comhairle ruling Deputies out of order by saying that they were engaging in a debate and that the purposes of Question Time was to elicit information. There is no logic in that ruling.</P>

Some narrower ruling than that must have been in mind because that would undermine the whole purpose of Question Time in this House.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if he considers that recent <Col N="1616" /> increases in dividends awarded to the shareholders of the Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland, of 59 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, are consistent with the spirit of the current national wage agreement, which granted workers a pay increase of 8 per cent; and whether they are in accordance with the Government's policy of encouraging moderation in income increases generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: The percentage figures quoted by the Deputy relate to total dividends paid to shareholders; on a gross earnings per share basis, the corresponding figures would be 16 per cent and 23 per cent.  In relating them to the development of pay it needs to be remembered that, in addition to the 8 per cent pay increase quoted by the Deputy, the national wage agreement allows for a further 2 per cent after 12 months, and it also provides for locally negotiated increases to a maximum of 2 per cent, and for productivity bargaining.  Overall it is expected that after allowance is made for these increases, and account is taken of wage-drift and the carry-over of 1977 pay increases into 1978, average non-agricultural earnings will show an increase of between 14 to 16 per cent in 1978 over 1977.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in comparing dividend payments and earnings, it is perhaps more appropriate to look at the pattern over a few years.  The average annual increase in industrial earnings over the past five years was of the order of 21 per cent; during the comparable period the average dividend increases, on a gross earnings per share basis, were 17 per cent for Allied Irish Banks and 24 per cent for the Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It would not appear from the development of the two sets of figures that the Government's policy of encouraging moderation in income increases generally is inappropriate or inequitable.</P>

The talks will be held under the aegis of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and other Ministers may attend depending upon the interest group involved and the topic under discussion.</P>

      <P>: Deputy FitzGerald would appear to be satisfied if these questions were to appear on tomorrow's Order Paper.  That would not satisfy this party.  We are more concerned with the basic fundamental rights of Deputies to submit legitimate questions and for them not to be ruled out of order against all established precedent and against any ruling in Standing Order.  Unless that issue is cleared up I hope the Chair realises that he is doing very serious damage to democracy itself and to the whole <Col N="1623" /> process of the democratic procedure. By your ruling you are undermining the whole democratic process.  As you are undermining the whole democratic process, I suggest respectfully that you review your decision and make known the outcome not to any one Deputy but to the House.</P>

      <P>: In dealing with amendment No. 11 I was pointing out the problems in relation to the notional system when one is urged to allow very many other items of expenditure than are specified in this Bill and that in effect what one is doing, if too many items are allowed, is abolishing the notional system.  This side of the House undertook, unlike our predecessors who were phasing it out, to retain the notional system and for that reason and other reasons I find it impossible to accept this amendment.  I think the Ceann Comhairle said amendment No. 11 but I think it should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: As Deputy Bruton has explained, the purpose of this amendment is to allow people who have opted for the notional system of valuation to be given permission to make certain deductions from their tax assessments.  If they are allowed this it will be a very definite encouragement to people on the notional system to make further investments in agriculture, which is our primary industry.  When one looks at the people engaged in agriculture and when one considers the history of agriculture one realises that the people engaged in it do not bring the same attitude of mind to bear towards investment in their industry as people in industry in general do. They hardly think of their farms as small industries.  They regard them as a way of life and they regard farming as something which it is natural for them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must see to it that farmers are given an adequate return on the actual value of their holdings.  They should be given sufficient incentives to make <Col N="1638" /> investments in their farms.  I understood the Minister to say that he has committed his party for all time to the notional system.  I can see a lot of value in the notional system.  I might disagree slightly with my colleagues, Deputies Bruton and D'Arcy, in regard to this.  I hope we will get every farmer in the country at some stage in the future to approach his business as the businessman has to approach his business, as an investment which must give adequate return to the owner of the assets which, of course, means accounting at some date in the future.</P>
    <P>It should be the objective of every Minister for Finance and also of the House that we would get farmers to look at their investments in the same way as businessmen have to look at their factories or establishments as investments which must give a return. In the meantime there is the necessity to encourage farmers to invest as much as possible.  As Deputy Bruton said, farmers do not as a rule invest their money.  They have it lying in banks at very low rates of interest.  If we can, through the tax system, encourage a far greater investment in agriculture, all farmers will benefit but the country as a whole will also benefit.  I recommend that the House should accept amendments Nos. 11 and 12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I wish to support the case made by Deputy Bruton and Deputy Barry.  The Bill proposes to continue the notional system of taxation for farmers but lays it down that farmers who opt for the notional system shall only be entitled to claim certain things as expenses.  This includes wages and contractors' fees.  There is no provision made for claiming depreciation of buildings.  The amendment we are now discussing proposes to confer on the taxpayer the right to claim for depreciation on buildings.  There is a lot of merit in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very desirable that farmers should be encouraged to keep their buildings in good shape, to see that they do not become decayed.  They should have the option at least  either electing for wages paid to contractors or depreciation, where they <Col N="1639" /> have not contractors' fees.  A farmer could be self-sufficient so far as machinery is concerned and he would not have to call on contractors at all to do his work.</P>
    <P>Such a farmer is prejudiced by the proposal in the Bill.  If he has his own machinery and does not have to engage contractors he will not be allowed any deduction.  If he is that type of farmer it is likely that he will want to keep his buildings, fences, roadways and so on in good shape. It is only reasonable that he should be allowed to deduct such expenses from his income tax.  The argument that this option should be given to the farmer is unanswerable.</P>
    <P>We have heard much chat recently in the House about the Green Paper. Far be it from me to open up a discussion on the Green Paper at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am hopeful that the Deputy would not want to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Chair can relax as I only want to make a passing reference to it.  The Green Paper has a proposal to encourage householders to keep their private dwellings in good order and repair.  It holds out in the words of one of our better-known political writers the carrot that such expenses will be allowed as a deduction against his income tax.  The basis for that proposal is that it will give employment and help to solve the unemployment problem.  If that case can be made in regard to painting a front door or tidying a front garden, how much more forcefully can it be made in regard to farm buildings, some of which may have been in use for a long time and are subject to more wear and tear than private dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and his colleagues, including the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, are serious in saying to the House through the Green Paper that jobs done on domestic buildings are a way of solving unemployment, they should accept this amendment and say to the <Col N="1640" /> farming community, whose buildings are more extensive than domestic buildings &ldquo;Yes, we will give you the option of claiming as an expense depreciation on your buildings, fences, roadways, gates and farm buildings generally&rdquo; and encourage the farmer to employ local tradesmen, whom the Green Paper admits are available, to do this work.  We would then be killing two birds with the one stone by improving the national stock of farm buildings, which are a necessity and a valuable asset to the farming community, and by doing much to solve the unemployment problem which is of real concern to the Government, the Opposition and the people.  It is hard to argue against that proposal.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said that the amendment is unreasonable or that it seeks to give the farmer-taxpayer a right to claim too much against his notional income.  It only seeks an alternative.  It seeks to confer on the farmer the right to claim contractors' fees or depreciation. It is a well thought-out amendment, put forward in a reasonable manner and deserves reasonable consideration by the Minister.  If he gives the amendment reasonable consideration I am satisfied that he will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit to accept this amendment.  His reasoning in opposing it was not very sound.  He said his party were committed to the idea of retaining the notional system. When the suggestion for improving the notional system was put forward he said&mdash;and this seems to have become an ever-recurring refrain in the Minister's replies to discussions of this type&mdash;&ldquo;Well, if you do not like the notional you can always go on accounts&rdquo;.  He went so far as to say that the arguments for this proposal would be very compelling indeed.  The Minister implied that he accepted the amendment and the arguments made for it as being very compelling.  What prevented the Minister from accepting what he admitted to be a very compelling case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: At the same time, the Minister was trying to say that he wanted the notional system to be retained and that he believed in it.  The only substantial argument he could put forward against an improvement in the notional system was &ldquo;Well, you can get that by going on accounts&rdquo;. That does not imply genuine commitment on the Minister's part to the retention of the notional system.  It makes me feel that, although he is speaking in favour of the notional system, his intention is to get rid of it by the back door.  He is going to use this back door method by rejecting what he insists are very compelling arguments for improving it and by introducing a novel and unusual provision to the effect that, if you go on to the notional system, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister may quadruple or treble the multiplier next year, you may not leave it for three years.  He is refusing to improve the notional system and making farmers who wish to opt for it buy a pig in a poke, accept on faith from the Minister that he will not increase the multiplier by an unreasonable amount. It seems that these two approaches of the Minister's are a strategy to discourage farmers from adopting the notional system of taxation, a system which in the course of this discussion he referred to as something he wished to see retained as a permanent feature of our taxation system.  On another occasion he referred to it as a concession, as if he had it in mind that it would be withdrawn at some future date when it might no longer be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers could be forgiven for being somewhat confused as to the true intention of the Minister in regard to the retention of the notional system. The notional system should be retained as a permanent feature of our taxation system.  It should be improved in ways such as those envisaged in this amendment to make it more attractive <Col N="1642" /> to the intensive farmer and to encourage the maximum increase in agricultural output.  That is precisely what this amendment does.</P>
    <P>I wish to elaborate on a point made by Deputy D'Arcy.  He pointed out that there was an element of discrimination in the Minister's acceptance of contractors' fees as a deductible expense under the notional system and his refusal to accept this amendment. If a farmer got a contractor to erect a farm building or, perhaps more relevantly, to do land reclamation work, and the contractor used his own machinery, in the charge made to the farmer which he would be able to set against his tax as an expense there would be an element of depreciation of that machinery.  In other words, if a farmer gets a contractor to do the work, indirectly he is enabled to claim depreciation on the machinery used by the contractor.  If he uses his own machinery to do the same work&mdash;and, indeed, it is desirable that farmers should have their own machinery in many cases&mdash;he will not be able to claim depreciation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: If he is on the notional system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: If he is on the notional system.  To my mind, that is an inequitable distinction.  This amendment would contribute very significantly to the creation and maintenance of employment in rural areas.  The more farmers engage in the erection of farm buildings, fences, roadways, holding yards, drainage and land reclamation, the more employment will be given in rural areas.  The people who will be doing this work will be local farmers or people living in rural areas and employed by a contractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The materials used in carrying out these works will all be produced at home.  We are prepared and the Government are prepared to spend very large amounts of money on creating new industrial jobs, on public works programmes through the local authorities, and on environmental improvements which, perhaps, contribute no lasting productive enhancement to our economy.  They are merely improve <Col N="1643" /> ments in the appearance, the character or the cleanliness of our country or the general well-being of our people. They do not contribute directly to our economic potential.</P>
    <P>Improvements undertaken on farms not only create employment on an equivalent scale, in precisely the areas where the Government recognise they are necessary by introducing environmental grants schemes for local authorities, but also enhance our productive potential and create the prospect that further employment will be generated in future as a result of increased farm output which will result from better buildings and better drainage.  In turn, this increased output will lead to increased employment.  It will have to be processed here and employment will be given in the creameries, the meat factories, and so on.</P>
    <P>Investment in farm buildings and land reclamation will extend the productive season of Irish agriculture. Animals can be finished all the year round, with the result that there will be less seasonality in the work of meat plants, because they will be able to get cattle in the winter as well as in the summer if buildings are provided for winter housing.  Our meat factories will be more fully used and greater employment will be created in them.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation will enable us to have a longer grazing season.  In many of the wet areas&mdash;and I am thinking in particular of the Shannon basin around Athlone&mdash;cattle cannot be put out to grass until the middle of May and they have to be taken off some time early in September.  With such a short grazing season, cattle can only be brought to the fat stage on those farms for two or three months of the year.  If they are slaughtered locally, factories relying on cattle from those areas for their input can work to capacity for only two or three months of the year.</P>
    <P>If those farms are drained, the grazing season can be greatly extended and so also can the period during which cattle can be finished on the land.  Therefore, the full working capacity period of our meat plants <Col N="1644" /> and our creameries can be extended because the period of maximum milk production will be extended.  This will contribute significantly to the economic viability of our creameries.</P>
    <P>I saw figures quoted recently which showed that in Irish creameries there is a 14:1 ratio between peak production in the middle of the summer of milk going into our creameries and the nadir of production in the winter. The result is that the creamery plants are under-utilised during the winter months.  The ratio in France is 2:1 and French creameries are much more intensively used and expensive capital put into creameries is much more intensively used than is the case in Irish creameries.  The reason for this wide discrepancy between those ratios is that, over the years, the French invested extensively in land reclamation to extend their grazing season and in the erection of winter housing for their stock so that they can be at full production the whole year round, or for a significant part of the year, and so that the milk going into the creameries will be maintained at a steady level throughout the year, or at a much steadier level than has been possible for us.  This contributes directly to the viability and the potential employment of the processing industries in France.</P>
    <P>I am arguing that this amendment which extends the possibility of depreciation being given to farmers for land reclamation and farm buildings if they are on the notional system will contribute not just to the viability of a firm but also to employment, directly and indirectly, in rural areas amongst agricultural contractors and those engaged in agricultural processing. The Minister would lose nothing by accepting this amendment because it is a substitute for contractors' fees.  If a farmer opts to accept the provisions of this amendment and claims depreciation on investments such as those listed he will not as a result be able to claim contractors' fees.  We are not proposing to add to the total list of deductions which a farmer may be able to make.  We are merely inserting an alternative which we believe will contribute <Col N="1645" /> directly to employment. Furthermore, we are not envisaging in our amendment that the farmer should be able to claim the entire depreciation involved all in one year, because this might involve a potential means of avoiding his proper burden of taxation.  The amendment is so framed that the allowances in question may be claimed only at a rate of 20 per cent in each year and over a period of five years.  Therefore, this area of tax avoidance is not created.</P>
    <P>The arguments which I have put forward are valid.  I had hoped that the Minister would be able to accept this amendment.  It now seems that he will not be able to do so, but I assure him that we will be keeping a very close watch on this matter and it will be our intention in this party to do everything we can, either by improvement in the tax system or by other means, to encourage greater land reclamation.  The Minister will be hearing the point we have made in this debate in next year's Finance Bill if he does not see fit on this occasion to make the changes we are seeking. It is by increasing the productive potential of Irish land that perhaps the greatest single contribution can be made towards the creation and maintenance of employment.  We on all sides of the House are interested in the creation and maintenance of employment, but unfortunately it seems that the contribution of agriculture&mdash;and this is certainly a feature of the Green Paper which I will not dwell upon&mdash;is being under-estimated in so far as the employment situation is concerned.  The philosophy which has led the Minister to reject this amendment is the same philosophy that has led the Government in their Green Paper to downgrade the potential contributions of agriculture to the solution of our employment problems.  They have said that there is no prospect for increasing farm employment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;and shall include contributions towards a pension fund for the employees concerned&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to allow contributions toward a pension fund of <Col N="1647" /> employees concerned to be deducted from the tax liability.  This applies to virtually all other spheres of life where we encourage people to provide pensions for their employees on the basis that the standard of living outside the old age contributory pension schemes of those people when they come to retiring age would be very much increased.  This is something we should not confine to sections outside agriculture but should include in agriculture also.  As in previous amendments I make the point that historically agriculture has not seen itself in the same light as business sees itself.  I would encourage individual farmers to see themselves as business people or industrialists engaged in the business of agriculture. The same allowance should be made to them in that regard as are made to business people.  The same encouragement should be given to them to provide for their employees at retirement, through a pension fund, an adequate pension outside the old age contributory pension which they will earn through their contributions to the stamp.  I move this amendment in the belief that it will bring the farming community into the same category as industrialists.</P>

      <P>: The farmers nowadays are beginning to see themselves as businessmen, particularly farmers who have employees.  I do not see why the Minister cannot see his way to giving them the same concessions as he gives to business people on this issue.  The concession will cost the Minister nothing for some time because to my knowledge no farmer has his employees covered under a pension fund.  The Minister might encourage a start and an interest might be taken in this by the farmer organisations. The Minister could be doing a very good turn for employees in agriculture by allowing this concession.  When it is allowed across the board for all business people, no matter what line they are in, the same should apply to agriculture.  I support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Such an expense is allowable to farmers who are treated <Col N="1648" /> on the same basis as other people; in other words those on the accounts system.  This amendment strives to make available the same concessions or allowances to those on the notional system.  Of course it cannot be argued that those on the notional system are on the same basis as people in other trades, occupations or businesses.  In so far as farmers are on the same basis they get the same treatment, but here we are dealing with another attempt to extend deductions or allowances available on the notional system.  The cost of this concession would not be very great but if this were agreed it would follow logically that a farmer on the notional system would be allowed the same treatment in respect of social welfare contributions paid by him in respect of his employees.  The cost of this would be in the region of £¾ million which is a relatively significant sum in the context of the yield from the tax on farming profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went into the whole basis of the notional system at some length on previous amendments so I will not dwell unduly long on it.  The notional system was intended to be a simplified system of assessment with the minimum number of deductions.  Since there is a restriction on the manner in which the income is calculated under the notional system there must of necessity be a restriction on the manner of calculation of expenses. For those farmers who wish to obtain deductions for a wide range of expenses the accounts basis is available on which they will get deductions for all trading expenses.  If a farmer opts for the notional system he must do so on the understanding that a limited number of deductions will be allowed and that he cannot expect anything like the same treatment as regards deductions under the notional system as is available under the accounts system.  Any undue extension of the deductions allowed under the notional system tends to erode the notional system which is something I do not want to see happening.  Also, if further classes of deductions are claimed under the notional system the multiplier would have to be increased to account <Col N="1649" /> for whatever factor was involved and in this case to meet the cost of the deductions for social welfare contributions which would logically follow from this amendment the multiplier would have to be raised from 90 to 93.  I doubt if that is what Deputies proposing this amendment would like to see happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Maybe it did not strike the Deputy that the case existed.  In any event, the two general principles involved are that deductions under the notional system must be kept to a minimum for the reasons outlined and that in so far as they are allowed they affect the level of the multiplier.  I am not sure that on balance farmers on the notional system given the choice would opt for the increased multiplier rather than holding to the position as it is. Even if the situation about the increase in the multiplier did not arise, and it does, in principle we have to be extremely careful about additions to the deductions allowable under the notional system.  I do not wish to waste time as the time available on Report Stage is limited, by going back over the arguments so I am asking Deputies opposite to take it that these arguments have been made again in relation to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister said that if he were to accept this as a further improvement on the notional system it would lead to an increase in the multiplier. However, the Minister admitted that in the case of the small concession we are seeking the increase in the multiplier would be insignificant, that it would not even be an increase of from 90 to 91 but that it would probably be increased by no more than 90 to 90.1.  That is not a significant argument against this amendment.  The Minister also said that if, under the notional system we were to allow contributions towards a private pension fund paid by the employer for his employee so as to supplement the contributory old age pension under the social insurance Acts in order to be consistent we would have to give the same tax relief in respect of social insurance contributions and that if we did that the increase in the multiplier would be from 90 to 93.  I do not accept the logical sequence put forward by the Minister in his argument.  It is not necessary if one accepts this amendment in order to be consistent, to allow social insurance contributions as an expense, because, in effect, granting a tax relief is a form of negative Exchequer contribution or Exchequer encouragement to a certain activity.  There <Col N="1651" /> is already Exchequer encouragement to farmers on the notional system in respect of the normal social insurance contributions, because the State already pays a share of the stamp anyway and undertakes the administration of costs of the social insurance scheme through the Department of Social Welfare.  On the other hand, there is no such State contribution, by tax relief or otherwise, in the case of contributions to a private pension fund by a farmer under the notional system and one could quite legitimately distinguish between contributions to a private pension fund and contributions to the social insurance fund, because that State contribution is already being made to the latter and no State contribution is being made to the former.  Therefore it is appropriate, in the case of a farmer on the notional system, that the State contribution should be made to the former in the form of tax relief.  I believe this case should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other arguments in favour of this amendment&mdash;increasing numbers of farmers are employing workers who, by virtue of their skill and ability, are enabled to claim and command a relatively high wage during their working life.  Having commanded that wage during their working life, having been employed by a farmer who is on the notional system, they come to retire and all they can get will be the ordinary contributory old age pension, when they will suffer quite a significant drop in their standard of living.  Commitments they had entered into will not be maintained in their retirement as they had been during their working life.  Because of this development in agriculture of more employment of skilled labour, this will become an increasing factor in agriculture, one which applies to the same extent in agriculture as applied in the past in industry and which has, in that context, justified the creation of private pension funds with tax relief.  It is all right for the Minister to say: well, if the farmer wants to create a pension fund for his employee and wants to deduct it for income tax purposes he can always switch to the accounts system.  This is becoming a refrain in all of the Minister's <Col N="1652" /> contributions to this debate.  But, as far as the employee is concerned, he has no control over whether or not his employer goes or does not go on the accounts system.  If his employer, for other reasons which may be perfectly good, has decided to go on the notional system, I do not believe that the employee will be in a very strong position to go along to him and say: Look, you are paying me so much.  I want you to create a pension fund for me so that I will have a reasonable pension when I retire; in the normal way if I were approaching you and you were on the accounts system, or if I was working for somebody else, I could put it to him as an argument: if you do create a pension fund for me you can deduct that as an expense against tax but I know in your case, because you are on the notional system for reasons best known to yourself, unfortunately I cannot use this argument, and there is no possibility that you can set off your contribution towards the creation of my pension fund against your tax, but I am asking you to do it all the same.  I do not think that an employee&mdash;and it is the employee's welfare that this amendment is designed primarily to meet&mdash;would be able to persuade farmers on the notional system very easily with that line of argument.  It would not be one that would be accepted readily.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the cost would be minimal.  He has admitted implicitly that it is desirable that farmers, whether they be on the notional system or otherwise, should create pension rights for their employees where appropriate by contribution to private funds.  He has admitted all of those things and I believe, therefore, he should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: This amendment was discussed at an earlier stage.  Nevertheless I regard it as a normal incentive to farm workers.  I believe further that novel incentives in agricultural employment are absolutely essential in Ireland today.  On previous occasions I recollect having questions down to different Ministers for Agriculture, and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, in regard to the numbers of people employed in agriculture <Col N="1653" /> when very sad figures were produced each time.  On average we have seen a drop in the number of people employed in agriculture of approximately 10,000 per annum.  I believe this would include farm workers and sons and daughters of farmers leaving agriculture, but numbers of that magnitude leaving agricultural employment each year constitute a serious haemorrhage.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree also that it appears to be an accepted fact of life that it will be extremely difficult to stop this haemorrhage.  The White Paper reluctantly faces the fact that there will be no growth in the numbers employed in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will not stop the haemorrhage nor will it increase the numbers employed in agriculture.  The Minister will be realistic enough to agree with that.  Nevertheless the Minister has admitted frankly that such a scheme will cost a minimal amount in the early stages to administer.  Nevertheless he is not accepting it.  Our whole approach to agriculture would have us believe that we are not affording it the status, as an industry, it deserves.  We have failed to grasp the nettle that this is a major industry and, for that reason, every possible incentive should and must be given it.  Everybody in the House will agree that there are similar incentives for workers in industry, which is all the more reason for giving <Col N="1654" /> incentives of this nature to agriculture. An opportunity is afforded us here of doing so.  Whatever extra employment it may give as an offshoot to people in regard to pension funds, whatever line of pension fund they may be in, whether it be through any form of institution or otherwise, it will be of benefit but, most important of all, it will give people in agriculture this extra incentive.  The contributions a farm worker pays are quite sizeable.  The employer, of course, pays the major portion of the stamp.  When the employee retires, provided he has had sufficient stamps over the years, he gets a contributory old age pension. Agricultural employees do very skilled work and it is not right that they should not receive the same advantages when they retire as people do in other walks of life.  There is a sort of attitude that employment in industry is somehow superior to agricultural employment. This is not a major amendment though it is a novel amendment and a novel incentive.  I believe it would be wholeheartedly welcomed by everyone in the agricultural community. It should be accepted by the Minister and incorporated in this Bill.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 19, to delete lines 32 to 50.</P>
      <P>This is a repetition of an amendment which was withdrawn by us, without being discussed, on Committee Stage because we wished to have another look at it.  It relates to the following provision 21A in section 14 which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, for the year 1978-79 or any subsequent year of assessment, an individual is chargeable to tax in respect of profits or gains from farming, the following provisions shall apply&mdash;<Col N="1657" /></P>
    <P>(a)  the amount of tax chargeable for that year of assessment: shall be reduced by the rates payable for the local financial year preceding that year of assessment;</P>
    <P>(b)  in computing the said profits or gains for that year of assessment, no sum shall be deducted in respect of rates.</P>
    <P>There are further clarifications and qualifications in the remainder of the section.  These are covered by lines 32 to 50.  This concession puts farmers of more than £60 rateable valuation in a peculiarly advantageous position in relation to their tax liabilities in comparison with businessmen who are not farmers.  Business is fundamentally a farmer's activity.  Acceptance of our amendment would not create a situation in which farmers would not be entitled to claim any relief for rates. It would simply restore a situation in which they would be entitled to claim relief for rates paid as a deduction from farming profits or gains before the assessment of their net taxable income.</P>
    <P>We see no reason for the very specialist treatment which is being allocated to farmers who, by definition, are the larger land-holding groups of farmers and those who are most likely to be assessable for tax. Since the Committee Stage debate during which I spoke on this section and was reported in the Press, I have had letters from several rural areas and from provincial towns in which surprise was expressed at the degree of the concession being given in this section.  The Minister may say that this concession was indicated in the manifesto, that it was understood by the farming community, but it is not yet so widely known among other sections of the community although it is becoming better known.  Businessmen have a difficult enough job in claiming their exemptions but they would have a valid reason for querying this concession. In this Bill we are being asked to allow this concession although there is no hint from the Minister regarding the Government's future intentions for the concession.  Is it merely a transitional provision designed to allow farmers a particular <Col N="1658" /> credit at a certain stage of the development of the country's agricultural industry or is it a concession which will be available in perpetuity to all farmers in the tax net?  These are questions which ought to be answered.  In the normal course of events it would be a perfectly equitable and adequate way of dealing with the situation to allow farmers to get money paid for rates against their gross profits before compilation for tax liability thus putting them in the same position as other businessmen.</P>

The Chair has described correctly the procedure that has been followed down through the years but it may be correct to say that the grouping of amendments for discussion is by agreement in the House.  Since, in this case Deputy Horgan is seeking to abolish the credit for rates, whereas Deputy Bruton is seeking to have it extended, it seems that Deputy Bruton has a problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The point I wish to make on this provision is that it should be borne in mind that the farmer whose valuation is more than £60 has suffered a dramatic increase in rates as a result of the misnamed Agricultural Rates (Relief) Act which in many cases has had the effect of doubling rates so that what appears to be a concession is far from that.  The be a concession we are discussing here should be considered only against the background of the Agricultural Rates (Relief) Act, which has greatly increased the burden of rates paid by those farmers.  If those increased rates were to be paid and were not allowed to be set off against income tax, as this Bill provides, a far greater injustice than is already being done by the arbitrarily increased rates, would be perpetrated. This must be borne in mind by the House in considering amendment No. 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not think Deputy Bruton really helps the case by referring to the Agricultural Rates (Relief) Act, whether he thinks it is relief or not.  It represents a very substantial contribution by the taxpayer to the reduction in the rates bill of farmers. If the amount of that contribution is reduced it still remains at approximately £30 million, perhaps more, so it is certainly a relief.</P>
      <P>In regard to the general proposition involved in Deputy Horgan's amendment, the granting of rates as a credit against a farmer's liability for tax as distinct from allowing it as a deductible expense, was promised in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  It is part of Government policy and its implementation was announced in the budget.  It is provided for in this Bill and, being Government policy, put before the election and implemented in pursuance of the undertaking given then.  I should not have to spell out why it would be impossible for me to accept a change in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason behind that undertaking was dealt with on occasions at some <Col N="1661" /> length prior to the last general election. I do not want to go into it in undue detail now except to say this about it. Deputy Horgan seeks to treat rates for the purposes of income tax in the same way as between farmers, on the one hand, and other businessmen, on the other.  That may seem a reasonable and plausible approach, but if one reflects on this for a moment one will see that land for a farmer is in a very special category.  It is the basis on which he produces his goods.  It is not like the rates on an office for an ordinary business or a factory premises for manufacturers where it is part of their normal overheads.</P>
    <P>The production of the goods does not arise primarily out of the premises in the case of factory premises.  In their case the rates they pay are allowed as a deductible expense.  Land in the case of a farmer is in a different category. It is in recognition of this difference that this provision is made.  The <i>rationale</i> behind this is that a farmer who is liable for income tax should not be obliged to pay both rates and income tax.  If he is not liable for income tax, this does not arise.  He is liable for the rates.  If he is above the threshold of liability for income tax then the question arises: should he be liable for both rates and income tax?  Having regard to the special nature of land in relation to the produce of a farmer as distinct from the produce of any other trader or business, the decision was made to allow rates as a credit against the farmer's tax liability.  As I said, this is Government policy put forward before the election and being implemented in this Bill.  I could not contemplate making any change in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to reply very briefly to the Minister's assertion that the <i>rationale</i> for this is based on the fact that land is something special. While one could accept for the purposes of argument that agricultural land is different from industrial buildings, the special qualities he claims for it are not peculiar to agriculture. The special quality of agricultural land is that it is basically there; it is in earth.  It does not produce without human intervention.  One could argue on that analysis that it is more <Col N="1662" /> analogous to industrial machinery than industrial premises.  Machinery does not produce unless there is human intervention. If we accept that analogy the fact is that the industrialist is allowed to claim machinery allowances against gross profits or gains before arriving at a net taxable income figure.  If we were for the purposes of argument to accept the Minister's assertion that agricultural land is not the same for the purposes of productivity as industrial and commercial buildings we could make a very strong case that it resembles industrial and commercial machinery, for which the same kind of allowance is made.  I am sorry the Minister does not accept the argument.  I am also sorry that he has not given us any indication that this concession is designed by him and his Government to be a permanent part of our tax code.  I suspect it is, so this may not be the last we will hear about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy will move amendment No. 17. Amendment No. 18 can be formally <Col N="1663" /> moved afterwards.  The two will be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 39, after &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or for any previous financial year from 1977-78 onwards in which rates had been paid which had not been set-off against an income tax payment to the extent that they had not been so set-off.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We all know that farming is a fluctuating industry and that in some years profits are made and in other years there are losses.  The variable returns from farming distinguish it from other businesses.  The Agricultural Rates (Relief) Act gave fewer reliefs than in the past and withdrew many others. Farmers with valuations in excess of £60, who are now in the income-tax net, had their rates dramatically increased by the removal of allowances which could have been set against their rates.  In many cases the rates of farmers with valuations in excess of £60 have been doubled as a result of the Agricultural Rates (Relief) Act.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> for this significant increase in a year when rates on domestic dwellings were being abolished was that the Finance Bill would allow farmers to set their rates off against their income tax.  The farmers who were losing the previous concessions were also in the income-tax net and the compensating factor for the loss of these allowances was the granting of a set-off against income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The set-off against the income tax payment takes place in the following way.  In 1978 a farmer pays his rates in two moieties, the first becomes payable in April and the second in July.  He may set these rates off against an income tax payment which he will be making on 1 January 1980.  He will pay the money in the middle of 1978 and the Exchequer will have the use of that money for 18 months.  If his income tax payment on 1 January 1980 exceeds his payment of rates, he may subtract the amount of his rates from his income tax payment.  There are two <Col N="1664" /> defects in regard to this procedure. The first defect is that the money, although it is not liable to be paid because of the tax concession, is paid and the State has the use of it for 18 months.  The second and more important defect is that the farmer in question may well have no income during the tax year 1979-80.  If that happened he would not have to make an income tax payment on 1 January 1980 and therefore would have no opportunity of claiming his rates against his income tax.  In effect, this would be a form of regressive taxation because the farmer who made a loss would pay his full rates whereas the farmer who made a large profit would have sufficient income to enable him to deduct his rates.</P>
    <P>Our proposal will not cost the Exchequer any money but will eliminate the injustice between farmers.  If on 1 January 1978 it transpires that the farmer has not made sufficient profit, that his income tax exceeds his rates payment made 18 months previously, he should be able to postpone the use of the rates relief to the following year. The Exchequer will still have the money and the farmer will have to wait for a further period to get his money in the form of a reduction in income tax.  This means that the Exchequer will have the use of his money for a further year or two, or three, until he makes sufficient profit.</P>
    <P>This amendment will remove an injustice which means that relief is given to a farmer who has sufficient income to pay tax and no relief is given to a farmer who has no income.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 concerns the availability of the concession in relation to rates to farmers who have a sideline, another business.  At present the only farmer who may qualify for this provision whereby he may offset his rates against his income tax payment 18 months later is the farmer who is either a full-time farmer or has permanent employment as well as being a farmer.  A farmer who has a farm plus a trade or profession may not claim rates relief against his income tax.</P>
    <P>I will accept&mdash;and I am sure the House will accept&mdash;that in so far as <Col N="1665" /> this provision in relation to a trade or profession is designed to prevent, for instance, a large builder, who also has a farm and whose building operation is perhaps four, five or six times as large in terms of profit as his farm, from availing of this concession, he should not get that concession.  In that type of situation the person with a trade or profession should be excluded as he is in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 is designed to achieve the granting of relief to a person with a trade or profession which is clearly subsidiary to the main farming operation.  We are defining it as being subsidiary to the farming operation by requiring that the concession be granted only where the income from the trade or profession is less than half of the income from the farm.  If the income from the trade or profession is two-thirds of or the same as the income from the farm he will not get the concession. He will have to pay his full rates, much increased rates as I have pointed out as a result of the provisions in the Agricultural Rates (Relief) Act, and he will not get them back against his income.</P>
    <P>If the business is clearly a small subsidiary operation he may claim this concession.  I will give examples of the type of subsidiary operations this amendment is intended to deal with.  In certain rural areas a farmer, or his wife more likely, may have a small shop. The amount of profit made from the shop may be quite small.  It is a sideline for her and it is also a useful social service in the area.  Alternatively, a farmer may have bought machinery which he does not use on his own farm during the entire year.  He may undertake to do work for his neighbours.  In other words, as well as being a farmer, he becomes a small-time agricultural contractor.  His income from the shop or the agricultural contracting operation is less than half his income from the farm.  In that case, where it is clearly a subsidiary operation and, incidentally, in most cases a social and economic benefit in the area in question, he should be able to get that relief.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment.  I hope the Minister will see his way to <Col N="1666" /> accepting it.  Not when the Agricultural Rates (Relief) Act was being discussed but only now do farmers really realise the extent of the increase in their rates because only in the past few weeks the rates demands actually issued to farmers.  Now farmers can see the extent of the increase in the rates they will have to pay.  They will now appreciate with greater force than hitherto the case for amendment No. 17 which would allow them, if they do not make sufficient profit next year to have an income tax payment against which to set their present rates payment, to retain the rates payment as a claim against income tax in subsequent years without any extra cost to the Exchequer. This would ensure that the intention of the Government in introducing this concession is fully realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I just want to ask a question or two to which the Minister can reply when he is replying to the amendment moved by Deputy Bruton. The first question is related to the fact that, as I understand it, the general rates relief we are talking about here is applicable both to farmers who opt for the notional and accounts systems. If I am correct in saying that, apart from the manifesto which is one of the few things in history which can reconcile otherwise irrenconilable elements, how can the Minister reconcile that, which is an extension of a concession in the notional sector, with his continuously reiterated belief that any such extensions run the risk of phasing out the notional system completely?</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would ask him to comment on the sections dealing with agriculture in the Green Paper and on two phrases in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the Green Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes.  On page 29 we read that rates on agricultural land act to some extent as a form of resource tax.  Just before that we read that the principle of a resource tax is attractive. If both those statements are true, how can they be reconciled with the attitude of the Government in the matter we are discussing here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Perhaps I should say at the outset that I find myself unable to <Col N="1667" /> accept either of these amendments. Before going into the detailed reasons for this, there are one or two preliminary matters arising out of what was said by Deputy Bruton and the questions put by Deputy Horgan which I might dispose of.  Deputy Bruton mentioned, in passing I agree, the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings. It is no harm to make clear for the record that that benefits farmers too.  Rates on their farmhouses and outbuildings have been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>: There never were rates on cutbuildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: There were two categories.  One was liable and one was not.  None is now liable.  Deputy Bruton talked about the situation of a farmer who, for one reason or another, found he had either no income or a very reduced income and under the present arrangement he would still have to pay rates.  That is true, but it was always so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The rates would not have been as large as they now are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are talking about the principle involved.  He would have had to pay rates.  The only change being made was in the position of farmers who have become liable for income tax.  The change there is a benefit which I dealt with on the last amendment whereby full credit is allowed against income tax in respect of the rates due.  The idea that because of this change effectively the farmer should not have to pay rates at all&mdash; effectively that is what Deputy Bruton is proposing; that is what it amounts to, as I will develop later&mdash;is not a proposition we have accepted.  It would imply the treatment of rates as tax.  In so far as there can be any principle of that kind involved, we have not accepted that or suggested that we would accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is what the farmers thought the Minister was trying to give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1668" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not think so, and I will deal with that in a moment.  With regard to what Deputy Horgan said, this and one or two other extensions are involved in the notional system which formed part of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and are provided for in this Bill.  It is precisely in the knowledge that there was this extension that I could not contemplate the kind of extensions that were being advocated in other amendments which we are not discussing now.  With these extensions the further extension would have the effect of eroding the notional system. I do not propose to discuss the Green Paper at this stage.  If I were to do so, I might draw down the wrath of the Chair and I do not wish to do that. As the Deputy knows, we will have shortly a much more suitable and full opportunity to discuss the Green Paper in this House.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 proposes a carry-forward of the excess of rates over whatever tax is payable.  In so far as it proposes this carry-forward it would equate rates with income tax, and that is not a principle that we have accepted.  If such a principle were accepted there would be certain consequences. First of all, traders and professional persons would be entitled to claim credit for rates against their income tax liability.  Secondly, where the rates figure exceeded the income tax liability a refund of the excess would have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is no question of a refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the Deputy thinks about it he will see that this is precisely what would happen.  If you accept the principle that rates are a form of tax to be equated with income tax&mdash;and that is what is involved in treating them as being capable of a carry-forward&mdash;it follows, as it would in any similar case arising under income tax, that where there is an excess a refund would be claimable.  Perhaps I should remind the House of what we said in our election manifesto in this regard.  I quote from page 18:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will retain the notional system of Farm Taxation and allow rates on agricultural land as an <Col N="1669" /> instalment of a farmer's tax bill. Taxes due under the notional system will be payable at the end of each year.  Farmers will be free to opt for assessment by farm accounts.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is clear that the farmers referred to here are the full-time far-mers. I will develop that further because it relates to amendment No. 18. On amendment No. 17, the allowance of rates as a credit against income tax per year means that farmers will not to that extent suffer the full amount of the double burden of rates and income tax.  When the rates exceed a farmer's tax his maximum burden is the amount of the rates and when the income tax exceeds his rates&mdash;and this can arise only when he has made substantial profits&mdash;then the amount a farmer will have to pay will be only the excess of income tax over rates.  If the proposal in amendment No. 17 for a carry-forward of uncredited rates were to be accepted it would be tantamount to abolishing liability for rates in the case of any farmer liable for income tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy should think about the position.  What would happen is that where a farmer is liable for sufficient income tax he will not be liable for any rates.  Where his income tax bill is less than his rates and he is carrying forward that amount, in some year he will set that off against his income tax liability, so that he would never pay the rates.</P>

Effectively the result of this amendment would be that a farmer would either set off his rates completely against his income tax liability where the income tax was the bigger, or where the income tax liability was the smaller he would carry forward a credit against income tax liability for the amount of rates uncredited, and to the extent that at any time in the future, having carried it forward, this would set it off against his income tax liability, he would not be paying any rates.</P>

      <P>: Deputies are playing with words.  If what they are trying to say is that the farmer pays his rates, gets a credit and does not have to pay that amount in income tax and therefore he is paying the rates, that is not a good enough point.  Deputies cannot deny that a farmer is liable for such an amount of income tax that he can set off all his rates.  In the event of paying his rates and paying then the balance of income tax over his rates, effectively he has paid no rates.  Would Deputies accept that?</P>

      <P>: We are on the semantics now and not on the realities.  The realities are that in those circumstances his total liability between rates and income tax is the amount of his income tax bill.  That is the situation if his income tax bill is bigger than his rates.  On the other hand, if his income tax bill is less than his rates then his total liability is the amount of the rates.  That is not a disadvantageous position for anybody, be he ratepayer or taxpayer, but this amendment seeks to go further and to say that whatever happens the total liability between rates and income tax will never exceed the amount of his tax liability.  In other words, he will never be liable for the amount of the rates because he will either set it off or he will carry it forward.</P>

      <P>: The semantics are there and Deputies know it.  They are trying to ensure that farmers who have an uncredited amount of rates&mdash;uncredited <Col N="1671" /> in the sense of not having them set off against their income tax liability&mdash;can carry it forward from year to year until eventually they have set it off.  In those circumstances they are not paying any rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: What they understood was happening was what is in this Bill, that they could set off the amount of their rates against their income tax liability so that in any year their liability would be either, if the income tax liability was big enough, the difference between that liability and the rates liability, or if the income tax liability were smaller than the rates, then the total amount of their liability would be the amount of the rates. That is what they understood and that is what is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 18, having regard to the terms of the Government undertaking in their mani-festo it is quite obvious that the farmers referred to in that manifesto were full-time farmers since they were the only ones entitled to opt for assessment on the notional basis which we said we would retain for their benefit. Likewise, the credit for rates is a provision intended for full-time farmers to the exclusion of trader farmers&mdash; those who or whose spouses carry on another trade or profession.  Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1974, applies to these trader farmers.  Deputies will recall that that section was intended as an anti-evasion measure which was introduced in an effort to prevent business or professional people who had farms from escaping tax liability on their business profits or professional income by attributing to their farming activities large slices of the income derived from their trade or profession. The profits from farming would have been exempt from income tax because the rateable valuation of the farm was below the relevant threshold of liability or alternatively would be covered by the notional system of assessment so that the business profits attributed to farming would escape tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> What happened was that in 1974 a £50 threshold of liability was fixed in respect of trader farmers instead of the £100 threshold which applied generally, and last year the threshold was removed altogether because of what was happening.  Furthermore, these trader farmers were excluded from the scope of the section giving an option for assessment on the notional basis, and the principle adopted in the case of trader farmers was and is that all their trading activities should be treated as trading activities and assessed in accordance with the ordinary provisions governing such activities.</P>
    <P>That same principle applied to the professional person who is also farming. This principle has been consistently applied, and trader farmers have been excluded from all of the special provisions relating to full-time farmers whether these were in easement or otherwise of full-time farmers, for example assessment on the notional basis, the general threshold of liability, payment for tax on farming profits on 1 January in the year of assessment, and the crediting of rates against income tax.  The problem is that any departure from this principle opens the door to the manipulation of profits so as to reduce tax liability.  The rates of full-time farmers would be credited against income tax on their farming profits but if no income tax is payable, for instance if profits were low or if a farmer has very high expenses or personal reliefs, the credit for the rates may be of no benefit to him or may be only partially absorbed if his tax bill is below the rates charged.  This matter is being dealt with in the previous amendment.</P>
    <P>If, however, a trader farmer in similar circumstances were entitled to a credit for rates it would be open to him to attribute business profits to his farming activities so as to derive the maximum benefit from the credit. Effectively, such a farmer would be getting a credit for rates against the tax on his business profits.  If this were to be agreed, full-time farmers would argue that this reinforced a claim for a refund where their rates exceeded their tax liabilities which, as I mentioned <Col N="1673" /> earlier, would be a logical follow-on to equating rates with income tax.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the inescapable conclusion, from all these considerations, is that contrary to what is urged in amendment No. 18, the trader farmer must continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions relating to traders generally and must be excluded from the special provisions governing full-time farmers.  This means that in this matter the rates payments of trader farmers, whether on their farmland or on their business premises, will be allowed as a deduction in computing their profits and not as a credit against the tax payable on those profits, whether farming or business profits. I do not see how any other treatment is possible if one is to avoid fairly substantial manipulation of the system to avoid liability for income tax by the categories concerned.  For all these reasons I am afraid that I cannot accept amendments Nos. 17 and 18.</P>

      <P>: On this final stage, with the limited time available for discussing this matter, having listened closely to the Minister I feel it may be idle for me to go into it further but I would urge the Minister and the Government to consider a few points. The people being dealt with are full-time farmers.  A full-time farmer with, for instance, a valuation of £59 is in no way affected by income tax and is getting the full benefit of rates remissions, the full benefits under the Health Acts and the full benefits under the higher education grants.  A full-time farmer with a valuation of perhaps £61 is liable for income tax.  After next year he will have to pay full rates and will not get any rates remission; if he is in poor health he gets no health allowance whatever and even if he has a most brilliant family he will get nothing from the State for the higher education of his family.  Surely, even at this eleventh hour, the Minister will consider these points.  If he does not a farmer with a £61 valuation will be faced with a substantial income tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It would be very much reduced for a person with a £61 valuation.</P>

    <Col N="1674" />
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: He will still be liable to income tax.  Even with the rates remission level at £60 valuation next year, which is a separate point, he will be liable for his rates.  In these instances surely a case can be made and accepted for allowing these deductions from rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his statement to the House on 9 May last said that 21A provides for the granting of the preceding year's rates as a credit against the tax bills of full-time farmers.  There the Minister was making the point that, if a farmer is liable to tax, he can deduct his rates therefrom.  That is accepted.  The Minister continued and said that if he is not liable to tax, then he has to pay his full rates.  I take it what the Minister was saying then was that, if he was not liable for tax, we would ensure that he did not pay his rates at all.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that that is what is contained in the amendment.  Indeed, the amendment could be qualified somewhat more.  It is not permissible for me to put in a further amendment at this stage.  But, if it were limited to carrying forward the rates allowances against income tax for a precise period, it might suit everybody's purpose better.  Rates are struck and have to be paid.  They can be carried forward for 12 months or a maximum of perhaps two years.  If within the two-year period a farmer is liable to income tax in excess of his rates, he should have to pay the income tax.  His rates would have been paid anyway, but if he is liable for less income tax he is still liable for his full rates.  I do not know whether I have made myself any clearer.</P>

      <P>: With due respect, I think it has been tossed out the window long ago by the Minister.  The amendment, recommending that rates be deducted from income tax and be carried forward, is a reasonable one.</P>
      <P>In my view the provisions of amendment No. 18 are an accepted fact of life in rural Ireland.  Deputy Bruton put it exceptionally well and I shall not dwell on it at any great length. There is the example to be found in many villages and towns of the farmer who also runs a small grocery shop. It is a family involvement.  I believe that such a farmer should and must be entitled to a remission, as is specified in this amendment, if his income from the trade or profession is less than half that derived from farming.  This does not apply merely to grocery shops but to many small businesses run in that manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider this commonplace situation obtaining in rural Ireland.  The Minister said earlier that farmers were reaping the benefit of the allowances in regard to rates remission on their dwellings; that is the dwelling-house attached to their farm. The case put forward here by Deputy Bruton and Deputy Barry was in regard to a farmer who engaged also in a trade or profession.  Let us take the example of the grocery shop, a pub or that of an auctioneer who carries on a small business in his house.  None of those three people is getting rates remission on his dwelling.  Therefore they must pay full rates.</P>

      <P>: The situation is that in a public house there are a number of rooms licensed and it would take some working out to subdivide them. In my opinion, the major part of the premises would be regarded as liable for rates.  I am sure that would be the opinion of the Valuation Office if one were to question them.  Therefore these people are liable to almost full rates on their premises because a business is carried on there.  They are liable also to full rates on their land and are not being allowed to carry that forward. These people should be entitled to the remission about which we have spoken. If less than half their income is derived from this business it should be accepted and granted.</P>
      <P>If the Minister does not accept this amendment it will mean that a considerable amount of revenue will be extracted from these people.  It is a fair and reasonable amendment, which the Minister should consider.  One point of interest is that it is the preceding year's rates that are specified.  I would still be interested to know why it was not the current year's rates.  We are speaking here about a sizeable figure and that is why I ask the Minister to give it full consideration.  As I have already pointed out to the Minister, many people in this category were not liable for anything up to now and will henceforth be heavily penalised.  It appears to me to be a great worry for the farming community that they will be left with a large responsibility for carrying local authorities. These two amendments are important because of the magnitude of the rates bill this year and the likelihood that rates will be very sizeable in the years to come.  It worries me and I am sure it worries many in the farming community.</P>

He is prepared to give relief to people with substantial incomes but people who in a particular year, for reasons of <Col N="1677" /> seasonality and nonavailability of agricultural content, will have no income but will have paid their rates, and have no income tax to set against the rates, will lose that relief for good.  That is regressive because the burden falls more heavily on those without incomes than it does on those with incomes. The Minister should have accepted this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 27, line 59, to delete &ldquo;paragraph (c)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;paragraphs (b) and (c) (i)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We were concerned on Committee Stage that the amended sales test brought under this paragraph would permit a company to claim that the amount receivable in 1977 was not less than 119 per cent of the amount receivable in 1976 but the Minister did not agree with our point.  He considered the kind of criteria suggested by us were not exactly helpful and he presumed to see further assistance to job creation in the section unamended. While we are not in dis-agreement with that approach, we believe there should be more statutory safeguards to ensure that other criteria are also taken into account and that is why we have the requirement that the employment content should be moved from 3 per cent to 5 per cent before those benefiting under the section qualify for the exemptions therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept that the primary objective of the section is to further incite those with capital to increase employment but we believe the target should <Col N="1678" /> be higher than that set out.  The Minister argued that by moving it up over 3 per cent it might prove less attractive to the <i>entrepreneur</i> and discourage him with a resultant loss of employment.  That is a valid enough viewpoint, but we are concerned to ensure that as much employment as possible is generated and that is why we put the target higher than the one suggested by the Minister.  There is a strong case to be made for linking the kind of gains that will arise from this section to a higher job creation figure.  The Minister on Committee Stage did not appear to see much benefit in these amendments but, because of our anxiety about creating employment, we suggest the amendments should be looked at again constructively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would like to add my tuppence worth to that of Deputy O'Leary in support of the various amendments, Nos. 24 to 42.  Amendment No. 24 seeks to delete the sales test for subsequent years as a gateway to corporation tax relief because, on the basis of the level of the thresholds as the Bill stands, and even on the basis of certain moderately favourable assumptions about inflation, inflation might eat up most of the thresholds and allow a company to claim exemption from the higher rate of tax without having done anything really to justify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not opposed in principle to the idea of incentives but we insist on the need for a sophisticated incentive scheme which will genuinely produce the kind of results we are looking for in return for the kind of incentives we are prepared to give.  The incentives in the Bill could result in savings to companies&mdash;for example, under the employment provision, of the order of ten or 20 times the extra expenditure by the company in the employment field, depending on the relationship between the company's turnover and gross profits, on the one hand, and the employment potential and actual employment position on the other.  This situation could easily be created.  A company with extremely high profits per employee which would normally be liable to the higher rate of income <Col N="1679" /> tax could by hiring employees, whose work may not even be, strictly speaking, necessary to the success of the enterprise, have an immense saving in corporation profits tax.  There is no proviso in the section to which these amendments refer that any of these very substantial savings should be further ploughed back into the creation of jobs.  There is nothing to stop them being handed out to shareholders by way of increased dividends or to directors by way of increased remuneration.</P>
    <P>Given the practice of companies over the last two years in terms of their disposition of profits, we have to conclude that there is a far greater likelihood that savings made by companies who meet these very low thresholds and so become eligible for the lower rates of corporation profit tax, are far more likely to be distributed in dividends and directors' fees than they are in reinvestment.  The statistical evidence published by the Irish trade union movement in relation to the distribution of company profits among the top 50 private and public companies over the last two years, provides very compelling and depressing evidence about the failure of companies to reinvest in employment or even in some cases in re-equipment.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make is in relation to the cost of this provision. According to a parliamentary reply given to me by the Minister a week or so ago, the total cost is about £10 million.  That is a very substantial estimated investment in industry by the taxpayer who is foregoing an equivalent amount of relief elsewhere. We are entitled to insist before enterprises have access to relief of this order &mdash;and it amounts to some 12 per cent of the total figure of aid to industry via the IDA and Gaeltarra Éireann&mdash; that real teeth in relation to productivity and employment should be put into this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is what this amendment attempts to do.  Raising the thresholds in the way we have sought is comparatively modest and any company really interested in providing extra employment would have little or no <Col N="1680" /> difficulty in meeting the higher thresholds. But the problem is that many people in companies regard job creation, with the best will in the world, as a necessary evil and they will produce jobs if they can produce profits.  We have also maintained that even though incentives of this rather crude and lax kind help to produce jobs, they are incapable by themselves of producing enough jobs and that is why we are and will remain critical of a Government's strategy which is based largely on incentives of this kind directed solely to the private sector.</P>

      <P>: Perhaps I should say at the outset that my attitude on this matter has not changed since we discussed it on Committee Stage.  It is as well to recall the history of the incentive that is involved here.  In my view, it is one of the not very many good things done by the Coalition Government. It required improvement and we are trying to improve it in this Bill.  Basically it represented a very belated recognition by the previous Government of what they should have been doing in trying to encourage the creation of jobs rather than wasting so much of their time and energy seeing how much they could collect in the form of wealth tax and otherwise. The time to worry about that is when <Col N="1681" /> we have created the wealth and the jobs.  The previous Government were right to try to introduce an incentive of this kind to create jobs.</P>
      <P>As introduced it had two elements. First, a sales test, a test on the increase in sales, and second, a test on the increase of employment of 3 per cent in a year.  We are proposing in this Bill to delete the sales test altogether and to leave the employment test at 3 per cent.  The deletion of the sales test is for two reasons primarily. First, the real thing we have to concentrate on is the creation of jobs.  There is not much to be gained by obscuring that issue by introducing the sales test as well.  The second reason was advanced by Deputy P. Barry on Committee Stage when he rightly pointed out that it is extremely unlikely that a firm will be increasing their work force if they are not increasing their sales.</P>
      <P>If one concentrates on the real purpose of this incentive, one will concentrate on the employment test.  It is too early yet for anybody to be able to say whether the incentive, as introduced by the previous Government or as being amended now, is going to be effective.  We do not know, but we have to try to arrive at an incentive which, on the one hand, will be sufficiently attractive to make people strive to meet the conditions under which this reduced corporation tax will be payable and, on the other, will be sufficiently realistic as to be attainable. On that basis the target of a 3 per cent increase in employment in a year seems to me, in the absence of clear evidence either way, to be a reasonable target.  I do not think any case has been made by the Labour Party for the increasing of that target from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, as I said, in the absence of information on how the scheme has worked so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder about the attitude to this matter displayed by the Labour Party, particularly as put forward by Deputy Horgan whose main concern seemed to be that as a result of this incentive shareholders might get increased dividends or directors might get increased fees.  Suppose they do because they have increased the employment content, <Col N="1682" /> is that any harm?  Is it not the object of the exercise to create jobs, not to be trying to ensure that directors and shareholders do not get any more money?  The priority is wrong.  This pre-occupation of trying to ensure that some people do not earn more than others, ignores the reality of the situation, which is to create jobs.  This is what it is all about.</P>
    <P>When it has been shown that this has operated successfully so that the Labour Deputies can come here with information to indicate the increase in the benefits accruing to shareholders and directors they will have a case to make, but in such circumstances they will have to meet the problem for them that it had worked and had created jobs because there will not be any profit to shareholders or directors unless there is an increase each year of at least 3 per cent in job creation. I should be very happy to find that the Labour Party were complaining that according to them directors and shareholders had benefited unduly because that would mean that the jobs had been created and we could then review the situation with a view to determining whether the target should be 3, 5 or 10 per cent, but in present circumstances the concentration ought to be on anything we can do to encourage job creation.  It ought to be borne in mind also that the cost to companies and employers generally of creating jobs and employing additional people is more than the wages paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan said that the major criticism he and his colleagues had of the Government's strategy in this connection was an undue reliance on the private sector and that the Labour Party were convinced that this would not create jobs.  If they are so convinced why try to hobble one of the incentives for the private sector with the risk that it will produce even fewer jobs than those Deputy Horgan thinks will not be sufficient?</P>
    <P>There is not a worth-while case for these amendments if one is really concerned with the creation of jobs.  There have been indications in recent times by way of reaction to certain proposals that there may be a number of people who are not genuinely concerned with <Col N="1683" /> the creation of jobs or with tackling unemployment or who, if they are so concerned, have other priorities that are much higher, whether they involve a concern to leave the situation as it is or whether it be a higher priority being accorded to what they would conceive to be equity in taxation.  Whatever the reason, so far as my colleagues in the Government and I are concerned, our first priority both economically and socially is the creation of jobs.  It would not be appropriate for me on this amendment to develop that theme but it is necessary to stress it in the context of the amendment.  The basic points are as put forward by Deputies O'Leary and Horgan and I have set out our attitude to these.</P>
    <P>A series of Deputies tabled the amendments and they proposed also the confining of the provision to manufacturing. I am not sure that I am altogether accurate on that but it is hardly relevant.  We have dealt with that argument before and I have no wish to detain the House unnecessarily. The points made in putting forward the amendments related only to the sales test and the employment test and for the reasons I have outlined we would be very foolish to reinstate the sales test in any form.  We would be foolish also to increase the employment target in the absence of any concrete information as to how the incentive would work.  To the extent that any complaint arises in future about an undue benefit being conferred by this reduction of corporation tax in certain circumstances, we may all rejoice and say that the incentive has worked and has created jobs in the way we had hoped for.  The situation could be looked at again then in the light of the amount of profit created, the number of jobs created and the prospects for the creation of further jobs in the future.</P>

      <P>Provided that where the expenditure is incurred for the purposes of the trade of hotel-keeping it shall not be regarded as qualifying expenditure unless it is incurred on the construction of premises which are registered in a register kept by Bord Fáilte Éireann under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1975.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to meet a point raised by Deputies on Committee Stage the object of which was to secure that the benefit of free depreciation would not be given in respect of premises used as a hotel unless they were registered with Bord Fáilte as a hotel.  I expressed sympathy with the principle behind the amendment but the House will recall that I was concerned not to take away relief from the limited number of persons availing of the relief.  I undertook to consider the matter before Report Stage.  I think this amendment achieves what was required.  It precludes claims for free depreciation in respect of premises used for the trade of hotel-keeping unless the premises are registered as a hotel under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1975, but it does not interfere with claims for initial or annual allowances under the existing law.  Unless the House wishes otherwise.  I shall not go into further detail.</P>

      <P>In page 36, between lines 47 and 48, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;29.&mdash;(1)  In this section `levy' means a levy or charge of any kind (not being a duty of customs or a duty of excise) which is imposed by an act adopted by an institution of the European Communities on the importation into the State or exportation from the State of any goods and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is for the purposes of the common agricultural policy of the European Communities, or</P>
      <P>(b)  is provided for under the specific arrangements applicable, pursuant to Article 235 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957, in relation to certain goods obtained by processing agricultural products, or</P>
      <P>(c)  is designated by regulations made by the Minister for Finance as a levy for the purposes of this section.</P>
      <P>and `import levy' and `export levy' shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Customs Acts and any instruments made thereunder shall apply to a levy as if it were a duty of customs and the provisions of the said Acts and instruments which relate to the exportation of goods <Col N="1686" /> shall also apply to the goods referred to in subsection (5) of this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister for Finance may by regulations apply to goods that are subject to an export levy, with such modifications as are, in his opinion, necessary, any of the provisions of the Customs Acts and instruments made thereunder that apply to imported goods.</P>
    <P>(4)  A levy shall be under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(5)  The exportation from the State of goods that are subject to an export levy shall be prohibited unless, before the exportation and subject to such conditions as the Revenue Commissioners may impose, the amount of the levy is paid to the Revenue Commissioners or security that is, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, adequate for its payment is given to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(6)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Customs Acts, where an export levy is payable on any goods, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to such conditions as they may see fit to impose (including conditions in relation to the giving of security for payment of the said levy), permit payment of the said levy to be deferred for such period as the Revenue Commissioners may determine.</P>
    <P>(7)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Customs Acts, where a duty of customs or an import levy is payable on goods imported into the State and entered for home use, including goods cleared from warehouse, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to such conditions as they may see fit to impose (including conditions in relation to the giving of security for payment of the said duty or levy), permit payment of the said duty or levy, as the case may be, to be deferred for such period as the Revenue Commissioners may determine.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> (8)  Subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Revenue Commissioners may impose, section 12 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, insofar as it relates to the warehousing, custody and delivery out of warehouse of goods,, shall apply to the warehousing of such goods (being goods to which, apart from the section, that section does not apply) as the Revenue Commissioners may allow to be warehoused for exportation or for use as stores.</P>
    <P>(9)  Regulations 4 and 7 of the European Communities (Customs) Regulations, 1972 (S.I. No. 334 of 1972), are hereby revoked.</P>
    <P>(10)  Regulations under this section shall be laid before Dáil Éireann as soon as may be after they are made and, if a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by Dáil Éireann within the next twenty-one days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the regulations are laid before it, the regulations shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>(11)  This section shall come into operation on such day as the Minister for Finance may appoint by order.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 48:</P>
    <P>In subsection (2), before &ldquo;The Customs Acts&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;For the purposes of this section&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments, which do not affect the substance of the section, are designed to clarify that the application of the provision of the Customs Acts is restricted to purposes of collection and control of a levy as defined in the section.  That is the purpose of the amendments which were circulated this afternoon.  The purpose of the major amendment, that is, the inclusion of the new section 29, is to give to the Revenue Commissioners the charge, care and management under customs law of the collection of levies applied under customs law to EEC levies and charges on agricultural produce, <Col N="1688" /> whether they are payable at importation or exportation.  It is necessary to have this provision in order to give effect to the transfer from the Department of Agriculture to the Revenue Commissioners of responsibility for the collection of EEC levies payable on agricultural produce at export.  The Revenue Commissioners have hitherto been responsible for the collection of such levies payable at importation only, not at export level.  They have been responsible in accordance with the provisions of regulation 7 of the European Communities Customs Regulations 1972.</P>
    <P>This section makes a corresponding provision in relation to export levies. In the interests of legislative clarity the relevant provisions of the 1972 regulations are being revoked and reenacted in this section.  I have a detailed note on the section which I will give the House if necessary.  Unless it is necessary I do not wish to take up the limited time available.  I should explain to the House that it was intended, when the Bill was originally being drafted, to include this section but a certain doubt was raised as to the validity of the provisions on the basis that the content of the section might conflict with the requirement of a Money Bill under Article 22.1 of the Constitution.  However, following further inquiries, communications and legal opinions, the parties concerned are now satisfied that it is appropriate to include this section in the Bill.  It is, therefore, being introduced now by way of amendment.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 41, to delete lines 1 to 17.</P>
      <P>This is the same section which provoked the introduction of the guillotine on Committee Stage.  This is the section of the Bill which deals with the abolition of the wealth tax.  Before we reach the imposition of the guillotine at 6.45 p.m.  I would like to reiterate the points that were referred to earlier on Committee Stage and also on Second Stage.  I believe the Minister was not able to sustain the case stated by him on Committee Stage that the removal of the wealth tax ensured a greater number of jobs becoming available. He attempted to give an economic gloss to this exemption measure of the Government.  It is incontestable that the money lost to the Exchequer, because of the abolition of the wealth tax, must be found elsewhere.  Those moneys must be found from the PAYE taxpayers.  They must make good the loss of the revenue which came from the wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not satisfy the House that the removal of this tax would improve the economic situation <Col N="1690" /> to the extent he was proposing.  We have said there was no evidence of outflow of capital referred to by the Minister in the period in which the tax operated.  We also said that we believed if inflationary expectations are to be kept down in our economy this year and the next year&mdash;the OECD report referred to the necessity for doing this &mdash;it must be clearly apparent to all who look at it that our taxation system is a fair one and that it attempts, however marginally, to redistribute in favour of the less well off.</P>
    <P>That element in our taxation system was removed under section 36 on the basis that this would assist in the creation of more jobs.  The case was not sustained.  We said on Committee Stage that we were not convinced by the reasons put forward by the Minister. We said if hardship was reported to the House and if people suffered as a result of that measure then it was open to the Minister to come before the House, at a select committee or otherwise, to consider what changes it was necessary to make.  We had, instead of that, out of the blue, this decision of the Government with their enormous majority, to abolish it.  There decision is not even in the interests of the business community whom they have said it is designed to assist, whose entrepreneurial zeal was dampened by the imposition of the wealth tax by the Coalition Government and that its removal would make sure that investment flowed without interruption once more. We believe it is not in the interests of the business community that that tax be removed.  I do not know what the ordinary members in the various cumainn who support the Government party throughout the country think of the kind of priorities the Government have.</P>

If one is to believe the vast leaks which are occurring, the kind of confidences which are being given to <Col N="1691" /> members of the Press, the defences being put forward by people like the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, there is no doubt that this is a Government who are prepared to batten down the spending hatches over the next two years.  If that is the kind of fiscal system which will be managed by the Minister for Finance over the next two years, what is the sense of priority when they deprive the Exchequer of cash for the rather shallow reason put forward by them that it would assist in the creation of more jobs?  What do the ordinary members of the Fianna Fáil Party throughout the country think, the people on whose work the 84 members of the Government party were returned here a year ago?  What do the ordinary members of that party think of the kind of priority that is animating this Government?</P>

      <P>: The Minister will agree that he did not sustain that case when he spoke on Committee Stage. He cannot point to one extra job that will be created by the abolition of this tax.  The Labour Party are committed to do everything within our power to ensure that people invest more money in the country.  If the Minister could convince us that extra jobs will follow a measure such as this, we would be the first to support him.  But that proof has been lacking all along.  We cannot decide on the reasons that led this administration to their surprising decision. They have always boasted that their membership comprised the broad mass of ordinary men and women. They are very proud to say that they include in their ranks more trade union members than any other party. What do these supporters think of a measure such as this?</P>

      <P>: The Minister knows that the creation of jobs is a more difficult task than the abolition of a tax.  There is no proven connection between the decision to abolish the tax and the creation of more jobs. One must search elsewhere for the reason for this surprising decision. Taca is no more but there may be a new group in its place.  I know the Minister is on record for his opposition to such connections in the past. One does not know whether this kind of reasoning has led him to this surprising decision that inflames expectations that certainly fans the politics of envy with which they are so concerned. They certainly postponed the idea that the tax system is fair, because you cannot plead the necessity of saying that you cannot do anything about children's allowances in the same budget that gives this kind of bonus to another category in our community.</P>
      <P>There are few resources available to the State in terms of revenue and each source must be used to the best possible advantage.  The general direction of our taxation system, which we have been following under all Governments for some years to a lesser or greater extent, is redistribution and equity. Those two standards have been damaged by the decision of the Government. The poor defence put forward for the decision, that more jobs would follow from it, has not been sustained. The Government won the election on their claim that they would restore confidence to the business community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: During last night's discussion on this Bill the message came loud and clear from the Minister's reply to my opening statement that a lack of concern and a disinterest in the welfare of this section of the workers is displayed in the 1946 Act.  The situation is very unsatisfactory. The Minister and the Government admit that there is an outdated anomaly in the Act debarring this type of worker from the benefits of the 1978 National Wage Agreement, but the Minister is not prepared to take immediate action to resolve the problem.  Rather than do that he is putting the matter on the long finger by referring it to the commission he mentioned last night who, on his own admission, may report by late 1979.  As I have said, when one hears of commissions one thinks in terms not of months but of years and late 1979 could mean late 1981.  Despite the promises, this attitude shows very little interest in the plight of these workers, and it is admitted by all that very many of them are badly paid.  There is an admission by the Minister of an anomaly which is depriving the worker of his rights under the national wage agreement.  Therefore, one must ask whether there is some pressure on the Minister not to give these workers certain concessions which have been granted to workers in other sections of our industry who together, following the plea of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, agreed on a national wage agreement over a 14-month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amounts to discrimination against this body of workers and it reminds me of the Safety in Industry Bill, introduced some months ago by the Minister for Labour, which again ignored completely this section of workers and excluded them from its benefits.  It was necessary therefore for me to submit approximately 65 amendments to this Bill to ensure that those <Col N="1696" /> workers are included in the safety precautions.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the Government and the Minister concerned, not to resist this Bill, but to tackle the problem and either accept our Bill or produce a Bill themselves which will ensure that those workers are brought on a par with other workers in regard to the wage agreement.  The Minister's attitude and concern are in keeping with the predictions in the recently published Green Paper in which the Government admitted that in the years ahead 4,000 people will leave agriculture and the land.  We all want to keep people in rural Ireland, and one must accept that among that 4,000 people will be agricultural workers.  The exodus has already commenced.  In my own area because of the situation and the imbalance very many workers despite their contribution to agricultural industry, have left the land against their will.  Any person who has started to earn his livelihood from agriculture wants to stay on the land. Due to economic circumstances these people have been forced to leave it and to go to industry in the towns. This is a tremendous loss to the farmers concerned who on many occasions find themselves in the position that they cannot get replacements for those workers.  Thus the Green Paper's prediction is <i>en route</i> already.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is voted on those who vote against it will be voting to deprive these workers of around £100 this year in their salaries.  If the anomaly is not excluded from the Act, which is 32 years old and completely outdated regarding the needs of agricultural industry, the workers will be deprived of money due to them between now and October or later.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister and the Government to reconsider this situation of a body of workers who down through the years have given great service to the country.  If the Minister does not accept our Bill I ask him to introduce in the very near future some measure which will exclude this anomaly and encourage the farm worker to be proud of his work and to be accorded pay in line with that of workers in our industrial sector. <Col N="1697" /> The commission is not and cannot be the answer.  It means that the Minister is saying, &ldquo;Let us wait another ten years and then we will give the agricultural worker his due&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out last night, we welcomed the benefits of our entry to the EEC.  We welcomed the additional revenue to the country.  We welcomed the improvements in farmers' incomes, but the man working on the land helping the farmer is entitled to some of the profits accruing from our entry.  Unfortunately, at the moment many of them are benefiting only <Col N="1698" /> from the increased food prices.  From reading to-day's paper one can appreciate their feelings at the discrimination implicit in this Act of 1946.  A wage agreement was reached in March 1978 on the basis of the cost of living rising by a certain percentage.  Surely if the cost of living is going to rise in the coming months these workers, their families and dependants are entitled to the same increase in wages to ensure that their living standards are not impaired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I assume the Chair has permission to make a statement in relation to a matter which took place in the House earlier today at Question Time when the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle in relation to certain questions was challenged.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to establish a precedent that questions which are challenged should be raised in the House in this way there were circumstances today in which I conceded to make a statement in relation to the matter, particularly since two questions were raised. One was that some Members seemed to think that questions should not be ruled out as anticipatory in any event.  The other was whether or not the Green Paper was a matter for discussion on the Adjournment Debate.  For that reason I decided to make some explanation to the House.</P>
      <P>It has been the long standing practice of the Chair to rule out of order questions which anticipate the subject matter of a forthcoming debate, with the exception of purely statistical questions.  There have been numerous instances in which questions were ruled out as anticipatory of debate. For example, on the budget, on the Finance Bill, on many other Bills.  Indeed a Bill which had been introduced in the Seanad, and which had not even reached the Dáil&mdash;the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill&mdash;was regarded as anticipated by questions which were duly ruled out of order. Similarly, questions anticipatory of debates on motions have been disallowed. For example, questions regarding EEC matters have been ruled out as anticipatory of the motion regarding Developments in the EEC, Fourth Report.</P>
      <P>To give Deputies some idea of the number of cases involved I may say that a file of disallowed questions, dating only from 1941, is many inches thick.  I have brought it here and will quote from it if the House wishes to have examples of questions, literally hundreds of them, which have been turned down in similar circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present case various references were made in the House to the availability of the Green Paper and its discussion on the Adjournment Debate. For instance, on 31 May, Deputy Cluskey asked whether it would be circulated, available and ordered to be discussed during the Adjournment Debate. Again, on 8 June, the Taoiseach, in reply to a question from Deputy Kelly, said that the Green Paper would be available in good time for the Adjournment Debate.  The impression created in the minds of my advisers and myself in regard to the Adjournment Debate was that its subject matter was to be the Government's Green Paper.  A debate before a long adjournment can be so confined either by putting down a motion, for example, that the House takes note of the Green Paper, or by a general agreement that the debate on the motion to adjourn the House for the recess would be devoted to a particular subject. The staff and I believed that either of those courses would be followed. Accordingly I felt obliged to follow precedent and ruled out questions referring specifically to the Green Paper.  Unless the House tells me now <Col N="1701" /> that this assumption is wrong and that, instead of being the only subject on the debate the Green Paper will be just one of many matters raised, my ruling, based on the long-established precedent, must stand.</P>
    <P>Before anybody speaks, I have a very deep file here in front of me in relation to questions which at least three or four of my predecessors ruled on as being anticipatory questions, very many relating to budget debates, and I am referring to our assuming from certain evidence before us that there would be a debate on the Green Paper.  I look at a precedent where several questions were put down in relation to mergers and take-overs.  They were ruled out of order on the grounds that the matter would be covered in a Bill to be discussed in Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The people asking the questions were seeking information which they thought enabled them to equip themselves for the debate. But they were ruled out by one of my predecessors&mdash;the said Committee Stage never took place.  Similarly there was a motion on the EEC for which there were as many as ten or 12 questions ruled out on the same grounds, that they were anticipating the debate on the motion.  These questions were being asked by Deputies who would argue that they were seeking information to enable them the better to deal with the debate.  I have literally hundreds of them here, from 1941 down to the present day.  Therefore the criterion of a question anticipating a forthcoming debate, a Bill or a motion is very common practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to say that I am not aware of any suggestion that either of the procedures which you have mentioned as confining an Adjournment Debate have been contemplated by anybody and certainly not by us.  I understood the form of the Adjournment Debate to be normal open form.  I took it that some speakers might wish to refer to the Green Paper.  I am aware that a number of speakers wish to refer to other matters not connected with the Green <Col N="1702" /> Paper.  Therefore there may have been, on your part, a misapprehension as to the intention with regard to both the format of the debate and the nature of the contributions in the debate.  Having made that statement as to my understanding of the position, I should like to ask you a question, which is whether you can quote precedent relating to an open-ended Adjournment Debate which has not been specifically confined to a specific topic, and which I think is the issue at stake in these circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Sir, you have referred to a very thick file of precedents. From what you have said, by implication I have gathered, but I would like to be more directly informed, that these related to cases where either a specific Bill or motion was coming forward or where an Adjournment Debate was about to be or had been agreed to be confined to a specific topic by way of one of two procedures which you mentioned.  It is my understanding from what you said that there is not a precedent for refusing questions where the Adjournment Debate is of the open-ended kind which it normally takes.  I should like to have confirmation of my understanding of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: Most of these questions, like the ones ruled out of order on tomorrow's Order Paper, were based on the assumption that an opportunity would arise in a forthcoming debate, already mentioned, sometimes ordered and sometimes by way of motion.  Many of the things for which these questions have been ruled out did not take place at all.  We have frequently to go on the assumption that we have reasonable grounds for so ruling.  I was amazed that Deputies raised the question of the Ceann Comhairle ruling out questions of the ground that they were anticipatory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I also very much welcome the fact that you clearly indicated that on being told by Members that your staff made an incorrect assumption with regard to the discussion of the Green Paper, you referred to a question addressed by me to the Taoiseach asking if the Green Paper would be available in time to be discussed during the Adjournment Debate and the Taoiseach assured me it would. Naturally it would not be our intention, and I find it difficult to see how anyone could assume it would, to confine our remarks to the Green Paper in the Adjournment Debate.  There was also the fact that the Taoiseach assured me on two occasions some considerable time ago that we would have an opportunity in Government time to discuss the Green Paper.  That opportunity has not been afforded to us yet. However, I am very much relieved that the situation now seems to have been resolved.  I welcome the fact that the Chair has appeared to me to clearly indicate that, on being assured, as I now assure him again, that our remarks on the Adjournment Debate would naturally include references to the Green Paper but would not be confined to references to the Green Paper, that would lead the Chair to revise the disallowing of the questions that were the subject matter of this controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not want to enter into any controversy at all on this matter but I would say that many of the precedents here in front of me in this huge file relate to cases where the matter was ruled out in relation to Bills which covered many things other than the subject matter of the questions.  I think I was right in assuming that the questions related to matters which could be and, no doubt, will be raised on the Adjournment Debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In ruling you relied on precedents and the Chair quoted the precedent of the budget debate.  That is a specific debate in relation to which one would expect a question to be ruled out if it were probing the <Col N="1704" /> budget.  The Chair also referred to specific debates on specific resolutions and Bills.  These are all closely knit debates.  I doubt if the Chair will find a precedent where something was ruled out in anticipation of a general adjournment debate.  The Chair has raised the question as to whether the Green Paper will be the only matter to be dealt with in the Adjournment Debate or whether it will be one of many matters.  I have no doubt the House will agree that a wide range of topics dealing with every Department and the activities and inactivities of the Government over the last 12 months will be dealt with in the Adjournment Debate and I am sure that if the Chair's advisers had appreciated that when they were advising him, the questions would not have been ruled out and I take it that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: May I have clarifi-cation, first of all, as to whether I am right in assuming that the Adjournment Debate is a general open-ended debate and, if I am right in that, is it not correct to say that every one of the precedents you quote were not in fact of a general open-ended nature but dealt specifically with financial or other matters and dealt in a closed way with the issues on which the questions were disallowed?  In other words, is there not a major difference between questions about specific proposals, such as the Green Paper, and their being ruled out of order on the basis of a general debate and questions which could reasonably be said to be linked with specific proposals, <Col N="1705" /> such as the Finance Bill, budget proposals, a Broadcasting Bill, EEC legislation and so on?  Is there not a fundamental difference and is not that fundamental difference underlined by the fact that, whereas in any of the precedents you quoted there would be a Committee Stage and, therefore, a question and answer session, there is no guarantee whatever that any Deputy would be entitled to contribute to the Adjournment Debate because it is a limited debate and, secondly, whoever replies need not even bother to acknowledge the questions, to say nothing of not answering them specifically, and, if we accept that, do we not therefore accept automatically a major circumscription of the right of the Members to ask questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

I want to say finally, if the House is satisfied that the Green Paper is not the principal part of the discussion, <Col N="1706" /> and that a proper opportunity does not arise to raise these matters, I will permit these questions.  I would like to add here for the benefit of anyone who might impute any ulterior motive to the Chair&mdash;I do not think anyone did&mdash;that had I allowed these questions in the first instance they would not have been reached.  Anybody can make his own deduction but I want to make the position quite clear in case anybody would think that there is any ulterior motive.  I thank the House.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1978, a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 14 June 1978.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this resolution is to seek the approval of the House for a draft order to guarantee bank borrowings to the extent of £2.3 million by Avoca Mines Limited.</P>
      <P>Avoca Mines Limited have operated the Avoca copper mine in County Wicklow since 1971, having purchased the mine in 1969 from the previous operators, St. Patricks Copper Mines Limited, who went into receivership and closed down the mine in 1962. Copper concentrate and pyrite concentrate are produced at the mine.  The copper concentrate is exported and the pyrite concentrate is sold to NET.</P>
      <P>The essential factor governing the profitability of the mine is the price of copper.  The copper market, like that of other base metals, is broadly cyclical, and as the Avoca Mine is a low grade copper mine it is extremely vulnerable to significant financial losses in periods of downturn in the price cycle; a grade of 0.7 per cent copper is being mined there at the present time when mines in Africa with up to 4 per cent grading are finding it extremely difficult to operate on a profitable basis because of the low level of copper prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> Copper prices in the period from 1972 to mid-1974 were at a level which enabled the Avoca mine to operate on a profitable basis and the company ploughed back these profits into the operation.  Copper prices reached a peak of £1,400 per ton in April 1974 but by the end of 1974 they had dropped to £500 per ton. Since then the high price levels of the 1972-74 period have never been regained, the highest price reached being slightly over £900 for a brief period early in 1977.  The price was around £675 a ton in April of this year.  It rose by about £100 a ton under the influence of the recent disruptions in Zaire and certain other factors but it has since declined from this level and is now around £720 a ton.  It is not possible to gauge with any accuracy what influence the Zaire situation and other recent developments in other copper producing countries will have on copper price movements in the short-term but commentators seem to agree that a sustained return to the high price levels of the early 1970s is unlikely to emerge before 1982 and some of them predict that this might not occur until the mid-1980s.</P>
    <P>The break-even copper price level for the current mainly underground mining operation at Avoca is very substantially in excess of average copper prices in the last few years and as a result the company has been in a situation of substantial and growing operational loss.  The mines net losses in 1977, including interest on bank overdraft, depreciation and other costs, amounted to £1.162 million.</P>
    <P>The company, having suffered a serious deterioration in liquidity in 1974, sought State assistance and a loan of £300,000 was provided through Fóir Teoranta.  With a view to keeping costs as low as possible during the period of the depressed prices production was cut back and the workforce was halved.  In June 1975 the company's bankers expressed concern about Avoca's overdraft and said that they would have to consider foreclosure unless the Government were prepared to guarantee part of the overdraft.  The <Col N="1708" /> bank requested a guarantee for the shortfall between the liquid assets of the mine and the amount overdrawn by the company, after payment of preferential claims.</P>
    <P>In July 1975 the Government approved the offer of a guarantee of £170,000 until September 1975 to ensure continuance of the operation while the possibility of attracting private interest finance to the mine was being investigated.  The Government subsequently approved of further increases and extensions of the guarantee. In November 1977 an increase to £1.6 million was granted but this level of guarantee for the company's bank overdraft facilities will be inadequate shortly.</P>
    <P>The efforts to attract private interest investment to the mine culminated in an agreement being reached with Messina (Transvaal) Development Company which provided Messina with an option to take over 85 per cent of the share capital of Avoca Mines Limited if the results of an exploration programme to be carried out at the mine in the meantime were satisfactory. Messina commenced an exploration programme at Avoca in August 1977.  Their immediate objective was the identification of an underground orebody of at least 3 million tons of grade 1 per cent or over which could be mined and milled by the existing facilities at the mine.</P>
    <P>In December 1977 the company informed me that their geologists had concluded that the chances of finding the large additional tonnage they had hoped for were so remote that they had decided not to do any further work at Avoca and not to exercise the option to acquire the bulk of the share capital of Avoca Mines Limited.  The company's decision came as a disappointment but it was not entirely unexpected.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the sharp deterioration in the outlook for copper at the time and other relevant factors it had to be accepted that, in commercial terms and apart altogether from the geological conclusions, the basis for further work by Messina was doubtful.  Furthermore, a number of other major copper-mining companies had earlier <Col N="1709" /> been persuaded to look at Avoca and they too had concluded that there were not sufficiently attractive prospects there to justify involvement on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>Following the withdrawal by Messina the situation of the mine was reviewed by my Department and the Geological Survey Office, in co-operation with the mine management.  It was clear that continuation of operations on their present basis could not be expected to be viable other than for a relatively short period in the copper price cycle when prices would be temporarily high and any profits realised in that short period would not nearly compensate for the substantial losses which would be accumulated during the much longer periods of lower prices.</P>
    <P>There are geological indications of ore reserves of a size possibly sufficient to support a significant open-pit operation for a reasonable period but the viability of such a project depends on a number of extremely crucial factors. These include the volume, grade and grade distribution of the ore, the additional capital equipment and other development costs necessary, extraction, haulage, milling and other operating costs and, of course, the difficult question of how copper prices may move during the next ten to 12 years. Deputies need only look at these points to see how many question marks hang over the possible viability of this project.</P>
    <P>As much evaluation as possible has been done with the limited resources available to my Department, but in order to analyse these questions more fully and offer authoritative opinions on them I have decided to engage a consultant from the mining sector to carry out a comprehensive survey of the situation.  The mine management have agreed to assist and co-operate in the consultant's evaluation, which will cover prospects generally at the mine and the open-pit possibilities specifically.</P>
    <P>The Geological Survey Office will make relevant data, reports and evaluations available and will also generally assist in the consultancy project.  The estimated cost of financial support for the mine for the necessary period and <Col N="1710" /> the consultancy and associated expenses are included in the sum specified in the resolution before the House.</P>
    <P>I want to have this evaluation done properly but I also want it done with the minimum of delay because the present on-going cost of maintaining the mine for any significant period without the prospect of a viable longer-term future, is not tolerable.  I hope, therefore, that the results of this expert study will be available to the Government well before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The study by the consultants should provide the company and the Government with authoritative and expert advice which will enable firm decisions to be reached on future operations at the mine.  It is my hope that a means will emerge to ensure a viable continuing mining operation at Avoca which will enable employment to be maintained at the mine at least at the existing level of 230 men.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prejudge the findings of the expert study.  However, in the circumstances which I have set out, especially the fact that over the long history of the mine the grade of ore mined has been predominantly low and that a substantial and sustained rise in copper prices cannot be foreseen for some time, I would not wish to convey to the House a particularly optimistic expectation about the outcome of the consultants' work.  Their findings will obviously have to give realistic promise of a much more viable operation than is being engaged in at Avoca mine at present because, as I have said, continued underwriting by the State of losses on the current level simply could not be justified.</P>
    <P>The present Government&mdash;and indeed successive Governments&mdash;have gone to very considerable lengths to maintain mining operations at Avoca. The ultimate cost to the State arising out of the failure of St. Patrick's Copper Mines was in the region of £3.2 million.  Indeed it may be suggested that the efforts made and the costs assumed by the State over a long number of years are more than would be justified on any economic basis, however, defined.  The decision to be taken within the next few months will be a difficult one whichever way it goes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> The reason why a resolution and order to formalise the guarantee has not been introduced in the House before now was that in the first instance the extent of the State's future involvement in the company's affairs could not be assessed while the efforts to attract private investment were in progress and more recently until studies by the Geological Survey Office and by the company were completed.</P>
    <P>I now recommend that in the circumstances I have outlined the House should pass the resolution before it approving of the draft order which will authorise the Minister for Finance to give a guarantee of £2.3 million under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, in respect of bank borrowings by Avoca Mines Limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: We agree with this motion with a certain amount of cold feeling in the pit of our stomachs because the message running right through the Minister's speech is that his Department at least, perhaps the Geological Survey Office and Messina do not appear to think that this company can be made a viable producer, except when the price of copper is at its height.  I suggest that we avoid going into the history of Avoca Mines and its various ups and downs over the last few years.  We should pin our hopes and the State's money on the survey the Minister is arranging to have carried out.  I trust that the survey will be completed as quickly as possible and that it will include all the factors that will give us an indication of the future of the mines.  The future of the 230 people who are employed there must be considered. Obviously, present copper prices indicate a large world surplus, much of which is in Zaire, Zambia and other Central African countries.  The recent troubles in Zaire have had an effect on the price of copper.  Perhaps, too, we should consider the study from a security point of view.  The Minister says that the quality of the ore mined at Avoca is low but although it would cost money to keep the mine open, it might be worth while spending this money in order to ensure that in the event of an emergency we would have <Col N="1712" /> a supply of copper within the State although the quality would be low.  Apart from the investment in the original company, we will have invested £2.3 million in the parent company by the time the overdraft guarantee amount is used up.  Apart from the ordinary commercial criterion that will be applied as a result of the study being commissioned we should have regard to two other points before making a final decision on the future of the mines.  The first point is the livelihood of the 230 people and their families who are involved in the mines, and the other consideration is the question of whether it is realistic to continue investment in the mines in order to ensure that in the event of copper not being available from other sources at some future date, we would have a source of copper here.</P>
      <P>The Minister is acting correctly at this stage in guaranteeing Avoca further until the study on the mines has been completed.  I trust, though, that before any irrevocable decision is made the Minister will come back to the House to furnish us with the report so that the House may be part of any decision taken at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister's statement is rather grim.  The prospects for the mines could not be described as being encouraging in any way.  The net effect of what the Minister is proposing is that in a relatively short period we should invest another £0.75 million of taxpayers' money in the Avoca mines.  When the Minister discloses the reasonable scenario to 1982 or to the mid-eighties it is fairly evident that with the £2.3 million limit we are sanctioning today&mdash;having cleared already the £1.6 million limit &mdash;on the basis of current assumptions and price levels, we shall be able to keep the mines open up to the mid-eighties with an injection of perhaps another £2 million or £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little else the Minister could have done in the circumstances. He is awaiting yet another report from another group of consultants.  I do not know how many geological assessments there have been into the operations at Avoca.  I am sure that the list of efforts of various Ministers to <Col N="1713" /> interest foreign concerns in the future of the company would read like an international mining dossier.  The efforts have been intensive.  I recall some involvement in the sense that as a trade union official and as Labour Party Whip I had intensive discussions on the matter with the Minister's predecessor, Senator Keating.  In a period of great financial stringency we had much difficulty in extracting from the Minister sanction for, say, £100,000 or £150,000 here or there in order to keep the mines in operation, albeit, at a very substantial loss.  That was at a time when there were substantial price movements in respect of high pyrite copper concentrate although these were short lived.  The House would be living in a fool's paradise if it were not to appreciate that from all accounts the situation is grim.  I do not know who is the consultant the Minister has engaged for this study but personally I should be interested in knowing who is to carry out this comprehensive study.  However, if the Minister prefers not to disclose the information I shall leave it at that.  I am pleased to learn that the mine management have agreed to co-operate with and to assist the consultants in their work.  I do not suppose there would be much prospect for them should they act otherwise.</P>
    <P>The open-pit possibilities in relation to this mine have been examined but perhaps there is another dimension by which they could be examined further.  There could be nothing worse than to cause a degree of despondency among the workers involved and their families.  These workers have earned reasonable wages.  The only justification for engendering despondency would be a genuine sense of futility in terms of the extent to which we are putting taxpayer's money into an operation of this nature.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether in the mining sense anybody has ever carried out a clear cost-benefit analysis of what the mines have cost during the years of their operations.  The State has put in more than £5.5 million but this has resulted in employment being provided in an area of low income.  Apart from the tremendous work being done by NET locally, the Avoca-Arklow area <Col N="1714" /> has always been in dire need of employment. It is arguable, then, that on balance the £5.5 million expended by the State, admittedly during a long period, was worth while in terms of taxpayers' subvention in order to provide employment.</P>
    <P>It is with some reluctance that I accept the Minister's view that the decision to be made within the next few months will be difficult.  I have not access to the accounts of the company concerned but I am wondering how long the additional guaranteed borrowing will last.  Will it last for another six months or, perhaps, until the middle of next year by which time the shutters would come down on the mine?  With that current pessimistic assessment on my part I accept what the Minister has said and assure him that I should be very happy to be proved wrong in my assessment.  The prospects, as the Minister has pointed out, depend on the general price outlook which looks fairly solid at its current low level for the next five years at any rate.  The cost benefit situation arises, therefore, for the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the work of the Department, particularly the senior staff, who have been subjected to great pressures in regard to the operation of this company to which they have also given a great deal of thought, time and effort, whether it was at Fóir Teoranta level or at departmental level.  They cannot be accused of having been found wanting whenever any foreign mining entrepreneurs have been available to take another look at this operation in the hope that they would find the elusive even half break-even point.  The departmental staff have been most co-operative and helpful. They also have a public accountability in regard to the taxpayers money.</P>
    <P>I was not quite sure from the Minister's speech when the result of the consultant's report will be available. The Minister said &ldquo;before the end of the year&rdquo;.  We can assume that there will be sufficient liquidity by subvention between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I hope the consultants report will hold out some long term viable future <Col N="1715" /> for the operation of this company.  I accept what the Minister has said.  He is quite right to come to the House at this time to give this additional subvention; but he will be faced, as his predecessor was, with circumstances which sometimes look tremendously promising, when new people come on the scene and new investigations are opened up, but seem to fizzle out rapidly over a period.  I accept what the Minister has said and I accept the necessity for the current proposal in relation to bank borrowings, but with all the reservations which I have expressed, which, although not unduly black, bear in mind the reality of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The position of Avoca is very grim, particularly to a Deputy who represents the constituency. Avoca Mines have tried many options which have simply not worked out.  We all hope that eventually some upturn in the world situation will help Avoca Mines further on their way.  I have had the privilege of meeting the management of this company on many occasions and also representatives of the workers.  I know their zeal and enthusiasm in their efforts to try and make the undertaking more viable. Unfortunately, the copper grade in Avoca is extremely low.  The prospects are chilling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister is making a further £0.7 million available to allow for this evaluation to take place.  I hope it will prove positive and allow for a significant open pit mining operation in that area.  There is a tradition of mining around Avoca, which has had its ups and downs.  There are 230 employees on the pay roll.  I hope that something can be done for them.  As far as I know this is the only copper mine in the EEC.  Could the vast resources of the EEC be tapped to allow a holding operation?  For some time past the holding operation at the mines has been vital for the lives of the 230 men there.  I hope that a grade of ore as low as that in Avoca can be <Col N="1716" /> useful in the world economy in the mid 1980s.</P>
    <P>I understand the difficulties there are for the Minister.  He has responsibility and accountability.  A sum of £2.3 million is a lot of money, but I know many of the workforce there and the management and they are very hard working people.  I have also been in contact with the Department in regard to this matter.  I know that the Minister is very anxious that this mine, if at all possible, be kept going.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the difficulties of finding alternative employment in that area for the 230 men involved.  The town of Arklow is doing particularly well and I am delighted to be able to state that the employment there is very good.  In Avoca the situation is not very good and there are not many options open to people who are skilled in one form of operation.</P>
    <P>The workers in Avoca Mines and the management there are faced with the ongoing situation of a possible closure of the mines.  They are optimistic and they are very diligent workers.  I am pleased that the Minister came before the House to seek the raising of the guarantee from £1.6 million to £2.3 million.  I would like if the situation were more promising.  I hope the evaluation will prove positive and that the Minister will see if the vast resources of the EEC can be utilised in saving this mine.</P>

      <P>: I should like to thank Deputies for their welcome to this motion to enable this guarantee to be given.  There is not an existing guarantee under the State Guarantees Act.  While the Government have progressively increased the figure up to £1.6 million the motion has still to be moved in relation to all of it because it was not moved in the past for the reasons I gave in my opening speech.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry referred to the importance of our having a source of copper here in case of difficulties in a time of emergency.  This mine is not a source of copper but of copper concentrates. We do not have a smelter and we would not have access to the metal in any even if there was a difficulty of that kind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are several, mainly in Spain, but they are in the Community also.  A fact which has to be borne in mind about this mine and its future is that on present knowledge the known reserves are adequate for only four or five years, even if the price was at an economic level which would be over £1,200 per ton.  It is possible that there might be further reserves but the cost of exploring for them would be substantial.  The best prospect would appear to be the possibility of a much enlarged open cast operation in what was described as the East Avoca area.</P>
      <P>Deputy B. Desmond referred to the consultancy report being expected before the end of the year.  In my speech I said I would expect the report much sooner than that and that it would enable the Government to make a decision, one way or the other, well before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Deputy C. Murphy referred to the possibility of trying to get some assistance for this operation from the EEC. My Department have already been in touch with the appropriate officials of the Commission.  While those officials were sympathetic to our approaches, particularly as this is the main copper mine in the Community, small as it is, they advised that there is no readily available source of Community funds for such a purpose.  They informed my officials that it would take up to three years to get approval for a support scheme.  There are some prospects of help for the exploration project under the regional fund, but the element of cost for the consultancy is not great in comparison with the ongoing losses in the mine itself, so what might be got through the regional fund would be minimal.  What we would really need is support for the actual operation which, unfortunately, is not available.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I have had to come into the House with what has been described by some Deputies as a grim message.  This mine has not had a happy history in terms of commercial viability over a prolonged period and it is not at one of its best periods now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> I join with Deputies on both sides of the House in hoping that this study which is now being started will indicate a way in which some operations in this ore body will remain viable in the years to come.</P>

      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The need for this Bill arises from Mr. W. Garfield Weston's very generous offer to make a gift to the State of his property Barrettstown Castle and adjoining land at Ballymore Eustace, County Kildare.  The gift includes the contents of the Castle and a sum of £100,000 by way of permanent endowment for the purpose of discharging the outgoings on the property.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the present Government I should like to endorse the expression of thanks made to Mr. Garfield Weston by the then Taoiseach when acknowledging acceptance of the gift in March of 1977.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the processing of the gift, which is being funded by the Garfield Weston Charitable Foundation, include the setting up of Barrettstown Castle Trust and it was proposed that the Commissioners of Public Works would be the trustees of the Barrettstown Castle Trust.  The legal advice which was obtained was to the effect that the commissioners have no statutory power to act as trustees or to nominate trustees in a case such as this.</P>
      <P>Legislation to enable the commissioners to act as trustees is accordingly necessary and the Bill provides for this.  The Bill also contains a clause enabling the commissioners in general terms to accept the trusteeship of any other trust with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  It seems appropriate to take the present opportunity to give them this power which they have not had up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> The Barrettstown Castle Trust is being administered by the Trustees of the Garfield Weston Irish Foundation until the commissioners can undertake the trust.  The Irish National Stud Company is using the land and farm buildings on a rental basis and the question of the future of the house is being examined.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to join the Minister of State in saying how much the previous Government and this Government appreciate the generosity of Mr. Garfield Weston in making this valuable property available to the Government and, through them, to the people, and in giving the sum of £100,000.</P>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Weston is a Canadian and his attitude to this country, where he has, by his own admission, been successful in business and his appreciation of the hospitality that was extended to him is shown in this generous gift to the State.  This is in marked contrast to a number of people, the descendants of families who have been here for many hundreds of years, who in many cases were not contributing to employment. When they were asked to pay some more tax their immediate response was to clear out.  They could well take a lead from Mr. Weston's example and from the words of an assassinated president of the neighbouring country to Mr. Weston's home country, which were: &ldquo;Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the last sentence in the Minister's brief, the National Stud are using the land and farm buildings on a rental basis and the question of the future of the house is being examined.  On many occasions it has been said, outside this House mainly, that we need a residence for the Taoiseach.  It is inappropriate from his neighbours point of view that he should be living in a suburban area where security arrangements have to be made because of the job he holds. Like An t-Uachtaran, the Taoiseach <Col N="1720" /> needs a residence in which he can entertain and provide hospitality for visitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what distance Ballymore Eustace is from Dublin but it was possible for the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, Senator Keating, to come up to Dublin from Ballymore Eustace every day to his work.  I suggest to the commissioners that, when they get this property, into their control they might consider, and the Government might consider, making it available as a residence for the Taoiseach if it is within suitable driving distance from Dublin.  No doubt there will be many other suggestions as to how this house should be used.  This and other similar generous gifts which are frequently given to the Government should be examined with the No. 1 priority of being made a residence for the Taoiseach.  Perhaps this is too far away and maybe some other property will come on the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome this Bill.  I should like to ask how much land adjoins the castle.  I notice that the land and the farm buildings are rented by the National Stud Company. Mr. Garfield Weston has set a good example and the least this House can do is to thank him publicly for making the property available.  The Minister might indicate to us the extent of the contents of the castle.  The contents of some Irish castles are more valuable than the properties.  It is encouraging that the gift includes the contents of the castle and a cash endowment which will be useful to the Commissioners of Public Works.  I approve of this operation.</P>
      <P>I am a member of Dublin County Council.  Recently it cost us a good deal of money to bring Malahide Castle into public ownership and to decorate it properly.  It is a magnificent public property.  In Kilkenny Workshop and other places one visits, one grows to admire the tremendous craftsmanship and sensitivity the staff of the commissioners exercise in their care of many public buildings.  I know of thousands of Dublin people who have never visited Dublin Castle, not to mention Barrettstown Castle.  That is a terrible pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> I do not know what the Government or the Commissioners may have in mind as to the future use of this castle. I do not know the building.  Perhaps later Members of the House may have an opportunity of going down to see it. I am sure we would all like to see this gift to the State.  It might be possible for the Eastern Health Board in the area to lease it.  They might well be able to make use of a property of that nature if it is suitable for community work.  I do not know whether it would be suitable as the out-of-town residence of the Taoiseach and for guests of the President.  We need a residence of that nature rather than having to hire accommodation for visitors because of the inadequate facilities in Aras an Uachtaráin.  When the Taoiseach invites guests he has to put them up in expensive hotel suites in the city centre. Barrettstown Castle is about 40 miles from Dublin.</P>

I hope that other Irish families who have houses on their estates, some of which are in quite good condition, and some of which are not occupied, will follow this good example and make the properties available not only to the Commissioners of Public Works but also to the local authorities and other statutory bodies for public use, for public enjoyment and for the cultural and environmental enrichment of all our people.</P>

      <P>: It is estimated that the cost in the current year would be £8.5 million.  It <Col N="1628" /> is difficult to estimate the cost in 1979 as this will depend on the fluctuation in the market values that will have taken place in the meantime and on other factors such as the movement in and out of the tax of assessable persons. However, assuming an average overall increase of 10 per cent in yield the cost for 1979 would be in the region of £9.3 million.</P>
      <P>Outstanding tax will, of course, continue to be assessed and collected in respect of the valuation dates in 1975, 1976 and 1977.</P>

      <P>: As records in relation to the number of applications were not kept on a county-by-county basis until the beginning of this year, precise figures are not available for the number of applications received in County Kerry since the scheme began.  Since 1 January last, 274 applications were received. In the period from 6 July 1977, to the 16 June 1978, 410 grants were approved in the county and 79 were paid.  It is estimated that less than 5 per cent of all applications received have been refused.</P>
