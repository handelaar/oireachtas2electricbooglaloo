      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the talks in Siena between the Italian Prime Minister and Chancellor Schmidt in which the problem of underdeveloped regions and the adequate transfer of resources as part of the new EMS was discussed, he will now seek a meeting with Chancellor Schmidt to ensure an adequate resource transfer to meet our development needs in the event of our accession to the EMS.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As announced recently, I shall be meeting President Giscard d'Estaing, Prime Minister Callaghan and Federal Chancellor Schmidt for discussions on the proposals for a European Monetary System in Paris, London and Bonn, <Col N="1242" /> respectively, on 22, 27 and 28 November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us whether at the meeting with the German Chancellor the Taoiseach will be seeking aid from Germany directly or whether he will be seeking Community aid, and can he state, in the event of adequate aid being forthcoming from either Germany bilaterally or from the Community, whether any contingency plans are ready here for implementation of an employment protection scheme, utilising such funds?</P>

      <P>It is of central relevance to provide employment protection from any funds that may be made available.  It is not my fault if it is the Minister of State who is replying for the Taoiseach.  I am sure the Minister has been briefed to give answers to these relevant questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The current national agreement has more than four months to run for some groups and more than seven months for many others.  It is, therefore, premature to talk of action related to negotiations on its expiry.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the agreed statements issued following these meetings, arrangements will be made for further meetings as the situation requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>My question should be read &ldquo;ordinary wage negotiations next year&rdquo;.  My handwriting was at fault. Now that the unions have decided not to enter into preliminary talks on another national wage agreement, will the Minister agree that it is incumbent on the Government to clarify their budgetary intentions as soon as possible in respect of children's allowances, food subsidies and the general level of taxation? By doing so they would be preparing the ground for early talks.  Does the Minister agree that a duty devolves on the Government, if they are interested in preparing the ground for orderly wage negotiations next year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the prospect of talks being opened on orderly wage negotiations next year has been diminished if the Government are to proceed with plans mentioned by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development?  If the Government are anxious to prepare conditions in which orderly wage negotiations may take place, the best thing they could do would be publicly to amend policies declared that would influence the cost of living upwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the total number of persons charged as a result of the new breathanalyser alcohol test; the number of convictions; and the number of persons, if any, suspended from driving as a consequence of conviction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the period from the 20 July 1978, when the new Road Traffic (Amendment) Act came into operation, up to the end of October 1978 the figures sought are as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Number of persons charged: 898;</P>
      <P>(2)  Number of convictions: 98;</P>
      <P>(3)  Number of persons suspended from driving as a consequence of convictions: 91.  </P>
      <P>As these figures taken by themselves could be misleading, I would add two points of explanation.  First, the relatively small figure for convictions is accounted for in the main by the fact that the great majority of the cases in which proceedings have been taken are still before the courts.</P>
      <P>Second, disqualification is mandatory where the conviction relates to driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle when the blood/alcohol level exceeds the prescribed amount but it is not mandatory where the offence does not involve driving but only being in charge of the vehicle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is referring to the possibility of an amendment to the Constitution in relation to adoption, the position is that I made a statement in the matter in this House on Tuesday 24 October 1978.  I said that I hoped to be in a position to put forward proposals for legislation at an early date to safeguard adoption orders from the danger of being declared to be invalid because they were made by a board and not by a court.  I have nothing to add to that at this stage.</P>
      <P>That apart, I am not aware that it has been demonstrated that there are defects in the Adoption Acts that ought to be remedied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I say with all sincerity that I hope to be in the House in a very short time, definitely before Christmas, with the legislation.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is and has been the practice that the contents of legislation are not made known until the Bill is circulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together. Both these matters, that is to say, the law relating to the domicile of married women and the legal action known as an action for criminal conversation, are under examination by the Law Reform Commission who, I understand, expect to be publishing reports or working papers on them in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> I have not, to my knowledge, ever spoken of consequences of the abolition of the legal action known as criminal conversation.  What I have said is that there are various ways in which it is possible to achieve the desired effect of putting husband and wife on an equal footing in regard to such actions.  I have also said that the law of criminal conversation should not be considered in isolation but that the review of the law should also extend to other legal actions in the same general area such as an action for enticement&mdash;which incidentally is an action which a wife as well as a husband can take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that while cases of this kind may be very limited they symbolise the inequality of women before the law and are taken as such?  Would he not agree that it is a matter that should receive priority and should be dealt with urgently?  We tabled this question in October 1977 and the Minister's reply was not much clearer.  Could we have some action in the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept and I share the Deputy's concern in this area.  Again I say to the House that this matter is before the Law Reform Commission.  I understand it is very likely that we shall have a working paper from them in the very near future.  When this matter was last raised in the House I can assure the House the commission were made aware and are aware of the interest of the Members in this area.</P>

      <P>The method prescribed by law for inquiring into such matters and informing the public of the outcome is the holding of a coroner's inquest which in fact is a sworn public inquiry. An inquest has already been held in the case in question and the jury, in <Col N="1250" /> accordance with the medical evidence, returned a verdict of death from meningitis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there are limitations to coroners' courts and that a number of facts associated with this case were not investigated?  Why was it that these two boys, Owen Redmond and Aidan White, were kept in custody for 48 hours before being charged?  Why was it that the mother was not informed?  Would it not be appropriate that a parent should be available when a child or youngster like this is being questioned?  Surely this is something that should be inquired into by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured that it was wide open to the inquest to consider all these matters.  There was no question of anybody being prevented from bringing anything out at the inquest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister knows why it was that the Supreme Court ruling on this question of bringing somebody before a court or a peace commissioner after being charged was not observed in relation to these two youngsters.  Does the Minister know why that was done?  Why was it that this child died from meningitis and that this diagnosis was only made <i>post mortem</i>? Why was it not diagnosed in the Garda barracks or in the assessment unit to which he was sent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister would he not consider it his responsibility to know why the Garda did not obey the law in respect of charging the child, why they did not bring in the parent, why they held a child suffering from meningitis without medical care and attention?  This appears to be death under very suspicious circumstances in custody for which the Minister is directly responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it very clear that I am not to be taken as expressing the view that in the matter of the procedures they followed in this case the Garda were above reproach.  I believe that in some respects their handling of the matter may have been open to criticism.  This must in no way obscure the central fact that the death of this unfortunate boy cannot be laid at the door of the Garda Síochána.  Specific allegations of ill-treatment of the dead boy while he was in Garda custody were made by his mother and similar allegations were also made by another boy, a colleague of the deceased.  This other boy has since pleaded guilty in court on a number of charges and neither he nor his legal representative made allegations to the court of ill-treatment while in custody.  Although there was no medical evidence to support the allegations against the Garda the papers were referred by them to the Director of Public Prosecutions who was satisfied that no prosecution was warranted against any member of the Garda who dealt with the boys while they were in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the attempts which have been made to misrepresent the situation in a newspaper article it is well that we should be clear about the fact that the medical advice tendered at the coroner's inquest was to the effect that the dead boy was in a poor nutritional state which almost certainly increased his susceptibility to infection with meningitis and that, accordingly, malnutrition was a contributory cause of death.  Attempts have been made by at least one journalist to confuse the public on this issue by implying that the medical evidence was referring to a complaint that the dead boy did not receive adequate food while he was in Garda custody.  In fact, <Col N="1252" /> evidence was given that the boy had been away from home for some weeks prior to his arrest, that he had been &ldquo;living rough&rdquo; and that he had not had proper food.  He was in Garda custody for less than 48 hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered any of my questions about the <i>prima facie</i> breach of the law by the Garda in respect of this child's liberty and rights.  Why was it that this child was kept on a respirator for six days after being brought to hospital and the only reported reason given by the doctor in charge was that there might be legal complications?  It has been suggested that the child lost his bruises while being on the respirator and this helped to conceal the fact that the boys had been assaulted while in Garda custody.  Finally, is this kind of charge, which may be wrongly accusing the Garda of things they did not do, the reason that the Ó Briain Commission was set up so that somebody would be there as a witness other than on the Garda side or on the children's side?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of considerable concern at recent statements attributed to him on the question of rape; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question obviously relates to two newspaper articles in which something I had said in the course of a radio interview was grossly misrepresented and specific words were attributed to me which I had not used.  The Deputy will appreciate that I can accept responsibility only for what I said and not for what I am wrongly alleged to have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened on the radio programme was that, in the course of an interview about the Garda Crime Report, the interviewer brought up the question of public concern about rape and posed the question whether there ought to be more severe penalties for this crime.  I pointed out that the law already allowed the courts to impose life imprisonment and I then went on to refer to the need for young girls to take care in certain circumstances and particularly in the matter of whom they accepted lifts from when going home from dances or parties.  I made it clear that I was referring to some rapes and, even in those cases, what I said was that perhaps they <Col N="1255" /> would not have taken place if the girls concerned had been more careful.</P>
    <P>Caution in accepting lifts from strangers especially late at night is a matter of common sense about which I believe there would be general agreement. However, two women journalists, on separate occasions, accused me of saying that girls who are raped are asking for it.  I was also accused by one of the journalists of implying that girls must not dress attractively or perhaps even walk along the street at night.  I was accused of making excuses for the rapists.  I was not just accused in general terms of saying these things.  Specific words&mdash;placed within quotation marks&mdash;were attributed to me by both of these journalists.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that I have already publicly stated that the two newspaper articles were totally inaccurate in reporting my comments, I regret to say that neither of the journalists has seen fit to correct the misstatements made, let alone offer any apology.  It so happens that I have an accurate record of what I said in the course of the radio interview and I am having a copy of it placed in the Library of the House.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the continuous demand for additional gardaí he will (1) replace most of the 500 gardai now engaged on clerical duties with civilian employees; and (2) recall most, if not all, the extra gardaí assigned to Border duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the policy for a number of years to release gardai from office duties which can be satisfactorily performed by civilian staff and, since 1970, over 200 civilians have been assigned to clerical duties in Garda offices and stations throughout the country.  The Committee of Inquiry recently set up under the chairmanship of Professor W. J. L. Ryan will be considering the whole question of the extent to which types of work at present performed by members of the force could appropriately and with advantage be undertaken by civilians, and the way in which changes in this regard should be implemented.</P>

      <P>We are mutually affected. May I ask the Minister whether the report which appeared in various newspapers, as a result of his meetings in the not very recent dispute with the gardai and the negotiations with the Garda authorities, is correct in stating that all gardai engaged in clerical and similar duties would be replaced by civilians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the report issued on my <Col N="1258" /> behalf which dealt with the terms of reference of the Garda Siochana Committee of Inquiry.  Paragraph (c) of that report states that the committee will be considering reporting and making recommendations to me on the extent to which types of work at present performed by members of the force could appropriately and with advantage be undertaken by civilians and the way in which changes in this regard should be implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish that report, which does not seem to have been accurate, was actually accurate.  May I ask the Minister is it not patiently obvious, considering the problem of trying to find anything up to 500 additional gardai for normal police duties, that all members of the force now engaged on clerical duties should be replaced by civilians who would be quite capable of doing the work and, secondly, I seem to recollect a report, perhaps also inaccurate, which would seem to indicate that all gardai engaged on mechanical duties should also be replaced by civilians.  That, too, would make extra gardai available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the second report to which the Deputy refers because I have not seen it.  I am not responsible for it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

In regard to the recall of personnel now engaged on what is called Border duty, might I ask the Minister is it not as a result of <Col N="1259" /> Government policy that replacement of these additional gardaí took place, and his answer to the effect that the movement of personnel is a matter more or less for the internal administration of the gardai is neither accurate nor correct, and would he not consider there are at least 1,000 gardai who could be brought immediately into areas where they are much needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice, is the practice and will, I hope, continue to be the practice that the number of gardai assigned to particular areas is primarily the responsibility of the Garda authorities.  They review the needs of different areas from time to time.  They are the professionals in this matter and I would think they are the people best suited for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Murphy, since its inception the Garda Síochána has been an unarmed force and down the years the policy has been that it remains an unarmed force.  There have been occasions in the past when, <Col N="1262" /> because of upsurges of armed violence in the State, calls have been made for the arming of the police.  The Garda Siochana themselves have always staunchly maintained that they stay unarmed. The arming of the gardai to meet the challenge posed by armed criminal elements will not stop criminals from using firearms, a fact that is evident in other jurisdictions where the police are armed.</P>
      <P>Arming the police could well produce situations in which inevitably shoot-outs would escalate and possibly innocent civilians would be killed.  Moreover, an armed police force could have a serious adverse affect on the Garda role as a community service and on the capacity of the Garda Siochana to act as guardians of the peace.  The significant rise in armed robberies that has featured in the crime statistics in recent years is the reason given for arming the Garda. Serious though the situation is, it is not of the proportions that would call for such a drastic revision of policy.  Certain members of the Garda who are assigned to specific duties and who operate in plain clothes carry arms.  This has always been the position.  The number of men in the Detective Branch is being considerably increased at present and these members can be armed when assigned to particular duties.  Additionally the Garda authorities can and do call on support from the Army in situations where they require armed support.</P>

We must assume that the raids were 98.14 per cent successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Prosecutions cannot be brought for non-payment of ground rent or any other civil debt.  I assume therefore that the Deputy is referring to civil actions, but the position is that the statistical records kept in court offices do not, as a practical matter, enable civil actions related specifically to ground rents to be distinguished from other actions. For one thing, a decision as to whether a particular rent should or should not be described as a ground rent would involve an assessment of the terms of the particular lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can of course, in relation to any civil debt, be a question of a deliberate refusal to obey a court order for payment and, in case of such a refusal, a court may commit the person to prison for such refusal though only after examining <Col N="1266" /> the person as to his means and on being satisfied that he is able to pay the debt.</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1977, which provides a special procedure to enable ground rent tenants of dwellinghouses to acquire the fee simple, also took away the landlord's right to obtain possession of a dwellinghouse, under the terms of the lease, for non-payment of ground rent.

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the percentage of women in the years 1960, 1970 and the most recent date, who served on coroners' juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The summoning of coroners' juries is carried out in accordance with the law as laid down in the Coroners Act, 1962. In brief, the position is that when a jury is required for an inquest it must be assembled by the Garda and consist of not less than six and not more than 12 qualified persons.  Persons qualified to act on a coroner's jury are those between the ages of 18 years and 65 years residing in the coroner's district. Jurors are selected by the Garda from business firms, offices, public houses and other employments and include both employers and employees.</P>
      <P>There are no records in my Department from which the statistics sought by the Deputy could be compiled and I am informed that in general such records are not maintained by the Garda Síochána or in coroners' offices.  In the Dublin Metropolitan area the Garda have certain records which, however, go back only as far as 1971.  From an analysis of those records the Garda say that in 1972 about 6 per cent of those who served on coroners' juries in Dublin city were women, while the corresponding figure for 1977 was approximately 27 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that we should give consideration to changing these rules?  There appears to be the possibility of abuse, as, for instance, in the Aidan White case, where the Garda had a vested interest in getting a particular verdict.</P>
      <P>Is it not correct that a coroner's jury should be chosen by some demonstrably independent authority other than by people who from time to time will have a vested interest in a particular decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the <Col N="1270" /> implication against the Garda in the first part of the Deputy's supplementary. With regard to the second part, if the Deputy took a little time to reflect on the situation he would appreciate that there is no other way in which it would be practical for the Garda to assemble a jury, bearing in mind that in the general run of cases the task must be carried out at short notice&mdash;48 hours or less.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the amount of notice given is not in the control of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>From the figures given about the female content of juries, 6 per cent and 27 per cent, would the Minister not accept that there is discrimination of a particular kind and that this kind of discrimination could also apply to a more important one, that of obtaining a decision they want?  There must be some alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw the statistics I quoted I made further inquries about the percentages and I was informed that the Garda take as jurors people whom employers will release to them.  I am assured that there is no attempt on the part of the Garda to prevent women acting as jurors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister would be so assured but does he agree that there is a practice in the ordinary courts of taking people in succession from a register?  Can that be done in the case of coroners' courts rather than in a completely haphazard way as at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that in the selection of a jury for an inquest a limited amount of time is available to the Garda sergeant given the job of getting jurors compared with the generous amount of time available to county registrars to get juries ready in the normal sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain his reference that the controlling factor is the release of people by employers?  Why should members of coroners' juries be employees?  If that is the practice and as there are more male <Col N="1271" /> than female employees there would be this bias but why should the practice exist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill scheduled territories are now redefined. Until this Bill is enacted the scheduled territories would have been all the territories except the United Kingdom and <Col N="1381" /> Gibraltar and some other territories.  We were seeking to ascertain from the Minister of State on the last day what would happen in the event of a decision being taken by the United Kingdom to remain outside the EMS on 4 December while Ireland decided to go in.  What would be the position then in regard to flows of money, particularly sterling notes, between then and any future date one could mention?  Have the Government contingency plans to deal with that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In substance my query is much the same.  This is in fact the point we had reached on the last day on Second Stage and we had asked the Minister whether he could inform the House of the fate that would await the British notes in circulation here in the event of Britain's not joining the EMS after 1 January.  There has been a very close currency relationship between Britain and Ireland existing over many years.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was discussed before in the House it was a purely enabling measure.  On this occasion there is the prospect of its powers being invoked.  In those circumstances we do not think it presumptuous on our part to ask the Minister to give us an assessment of the practical implications of a change in the parity relationship between our currency and the British since it is a very likely event in the near future.  We agreed on the last day to break off until the Minister had considered this question.  I invite him now to give us some answer to that rather fundamental question which is at the heart of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised last week and I referred to it in my speech.  The explanatory memorandum covers the question now raised. However, in order to be as helpful as possible to the Deputies on this matter I will make a comment on the matters raised.  It would be useful in dealing with sections 4 and 5 of the Bill to refer again briefly to what exchange control is about.  The purpose of exchange control is essentially to protect the exchange rate of the currency and the official external <Col N="1382" /> reserves.  I believe the Deputies are fully aware of this.</P>
      <P>Controls are directed at capital transactions. Current transactions, such as trade, travel and general current transfers are not restricted but they are supervised to ensure that they are not used to move capital in an unauthorised way.  Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill deal with the importation and exportation of currency notes and can be taken as complimenting the powers contained in the Exchange Control Act, 1954, generally, the powers which the Minister would be enabled to use under section 3.  It is inherent in any system of capital controls that the power at least should be available to regulate the use of currency notes for international transactions hence, sections 4 and 5 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It would not follow that the importation and exportation of notes would be prohibited.  I believe Deputy Barry was interested in that point last week.  The exact measure that may be required would have to be settled in the light of developments which I cannot forecast at the moment. Similarly, bank notes of Irish residents abroad and of non-residents in Irish banks would have to be controlled but it does not follow that the holding of such accounts in a post-break situation would be prohibited.  The introduction of exchange control on UK transactions would not mean that sterling notes would be inconvertible here or that Irish notes would be inconvertible in the UK. They might still be circulated to some extent in the respective areas.  Of course, given the exchange rate for the two currencies might well be varying in that situation, the degree to which they would circulate would almost certainly decline. However, this result would not arise directly from the imposition of exchange controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that many of the issues raised especially by Deputy Barry and Deputy O'Leary relate to exchange rates questions and EMS and not directly to exchange control.  I want to make this point very clear because we cannot go into the matter of the EMS.  This Bill is an exchange control Bill.  However, I will try to give some indication of the factors relevant to the particular issues raised. That is as far as I can go at this stage.  I <Col N="1383" /> am sure the Deputies will appreciate that I cannot go into the area of the EMS. The Bill is more or less preparing for all eventualities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to say that the Chair ruled that a debate on the EMS could not take place.  The points we are trying to raise do not relate to the EMS but to very practical problems that will arise if, as a result of our joining the EMS and Britain do not join, sections of his Bill have to be implemented.  Those are the points we have been raising.  I raised a point which the Minister of State has not answered, I understand at the moment that there is an effective exchange control in operation without this Bill because the Central Bank, as I pointed out the last day, are not allowing the forward buying of sterling to business people here whose normal way of trading is to get goods on credit and pay for them in three, six or nine months' time, or whatever period they have agreed to.  When dealing outside sterling areas in Beigian francs or German marks that would necessitate getting a rate today which would be applicable next May, June or whenever it might be to the particular trader concerned <Col N="1384" /> so that he knows his competitive position today because he will pay next May or June at the rate agreed today. unfortunately, this is not happening now with sterling.  Even though the 99 per cent certainty is that they will be on a one-for-one basis in the New Year this is causing some disruption in trade at the moment because the traders find it impossible to buy forward sterling.  They can buy forward in other currencies but not sterling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time this debate ran last Thursday I drew attention to the very short speech of the Minister of State.  He devoted only two lines to how exactly the Industrial Development Authority expected to absorb a further £350 million in the next three years and I pointed out that that sum is almost equivalent to the total amount of grants that the authority have paid out since their establishment 20 years ago.  It hardly needs to be said that everyone on this side of the House will support, encourage and praise the authority for their good work, but I should have expected more than a couple of lines on what major developments they foresaw which would require this enhanced rate of expenditure.  I should have liked a few words about the reasons which led the authority to seek an increase to £1,125,000 in the amount of a grant that they will be entitled to make without going to the Government for approval.  I am sure the reasons are good but I should like to have heard more about them.</P>
      <P>I should like to dwell in some detail on the authority's task in general, about some of the obstacles with which they have to contend and about the place which industrial development&mdash;for which the authority are the main vehicle&mdash;plays in the development of our economy.  In their last report and in one of their recent publications dated April 1978, Volume 4, No. 8, the authority pointed out how heavy our dependence is and must remain on foreign investment.  In April the authority said:</P>
      <P> Without a consistent flow of projects from abroad we would have no prospect of attaining our national job creation targets and implementing our programme for regional industrial development. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time it must be said that, quite rightly, the IDA have adopted the policy of trying to reduce this <Col N="1387" /> dependence on foreign-based industry and of trying to increase the ratio of industrial investment from Irish sources. That is a wise policy, for reasons which I am sure are the same as those of the authority.  Worthwhile foreign investments which do not require us to contribute too much as regards the environment or some other loss that another country would not be prepared to suffer are becoming increasingly hard to get. Foreign competition, even from rich countries, is becoming more intense each month; and while it might have been possible when we were outside the EEC to match that with more intensified incentives, obviously there is a limit to our freedom now to adjust or to improve incentives. As the Minister knows, it is likely that our entire incentive structure will be increasingly under EEC control and will be geared decreasingly to the special needs of the Irish economy.  For those reasons the IDA are quite right to match it with efforts at home and always to maximise Irish participation in industrial development.</P>
    <P>I should like to say here in parenthesis that the frequent prejudice I hear voiced against multinationals is very misplaced in the Irish setting.  The facts which the IDA have circulated make it clear that multinationals in the ordinary sense of the word do not really play much part in our industrial scene, and what part they play is very heavily export-oriented.  The IDA have made this point very clear. The moment any foreign-based company comes here, even if it only has one other settlement, it is a multinational because of that very fact.</P>
    <P>Early this year the IDA published a Study on a Profile of Grant-Aided Industry in Ireland by Dermot McAleese. In a section that summarised the findings of the study it was pointed out that the substantial volume of trade between overseas firms and their parent affiliated companies also reflect to a certain extent the high degree of multinationality of many of the firms.  The multinationals with their marketing and personnel links and their knowledge of market conditions in other countries are able to export an above average proportion of what they produce.  That is an advantage <Col N="1388" /> to us but I do not hear it mentioned in the occasional condemnatory discussions of multinational companies.</P>
    <P>The IDA are trying to diversify investment. In the last year for which they have reported they succeeded in increasing the Irish share of new industry to more than 50 per cent.  That is a substantial achievement.  But it appears that the inherently vulnerable nature of industry is even more vulnerable in the case of some foreign-based industry who may be impelled, by factors that do not entirely arise in this country but in places over which we have no control, to curtail their operations here.  The disastrous effects that this can have on a region or country were exemplified this time last year.  The single act of the closure of the Ferenka plant meant that that entire region reported a net loss in industrial employment for the year.  That single closure meant that the efforts, so far as they were to be evaluated regionally, of the IDA and of everybody involved in industrial development had been put back.  The number of jobs involved was so enormous it exceeded the net job creation.</P>
    <P>The confidence of the IDA in their 1978 targets, which are ambitious, appears to be related to new job creation and not to a net increase in industrial employment.  The Taoiseach made a speech a few weeks ago and I tried to have a crack at it a couple of times but no one took much notice.  He seemed to be imparting an extraordinary piece of wisdom.  He said that failure to reach industrial employment targets this year would be due to redundancies.  An industrial programme must take account of potential redundancies as well as the creation of new jobs.  You might as well say that a failure to reach inflation targets is due to continuing high prices or that a failure to lower unemployment rates is due to a shortage of jobs.  To say that the failure to reach employment targets is due to redundancies is only telling us in a different language that they have failed.</P>
    <P>Between June 1977 and June 1978&mdash;the June 1978 figures have not yet been printed but it is possible to extract them in a rough form from a written <Col N="1389" /> answer given last week by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development&mdash;manufacturing industrial employment seems to have risen by only 3,300 jobs.  Conveniently enough, June 1977 was the last quarter for which details were available before the change of Government.  By this time tomorrow we will probably have the printed figures from the Statistics Office.  This is a small increase in industrial employment.  In the same answer the Minister for Economic Planning and Development gave figures for job creation in the public sector, in other words, for the installation of young men and women at desks.  He said that public service jobs increased by nearly two-and-a-half times that volume, by 10,700.  Many people have computed that it takes four jobs in industry or agriculture to sustain the drain on an economy represented by one public sector job.  In a year in which an incoming Government were going to fulfil their promise of producing tens of thousands of secure jobs in natural resources and of reducing unemployment in 18 months by 25,000, we have the situation that they have made only one conspicuous inroad by creating 10,700 jobs, not one of which will make an extra blade of grass grow or produce so much as a matchbox.</P>
    <P>Against that, the industrial growth for which the foundations were laid before the change of Government has succeeded, notwithstanding the efforts of a Government dedicated to increasing job creation in producing less than 3,500 new jobs in 12 months.</P>
    <P>That is another slightly negative feature of the industrial development scene and one which must worry the IDA a great deal.  I am sure that they sometimes find, as they did during the recession, that they had to run very hard in job creation just to stand still in the overall industrial employment picture. That is hard on them but it makes me wonder whether our structures in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy or anywhere else in the public service are sufficiently effective in keeping an eye on the exigencies of existing industry.  I doubt that they are.</P>
    <P>I cannot find any fault with the operations of the IDA and I am known to be <Col N="1390" /> fair when I point at any fault in the way in which the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy arrange their watchdog functions in regard to existing industry.  Since a job in an old factory is as good as a job in a new one, we ought to have the same kind of attention, inventiveness, innovative talent and beneficial public relations put into the business of trying to guard against redundancies, which the Taoiseach thinks are an excuse for our failure to reach job creation targets.  We should have an authority which puts at least that much effort into that aspect of industrial life as the effort which is put by the IDA into the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>These are qualifications on the IDA's overall point of view because they have only got one partial brief in this situation, which no doubt is a happy one for them and one which they can be congratulated. When put into perspective it somewhat qualifies it.</P>
    <P>Some initiatives of the incoming Government which were ostensibly aimed at seconding the efforts of the IDA, turned out 18 months later to have been merely electoral ploys which were not seriously meant to work in a grownup world.  The simplest and most evident example is the Employment Action Team which as recently as October and November last year was still being described by the Minister for Labour as the most important measure so far introduced in the field of youth employment and as the most important measure so far introduced in the area of job creation. These speeches were delivered by the Minister for Labour on 7 October and 25 November respectively.  The situation in regard to the Employment Action Team is that the Opposition have grown almost ashamed to ask about it for fear of embarrassing the Minister on his rare appearances in the responsibility to which he was appointed.  It is a long time since anyone heard much about it. Once it is admitted that it was only an election stunt no more scares will be heard about it from this side of the House.  It was not seriously intended to produce anything worthwhile and has now been quietly forgotten.</P>
    <P>The Sean Lemass-type industrial consortium was the subject of a question to <Col N="1391" /> which a written answer was given a week ago.  It turns out that this consortium&mdash;I have complained before about the name of Seán Lemass being attached to such a twopence-halfpenny institution&mdash;met on three occasions between January and March.  They had another meeting in June and another in July.  From that day to this they have not held another meeting.  It might not matter if this were a body with a staff and a permanent on-going existence but from questions I put down on this matter, the Industrial Development Consortium is only a name.  They have no office, no premises, no staff, no budget, no resources and no equipment.  They do not have as much as an office cat.  That is the Seán Lemass-type weapon which was going to swing into action as soon as the new Government were formed, to second the IDA to put Irish industry back into the situation which only the Coalition's malice and incompetence had deprived it of.  I unashamedly describe the Seán Lemass-type Industrial Development Consortium who manage their highly important work without so much as an office cat and without holding a meeting for four months, as an electoral ploy and nothing more.  As soon as that has been frankly admitted I will lay off the subject of the Industrial Development Consortium, but until that moment comes I propose to keep on saying it.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority are not expected by this Government, any more than they were by the last Government, to carry the entire weight of industrial development here. Both Governments would have been glad, although I do not think our appeals were ever quite as shrill and as anguished as this Government's, if the efforts of the IDA had been, in effect, backed up by the efforts of the private sector.  A very curious dialogue could have been observed earlier this year between the Government and the private sector in this regard.  Around 1 June you could have heard the two sides chiming at each other like church bells across the city.  The Government side said: &ldquo;We did all we could for you.  You have nothing <Col N="1392" /> more to complain about.  The wealth tax has been removed.  Your incentives are clear to see.  Your profits are safe.  Go ahead and create jobs&rdquo;.  The private sector retorted: &ldquo;We cannot create jobs unless we can be sure that our profits are absolutely secure.  It is not just a matter of this and that fiscal manoeuvre or manipulation which can be set at naught in the next budget.  It is a matter of giving us even more&rdquo;.  I do not intend holding up the House by documenting that statement because I am sure the Chair would not like me to be citing Minister and princes of industry against one another.  You may take my word for it that I could easily document this little dialogue which went on for a couple of weeks in the summer and is still going on to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>There was a kind of response from the private sector&mdash;I do not mean to belittle any effort made, even though I have to, to put the dimensions in perspective but I do not propose to sit back and be overawed by it just because it is something for the good rather than something for the bad&mdash;which was supposed to go some distance towards making up the ground the IDA could not make up.  The consortium is described as being equipped with a six-figure budget. I do not despise six figures; I do not even despite three figures, but a six-figure budget is not serious material for making inroads into industrial development or job creation.  Six figures could be as little as £100,000.  I assume it will be higher than that.  I want to put that kind of figure into perspective.  I admit I am taking an extreme example.  I have no doubt that £100,000 would go a long way towards saving a couple of relatively small enterprises in temporary difficulties but it would not go very far to keep them on their feet permanently.  It was envisaged that the smelter could cost £100 million at present prices and that it would employ about 500 people.  I remember the Minister saying that it would be wrong to run away with an inflated idea of the employment potential of the smelter because its employment content is known to be limited.  That, of course, is not the only factor in a project like the building of a smelter.  There are many other factors involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> I am in favour of the smelter being built if it can be done economically irrespective of the relatively poor return on capital in terms of cost per job.  If we look at it from that aspect and get into perspective this six-figure budget with which the private sector are responding to all the Christmas presents the Government have given them, it works out at £200,000 per job.  In other words, each man working in that smelter, if and when it is built, will be standing in front of £200,000 worth of capital investment. I mention that figure to put this matter into perspective, in case anyone runs away with the idea that the private sector are breaking their necks to help the Fianna Fáil Government because I must say with all politeness and respect that their response is not much more than a token response.</P>
    <P>I think it very naive of a Government to suppose that businessmen who may be rolling in apparent wealth one day but who could have the backsides out of their trousers the next are out of mere altruism going to put significant sums, which they could use to develop their own businesses, into businesses of which they understand nothing, merely to please a Government for abolishing a taxation measure which they thought should never have been introduced.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the industrial development scene here is the relative lameness&mdash;I do not call it a culpable lameness because it would have been naïve to expect much more&mdash;of the response from the private sector in regard to job creation.  Even the IDA have pointed out that the private sector have been very slow in coming forward with industrial investment probably because they got a fright during the recession and have to make up lost ground, build up reserves and so on. That is another unfortunate factor against the background of which the IDA's task must be viewed.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the very poor ratio which the productive side of the job creation programme&mdash;if it can be called a programme&mdash;bears to the number of unproductive jobs created.  I rely on the authority of the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy Ray Burke, in a speech <Col N="1394" /> which he made on 10 March this year. In passing, let me pay tribute to the Minister in regard to his indefatigable efforts in the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  There is hardly a day when I do not receive a script from the Minister and that means he has been out somewhere trying to persuade people to buy Irish.  It was another electoral ploy of the Government to suppose that they could guarantee a switch of 3 per cent in money spent on consumer goods to home produced goods.  At the same time, I sympathise with and admire the man who has been given the awful job of trying to make that programme stick.  He works very hard at it and I am glad to have the opportunity to say so.  During his speech in Waterford the Minister of State said:</P>
    <P> As we are all aware, the Government is committed to creating new jobs at a greatly increased pace.  This is our first priority.  However, creating jobs is not enough to stimulate and maintain economic growth.  These jobs must be productive. </P>
    <P>I draw attention to this part of the Minister's speech in order to underline the very disappointing record when the recession is over and industrial recovery has been going on since late 1975 or early 1976, according to the IDA and the CII.  It is disappointing that in an entire year this fairly disappointing growth in industrial jobs has to be measured against a growth in unproductive jobs between two and three times that size.</P>
    <P>Industrial development and the maintenance of existing industrial employment have been dealt a blow by the Government's failure to combat real threats to existing industry.  Part of that failure is attributable to neglect.  Every real threat to existing industry makes heavier the load which the IDA are expected to carry.  If a branch of industry folds up or loses half its manpower because of competition from abroad, the IDA are expected to make up the loss by enhanced targets in their next programme. We are putting too much on an authority of this kind.</P>
    <P>The British temporary employment subsidy alone was reckoned by the CII to have cost between 3,000 and 3,500 <Col N="1395" /> jobs in the clothing and footwear sectors. Those sectors&mdash;which are not very different from many other sectors&mdash;are in panic at the prospect of this country being part of the EMS while the British remain outside it if the consequence of that is that the Irish £ floats up in relation to the British £.  These sectors have been weakened by events during the past few years and I understand they feel this will polish them off altogether.</P>
    <P>That does not conclude the debate on the EMS which has other features we debated here and, no doubt, will debate again.  During the debate here I would have liked the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to say something about these matters on the ground.  What would happen to these sectors if we were in the EMS and Britain were not in it? Necessarily the currencies would be divided and the British £ might, through a devaluation of their own, float down <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish £.  I would have wished the debate to include material on such matters from any of the Ministers.</P>
    <P>The British temporary employment subsidy did damage in traditional industries which are labour-intensive where the wage cost differential is particularly severely felt in the price at which Irish firms are able to sell their goods.  Other parts of our industrial arm have also been damaged by heavy and sometimes unfair competition from low-cost countries.  I realise that protection of Irish manufacturers against imports from low-cost countries is not something which is carried out in Dublin, but some explanation must be forthcoming from the Government as to how it is that jobs are being lost in other areas where we were told 18 months ago jobs were waiting to be created, namely, the area of natural resources.  Two recent instances are the leather and timber industries. Both of these are under threat from competing imports which are too cheap.  These are both natural resources of the textbook kind; they are old-fashioned, traditional natural resources of the kind we learned about at school. They are not glamorous, trendy natural resources like zinc or natural gas but <Col N="1396" /> they are nonetheless natural resources. The leather industry is labour-intensive. It must be said that there has been some neglect when these industries have been so badly hit.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another matter which is not specifically related to the IDA, though it very quickly will be if the desired result is achieved.  I refer to the long-term exploitation of the Irish and adjacent sea bed.  Technology has not reached the point where it is possible to exploit economically the mineral deposits of the sea bed but there is no doubt that technology will, within measurable time, reach the point where it will be possible to mine at depths which previously could scarcely be reached, let alone exploited.  Potentially we are in a very favourable situation. We have a long Atlantic coastline and a large Continental Shelf.  The only difficulty lies in the extent of that Continental Shelf.  Here we are talking about a potential area for exploitation of immense size, possibly much bigger than the size of the country itself.  That area is in dispute with the British because of various unsettled matters, mainly concerning the status of Rockall and whether Rockall can generate a territorial status of its own.  That matter was the subject of negotiations with the British during the term of the Coalition Government and the intention was to submit the matter to arbitration in order to have the Continental Shelf divided between us.  I was involved in this for the few weeks in which I held the Office of Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understood it, 18 months ago we had agreed what court, or what tribunal, or what instance would decide this arbitration between us. Nothing seems to have happened.  I understood from a question the Taoiseach <Col N="1397" /> answered a few months ago that something happened which has thrown the operation into reverse.  I do not know what urgency there is on the Minister's part.  I know his Department have some involvement in this matter because I remembered going to meetings with them.  I urge the Minister to get a move on because, for reasons I will not go into here, we are, I think, at a favourable conjuncture for the judgment of this matter.  The time might not be so favourable two, three or four years from now.  It may easily be that that is the very possibility upon which the other parties to the arbitration are calculating if there is any element&mdash;and I do not allege this because I do not know what the situation is&mdash;of heel dragging.</P>
      <P>The relevance of that to the position of the IDA is that this will require an immense investment of capital if we are even to exploit this sea bed.  We should be working on that now.  I have here a cutting from the German paper <i>Die Welt</i> of 4 October last.  I do not think the Germans have a Continental Shelf in any real sense.  If you were to draw a median line between themselves and their neighbours, it would go scarcely any distance into the North Sea or the Baltic.  They have their eyes so closely on the ball of this Continental Shelf matter, and particularly the exploitation of the deep sea beyond the Continental Shelf in which all nations will have rights&mdash;although the particular regime for exploiting those rights, regulating them and distributing them has not yet been agreed&mdash;that they are already drafting legislation which will entitle them unilaterally to exploit areas not in their own little bit of water in the Baltic and the North Sea but in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>During a speech on industrial development I want to mention what everybody knows will be a major element of industrial work in the next century, that is, deep sea exploitation.  I should like to know how much work has been done on that by the Government, or by the Department, either technically or legally.  I have not seen any evidence that anything has been done since we left office.  I do not mean to say I know nothing has been done.  It may be that something has been done.  We have no time to waste.  I mentioned that matter about the Germans to show how far ahead of the game other people can be. They are drafting legislation which will give them unilateral rights.  I tried to discover what that legislation is and I have not been able to do so.  It is rather like trying to find out something about a Bill in draft here.  It has not yet been made public, but it is aimed at giving them unilateral rights in their own law&mdash;and that is as good as an international law for so long as there is not an international regime&mdash;to exploit the deep sea perhaps thousands of miles away from themselves.  We should not sit back and be too &ldquo;little Irelandish&rdquo; in this connection. We should have at least the rudiments of a legal and technical structure and an educational structure for doing the same thing when the time comes.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to the constraints on industrial expansion which the IDA have repeatedly identified and which the Confederation of Irish Industry have also identified.  One is the prejudicial position in regard to wage competitiveness. I think it was the Minister who said the other day one of the reasons for the Government's failure to achieve job targets was the excessive wage drift.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>These are obstacles to industrial expansion which the authority to whom we are giving £350 million have identified.  I will not flog the horse to death.  The loss of wage competitiveness, or the loss of the edge which we once had <i>vis-à-vis</i> British industry <Col N="1399" /> in wage costs, must have damaged what ought to be national targets in regard to job creation which would be a job for every man and woman who want one.  I do not give a hoot about Fianna Fáil's targets.  I want to say in passing that one of the reasons&mdash;in my opinion the main reason&mdash;for the upward wage drift was the Government's failure to achieve the 5 per cent which we agreed was a reasonable limit.  The Government's failure even to get the higher figure stuck to was directly contributed to by the Government's own fiscal and social policies.  They could not expect moderation from people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is also important to keep a social balance which will mean that cost effectiveness is not achieved at somebody's expense, and that no section of the population feel they have to carry it on their backs, that it is out of their flesh and blood that competitive edge is being carved.  By their fiscal policies on 1 February last, or whatever date it was, the Government destroyed any hope that people would take them at their word in this regard.  They threw away the confidence the National Coalition Government had built up.</P>

      <P>In their nicely printed little annual report for 1977 the IDA said&mdash;and this is the report covering the period up to 31 December last&mdash;the growth of the economy in recent times reflects the greater moderation shown in income increases over the past two years; in other words in 1976 and 1977 national wage agreements negotiated by the effort and sweat of the Government I worked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case anyone might think the National Coalition have a fifth columnist in the IDA who is able to get access to the chairman's report and write sentences into it which he did not intend, let me quote from a statement by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, in a bulletin issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs on 1 March in which he attributes the resumption of industrial growth partly to the rate of increase in world import prices and partly to the recent strength of sterling.  He said that it is also the fruitful outcome of the income restraint achieved in 1977.  I do not wish to bang the drum about that since one of my own political adversaries had the grace to admit it as he has had the grace to admit so much else but I shall be expecting a continuing stream of revelations from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  I shall not attempt to make fun of him, but who achieved that restraint?  Who set the tone for the growth and expansion which both the Minister and the IDA now certify <Col N="1401" /> as having begun and taken root long before this Government were heard of? The CII, in which also I am not aware of our having any fifth columnist, say that since the trough of the international recession was reached in the autumn of 1975, Irish industry had maintained an expansion rate close to 10 per cent per annum.  In their newsletter of 26 September they attribute a large part of that development to the moderation of the wage increases that were negotiated during the past couple of years but not including, of course, the 1978 agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be regarded as the prophet of doom but the signs at the moment are not good.  What looks like being an even worse failure next year is attributable directly to the fiscal and social policies which broadly speaking amount to telling the industrial worker that he is expected to carry the can for people who are not only ten times but perhaps 100 times better off than he.</P>
    <P>This party are regarded by some people, but regarded wrongly, as conservative. Admittedly, there were some who were not in favour of the wealth tax and some who were not in favour of taxing farmers but I do not know of any one in this party who would have agreed with a budget of the type that was introduced here this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to conclude my contribution by offering to the House a few of my own views, some of which will not be new, in regard to what I think would be useful policies for achieving industrial expansion.  My remarks will not be contentious politically but will be related closely to the job that has been given to the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the IDA are correct in their policy of trying to diminish their total dependence on the attraction of vulnerable large-scale industries and in concentrating more on industrial organic growth, especially within the smaller <Col N="1402" /> enterprises, from within the four corners of our human resources and material. Instead of aiming for large and spectacular overnight development which can make big headlines, which a Minister can open four or five times by inviting the art editors of the papers to send along their photographers four or five times, we should be laying the groundwork for building up an industrially-minded people.  At school we learned that the reason for the North of Ireland being ahead of us industrially, as it was in those days, was that the people there, many of whom were migrants in the first instance, had an industrial tradition. We all learned about the parts of Ireland to which exotic people&mdash;they were not exotic in terms of more prosperous countries&mdash;came and set up industry such as the Huguenots who came to Portarlington and set up industries of a kind never heard of in Ireland up to then.  These people had an industrial tradition, too.</P>
    <P>Our aim should be to develop, not overnight obviously, but during a period of five, ten or even 15 years, an understanding among the ordinary people of what industry is about.  This was a subject that I was not taught anything about at school.  At one time there was among the Irish the foolish kind of assumption, especially among middle-class society, that there was something second-rate about working on a factory floor.  When such ideas are put into one's mind at an early age, it is difficult to rid oneself of them.  The IDA point out that such an attitude is surprising since there are more people working in industry than in any other sector of the economy.  The reason given by the IDA for this attitude is that Irish people have not been engaged long enough in industry to rid themselves of these ideas and also that the people who think in this way had parents who learned quite a different set of values.  We should be aiming at developing an industrial tradition.  We must endeavour to find talent for industrial enterprise and we must be prepared to release that talent when we find it.</P>
    <P>During the past couple of weeks my attention was drawn to two chief executives of very well-known State <Col N="1403" /> enterprises, one in the manufacturing business and the other not in that business but both of which are extremely productive national enterprises with very good employment records.  Both these chief executives started life as civil servants and remained in the civil service for some part of their working lives. There may be other people in the public service who, if granted extended sabbatical leave, would be prepared to become involved in industry.  When I put this suggestion of sabbatical leave to the Minister for Public Service at Question Time, he seemed to regard it favourably. There may be people in the Civil Service who have always had a bent for industry but who found themselves in the public service because of the assumption that the white-collar-job was preferable to a job in which one's hands became soiled. If there are such people in the public service they may be afraid to take the risk of leaving their jobs and that is why I was suggesting to the Minister for the Public Service that he explore the possibility of an extended scheme of leave whereby the people concerned could be assured of being able to resume their public service positions if they so wished.  Although such people might have every wish to throw themselves on the industrial wave and might even qualify for the first time entrepreneurial grant system which the IDA have instituted and which looks like being so successful, they would be reluctant to risk secure employment, pension rights and so on, especially if they were no longer in their twenties but with the assurance of being able to resume their Civil Service jobs, I am sure they could be lured into industry.  I suspect that the public service is a reservoir of talent.  For decades the cream of school leavers entered the Civil Service though I am sure there are people there in the vigour either of youth or of middle age who if given some encouragement would take a chance in industry or in the area of commerce, for instance, in marketing.  We depend to a large extent on the occasional individual who has a gift or a flair for enterprise and that is why we would be foolish to neglect any such talent.  When I raised the matter of sabbatical <Col N="1404" /> leave with the Minister for the Public Service he said that although he would not devise a scheme as such he would receive applications sympathetically.</P>
    <P>A scheme, of which public servants would be appraised would be a more effective way of achieving what I am suggesting.  I said in a speech a few weeks ago&mdash;unfortunately it was a speech in which I said something about neutrality with the result that everything else in the speech got buried&mdash;that, although I value the voluntary element in education as much as anybody, there would be a strong case here, because of our special situation, because of the national need which everybody recognises, to include as a compulsory subject, not for examination purposes&mdash;I know that once you do not examine a subject the compulsion element does not seem so compelling&mdash;nonetheless to include in respect of anyone receiving a State grant or State assistance in any shape or form, in other words, pupils in all schools whether publicly or privately owned, training, which they would have to attend compulsorily, in the rudiments of industrial and of agricultural science and technology.</P>

      <P>I am trying to give the IDA a leg-up.  One of the things they need, which they have said themselves repeatedly, is a better predisposition of people, particularly young people, to industrial enterprise, techniques and skills. However, I shall not labour the point. What I had in mind was that a course could be devised.  Of course, it would require the best possible efforts from <Col N="1405" /> educators to make it palatable&mdash;I could not begin to devise it myself and I do not know anyone who could but I am sure it could be devised&mdash;and suitable for, say, 12 to 16 year olds of both sexes irrespective of whether they were in State or privately-supported schools.  Something like that would be perhaps unthinkable in England, but that argument is the least and last one that would weigh with me.</P>
      <P>I am sick complaining for the last ten years since I started in politics about the way everybody looks over their shoulders at what England is doing.  Just because the English do not put a course of this kind on a curriculum is absolutely no reason for us not to do so, though I have not the least doubt that if the English did it we would be setting up interdepartmental committees to consider the same thing again within a year.  That has been the pattern here since the State was founded but it has been particularly bad under the Minister's party.  They are absolutely enslaved to the English, body and soul.  The Minister is laughing.  I remember him, when I was in the Seanad, bringing in a Bill into which he had copied a penalty, already 11 years out of date, word for word from an English statute.</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, you have voiced very trenchantly and briefly one of the points I was trying to get at.  Since <Col N="1406" /> you have, Sir, I shall leave it because I do not think I could improve on the way you put it.</P>
      <P>The second last thing I wanted to say in this regard bears on the psychological barrier which exists between industry and agriculture.  I know the Chair will pull me up here in a moment and I shall not go very far along these lines.  But it is a distinction which is an unreal one.  The IDA have got a whole section or department involved in the processing of agricultural products.  Of course, looked at from another perspective it is a very arbitrary line to draw.  The county produces food.  The line which distinguishes, on secondary, technical criteria, between a bullock on the hoof and a can of lobster soup or something like that, which is a very highly processed value-added product, is a very arbitrary one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>By the way, in any shop I go into I find that nearly all the fish soups come from Norway, if they do not come from further afield.  As far as I know there is none available from Ireland.  If the Minister of State, Deputy R. Burke, can find time amidst his very hard schedule to do something about that he would be doing a good day's job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an unfortunate and arbitrary distinction.  I say this only to provoke some different thinking about this area.  I cannot really understand why it is that we have an Industrial Development Authority which will have absorbed&mdash;if it runs to the length of its chain, with the money we are now authorising be granted to them&mdash;three-quarters-of-a-billion pounds since its establishment on setting up new industry here.  There is no such authority, except to the extent of the IDA having a section involved in the food processing industry, which deals with overall development in the agricultural industry short of where the tin can stage starts, or where the wrap-ping and processing stage starts.  That is a matter that ought be looked at.  All economic development, all job creation, all wealth production are parts of a single organic process, or we ought to <Col N="1407" /> look at them that way.  Without asking the IDA to take on the impossible task of trying to encourage agriculture as well, it is right to say; here is the main national resource we have.  Some distinguished people, the Director of An Foras Talúntais, for one, people in the private sector&mdash;people like Father McDyer and General Costello, have said frequently that the agricultural sector alone would be capable, if properly ex-ploited, of solving our job problem. Therefore why is it that that sphere is not the subject of any authority which has the same kind of brief and the same kind of cutting edge as the Industrial Development Authority?  Or why cannot the brief of the Industrial Development Authority be widened&mdash;I hope I will not give them fits by saying this&mdash;so as to permit them to involve themselves in this closely related, only arbitrarily distinguished and equally important, arguably more important, branch of the economy?</P>
    <P>The third thing I want to say&mdash;and I will spend even less time on this because I have said it so often before&mdash;is that the industrial development scene, particularly now that the IDA are concentrating more on small industry and that they are so keen, and rightly so, on making industrial investment national as much as possible rather than foreign, would be improved if the people themselves could be given a localised and therefore identifiable responsibility, in manageable units, for their own economic future, for job creation, for prosperity within their own area.  As I have suggested here more than once before, I should like to see any Government&mdash;I made the suggestion in vain to my own Government&mdash;even if only as an experiment and if it does not work try something else, implement the identification of a certain number of pilot areas within which there would be created a structure like a co-operative, except that it would be a total co-operative; it would not be confined to agriculture but would be industrial as well.  By the way, this is a theme I find even Ministers coming round to these days.  I suppose, in their desperation for seeking solutions to <Col N="1408" /> overall problems they are willing to look even at the Opposition's script.</P>
    <P>These pilot localities, to which the entire population would have access, in which the whole population would be members, could be created.  Permanent teams of experts could be assigned permanently to these areas&mdash;they would live there permanently.  Such experts would be drawn from the IDA, Bord Fáilte, the IIRS and an Foras Talúntais. The job of such co-operatives would be to maximise the potential of particular localities in every respect, not just in production of buildings, not just in dairy produce or in lobbying Ministers to put factories there.  There are other aspects of this thing that perhaps I can go into in more detail on a more appropriate occasion. These are long term suggestions to try to dispose our population more favourably to the job we are trying to do.  The very last thing I want to do, and then I will ask your permission to sit down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to see the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, here because he cited a document some years ago in a debate on an IDA Bill which I now intend to cite.  I am about to refer briefly to the work of Dr. Kieran Kennedy, the Director of the ESRI, giving his impressions of a visit by him to Denmark in 1975.  He published it afterwards in, I think, the bulletin of the Central Bank.  He found in Denmark staggering contrasts in the policies and techniques which the Danes have used to try to achieve industrial prosperity and those which the Irish have been using since independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Kennedy noticed first of all the vast industrial transformation in Denmark. One hundred years ago the Danes had no industry any more than we had. In 1922 industry in this country consisted basically of a biscuit factory, a couple of boot factories and a couple of <Col N="1409" /> breweries.  Almost 60 years later the scene has changed completely, but it has changed even more radically in Denmark, but by quite different policies and techniques.  They did it by native enterprise and not by foreign enterprise. In the main, their entrepreneurs were very small scale, people who were in general fairly uneducated in the academic sense.</P>
    <P>Dr. Kennedy reported that such education as they have tended to be in the skilled trades.  They were generally working on the factory floor of an existing firm when they got an idea for a new product or process.  Innovation was the keynote of the new efforts by them. According to Dr. Kennedy, they succeeded by &ldquo;extremely hard work by the entrepreneur and his family while maintaining little more than a subsistence level of drawings from the business&rdquo; while ploughing in retained earnings. The entrepreneurs were essentially expert in production and all that goes with it, such as design, quality and technology.  He continued:</P>
    <P> They knew little about other aspects of business so frequently stressed in Ireland (such as finance, marketing, personnel, etc.). </P>
    <P>The tendency was to make the articles good enough to sell themselves.  Dr. Kennedy stated that a cardinal influence was the prestige attached in Danish education to the industrial arts.</P>
    <P>I could not have told when I was a schoolboy&mdash;I can barely tell it now&mdash;what the industrial arts are.  I think that is shameful.  I am proud to have learned this and that in school, but it would not have killed me to have spent an hour a week learning about the industrial arts, and it would not have killed the rest of the population to have done so or to do so today.  It would take the strain off the State in trying to create 10,500 desks for them to sit at.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of achievement which the Danes have had without any industrial development authority, with next to no foreign investment and without any highly prestigious state organisations to egg them on in the early days.  They did it by a set of skills and talents.  That is the kind of long term <Col N="1410" /> purpose I have been aiming at.  If we could produce the kind of situation which the Danes have produced out of a country which raised little more than pigs 100 years ago, we would be striking a far greater blow for even a national objective like Irish unity than all the speechifying, editorialising, the summoning up of Wolfe Tone, the flying of flags, talking about the national inheritance and so forth.  All that sort of thing is water off a duck's back to the Unionists.</P>
    <P>What impresses a Unionist is performance. Perhaps that is not true, but he likes to hear it said about him even if it is an exaggeration.  He likes to hear it said that he is efficient and it is one of his cardinal beliefs that the people of the South are not, or that they are backward.  Not a thing would impress him more than to find an industrial revolution here, conducted and achieved by ourselves somewhat along the lines I have been talking about.  When I hear talk like that of the Taoiseach in regard to the EMS, when he said we would have to watch carefully in case the divergence of our currency from the British would throw up yet another ditch or barrier between us and Northern Ireland, I like to give my own personal view&mdash;I have not consulted my party, I hope I am not embarrassing anyone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support the general intent of the Bill, namely to increase from £400 million to £750 million the limit of the grant expenditure of the IDA, and to increase from £850,000 to £1.25 million the limit on certain grants which the IDA may make to individual undertakings without prior Government approval.  I see in this a valuable extension of the work of the IDA, and as such we welcome it.  My party also support the proposal in the <Col N="1411" /> Bill to provide a widows' and children's pension scheme for IDA employees. This is only as it should be in a major State-sponsored body and we consider this legislative amendment to be entirely appropriate.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Bill gives us a restricted opportunity to comment on the IDA role generally.  Many of us had hopes in the middle of 1977 that measures introduced by the previous Government in the budget of 1977, which were enterprising enough, and the subsequent measures of this Government in the 1978 budget, would have an impact on the employment situation. Unfortunately the IDA are faced with a situation in which they must continue to cope with continuing unemployment at an exceptionally high level.  Even this week, as we vote further substantial funds to the IDA, there are almost 100,000 persons registered as wholly unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one goes through the previous authorisations for the IDA back in 1975, when the previous Government were in office, and the subsequent 1977 Act, we had eminent personages who are now Ministers, notably the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, indicating that the true number seeking employment even then was much greater.  One may assume the number is still much higher than 100,000.  The magnitude of the problem facing the IDA and the Government&mdash;and as far as we can influence matters, facing the Opposition&mdash;is underlined when one considers that despite this allocation to the IDA it does not seem as though even with full utilisation of the statutory limits in the Bill any immediate affect will be felt on employment.  It seems that will take considerable time.  One must bear in mind that on the industrial front there has been almost total reliance on the job-creation work of the IDA.  That is a sobering reflection.  While we cannot go into it today since it is a matter for another debate, there is perhaps need for a further review of the Government's capital programme outside the authorisation now to the IDA.  It may be that major expenditure at local government <Col N="1412" /> level which has an impact on industrial development and in the educational sector and the other remedial-type projects together with IDA activity will have some impact on the employment situation.</P>
    <P>I detect a new element of sobriety, caution and post-general election reality entering into the speeches of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other celebrated politicians who saw no great difficulty&mdash;provided they were in office&mdash;in resolving those problems.  I recall that the traditional role of the Minister has been to act as a kind of fire brigade, putting up financial sandbags, stopping firms from closing, and I am glad to see that this speech of the Minister is positive and helpful and should be of considerable benefit to the IDA in their work.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have some doubts about two key elements in the IDA strategy as outlined by the Minister.  First, the Minister indicated that a major element in the IDA plan is to ensure that half&mdash;I stress that word&mdash;of the new job com-mitments comes from within Ireland. There is not a great deal of evidence as yet of the prospective success of that strategy.  Things have been rather difficult in 1977 and 1978.  Recalling the Green Paper and the White Paper published subsequently and the speeches, particularly of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, where he predicted there would be no problem, that there would be about 5,000 redundancies or at the very worst about 7,000 in 1978, it seems instead we shall have about 12,000 which is much the same as we had in 1977 and 1976. So the big take-off has not occurred.  The great rocket of industrial development has not lifted off.  There is not great evidence that despite the outstanding work of the IDA in the past two years, which by and large has been strenuous and very successful, the desired result has been achieved.  Such is the magnitude of the problem and the extent of unemployment and so severe the constraints within which any Government must operate even in the money market in the past few months, that this strategy is still not accelerating to the degree <Col N="1413" /> necessary to overcome the problem. Therefore, there can be no euphoria and certainly I do not think that half the new job commitments are currently coming from within Ireland.  There is no great indication that they will come from within the country.  I do not propose to speak at length as I know that Deputy Leonard wants to come in and perhaps the Minister may wish to conclude before 7 p.m.</P>
    <P>It has been said by the Minister that there should be particular emphasis within the job-creation programme on natural resource based industry.  Again, there is no real evidence of any great success in this strategy today.  One has only to examine such industries as meat processing, food processing generally, and the timber industry in terms of employment content or the extent to which employment has been generated by oil and gas exploration or mineral development, to find that the job-creation contributions from these sectors has been rather limited.  We must admit that were it not for the very large dependence on and import of foreign investment in the past three years, the IDA job-creation strategy would have gone askew in a big way.</P>
    <P>This is not to suggest that such foreign investment is unwelcome.  I never held that view and within my party I have continuously had to&mdash;if I may say so patronisingly to my own party&mdash;educate my party about the realities of a mixed economy.  I have never been hostile although I have certainly been hostile to some of the practices of some foreign firms operating here.  They may need some educating also and very often they have received such an education at a very heavy cost.</P>
    <P>A further <i>caveat</i> regarding foreign in-vestment is the very considerable danger of which all Governments are aware that we may be creating too many hostages to foreign fortune.  Even though we had the lesson of Ferenka, I do not particularly deplore it because inevitably in a major foreign investment sector one will have firms going to the wall.  It was not necessarily all the fault of Ferenka or of the Government.  Industrial relations had a major influence on that particular debacle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> There is a further cause for considerable worry.  If it is true, as it would appear to be, that we now have a major dependence on foreign investment and that the future programme of the IDA will depend enormously on attracting further foreign investment into this country, then a critical eye has to be cast on the very exceptional package of incentives offered to prospective foreign investors by the IDA.  How long is that package going to last?  If Santa Claus does not continue to deliver that package to the foreign investor&mdash;by Santa Claus I mean the Irish tax-payer&mdash;then the whole strategy of in-dustrial development in this country could fall apart overnight.  That is serious.</P>
    <P>There has not been much reference by the Minister of late&mdash;and I will be particularly interested to hear his views on the matter&mdash;to the current Community situation regarding Irish export tax relief relative to new industries coming in here. It is a matter for concern and is a key element in the whole package.  I am wondering how the current state of play rests in relation to that package.  I do not know to what extent the Government are now availing of the maximum support of the protocol of our Treaty of Accession to the Community.  If the package is under assault, as it would appear to be, then we must ensure that an equally attractive package is negotiated with the Community.  The IDA incentive package has been perhaps the most attractive, largest ingredient in industrial development in recent years.  As yet there is no assurance whatever that that package will be permitted by the Community to continue indefinitely.  Since so much hinges around this, in the context of the moneys which are now being devoted to the IDA it is important that matter should be elaborated on by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also pointed out that the Government have laid some stress on a further aspect, namely, the enterprise development programme.  I welcome the fact that some 19 projects with a job potential of about 850 jobs have been approved for IDA grant assistance since January last.  However, I pose the question to the Minister in the <Col N="1415" /> following terms.  How do we explain the situation that there were only a mere 19 persons in the Republic in the last ten months who had the necessary enterprise qualifications and the necessary industrial experience but who were short of finance and who went up to the IDA in order to get their projects off the ground?  Is it not something of an indictment that the number should be so small? Fair dues to the 19 projects concerned and all credit to them, but is the fact that the number is so small not a serious reflection on our domestic sense of entrepreneurial adventure?</P>
    <P>I had prepared my comments prior to hearing Deputy Kelly on the matter.  I share his view&mdash;and I think the Minister would also share it&mdash;that we still have a tremendous need to create and foster within our people, particularly our young people, a dynamic sense of productive commercial enterprise especially in the field of manufactures.  It is my experience that too many of our young people who have money to invest, who inherit money or who want to obtain money, who have a flair for enterprise find that that flair is not likely to be channelled into a factory, into the production of goods, into learning a foreign language, into getting up early in the morning, boarding an aeroplane and going off to plug their wares to an importer outside this island.  No, that is not the concept of Irish enterprise as yet. Too much of their money and enterprise are veered in the direction of investing in a pub or a hotel so that they would have money during the season, or perhaps they invest in a piece of land and sit around admiring it for the rest of their lives, or maybe they open up a garage and flog a few cars, or they will indulge in a bit of construction speculation.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way suggesting that there is anything inherently wrong, undesirable or unproductive about such commercial undertakings.  I know the hard work it takes in a pub, a garage or whatever.  However, unless we have factories opened up by Irish people and unless we have the real growth of products by Irish people in Irish firms, the long-term industrial development of our <Col N="1416" /> country is definitely at risk.  It is by manufactured products that we have a real major added value to our GNP.  I regret very much that our sense of commercial enterprise is limited to a very small segment of our population.  Very very few people are involved, and even when we look at ourselves here, we have Deputy Kelly who is an academic, we have a lawyer, a politician, member of the legal profession, an ex-trade union official and so on.  I am perhaps the only one who has worked for a company in a factory and that was for a very short time.  Most politicians in this House have never themselves worked in a factory. That is the kind of lack of enterprise which we have in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is a very real need to create a genuine enthusiasm for productive capital formation at all levels in both the public and the private sectors.  We must re-orient our educational system at all levels, not merely in order to place more emphasis on science and technology but also to engender in our young people the courage to take risks and develop a sense of adventure.  This is where second and third level education is very much at fault.  I do not propose to comment further on this but I endorse some of the comments made by Deputy Kelly.</P>
    <P>On the domestic front I would hope the Minister would expand the role of the IDA and give that body an enlarged brief.  I would hope we would see more joint ventures between the public and private sectors.  I would hope to see more joint ventures between industries and firms in the private sector and also between State enterprises.  There seems to be a lack in that regard at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to increase training grants to £1.25 million.  I would ask the Minister to ensure there is effective liaison between the IDA and AnCO. Two major State bodies are involved in this substantial sum and I sometimes wonder to what extent there is effective liaison and co-operation in the spending of public moneys as between these two bodies.  There is a possibility that some major savings could be effected if the liaison structure between the two was somewhat better.  The Minister need not travel too far to find evidence of the <Col N="1417" /> situation.  AnCO are an enormous body. The IDA are a major body.  There are two different Ministers involved and liaison may be less than effective.  A sharp word on the part of the Minister would not do any harm at all.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm, too, to examine the position of the board of the IDA. There has been a long-standing argument about the lack of trade union representation.  I can see good sense in such representation, depending on who the trade union representative may be. There has been a great deal of comment by the managing director and various Ministers on industrial disputes, unofficial strikes and their disincentive to development.  I remember making representations to the Minister's predecessor urging him to examine the structure of the board of the IDA with a view to have trade union representation on it.  The Minister might take note of that but he should exercise the greatest care to ensure that such nominees can contribute effectively to good industrial relations.</P>

It will certainly help the IDA.  On the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies we shall have an opportunity of examining further into the IDA.  The Bill is limited in its function.  The authorisation is certainly necessary.  Where advance factories are concerned we have grown up. There was a time when every village wanted a factory of its own.</P>

Later on I shall be trying to get more advance factories into south County Dublin generally. We could do with some additional land and some additional factories.  I admit this is somewhat outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The 1977 Act gave power to the authority to promote the restructuring of industry and a joint committee was set up constituted of the Department of Industry and Commerce, CTT, Fóir Teo and the IDA.  I would like some information on the report from this committee. To what extent has it succeeded in encouraging amalgamations or acquisitions? Such committees can be very wasteful, meeting interminably and not making any real contribution.  If they do not make a real contribution I would certainly not perpetuate them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope the work of the IDA, with the reservations I have expressed, will continue successfully.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it and making available the necessary funds.  I also congratulate the Ministers of State on their efforts in their own fields of activity.  Any Bill that puts the IDA in a stronger position to promote industrial growth and thereby create more jobs is particularly welcome.  The necessity to raise the limits indicates how much money is involved in securing industries.  Many countries are competing for whatever industries are available in the world market.  A major effort must be made by the IDA to ensure that we get our share.  The competition will get keener in the years ahead. The higher limits required emphasise the benefits of extending existing industries and promoting native enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At it becomes more expensive to attract foreign industry the IDA will have to concentrate on encouraging young Irish businessmen.  I am glad to note the success of the enterprise development programme which was set up to assist persons with viable projects in mind who had not the necessary finance to implement those projects.  Deputy Desmond was critical of the 19 projects with a jobs potential of 850 new jobs.  Since this <Col N="1419" /> scheme came into operation a few months ago it has created a lot of interest in industrial development and public representatives have had numbers of inquiries from young persons interested in having their ideas developed by availing of this programme.  There are probably more than 19 projects in the pipeline at the moment.  This is a good scheme which will help to involve young ambitious people in industry.  It would be a good thing if the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards were used to polish up the ideas of young people so that native projects could be brought into production.  People come up with very sound ideas which with the help of the IIRS could be brought into production.</P>
    <P>The production of farm machinery should be actively promoted.  It is shameful that an agricultural country should find it necessary to import so much farm machinery.  We cannot hope to produce tractors but we can produce a wide range of light machinery.  In a Dáil Question earlier this year it was noted that the cost of importing machinery for preparing and cultivating soil in 1977 was in excess of £10 million and the cost of importing harvesting and threshing machinery was in excess of £25 million.  An example of high quality, sophisticated farm machinery produced here are the harvesters produced by the Sugar Company.  If that kind of machine can be produced here there is no reason why a wide range of farm machinery cannot be produced here.  This area should be developed.  It would be a poor manufacturer who could not keep up with the standards of some of the machinery that is imported.  The farm modernisation scheme make grants available to the farmers and because of this they are inclined to change their machinery fairly often so this would be a profitable area to develop.</P>
    <P>In relation to the north-eastern region the IDA annual reports over the past four or five years have said that the IDA are seeking land for industrial development. The 1977 report states that progress in County Monaghan has been slow largely due to the lack of attractive industrial sites.  Clones is an example of <Col N="1420" /> one of the towns where the IDA claim there is a problem in relation to obtaining industrial sites.  In the period mentioned in the reports land adjacent to the town changed hands a number of times. The IDA are depending on the local authority to secure industrial sites for them.  If the local authority do not deliver the IDA should seek sites themselves.  It is shameful that a job should be lost, not to speak of a factory or factories, just because the property market in an area is not monitored.  I would ask the Minister to impress upon the IDA the need for them to become actively involved and not to depend too much on the local authority for sites.</P>
    <P>During the last two years at least there was an annual furniture exhibition in County Monaghan.  A large number of factories there produce high quality articles of furniture.  We should not try to compete against highly automated foreign plants, we should concentrate on developing the skills here so as to produce articles of quality.  There will always be a demand for quality articles. In the shoe manufacturing industry factories have gone into developing quality articles instead of mass production and I am aware that such quality articles are in great demand.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to note that the authority will exceed, by a significant margin, the job improvement target for 1978.  I appeal to the Minister to ask the IDA to give special consideration to Border areas.  In recent years those areas have experienced many problems and are deserving of special attention.  Apart from the Dublin region, the north eastern region had the highest fall-off in job losses during the recession.  That region covers counties Monaghan, Cavan and Louth.  In Louth, which has well populated towns, there are many big industries, but the other counties have mainly small industries.  For that reason a different approach is neccesary in Cavan and Monaghan.  It struck me that the cluster-units would be very suitable for small towns.  Those anxious to set up small industries experience great difficulty at the outset because they must provide a suitable site and face costly ESB connections.  It would be ideal if cluster units could be established <Col N="1421" /> in my area and I hope the IDA will make this a feature of their future programme.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear that a review of the timber industry is about to commence. If we did not export so much of our timber we would be in a position to create more employment for people at home.  I believe the meat processing industry could be developed to great advantage. We all hope that more of our meat will be exported in the can and less on the hoof.  It is a pity that our meat factories, which are heavily grant-aided, should engage in this.  Many factories when they anticipate more animals coming on the market reduce their prices. They did this recently in anticipation of a big influx of cattle on the market during the 30-day testing, but that anticipation was groundless because cattle prices held good.  During that period they did themselves a lot of harm as far as exports were concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend the provision of advance factories.  We had a case recently in Castleblayney where a French firm built a factory to the specifications of the Eurolever Company but when that enterprise failed after a short time that building was not suitable for any other industry.  Many industrialists have turned it down.  The IDA should insist on such factories being built to certain specifications so that they can be adapted for other industries.  I wish to congratulate the Minister, and his Minister of State, on the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Member of the party who were in Government when the IDA was established it is only fitting that I should welcome this amending Bill.  I can recall speaking on the Bill which went through the House in 1977 and describing it as an interesting innovation. I found the figures quoted by the Minister in relation to employment-creation very interesting.  The Minister of State, Deputy R. Burke, stated:</P>
      <P> I am pleased to say that it now ap-pears that the authority will exceed by a significant margin its job approvals target of 27,000 for 1978. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I find that figure interesting, at the <Col N="1422" /> same time I cannot comprehend it fully. Those figures are not reflected in the unemployment figures which are available. Indeed, the reduction in unemployment promised by a number of Ministers is not apparent.  What Ministers have stated here should be placed in the proper context of the overall employment of the population.  Unemployment has not come down as promised by Fianna Fáil.  The recent figures show that unemployment was moving towards the 100,000 mark and that is indicative of the failure of the Government's policy to cope with one of our most serious social problems, something which will have to be faced in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The strategy of the present Government will not be successful.  I firmly believe that the rates of inflation which are the basis of their strategy will be far in excess of the figure of 7 per cent originally laid down in the Green Paper. This basic objective of holding down inflation will not be achieved because of the inflationary policies of the present Government.  That will be the one serious obstacle to the success of their programme.  I would like to have seen a strategy laid down which would have created a solid durable climate for expansion in industry here.  It is becoming very obvious day by day that the industrial, economic and monetary strategy of the present Government will not lay down a solid base for expansion of industry in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The question of the national wage agreement negotiations being rejected by the Congress of Trade Unions is something which the Government should comment on in more detail than they have done to date.  The Tánaiste issued a statement saying that the Government had no objection to the termination of the national wage agreement system.  I would like him to explain to the House in the context of industrial development how his party would like to see future wage settlements achieved. Will a free-for-all do any damage to his party's industrial policies?  As yet we have heard very little on this subject.  We have heard an awful lot about the EMS and world affairs, but we have heard very little solid information on the bread <Col N="1423" /> and butter problems which this country has to face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely referring to the general question of industrial policy and industrial strategy and how the IDA will meet their targets in the context of present Government policy.  I am very dubious about their objectives being achieved, and it is very unfortunate that I should have to say so in this House.</P>
      <P>There is tremendous unease in relation to pay in the civil service.  There is tremendous unease in the local authorities, as witnessed by the present engineering work to rule.  There is unease among industrial workers in relation to pay, and this is simply because the policies of the present Government are not seen to be socially equitable.  That is putting severe pressures, especially on the lower paid workers, to take action to redress what they see as a social imbalance. I wonder, for instance, is it socially beneficial to the country to have people driving around in cars costing £5,000, £6,000 or even £7,000 without having to pay any road tax?  Is there any social benefit in seeing people living in very large houses or on estates without having to pay any rates?  The policy at present being pursued by Fianna Fáil will lead to grave social unrest here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to the Bill directly, the increase in the amounts of grants and payments which may be made by the authority is a reflection of inflation and also of the commitment which the IDA have to grant-aid new industry.  I was interested to read in the Minister's speech that it is hoped that employment from domestic industry will amount to half of the total new employment to be created up to 1980.  This is good, because there is a general feeling abroad that the foreigners can come in and announce grandiose industrial schemes which too often fall apart after a few years; whereas the ordinary Irishman, a genuine hard-working person who wants to start a small or medium sized industry, <Col N="1424" /> feels that he is not getting a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>This image may be wrong.  I am sure the IDA have their own views on it.  But certainly on a number of occasions people have approached me in my capacity as their representative expressing grave reservations and doubts about the activities of foreign concerns.  One recent incident is the Ferenka closure.  I do not wish to go into the internal problems there.  The Ferenka owners may not have been to blame in relation to that. But certainly in my own city, or just outside it, 381 jobs were lost in the National Board and Paper Mills, simply because of a decision of an American company. There was little, if any, negotiation with the trade unions involved.  They just closed down.  It was closed without much consultation and without much heed to the social damage which the closure was doing to the fabric of society.  These events cause social concern. People discuss them.  If there is a continuation of foreign firms closing Irish people may come to look upon them with a certain amount of antipathy. There may be genuine reasons for closing or there may not, but certainly there will be antipathy.</P>
    <P>The question of the raising of the limits on certain grants from £150,000 to £1.25 million which the authority may make without prior Government approval is also a good thing.  It is a reflection of the independence which the IDA should exercise.  I understand that the commitment of the Government is very large in relation to this activity.  I am also confident that the authority, with their expertise, are capable of allocating funds on a very professional basis and a very rational basis.  This enabling section in the Bill is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposals of Waterford Glass to undertake a major expansion in Waterford, this is something that was before the Government for some months before it was finally passed. There should not have been a delay in this matter because Waterford is crying out for employment.  Indeed the report in today's paper of the Minister's speech in relation to an advance factory reflects the feeling in Government circles about the unemployment situation in Waterford. <Col N="1425" /> I must welcome the proposal to establish a 40,000 square foot advance factory in Waterford and also to establish a 20,000 square foot clusters complex in Waterford.  These are badly needed and the Minister's action, combined with the announcement in relation to Waterford Glass, is welcome.  I would like to ask the Minister about the proposed employment in the Waterford Glass extension.  A figure of 1,000 new employees has been thrown out as a suggested figure and some trade unionists locally have suggested a figure of 400.  I hope that figure will be nearer the 1,000. I would like confirmation from the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>Waterford has been hit very hard by the recession during the past five years. The National Board and Paper Mills are the most recent of a sad tale where 281 people were made redundant.  I was involved with the campaign to ensure that the Munster Chipboard Company would not be a casualty of rationalisation of the chipboard industry here.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry gave a categorical assurance to the deputation he met that the employment would be maintained in Waterford.  There is a Litton Report which has been in the hands of the Government for some time but has not yet been published.  I wonder what the recommendations of that report are?  Usually those reports deal with rationalisation and closing down of factories.  I would like to know what the Litton Report has to say about the woodpulp industry in Waterford.  Water-ford will not tolerate any move towards rationalisation of the chipboard industry if it affects Waterford in any way.</P>
    <P>Goodbodys, Dennys, Croker, Modern Plastics provide a litany of closures none of which is of direct Government responsibility.  Some of them, because they were old firms, were unable to meet the requirements of EEC competition and others closed because of management. There was one case where possibly inter-union problems may have been the cause of the factory not being well es-tablished as was first hoped.  The most recent one which has shown its head is the Irish Leather Company where 140 people are to be laid off at the end of January in Dungarvan and 40 people in <Col N="1426" /> the same company are to be laid off in Portlaw.  What action has the Minister taken to establish alternative industries in Dungarvan, Portlaw and Waterford to counteract this ongoing situation?</P>
    <P>The case in relation to Irish Leathers is a matter of international dumping.  I understand that the European Tanners Federation are about to make a submission to the EEC Commissioners in regard to this dumping.  I believe that it is very difficult to have it legally accepted as dumping.  Are we to suffer the very cheap, sweated labour prices of the South American Continent?  Will the Government tolerate a position where very cheap processed leather is imported at the cost of employment here?  We have a duty to ensure the employment security of that industry in the country and, as far as I am concerned, in my constituency.</P>
    <P>There are a few aspects I would like to discuss in relation to industrial policy in general.  What influence is exerted in relation to an applicant for an industrial grant for a new industry to site it in a particular place?  Is ministerial pressure put on an applicant to site a factory in Dublin, the north-west, the west, the south-west or the south-east?  I have been told on several occasions in my constituency that pressure is put on applicants to go to a certain place.  I do not want that pressure to be mixed up with the percentage differences in grant aid as between the designated areas and the non-designated areas.  I am talking about political pressure which many people feel is put on incoming new industries because of the standing of Ministers or Ministers of State and their desire to show their constituents that because they are Ministers they can bring new industry to their constituencies.  This myth or truth should be pinpointed once and for all.  I would like a categorical assurance that no pressure is put on an industry to site in any particular constituency. It is important that every county, whether or not it has ministerial representation, should get a fair crack of the whip and the people should be satisfied that their particular counties are receiving a fair proportion of any new industrial establishments.</P>
    <P>I would like again to refer to the <Col N="1427" /> Minister's speech as published in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> where he said that he is examining the suggestion that a judge would be made available to deal with the planning appeal cases and prevent them having to join a court queue.  This is a good suggestion and the Minister is entitled to our support.  I do not know how the present Planning Act would have to be amended but an expeditious manner of hearing planning appeal cases in relation to the establishment of new industries or in relation to the establishment of existing industries is welcome. We have had the unfortunate experience in south Tipperary, and in relation to the Beecham Group in County Clare, of narrow-minded objections by some people living in those areas.  Despite assurances from our professional institutions in relation to such matters as the environment, those protesters continued to protest.  In doing so they denied many people the opportunity of employment. That cannot be tolerated.  I accept fully the right of people to appeal in our democracy but because of our experience there is a need for an expeditious hearing of any planning appeal case.  The Minister is working in the right direction and if it is necessary to bring in an amending Bill it will be given swift passage in this House.  We support fully the process of democracy but there must be bounds.  We cannot hold up industry that is backed by technical expertise and where the environmental problems have been met to the satisfaction of the highest competent authorities, such as the IIRS.  The process of democracy must not be so mad as to allow the lunatic fringe to hold up major industrial development projects.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of industrial policy that has not been fully exploited relates to the corporation profits tax structure. Export sales relief in relation to corporation profits tax is fully understood and acceptable and I hope the EEC will allow us to continue with it after 1990 when the practice is to be phased out. We are only a developing country from the industrial point of view.  We are in our infancy when compared with Germany, France and parts of England.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> A good case could be made for reducing the level of corporation profits tax on domestic industries.  If we have full employment as our objective in the next few years and if we are putting our trust in private industry, then, proper incentives must be established and understood. The present level of corporate taxation on domestic limited companies should be examined with a view to reducing the impact of such taxation on reinvested profits.  In other words, where profits are proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be reinvested in the expansion or modernisation of a company in order to make it more efficient, such profits should not be taxed any more than exports.  They are achieving the same objective of encouraging employment and I would ask the Minister to review the matter.  If the present level of taxation of company profits in the domestic economy were reduced substantially it would have a tremendous impact.  People would be given an incentive to go into industry or to expand their enterprises and it would have a beneficial effect on employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the educational aspect of our industrial policy.  There is a need to look at curriculum development in our second level schools.  It is generally acknowledged that our schools are far too academic in relation to the subjects they offer.  The teaching of practical and technical subjects costs substantially more than the teaching of academic subjects.  The recent statement by the chief of the Confederation of Irish Industry indicates that we are suffering bottlenecks in relation to the availability of skilled manpower. While we are producing academics who cannot find employment, there is a bottleneck in relation to the supply of technocrats at various levels. It is caused because of an imbalance in the subjects taught in schools and an undue bias in relation to the benefit of academic subjects as against technical subjects.  To my mind the technical subjects would be more suitable to our developing industrial economy.</P>
    <P>AnCO are doing excellent work with regard to retraining and apprenticeship but I think the activities of AnCO <i>vis-à-vis</i> the apprenticeship scheme are <Col N="1429" /> duplicating the efforts of technical colleges. This matter should be looked at in order to avoid duplication of resources and to ensure a proper academic balance and a proper understanding of education for young people.  It is important that balance be maintained but this is not being done at the moment at second level. The apprenticeship scheme needs to be balanced in the other direction in order to give the apprentices a proper liberal education.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the employment development programme is effective.  I know that 19 people have received approval and that it has potential employment for 850.  Anything that encourages initiative in our economy must be welcomed and I wish the programme every success.  One can only admire the work of the staff of the IDA.  They are competent and most expert at selling Irish industry abroad.  They are tackling their task with the necessary professionalism in order to attract sophisticated multinationals to Ireland.  Nothing must deter us from continuing to make Ireland an attractive place for industrialists. Nothing must deter the Minister, whether he be a Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour Minister, from pushing Ireland in every corner of the world.  We are only in our infancy as regards industrial development.</P>
    <P>With regard to EEC involvement in our industrial policy, I do not think it is effective.  The lack of a proper regional fund is one basic weakness.  The lack of political will to establish an effective transfer of resources to poor areas such as Ireland and southern Italy relative to Germany is one of the major failures of the EEC.  There must be greater efforts made in Europe to attract industry here. Our European partners should be more helpful in relation to the establishment of industry.  More capital should be made available to the IDA to ensure their capabilities in the field of industrial promotion.  One can only wish the IDA well in their efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, particularly the increase from £400 million to £750 million in the limit of the aggregate amount for grants and payments of a capital nature which may be made <Col N="1430" /> by the authority.  We are all aware that the level of capital required has greatly increased.  The consequence of the increased capital requirement is that the IDA will need greater resources to attract new industry.</P>
      <P>This Bill comes at a time when there is much discussion of job creation.  It is important to look at the creation of employment in three different respects. The first is the direct jobs which have been created by the Government.  The Government promised to provide 5,000 jobs in 1977 and 20,000 jobs in 1978. We know that 5,000 jobs were provided in 1977 and that we are now close to the target of 20,000 jobs for 1978.</P>
      <P>The second aspect of job creation is the net job creation within industry.  We know that the net job creation within industry is lower than expected, which may be due to a time lag in uptake by industry. Efficiency in industry must increase before employment increases.</P>
      <P>The third aspect relates to new industrial job approvals.  We can see from the Minister's speech that that aspect is above target.  We are pleased to welcome the results obtained by the IDA and to congratulate the Minister and the IDA on their achievements.  I am glad to see that the IDA will exceed by a significant margin their 1978 job approvals target of 27,000.  I am also glad to see that more than half the new job commitments will come from within Ireland.  I am pleased that the IDA will publish higher job targets later in the year as a result of having to increase their targets.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that an IDA unit is being developed in the Baldoyle industrial estate. I would ask the Minister to earmark more of them for intensive use in the north city area, particularly in the industrial estates provided by the corporation and the county council.  The industries being developed on these sites, which are scarce, should provide high levels of employment.  As the north side of the city is the fastest growing area in relation to second-level education, the situation there will become even more difficult unless action is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that the enterprise development programme has been going well.  The Minister's satisfaction with the response to the programme demonstrates <Col N="1431" /> that there are many people of adventure and enterprise in the country. A fast uptake in relation to this programme cannot be expected until the confidence of both sides, the entrepreneurs and the IDA, has increased. I look forward to an increased contribution from that sector.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position to move into phase two of the economic development plan during which maximum reliance will be placed on native raw materials and home-based industries producing well-designed quality goods.  We have a large number of young people available for employment with the necessary technology and skill, and the Minister's policies will lead to their development.</P>
    <P>As a result of our membership of the EEC our trade is shifting towards the Continent.  Statistics show that in 1972, 66 per cent of our exports went to Great Britain, 13.5 per cent to Northern Ireland and 20.5 per cent to other EEC countries.  In 1977, 51 per cent of our exports went to Great Britain, 9.9 per cent to Northern Ireland, and 38.3 per cent to other EEC countries.  These figures are significant.  It is important to realise the extent of the shift in trade to the EEC. We should be making more provision for transport to the Continent.  We should consider a comprehensive roll-on roll-off service to the Continent using large capacity ships.  Nearly 90 per cent of UK exports to the Continent are by roll-on roll-off transport.  The use of such transport between here and the Continent would result in significant cost savings. A great deal of our business goes through Great Britain to the Continent.</P>
    <P>In view of the change in our export markets the Minister should consider developing a transport system from, say, Cork, using larger vessels.  We are at a take-off point in relation to the development of trade with the Continent.  I appreciate that we have a service between Rosslare and Le Havre.  This service carries cars in the summer and other goods during the winter.  The emphasis on such a system would be even greater if we were to become involved in the EMS.</P>
    <P>If we look at development in imports we find that our imports from the EEC <Col N="1432" /> countries have not increased by the same proportion as our exports.  It is quite likely that in future we will be purchasing more from the Continent. This means there could be two-way trade.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the reluctance to create new employment. As I mentioned at the outset, one of the problem areas is the shortfall in net job creation in industry and the fact that there seems to be a lag in employing people in the industrial areas.  There is need for a fresh approach here.  The IDA, in association with AnCO, might consider providing a special fund to train people for short or long working periods in industry and to take them back when, and if, there is not work for them.</P>
    <P>In my daily work as a TD I deal with a number of young people who are looking for jobs.  I have found that AnCO experience and their work training programme are very valuable and I would like to see this developed further. If more people were trained that might help to overcome some reluctance to employ these people in industrial areas. This could increase the numbers retained in industry and would give people looking for jobs, especially young people, useful experience in industry.  This could be done by AnCO and the IDA could look at this in relation to the overall job creation programme.  AnCO have the technical expertise and the involvement in industry to form such a link.  I would like to join with other Deputies in congratulating the Minister and in welcoming this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy must welcome a Bill which increases the amount the IDA will have to encourage foreign industrialists to set up businesses here, whether they be direct grants for plant and machinery or factories, or training grants.  I am disappointed that the major cities seem to be getting the big industries while some of the underdeveloped areas have been getting very little industry.  The IDA must take some of the blame for this.  I am not suggesting that they are inefficient because I have stated time and time again that they are one of the most efficient, professional organisations we have at the present <Col N="1433" /> time.  Some of the areas I know, north Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal, got practically nothing and, like other Deputies in that area, I am very disturbed at the number of advance factories lying idle.</P>
      <P>I welcome the idea of cluster factories, three or four in different areas.  There is a lot to be said for such an idea.  It costs the same to bring electricity, water, sewerage and so on, to all factories. a directive must go out from the Minister to ensure that the advance factories already in existence get priority over new factories.  It is sad to see so many of these factories, which were built with public money, lying idle in the counties I mentioned.</P>
      <P>Other speakers mentioned regional development.  If we are serious about this we must ensure that the regions, especially those on the western seaboard, get the development they deserve.  Parts of the country seem to be booming but others have the highest rates of unemployment in western Europe.  We hear lecturers talk about the under-developed areas of Italy but it has been proved that the under-developed areas in the west are as bad as, and sometimes a lot worse than, the under-developed areas of Italy.</P>
      <P>We welcome the job target set by the IDA and will give the Government every co-operation to ensure that they are reached.  Has the Minister ever consulted the IDA about a transport subsidy towards the long haul which many factories will have to take into consideration when deciding to start a business in the west?  One of the greatest disincentives to setting up a factory on the western seaboard is the cost of transport. While we welcome these roll-on roll-off ferries, a great deal of thought must be given to the roads in these areas. There is no point in talking about two Irelands when many people seem to think we have three Irelands&mdash;the under-developed areas in the west being the third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all welcome the fact that from 1977-80 the IDA hope to encourage about 49,500 new jobs to this area. There is no point in encouraging these new jobs if different factories close down for one reason or another.  We must ensure <Col N="1434" /> that, once a factory is located, and if it is viable, it will be kept open.</P>
    <P>Five years ago when the Coalition came into power a certain factory in Donegal was losing £30,000 a year and everybody said it was only a matter of months before it would close.  The development and managerial teams were changed and they went out and promoted their goods.  Now that factory is one of the best in Donegal because the entire managerial and professional organisation was changed.  When I see some of these factories closing I wonder if enough thought and managerial expertise went into investigating them to see if they could be kept open.  As the years pass, it will become more difficult for the IDA to encourage new industrialists to come here and, as politicians who in some way direct the IDA, we should ensure that these industrialists are encouraged to stay.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign Fianna Fáil candidates were talking about the thousands of new jobs which should be developed in the area of natural resources.  They have now been in Government for almost two years and we have not seen any major effort to develop the meat trade off the hoof, to develop our timber and fishery resources or the area of marine biology.  In these four areas thousands of jobs could be created but the Government have done nothing.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging when one is abroad to see the brand name &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; in every supermarket and on every aircraft. Much more could be done in this line. We should have one brand name covering a complete range of meat and dairy products and an image should be projected comparable to that of &ldquo;Kerry-gold&rdquo;. We should prepack our own meat and fish and market such produce under a single name.</P>
    <P>We are glad to see Irish tweed being sported in fashion shops, particularly in North America.  Those in the biscuit in-dustry are to be congratulated.  It costs much more to produce biscuits here than in Britain or Northern Ireland, yet we can export biscuits because of the capital incentives offered.  More firms should take into consideration these tax free incentives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> Many smaller industries are suffering from unfair competition, particularly in Border areas.  A question was asked in the Dáil recently about why bread is cheaper in the North than here.  The IDA must examine the grants system operating at present.  The reason for price differences in bread, poultry and meat products is that industrialists were given grants in Britain and Northern Ireland, while grants are not available here for bakeries and poultry production. The IDA recently turned down a grant application for an abattoir in Donegal because there are, in their opinion, sufficient meat processing units in the State.  I often wonder if the IDA take into account the size of a county like Donegal.  An abattoir in the midlands is not suitable for Donegal.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the EMS and the possible effects on Border industries. Have the Minister and the IDA given real consideration of the effect on exports of entry to the EMS, particularly if Britain does not join and our £ is higher than the British £?  In such an event industries will suffer from unfair competition, especially the textile and shoe industries, and British industries will be able to compete much more favourably on the European market.  I ask the Minister and the IDA to look into this matter.  I understand that textile manufacturers, including Magee's of Donegal and Glen Abbey, held a meeting recently and they are very concerned about the possibility of entering the EMS without Britain.  No matter what sops or subsidies we receive from the other member states of the EEC, if Britain does not join it is only a matter of time until continental efficiency overtakes us and jobs will be run down.</P>
    <P>Idle advance factories are the greatest eyesore in the west.  Before any new factories are set up, the Minister should direct the IDA to ensure that all advance factories are taken up.</P>

      <P>An amendment has been tabled by the Minister for Health to the motion in the names of Deputy Boland and other Deputies.  To that amendment a further amendment has been tabled by Deputy Joan Burke to add after the word &ldquo;Enquiry&rdquo; the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;into the remuneration and conditions of employment of the profession&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to establish a Commission of Enquiry into the remuneration and conditions of employment of the nursing profession in relation to other categories of employment in both the public and private sector, bearing in mind (1) the educational requirements on entry (2) the period and degree of training (3) the responsibility (4) the professional proficiency (5) the dedication and nature of service, required of members of that profession. </P>
      <P>It is true to say that the Minister for Health is living dangerously with the nurses.  The result of that dangerous living has not been a good relationship between the members of that profession and the Government of the day.  A large measure of the fault for that must lie with the Minister because of the attitude he has adopted and the approach he has taken to the nursing profession and their representative body since he took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since he became Minister, the Minister has engaged in the politics of brinkmanship with the nursing profession in the various claims they have made.  His attitude can only result in forcing them more regularly into considering what they are so obviously reluctant to do, that is, to resort to militant <Col N="1437" /> action.  If we look at the recent history of the Minister's relationship with the nursing profession, we find that, although the nurses sought equal pay and an arbitration award over a protracted period, they could get no agreement with the Department on a submission to the arbitrator.  The Minister held out steadfastly and employed every delaying tactic available and, when the nursing profession made it quite clear that they had reached the limit of their patience and were no longer prepared to accept the public relations campaign engaged in by the Minister, last June, two or three days before they had threatened to take to the streets in protest, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, the Minister was suddenly able to agree on the basis on which they should go to arbitration.</P>
    <P>If that is not a bad enough indication of a bad attitude and a bad relationship between the Minister and the profession, we then discover that, before the date of the annual general meeting of the INO no decision has been made on the arbitration award and understandably the nurses were upset and becoming increasingly vocal in their criticisms and complaints.  Again, <i>mirable dictu</i>, just two days before the AGM of the INO, suddenly the Minister was able to announce that he was accepting the arbitration award.  At that meeting the members decided to call for a commission of inquiry into their levels of pay and their conditions of service relative to other categories in the public and private sectors.  The Minister rejected that concept out of hand in a rather condescending letter to the INO.  He refused to accept that request.  Once again the nurses organised and arranged a mass public protest march to this House.  This party considered their case and decided it was valid and worthy of support.  We also believe it has the support of the general public.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the editorials in two of the daily newspapers following immediately on the AGM of the INO which seem to us to indicate that the general public, through the responsible media, were in favour of the case made for the setting up of a commission of inquiry.  In an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 September reference <Col N="1438" /> is made to the fact that the nurses had taken the unusual and unprecedented step of allowing themselves the right to strike action.  The editorial states it is highly unlikely that they will use this new industrial muscle precipitately or irresponsibly, but they have given the nation notice that they are no longer the submissive handmaidens of every Tom, Dick and Harry to exploit them, and about time too.  It is also stated in the editorial there can be no doubt that the nurses' commitment to ethical and professional considerations has allowed them to be exploited by a community prepared to pay them only lip service for their devotion.</P>
    <P>The editorial in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 27 September referring to wage negotiations states that whatever the final outcome of the negotiations between the nurses' representatives and the authorities, it is certainly time for a sympathetic look to be taken at improvements in training, job opportunities, duties, working conditions and wages of one of the most long-suffering, hard-working and vital professions we have.  It goes on to say that the nurses are better organised now, that they are intent on improving their lot, and that they are prepared to fight for a better deal and they certainly deserve one.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of the degree of public sympathy for the reasonable claim by the nurses for the setting up of a commission of inquiry, a commission similar to those set up for other branches of the public service, such as the commission set up by the Government for the Garda for the second time.  The Minister's reply to the nurses was that he could not see that an inquiry of the nature demanded was necessary and he suggested they should continue to work for the well-being of their members through the medium of the established and well-tried procedures available.  That was the Minister's letter of 31 October.</P>
    <P>The tone of that paragraph is the tone of an academic looking down on a bunch of unreasonable school children. It runs right through his letter and it seems to me to be an extraordinary attitude for a Minister to adopt towards a responsible body.  Faced with this Private Members' motion in this House <Col N="1439" /> tonight and tomorrow night, and with the massive public protest march scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, the Minister suddenly produced action as he did in June and before the AGM of the INO.  He met the INO yesterday and, according to press reports, he told them he has changed his mind and is prepared to set up a commission of inquiry.  If that is the case, it is to be welcomed.  I am glad the INO were successful.  I am glad our party were associated with it through the pressure we brought to bear and our support for the nurses' worthwhile proposal.</P>
    <P>I suggest this is not the way for a Minister to do business.  The Minister is changing his mind pretty frequently now.  Not long ago we watched him on television saying he might decide to change his mind and go back to the people in Roscommon and tell them he did not really mean what he said some time ago.  The Minister will always be remembered for the fact that during his tenure in office the nurses decided to remove from their constitution the no-strike clause which was contained in it. It is unfortunate that things should have come to such a pass that they decided upon that action.</P>
    <P>We understand a commission of in-quiry is to be established.  We expect the House will be told clearly this evening what the terms of reference of that commission will be.  Nothing said so far makes us any the wiser in that regard.  I deliberately read into the record the wording of our motion in which we mentioned specifically the terms of reference of the commission and the factors to be taken into account in any recommendations it might make.  For reasons best known to himself the Minister has chosen to submit an amendment the effect of which will be to delete all reference to the terms of reference of the commission and the various factors we believe should be taken into account in fairness and in equity in arriving at a reasonable assessment of the status of the nursing profession and the level of pay to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment suggests that the House takes note of the recent <Col N="1440" /> decision to set up a commission of inquiry. There is no indication as to what they will investigate or recommend or as to what will be their terms of reference. In his statement to the House it is vital that the Minister set out clearly the terms of reference of the commission and that in particular he sets out that the commission will be empowered specifically and will be expected to recommend on the levels of pay and on the related conditions of service of nurses.  Also, it is vital that the commission state what are those pay levels and conditions, regardless of whether they be in line with comparable rates either inside or outside the public service or inside or outside the health service.</P>
    <P>It is very important, too, that the Minister tell the House during this debate whether he has acceded to the request of the INO that this commission be set up before the first of next month and that they be instructed to make their report within six months of that date.  I trust that the Minister has decided, in keeping with his change of heart, to accede to those reasonable requests.</P>
    <P>In stating that a commission of inquiry are being set up the Minister should say also whether it is the intention of the Government to take any action on the findings of that commission and also within what length of time after the publication of the findings the Government intend stating whether they are accepting them.  I appreciate it is unusual to suggest that a Government, while appearing in good faith to set up a commission of inquiry, might not give the sort of undertaking I am requesting but I have in mind the fact that in order to salve their conscience and to vindicate their stance in Opposition, the Government did not seem to have qualms of conscience about setting up the Ó Briain Commission in relation to the Garda although a large skelp of the recommendations of that commission&mdash;as much as three-quarters&mdash;was merely shelved by the Government.  We were told that the recommendations were to be noted but that no action would be taken on them. Is there a likelihood that the commission we are talking of this evening, which is being set up so reluctantly by the Minister under threat of public protest in <Col N="1441" /> the street, and because of this motion which amounts to a motion of censure, will be set up without there being any intention on the part of the Government to accept their findings?  That is why I take the unusual step of suggesting that the Minister tell us during his contribution whether the Government intend accepting the findings of the commission and also the length of time that may elapse before the Government announce their decision.</P>
    <P>It is important also that we distinguish between the work of this commission and the work presumably being undertaken by the working party on nurses who have been in session for three years and whom I understand are due to report their findings to the Minister in stages from the beginning of next year. We must distinguish between the areas that party are examining and the areas which the commission should examine. It would seem pointless to set up a commission who would duplicate the work being undertaken already by the working party.  In such circumstances we would have a commission without much merit.  That is not what the INO want.  It is not what we are calling for.  We are calling for a commission of inquiry specifically to investigate the pay and conditions of employment of the nurses.</P>
    <P>Up to now the profession generally has been equated for purposes of wages and salaries structure with the clerical officer grade in the public service.  Not much elaboration is required for the House to realise that that analogy was not there and did not take into account such special working conditions as the unsocial hours worked by nurses and the level of training and dedication required of members of that profession.  In saying that I am not attempting in any way to denigrate clerical officers in the public service.  Generally speaking these clerical officers work a 40-hour week and during the ordinary working day from Monday to Friday.  Like nurses, they are required to have leaving certificate at entry but they are not required as are nurses who, very often are required to have several honours in their leaving certificate, to embark on a three-year training course. Neither are they required to work the <Col N="1442" /> unsocial hours on any day of the year as nurses are expected to work.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare the different levels of pay, both for nurses and for clerical officers with whom they are compared for this purpose.  Including the recent arbitration award, about which the Minister will undoubtedly pat himself on the back in due course, a student nurse is paid £47 per week at the commencement of her employment.  This increases to £49.54 in her final year.  On becoming a qualified staff nurse the weekly pay is £62.41.  A clerical officer starting at leaving certificate level and without any training is paid £55 per week, increasing on an incremental scale to £86 per week.  After nine years' increments a staff nurse's salary increases to £79.90 per week.</P>
    <P>That is not a great deal for what is expected of her, for the sort of service that she is expected to give and which she gives so willingly.  Neither is it good remuneration when compared with other grades in the hospital service.  For example, a hospital storekeeper starts at £77 per week and this increases to £106 aften ten years while an assistant storekeeper starts at £69 per week and receives £82 per week after ten years' service.  Irrespective of the good work that those other people are doing, they do not require the long and special training course that nurses must embark on. If the comparisons are rather odious, what is the position of the ward sister whose pay increases from £79.70 as a staff nurse to a maximum of £89.46? Another example is a matron who starts at £95 per week and receives £114 maximum. These figures are not good when such factors as unsocial hours are taken into account.</P>
    <P>There are a number of strange anomalies through the nursing service which should be examined by this commission. Although nurses are supposed to be analogous to the clerical officer grade for purposes of remuneration, their working week does not include meal times whereas meal times are included in the clerical officer's 40-hour week.  There is the fact that very often a nurse on duty would be expected to work broken shift hours.  She might be expected to work from 8 o'clock in the <Col N="1443" /> morning until 2 o'clock in the afternoon, with four hours off duty, returning from 6 o'clock until 10 o'clock in the evening. In effect therefore we are talking about somebody whose entire day from 8 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock in the evening has been taken up in connection with her duties.  No special benefit is afforded people in that position.</P>
    <P>Nurses are upset, and rightly so, that no special allowance is given them in respect of additional qualifications. There is the extraordinary position that nurses engaged in post-graduate courses, if they leave the hospital they trained in and where they have been working in order to go to another hospital to attend specialist courses, instead of being seconded from their original hospital are assumed to be taking up employment at the level of a temporary nurse at the hospital where they are undergoing their special post-graduate training course. Consequently they are paid at the minimum of the scale on the basis that they are temporary officers, although they have the entire training of a staff-nurse and sometimes some years experience at staff-nurse level.  Yet they are made revert to the minimum of the scale on the basis that they are operating only as a temporary.</P>
    <P>Then there is the situation that has obtained for years in the nursing profession, one that cannot be allowed continue, in which there are relatively few promotional opportunities open to nurses and in which, at certain levels in the service, promotion from one grade to another can mean an actual loss in pay. For instance, somebody working as a ward sister, working on a rota basis, sometimes at night, sometimes during the day, is paid time-and-a-quarter in relation to their work at night.  If that person applies for the post of night superintendent, when she would be working permanently at night, that should represent promotion.  In fact, a night superintendent or anyone else working permanently at night is paid only at the rate of time-and-one-sixteenth.  The person who ostensibly gets promotion loses about 10 per cent in real terms for the first year of <Col N="1444" /> occupancy of their supposedly higher position.  That hardly sounds like equity.</P>
    <P>There is the extraordinary situation also which would not be tolerated in many other professions, or indeed in industry in this country, in which a nurse who works on Saturdays is paid the princely sum of £1 extra, one single pound sterling, one miserable extra £1. Indeed, as I am reminded, that is £1 gross before the Minister's colleague and friend, Deputy Colley, and the Revenue Commissioners get their hands on it.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning also that nurses on call&mdash;for example, a nurse working in an operating theatre and on call&mdash;is allowed from Monday to Friday inclusive only £3.24 per night and an additional £3.24 per case on the basis of being called out.  If a nurse has sufficient dedication, as so many of them have, to go on and undertake special courses or obtain special qualifications in very many cases she is paid not one penny extra for the special qualifications she obtains.  The most common example that can be given in that field relates to the qualification in midwifery for which there is no additional payment unless she happens to be working entirely at midwifery&mdash;in other words, unless she happens to be working in a maternity hospital.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying later this evening can he cite any other profession in which people would be expected to study for additional qualifications and then, having obtained them, their employer did not pay them one additional penny?  I do not know of any. Perhaps the Minister can explain and justify it, because certainly I cannot.  In relation also to certain other qualifications, most of which have emerged since the special qualifications were set some years ago, nurses who had studied and now hold such special qualifications, who are working whole-time in fields allied to those special qualifications, still do not obtain any additional payment.  I refer to nurses with a diploma in ear, nose and throat who, although working fulltime on ENT, do not obtain any special allowance for the fact that they hold that special diploma.  Likewise nurses holding an ophthalmic diploma although working fulltime in that field do <Col N="1445" /> not obtain any additional payment or recognition whatsoever.</P>
    <P>It should be mentioned also that nurse tutors&mdash;that vital area of the training of nurses&mdash;are paid at a very low level.  It could well be argued that nurse tutors are of a comparable grade to people working in the other teaching areas at third level.  After all, students who enter the nursing profession are required to hold their leaving certificate, often with a certain number of honours.  In that regard nurse tutors are training people who have gone through second-level education; therefore they are training them <i>de facto</i> at third-level.  Yet their salary rates bear very little relationship, if any, to that being paid to teachers in third-level colleges.  In fact, nurse tutor salaries do not compare well with the level of salaries being paid to teachers at second-level.  When we examine this teaching area one can see quite clearly the validity of the case I have been making about special qualifications.  Any teacher who takes on an extra, special qualification is automatically allowed additional payments per year by the Department of Education in respect of that special qualification.  For example, teachers in the vocational field are allowed special additional moneys if they have a university degree, if they have their H.Dip. and their Ceard Teastas. Yet there are nurses working fulltime, unsocial hours, with a dedication not apparent or readily identifiable in many other branches of the public or private sector.</P>
    <P>It is to the detriment of this country that the same level of skill, service and dedication consistently displayed by people working in the nursing profession is no longer displayed by those working in other branches of industry and the public service.  It would be a shame if the attitude of Governments, whatever Government it might happen to be, was such as to shake that dedication and sour the contribution and level of service nurses are prepared to give.  As newspaper editorials have pointed out, it is time our society recognised the special role of the nurse, the special contribution she has to make, that we recognise that special role in the only way Governments have on behalf of the public: <Col N="1446" /> through hard cash in their pockets, through promotional opportunities, through recognition of the fact that those who wish to study and obtain additional professional qualifications be rewarded.  That sort of attitude is not being displayed at present.</P>
    <P>The Commission of Inquiry might well be asked to examine the position in which very many people in the nursing profession find themselves, especially those working in hospitals in rural areas where very many nurses are engaged on a basis which can be described only as a permanent/temporary one.  They have never been made permanent and apparently there is no intention of making them permanent.  The advantage of that to their employers, the Department, is that as temporary nurses they will continue to be paid at the minimum of the scale.  There are all sorts of disadvantageous conditions attached to nursing, in relation to uniforms, for instance, which should be examined by a commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to a certain branch of the profession which has been in dispute with the Minister, although not consistently reported in the newspapers, during the past two months.  In this matter there is apparently no likelihood of an initiative or solution.  I refer to the public health nurses.  They are expected to work a five-day week and are paid special allowances for services they provide at weekends.  They want their conditions changed so that they would work on any five days of the week but that they would be allowed to have two continuous free days.  They want recognition in relation to Saturday and Sunday work in the level of payment made to them.  Except in the greater Dublin area, public health nurses have been engaging in industrial action and have refused to provide service at weekends since the beginning of October. Action has not been taken by the Department to help to bring an end to that dispute.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Minister's amendment suggest that the House should welcome the suggested improvements in the pay, conditions and status of the nursing profession.  I presume the Minister refers to the improvements <Col N="1447" /> since he took office, and I presume he will tell us how that extravagant and unjustifiable claim can be justified.  In the last few days I have been considering what has been happening to the nursing profession in the past year.  There has not been any great improvement as far as their status is concerned.  I agree some additional public health nurses have been employed and that some additional nurses have been in training.  There are supposed to be three additional nursing posts in the Department of Health.  This has been talked about for a long time. These posts will be of benefit only when they are filled, and as far as I know these posts have not been filled and I do not see any likelihood that they will be filled in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister will tell us that he sanctioned an arbitration award of 15 per cent improvement in nurses' salaries. That is not correct.  In common with the rest of the public, nurses have been seeking to have the equal pay award made available to them.  I suggest they are the last branch of public service employees outstanding in so far as equal pay is concerned. The 15 per cent has been awarded in the form of a flat payment of £308 to each nurse to make up the difference in relation to the marriage gratuity, and a 5 per cent award which has been given to the analogous grade to which I referred earlier, the clerical officers. That means 15 per cent to junior nurses in training&mdash;indeed it is a little higher than 15 per cent&mdash;but for the senior nurses it means less than 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>This has not improved the position of nurses, as the amendment of the Minister appears to indicate.  It has merely belatedly removed the discrimination between men and women in the profession.  I emphasise that it is very belated because the nurses are the last branch of the public service to have received equal treatment.  The 5 per cent has been given to stop them falling further behind the clerical officer grade. They should not be tied to a grade who work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, a 40-hour week, including meal times.  The special status of nurses <Col N="1448" /> should be taken into account.  Their educational requirements, the amount of training they have to do, the special skills they must possess and their unsocial hours, should all be taken into account in computing a wage which would be realistic from the point of view of 1980's society.</P>
    <P>For too long nurses were prepared to serve the general public because they believed they had a vocation to give themselves unstintingly without just reward.  One change has come about in our society: people have been insisting on obtaining a just reward in return for their services, and I do not believe there is any branch of the public service with whom the general public would have more sympathy than the nurses, or any branch of the public service who would receive more support from the public.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that nurses should have been driven at their annual meeting to contemplate strike action.  It is pathetic that nurses should have been driven to march <i>en masse</i> on this House tomorrow, and it is a sorry state of affairs that this party should have to continue with this motion despite the fact that the Minister has announced that he is to set up a commission of inquiry.  We are reluctant to accept that the Minister's proposed commission of inquiry will be on the same basis as the terms outlined in our motion.  Our reluctance has been reinforced by the wording of the Minister's amendment, the effect of which is to strike from the record the terms of reference suggested in relation to the remuneration and conditions of employment of nurses <i>vis-à-vis</i> other branches of the public and private sectors.  The commission should be asked to examine levels of pay along the lines of our motion, and I cannot understand why the Minister, if acting in good faith, should table an amendment to strike from the record our suggested terms of reference unless it is his intention to appoint a commission which may not produce the kind of recommendations which the nurses expect and which we endorse.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister to say whether he is prepared to do the big thing and agree to the terms of reference outlined in our motion and asked for by the INO. <Col N="1449" /> It is incumbent on me to say that the general attitude of the Minister to the nursing profession has not endeared him to its members.  Many of them do not believe that the Minister is acting in good faith because of the way he handled the demands for a commission, because of his steadfast refusal to agree to a commission until he backed down at the last moment when faced with a public protest and with this motion in the House.  It is indicative of the amount of faith the nurses have in the Minister that although the announcement of a commission was made last night they will still arrive at the gates of this House tomorrow afternoon.  When they do, this party will be with them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P> To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves the measures taken by the Government to date to improve the pay, conditions and status of the nursing profession and welcomes the recent decision to establish a Commission of Inquiry&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow afternoon will bring what perhaps is an unprecedented demonstration to the gates of Leinster House, when for the first time representatives of the general nursing profession will take to the streets to highlight their demands for improved pay and conditions.  Tomorrow's demonstration and those which have occurred in Cork, Tullamore, Bundoran, Castlebar, Kilkenny and Kells, represent a watershed in the battle for proper recognition of the status of the nursing profession in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until now the nursing profession sought recognition by adopting a &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; approach.  Quietly and patiently they endured the role of the charitable volunteer in our health services, the role of the dedicated employee whose commitment to service and to people somehow evolved into a reason for tolerating inferior educational programmes, few opportunities for career advancement, poor working conditions <Col N="1450" /> and grossly inequitable salaries. As a doctor who has worked for a number of years in hospitals I have seen the nurses' dedication to duty and their commitment to people; but I fear that dedication and commitment has been exploited because the Department of Health have become accustomed to the provision, as far as nursing is concerned, of patient care on the cheap.  That is exactly what the nurses have been providing.  No longer are they willing to have their vocation used as a convenient means of perpetuating poor conditions of employment.  Rather late in the day they realise that they have been downtrodden and treated very shabbily by successive Governments.  They are fed up with the Florence Nightingale charade where demands for decent pay and working conditions and a real say in patient care have been seen as unseemly or unproper demands coming from a profession founded on dedicated and ideal service.  The point should be made that the ultimate beneficiaries of these demands will not be solely the 14,000 nurses providing the general and psychiatric care: there will also be the patients themselves.  Much will be achieved by improving pay and conditions of nurses.  They will not be the only people to benefit when we politicians finally grasp the nettle and deal with their demands.</P>
    <P>Nurses perhaps more than anyone else have been in the forefront in highlighting conditions under which patients have been cared for in hospitals. They have condemned chronic overcrowding, lack of facilities and general disregard for the physiological and psychological needs of patients in hospital. A few days ago I saw where nurses in Newcastle psychiatric hospital exposed the miserable failure of the health board and local management to provide proper care for patients.  In highlighting this I felt they were performing a very important public duty.  This is just another recent example of nurses championing the rights of patients.  Many of the demands we are discussing this evening are linked to the quality of patient care.</P>
    <P>The motion in the name of the Fine Gael Party and the Minister's decision to grant the special inquiry into pay and <Col N="1451" /> conditions gives us an opportunity to discuss the outline of the new deal for the Irish nurses which will also benefit patient care.</P>
    <P>The special inquiry which the Minister has agreed to is sadly needed, given the historical lag in pay and conditions which has existed between the nursing profession and the other public services. I think there are two reasons for this lag. First, nursing has primarily been a woman's profession and, whatever about equal pay and increased opportunities for women, we have been very slow to change the stereotyped and discriminatory notion that a woman's profession is automatically linked to a lower rate of pay.  That is the mentality that still lies behind the low pay structure for nurses.  It is a mentality we must continue to fight and overcome.  The second reason is that there are so many applicants for nursing training each year.  It is a classic case of low wages in the case of readily available labour which is also a notion we must resist in our society now.  A better idea of what consideration should lie behind nurses' pay can be found in a resolution on nurses' remuneration passed by the International Labour Organisation, of which Ireland is a member, which says:</P>
    <P> Remuneration for nursing personnel should be fixed at levels commensurate with their socio-economic needs, their qualifications, their responsibilities, their duties and experience. It should also take into account the constraints and hazards inherent in the profession. </P>
    <P>A brief look at the pay structure of the nursing profession compared with that in the public and private sectors will be sufficient to demonstrate that nurses' pay in Ireland in no way meets the criteria set down by the International Labour Organisation.  One can compare the starting pay for a student nurse with leaving certificate at £47.18 with that of somebody joining the Army at 17½ or 18&mdash;I have just seen the advertisement on television&mdash;at £58.50.  I think the Minister will agree there is a great disparity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> As a student nurse she is not wholly a student; she is employed in very important work.  Much of the work undertaken by student nurses is not commensurate with the particular type of duties she has decided to undertake.  Much of it infringes on her actual training and educational work.  This must be accepted because I have seen it too often and for too long in hospitals, nurses expected to do work not in keeping with their training or obligations, and I have often felt it should not have been tolerated.</P>
    <P>They must pay for their maintenance out of £47.18.  The Minister will agree that is absolutely unrealistic especially when compared with other employments in the health service and the public service. Even in the case of the nurse with many years experience, pay has lagged far behind that in other forms of employment in the public service.  There is definitely a case of injustice against the nursing profession.  Anything we could do, other than setting up a special commission of inquiry to examine pay and related conditions, would be futile.</P>
    <P>The special inquiry must not resemble the committee set up in 1975.  In August of that year the Department set up a working party on the whole range of issues involved in nursing and, as far as I can understand, its final report is expected some time in 1979.  It would be wrong if this evening we were to allow any ambiguity in the terms of reference of this commission of inquiry into nurses' pay and related conditions.  I should like the Minister to lay down clearly and explicitly exactly what the commission of inquiry will do because I have great fears about the Department of Health and their commissions of inquiry. I often feel these are delaying and stalling tactics by the Department to leave the matter in abeyance and that in fact they are used as a political ploy by Governments&mdash;I do not blame any one Government&mdash;to put the matter on the shelf.  The committee set up four years ago was a scandal which we must not allow to continue when it can take so long to consider such basic issues.</P>
    <P>Having made the right decision about a special inquiry I hope the Minister will set the deadline at six months.  I should like to know exactly what will happen <Col N="1453" /> when the report of the commission is made known because we have had a few commissions of inquiry&mdash;the Conroy Commission on the Garda and the Devlin one&mdash;and I often feel such commissions involve no financial commitments and are a useful ploy of Government. When the report of this commission is published, can we have an indication from the Minister as to when its recommendations if accepted will be implemented? As I see it they will not be implemented in the 1979 budget year.  If the report is made in June 1979 at the latest the nurses cannot expect implementation of its recommendations before 1980, because they are not being provided for in the budget.  How does the Minister feel about this very important aspect?</P>
    <P>The Minister has changed his mind; he deserves credit for that.  Changing one's mind is difficult in politics.  The question of pay and conditions for nurses did not suddenly drop down from the sky in 1978 and it would be politically dishonest to imply that it did.  The problems have existed over a long period and a number of Governments were involved, but this does not excuse the present Government from their responsibility to act.  We should not allow the issues to become clouded by a political slagging match over who did what and when, or who got what Government to do such and such.  The problem is not new but we should approach it realistically.  Nurses have had a raw deal over the years.  We should debate the issues this evening and put forward useful, constructive suggestions as to how they might be best confronted.  It would be wrong simply to look upon this matter as certain increases that would be required. The only thing to do in a situation like this is to wipe the slate clean.</P>
    <P>We should evaluate a nurse in terms of education and training, of the hours she works and the abnormal work she is called upon to do.  There is a great barrier between nurses and doctors in conditions and pay, and there is very little in the degree of responsibility between a nurse and a doctor.  The other night I was examining what the consultants are seeking in the new common contracts, and there is talk about £27 an hour for <Col N="1454" /> consultants.  In regard to patient care it is ironic that we can talk about such figures and yet treat nurses so shabbily in terms of rates of pay.  Compared with even ten years ago, nurses nowadays have very grave responsibility in the care of patients.  In hospitals they are involved in very highly technological work in cardiac units where their responsibility would be perhaps greater than that of a doctor who can just look in casually and issue directions which a nurse must carry out.  She has responsibility over life and death.  It is ludicrous that an unskilled labourer can get more pay than a nurse.  Every one of us may be involved in this question of patient care, and only when we are at the receiving end of it do we realise how important the nurse is and how responsible is her position in the health service.  Nurses were very silent on the question of responsibility in the health service.  The injection work they do nowadays is highly complex and responsible and fraught with great danger.  The nurse is dealing in a highly technological world of medicine nowadays, and we have not made any attempt to assess her value in the health service.</P>
    <P>For instance, we have disregarded the nursing profession in the question of the health boards.  Doctors have obtained for themselves a very important place on the health boards far out of proportion to their numerical strength, and the nurses, who are four times as numerous, have not won their rightful place in the operation of the health service, especially with regard to membership of the health boards.  They were treated very shabbily.  I have often criticised the medical authorities for allowing this and for their silence in the face of this injustice to nurses who are their colleagues in the health service.  They did not do enough to support the demands of nurses.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation here tonight and we should all agree on this.  I would appreciate if the Minister would spell out exactly what he wants done to satisfy this profession.  It would be a tragedy and a disaster if the nurses were forced to take strike action, and we all know the consequences of such strike action.  We should not become involved in political <Col N="1455" /> wrangling over who is responsible.  The Minister should accept the fact that one political party have decided they can do this.  We will get a lot of work done in Government if we have a strong opposition pressing for this through motions in Private Members' time.  It would benefit the Government and the country to have an active opposition to do this.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept the motion from the Opposition without trying either to distort it or to ensure that the Opposition do not get credit for Private Members' motions such as this.  Such an attitude in politics would be wrong and regressive.  I would like the Minister to admit that nurses have had a raw deal, that they have not been compensated as they should be, that they do not get the hours, conditions and terms of employment that they should, and that he will see to it that they get them.  He should spell out specifically the terms of the motion and he should see to it that the Commission of Inquiry carry out exactly what we as legislators want for the nurses.  The Minister will be a big man and a statesman if he will stand up and say &ldquo;Yes I will get the full terms of this commission of inquiry spelled out in detail.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no argument whatsoever about the value of the nursing community.  The dedication of their long and very often unsocial hours of service and their loyalty to patients are undisputed.  Having listened to the previous two speakers, what saddens me is a definite attempt to make a political football out of this issue.  I resist this very strongly from the word go.  We have a Minister for Health who has a firm commitment to every aspect of the medical profession.  If one examines the record of his involvement in every sphere since he took office one finds the record speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>Full well we all know and recognise that nurses are not clock watchers.  Of their own choice they provide a full and thorough service to the community. They are a link, if one may put it that way, between the patient and the doctor. And what a very valuable link that is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Now the Minister is well aware that if there is a disruption in that role, any break in that link, the medical service will immediately start to disintegrate or crumble.  It has not started to crumble because the Minister is very quick to receive deputations or representations on any aspect of the medical services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has always had excellent relations with the nursing profession. Long may that continue.  Less than two months ago the telegram arrived from Bundoran and the Minister has now agreed to this commission of inquiry.  It would not serve any useful purpose to narrow the inquiry under the five headings set out in the motion.  When one considers all the ramifications and all the issues involved it becomes abundantly clear they could not possibly be tabulated under just five headings.</P>
    <P>Through my family I have been associated with various aspects of the medical profession.  I am well aware of the grievances nurses have, in many cases justifiable grievances of which the Minister also is aware.  In June last there was an award of a 15 per cent increase to nurses.  One Deputy put the case in regard to that 15 per cent award incorrectly. Roughly half was paid in June, approximately 3½ per cent more will be paid in January and another 3½ per cent in June next.  By next June, therefore, the maximum salary of a staff nurse will be of the order of £4,400.  In addition, there will be approximately another 12 or 13 per cent earned for double time, unsocial hours of working, and so on.  This will represent a further £600 or so.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that is enough. Nobody believes it is enough.  What can be done about it?  Throwing out figures for the sake of making an emotive and sensational case will not get anyone anywhere.  The nursing profession, which has been engaged in negotiations over the years, will see the falsity of that approach.  What the profession really wants is a direct say in the destiny of its own career and the formulation of standards and conditions governing the profession.  In other words, nurses want to know where they are going.  They want active participation in the higher echelons of power within the Department of Health.  This has already been <Col N="1458" /> granted to the profession.  Within a few weeks positions will be advertised inviting nurses to participate actively in the Department of Health so that they will know exactly where their profession is heading.  This is of paramount importance. Lack of active vocal participation has been a bone of contention for many years and I am delighted the aim of the profession will be realised in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I cannot let this opportunity pass without referring to the scheduled march tomorrow.  I do not see it as a protest march.  I see it as a march organised as part of a general information campaign and every Member of the Dáil should make himself or herself available to the members of the nursing profession because we all have to be educated about their needs, their grievances and so on.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow night the Minister will meet the representatives of the profession. There is no disinclination on the part of the Minister to meet militant marchers.  He is totally aware of the situation and wholly sympathetic towards the profession.  There is just no point in trying to put over the argument that the Minister is standing aloof.  He is highly sensitive to what is going on in negotiations.</P>
    <P>One speaker referred to the working party set up by the previous Government in 1975.  This working party seems to be very slow in producing any findings.  The Minister and his Department have repeatedly encouraged this working party to come forward with their findings as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Naturally there are areas of contention as there are areas of contention in any profession.  There is the question of overcrowding in hospitals.  There is the demand for recognition of post-graduate courses.  The Minister is considering the question of awards for extra diplomas in post-graduate training.</P>
    <P>This debate is not just about conditions and pay.  It is about everything relating to the well-being of the nursing profession.  It is not concerned specifically, in my opinion, with just one or two aspects of the profession.  As we all know, there is conciliation and arbitration machinery available for the purpose <Col N="1459" /> of negotiating salaries, hours of work and so on.  Last June a measure of agreement was reached on the 15 per cent increase to which I referred earlier.  But there are grievances apart from salary and the Minister is very anxious to discuss these grievances with the representatives of the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am totally in favour of upgrading the profession.  The role played by the nurse has increased over the past number of years.  Like all professions that of the nurse is evolving all the time.  It is within the Department of Health the real decision-making takes place and when the profession has got proper representation within the Department that will be a major step forward in improving the lot of the profession.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to participation on health boards.  I think that would be somewhat removed from the actual decision-making.  I believe it is much more important that members of the profession should actually work within the Department because there they can relate in a much better way to the profession as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is at cross-purposes with the Minister's thinking. The Minister wants the health boards to take the decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell can have his interpretation.  I have a different one.  I do not agree with this approach of using such a serious issue like a political football around the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 16,000 general nurses and 6,000 psychiatric nurses are employed in the health services.  They work an average of 40 hours per week, but they have appalling extra night duty, extra work on bank holidays and work coming up to Christmas.  Apart from the difficulties of their work nurses derive tremendous satisfaction from their duty or their vocation.  We must have a respect for their dedication.  Tomorrow evening the Minister will spell out clearly his future intentions in relation to the evolution and development of the nursing profession.  Expressing fears within the terms of this motion is meaningless. <Col N="1460" /> The nursing profession is much wider than just these few points.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give consideration to the question of a reward for service, for so many years work and so on. There should also be a reward for post-graduate education.  I know these issues are being actively examined at the moment and I feel the Minister will refer to them tomorrow night.</P>
    <P>In relation to salary structures, Deputy Boland spoke about hard cash which is very important.  I spoke to nurses recently who said that we hold our own when making a comparison with the nursing profession in England. The salary structures here are on a par or are even greater than in England.  For many years due to the non-availability of work but mainly due to the salary structure Irish nurses were forced to go to England.  The situation has changed and I welcome that change.  I would be glad if nurses were paid more, but their salaries must be realistically negotiated. We cannot give out large sums of money which cannot be substantiated through any health budget.  That would be mischievous and misleading.  It might be the popular thing to say &ldquo;pay nurses £10,000 or £12,000 a year,&rdquo; but it is just not possible.  The Minister will not adopt that approach but will constantly monitor the nursing profession, will keep in touch with their requirements and will have a sympathetic attitude to their working conditions.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some of the problem arose in the early years because the nursing profession evolved slowly and nurses were prepared to work appallingly long hours for little pay.</P>

I will be batting for them as I am sure will many Members of this House, but it is by a critical examination founded on fact that their case must be heard.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy O'Connell in congratulating the Minister.  Do not misunderstand me when I say that; I do not congratulate him for changing his mind because he did not change his mind.  The Minister succeeded in the last few weeks in changing the minds of his colleagues in Government so that he could be in a position to put down his amendment and to announce yesterday at his most recent meeting with the Nurses Organisation, that a committee of inquiry or a commission was being set up.  What I dislike about commissions is that&mdash;and as a member of a government for many years this has been my experience, as I am sure it has been the experience of other Members&mdash;if one wants to do nothing about something, one sets up a commission. In the library in this House there is a large bookcase full of commission reports; nobody knows what is in them, and certainly they have never been acted upon.  I advised the nurses in my constituency, because of my abhorrence of commissions, that they had made a mistake in looking for a commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not change his mind, <Col N="1462" /> the Minister wanted to do something about the situation in which nurses now find themselves.  Over generations no charter has ever been set out for the nursing profession.  The profession is manned by people with a vocation who were perhaps educated to the view that it was wrong in their profession, important as it is, to ever contemplate industrial action such as has been used and abused by many others in our community to feather their own nests.  It may be regarded as an advance that the nursing organisation in recent months decided to delete the &ldquo;no strike&rdquo; clause from their organisation articles.  In another way it is a tragedy that it had to come to the point where the &ldquo;no strike&rdquo; clause had to be removed.  Without any question the organisation of nurses over the years has been anything but methodical or professional. It is only now that they, like some other bodies who were getting nowhere in the past with those they negotiated with because they did not have the clout, have the professional approach and have got for themselves a professional secretariat.  I hope that the secretary is the driving force behind correlating their demands, bringing them to a head and getting something done about them.</P>
    <P>The pay structures are well known and can be readily ascertained but some of the highlights mentioned by Deputy Boland are worth thinking about.  The pay of a nurse in the first year after she qualifies is equal to that of a trainee psychiatric nurse.  It is also true that health board clerical staff are on the same scale or, to put it another way, fully trained nurses are on the same scale as clerical staff.  It is also true that the incremental movement of nurses' salaries is not what it should be and ranges broadly from £57 to £75 per week.  That is as far as it can go.  When a nurse moves to a sister's post the recognition is that on appointment a sister starts at the maximum of a staff nurses' pay.  It is unusual for a nurse to reach sister status without first having reached, and exceeded, staff nurse pay.</P>
    <P>The whole system in regard to pay in the immediate vicinity of the trained nurse in her early years, and at the top of the scale, and that of the sisters in charge does not recognise their responsibilities <Col N="1463" /> or experience gained over the years in the form of pay.  There was no noise when the doctors got a 25 per cent increase and I saw a headline in a newspaper last week to the effect that they had refused £730 per week.  There was mention tonight that they were looking for £27 per hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Those figures are a bit erratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>And so is the Minister's attitude to the nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe they are but one thing which is not contained in any of those figures is what they earn outside their salaries and that is far greater, in the case of any worthwhile consultant, than what they would receive if they got £27 per hour.  Even if the figures I quoted are too high there is enough being made on the side by them to far exceed my figures.</P>
      <P>Can anybody say with sincerity, or with any hope of being believed, that a doctor is worth 12 nurses?  That is the evaluation we have at present.  In fact, if the truth was known the more successful doctors at the top of their scale are getting more than any 12 nurses.  We also have a bad situation in relation to holidays. Nurses receive 23 working days holidays, plus days <i>in lieu</i> of bank holidays but clerical officers in health boards receive half-days and Church holy days also.  They are nearly as good as the continentals.  It is probable that we are taking after the EEC in this regard but if we are we should not forget the nurses and give them the half-days and church holy days in addition to what they have.  We have heard about a 40-hour week for them but that is a 40-hour week plus the half-hours they are allowed for meals, where they are allowed any time for meals.  It should be remembered that night nursing staff do not have any time allowed for meals but on the psychiatric nursing side time is allowed for meals and the night staff have their meals supplied free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not advocating that we take that concession from the psychiatric night nursing staff but what I have indicated <Col N="1464" /> makes it clear that psychiatric nurses, much fewer in number but far more important where the clout and organisation are concerned, have won these things for themselves while the general nursing service have remained behind.  We have heard talk about the responsibility that nurses carry and comparisons between that responsibility and that of doctors. Unlike the other speakers I cannot speak from experience in the medical profession but it is well known that nurses carry a responsibility equal to and in most cases far exceeding that of the medical staff whom they serve.  If it was not for the nursing staff being exploited in many cases by the doctors&mdash;I say that deliberately&mdash;those doctors would not be as successful financially or otherwise as they are at present.</P>
    <P>I also understand that the minimum qualification for going for nursing training here is not intermediate certificate standard, something which I did not realise until recently and that not only is it not intermediate certificate but leaving certificate is not sufficient unless certain subjects are passed to a certain degree. Only a small quota of those offering and seeking to get training are taken in.  A lot of those unsuccessful applicants go to England to get trained and, fortunately, a lot of them return here and we get the benefit of the training they got in that country.  It is totally wrong to talk about the regulation which indicates that the entrance point, educationally speaking, is intermediate certificate.  Some leaving certificate subjects are compulsory, particularly maths.  The nurses, literally and methaphorically, carry the can as far as the operation of our hospital service is concerned and nobody can deny that although some on whom it may reflect may attempt to do so.</P>

      <P>Saint Brendan's Hospital, Grangegorman, as it was known, has conditions which would make every member of our society ashamed because we are treating poor helpless people in appalling conditions. No self-respecting government or parliament should tolerate them.  Following a protest by junior non-consulting doctors who were repelled by the abnormal and appalling conditions in the hospital I visited the institution.  Those doctors said it was rat-infested and unclean and there was no exaggeration on their part in the protest they made to the Minister for Health.  I should like to state that they made a private protest to the Minister and did not wish to publicise it but the fact that their protest was treated with contempt and indifference prompted them to make the facts public.</P>
      <P>The protest that they made is no exaggeration. I went on tour of the hospital and I will not easily forget what I saw. We are treating defenceless, helpless human beings in that hospital worse than we treat animals.  When I visited the hospital there was a deliberate cover up, which I just realised when speaking to nurses working in the hospital.  It transpired that I was only shown part of the hospital and not only that but there were places which were purposely cleaned only hours before I went there.  I will give a description of one of the wards; one old lady was lying there with the paint falling on top of her as men were working in the ward.  What I saw of the bathrooms and the toilets I could not describe adequately.  Their condition was appalling.  We are allowing this to take place in our society; poor defenceless people who are not able to speak out for themselves are living in conditions more reminiscent of the seventeenth or eighteenth century than today.  The men and women sitting there in those depressing wards, depressed and lonely, could not but deteriorate in the conditions which I saw there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am asking for is immediate action to improve the conditions of these most defenceless people in our society. Over and over again conditions in psychiatric <Col N="1466" /> hospitals have been exposed.  I have attempted to expose them on many occasions.  Indeed, I first exposed the conditions in St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane where I saw 96 in one ward. There were two open toilets for the use of those 96 women.  Every attempt was made to cover up on that at the time and conditions are still bad there.  But my visit to St. Brendan's was most depressing. When junior doctors or anyone else try to expose such conditions the Minister should in all honesty and, having regard to his position, personally visit the hospital to see for himself the conditions existing there.  It would not be wrong for him to visit the hospital.  He should not ignore the problem and he should not lay the blame for it on anyone but the Department of Health which should provide the money.  The Minister may say he gave £200,000 or twice that, but the situation is that conditions could not be worse there.  There are dirty, filthy kitchens that have not been painted or even cleaned in years.  I saw a wild bird come in through the window, flying around the kitchen and its droppings all over the food.  Not only did I see it but newspaper men saw it.  I saw baths that one would not see discarded in fields used for patients.  They are human beings.  They need help.  If they have to live in mental hospitals let them do so in a degree of comfort and privacy which they do not have at present.</P>
    <P>It would not be right to condemn the conditions of a hospital without offering some constructive suggestions.  I feel that the situation at St. Brendan's, if we are to be realistic about it, could be remedied at no cost whatsoever to the Exchequer.  There are 87 acres up there at St. Brendan's.  Thirty-seven acres of that could be sold immediately for housebuilding purposes.  It is centre city development land and it could easily be disposed of.  There is no doubt that at £20,000 an acre it would fetch £7 million. So that we have immediately £7 milmillion and I understand that £10 million, spent over the next five years, would bring about very comfortable conditions for these patients.  I do not think that is a lot to ask over and above the normal maintenance costs of this hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> I recognise that there was a recession; I recognise that the money was not available for normal maintenance.  But we are not talking about normal maintenance; we are talking about the appalling conditions that have existed for 30 years there.  I have exposed it on previous occasions.  I tried, through our medical newspaper, to highlight the position there so that doctors would join in this protest.  There are consultant psychiatrists working there who are precluded from highlighting the conditions there by the terms of their employment. There is a statement just issued by the medical union to the effect that the consultants, under a clause of their contract, are not allowed to expose or refer to the conditions in the hospital in which they work.  So we have people working in these conditions and I must say I have never seen such dedicated people as the nurses and doctors I have seen working in these conditions.  I do not know how they keep their sanity working there.  It is the most depressing place I have ever had the displeasure of being in and patients there could not but deteriorate in conditions such as exist there today.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for the closure of the hospital.  All I am asking is that the Minister go and visit it.  There could be some simple changes carried out.  Parts of that hospital need to be closed immediately because they prove a serious fire hazard.  Indeed, the top floor of one building there is a fire hazard because the elderly people there could not negotiate the narrow stairways to get out in the event of a fire and I understand from talking to some nurses there that there was a fire and it was a miracle that people were saved.  I am saying that parts of that hospital should be closed immediately.  There are many hospitals around the city that could take in the geriatric cases that are at present in St. Brendan's.  Some of the hospitals that could take these patients are Cherry Orchard, Clonskeagh Hospital and Kilcroney.  We should mobilise these places to take some of these patients urgently, especially the geriatric patients who should not be in St. Brendan's in the first place.  I am asking that these hospitals be asked to provide the beds <Col N="1468" /> for these patients and that parts of St. Brendan's be closed immediately.</P>
    <P>The chief psychiatrist of the Eastern Health Board maintains that proper services could be rendered, that proper physical comforts for the patients could be provided and also that parts of this hospital should be closed down immediately. This should be done.  What the non-consultant hospital doctors ask for are simple things like cleaning the place, providing proper heating for the patients and providing proper sanitary facilities.  They refer to the fact that it is extremely dirty, that it is overcrowded and lacks any adequate sanitary facilities.</P>
    <P>I have read the report of the programme manager who confirms the fact that the heating is inadequate, that conditions there are bad.  He says that despite the fact that the physical conditions in the hospital are bad it is rendering a tolerable service.  This is not good enough for these people.  I am asking the Minister to visit it to see for himself the appalling conditions there because no words of mine could describe them.  The Minister should make the necessary money available immediately by disposing of the land as I have suggested.  He should consult with the Eastern Health Board so that they could provide beds in Clonskeagh Fever Hospital, in Cherry Orchard and places like Kilcroney and so enable the relevant parts of St. Brendan's Hospital to be closed.</P>

      <P>The publicity about St. Brendan's has helped to some extent to bring home to the general public the reality behind the public relations facade which the Minister for Health has been engaging upon since his assumption of office.  The fact that the non-consultant hospital doctors in the hospital took the most unusual step for anyone engaged in the medical profession of publicly releasing their complaints is indicative of the condition of part of the hospital.  Those doctors are to be congratulated for what they did.  There was no onus on them. They were doctors working for the health board as many pople had done before them and yet they took it upon themselves to make public the facts as they saw them.  They deserve credit for <Col N="1469" /> what they did and I am not at all prepared to subscribe to the point of view that they caused unnecessary ripples or that they did not go through the proper channels.</P>
      <P>They wrote to the Minister about this matter and received a reply from him on 19 October.  They replied by letter dated 27 October complaining about specific items and areas and said that if the Minister refused to go to the hospital and if those items and areas were still without attention they intended making this correspondence public.  They did not do that for a further fortnight when the Minister had time to act if he wished.  He apparently did nothing more and the correspondence was published.  The option afforded was not accepted.  The invitation to visit the hospital was not accepted and consequently the people who feel annoyed should not be.</P>
      <P>The doctors complained about the level of cleanliness in wards of the hospital.  During my recent visit I found that walls and parts of wards of that hospital were dirty.  Everybody there agreed that the walls were dirty.  I do not believe it is acceptable to have walls in public places as dirty as the walls of that hospital are.  I accept that the patients, because of their particular handicap, might not be the easiest patients to mind but nevertheless the level of cleanliness in some of the wards which is not the fault of the staff is unjustifiable.</P>
      <P>There are a number of wards in the hospital which have been renovated and I was impressed by the services provided in those wards when one bears in mind the age of this building.  They represent substantial improvements since I last visited the hospital some years ago.  The conditions in the wards which have not been renovated can only be described as dickensian and deplorable.  If the toilets and service kitchens attached to some of the wards in St. Brendan's were attached to restaurants and hotels those places would be closed down by the Minister's officials and the owners would be prosecuted.  If the officers of the court saw such toilets attached to restaurants they would impose the maximum penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an overnight situation.  It is a very old building which would cost a <Col N="1470" /> very large sum of money to renovate. We are talking about a vast programme which the Eastern Health Board are trying to have implemented to improve areas of this hospital over a five year period and to close down parts of it.  I was amazed when the Minister first reacted to the criticism in an interview on the Friday to hear him say that it was part of his policy to completely close down this hospital.  That was the first I heard that it was Government policy to completely close down this hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will get his ten minutes.  He seems anxious to speak now but he was not anxious earlier tonight for some strange reason.  The policy of the Eastern Health Board was to close down a considerable area of this hospital and to retain part of it in conjunction with some specialist buildings such as the community care centre for a particular area of Dublin.</P>
      <P>When I visited the hospital I saw toilets attached to wards where there were incontinent patients who had to be changed sometimes twice a night but there were no sluice rooms attached to those wards.  The soiled bed linen had to be sluiced in the single bath that was available in the washroom attached to those wards and the patients were washed in the bath afterwards.  Those are the facilities which are available to the staff there.</P>
      <P>The complaints made about rat and mice infestation were highlighted but I got no evidence from anybody of rat infestation. There is mice infestation which I understand is a problem in many public buildings.  None of the people I spoke to were prepared to say that there were rats in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the complaint about a lack of bedside lockers and no place for patients' clothes, I saw bathrooms with <Col N="1471" /> baths on one side and racks of patients' clothes along the other side because there was nowhere else to hang them. That is the type of facilities being complained about.  It is a long time since I was a member of the Dublin Health Authority and heard of the proposal to have this hospital phased out.  I am afraid some of the senior medical staff, who also had administrative responsibility, will have to take some of the blame for the criticism in regard to this hospital.  There was a tendency to flit about like butterflies from one aspect to the other of the mental services that did not help in having an orderly development. Certain areas were sometimes concentrated on and sometimes ignored. The fear now is that if this hospital is improved money may be diverted from the community care programme but that should not be the case.  In order that the community care programme may be a comprehensive programme it must be arranged with a certain amount of institutional care in the mental handicap services.  There has been a tendency to concentrate on one aspect or another of the services to the detriment of others. This has been because of the policy of certain senior administrative people in that hospital.  This needs looking into.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board proposal to improve this hospital over five years should not be shortened to a two or three year phased programme.  There are certain wards in the hospital which should be closed down immediately.  St. Brendan's is not unique.  There are other hospitals in the Dublin area, notably part of St. Ita's, where the temporary buildings built 90 years ago are still being filled with patients.  There are psychiatric hospitals in some parts of the country that have unsanitary and unhygienic conditions because of the age of the buildings.  The hospital services generally could best be served now by conducting a public inquiry into the level of facilities provided in public hospitals but especially in the psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>The conditions in St. Brendan's hospital and others which have not been highlighted are a testimonial of shame which society should bear because it has <Col N="1472" /> not wanted to know about the mentally handicapped.  We must all ensure that the matters raised by those junior hospital doctors are not brushed to one side, that public money is set aside in the health budget for services for the mentally handicapped and that an inquiry be held into the conditions of St. Brendan's hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to point out is that since I assumed office neither of the Deputies who have spoken ever mentioned St. Brendan's Hospital in the House or put down a Parliamentary Question about it.  With regard to my going to visit St. Brendan's Hospital, I am endeavouring to do so.  It would have been very difficult for me to do that in the last couple of weeks because there was such a scramble of politicians seeking to get up there to get in on the act that I would have found it very difficult to get there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My association with St. Brendan's Hospital is very clear.  I want, first of all, to indicate to Deputy Boland that in January 1978 in connection with the capital allocation for 1978 I made it quite clear that it was my policy to close down St. Brendan's and for that purpose I was this year allocating in the capital allocation the first amount of money for that purpose.  If Deputy Boland was not aware of that being the policy which was being implemented then I suggest the fault is his and not mine.  Secondly, in regard to St. Brendan's, because in 1976 there were savage cutbacks by the National Coalition Government, when not one penny was spent on that hospital or any other mental hospital.  I made special provision in 1978 for St. Brendan's Hospital.  I provided £200,000 for some minor works.  I also made <Col N="1473" /> available to the Eastern Health Board a special sum of £360,000 for the type of works which are badly needed in St. Brendan's.</P>
    <P>The overall policy in relation to St. Brendan's is to close it down and in pursuance of that policy the number of patients has been steadily reduced. Throughout the city the programme of providing hostels for community mental care is being pursued steadily and the situation is that the only possible ultimate solution is to close St. Brendan's. This policy is being pursued by me as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>In case some Deputy may suggest that I did not advert to this situation before it reached crisis level, I availed specifically of a recent dinner at which psychiatrists were present to draw attention to the position of long-term patients in mental hospitals throughout the country.  I pointed out there were about 10,000 long-stay patients who were totally dependent on the particular mental hospital in which they were living and I said that too many of them were still living in drab, overcrowded conditions bereft of many things which most of us would consider essential to make life tolerable.  I said that they were our fellow citizens with a right to a life of dignity and self-respect and that there was a moral obligation on us to do what we could as quickly as possible to improve their conditions and standards.  That the conditions existing in some mental hospitals have not been improved long ago is a reflection of the lack of any great level of public concern about them. I said that Governments generally respond to public demand, particularly if it is articulated in a definite and sustained manner.  What I said on that occasion is a little ironic.  I said &ldquo;Would that some of the marches that have taken place, the banners that have been waved, the drums beaten about, for instance, the role of the general hospitals had been undertaken to procure improvements in the district mental hospitals&rdquo;.  I mention that to indicate to the House that I was not unaware, unsympathetic or insensitive to the conditions pertaining in many of our mental hospitals throughout the country and in particular to St. Brendan's.</P>
    <P>Of course there are other mental <Col N="1474" /> hospitals throughout the country which are accommodated in old, unsuitable buildings also.  I shall refer to just two of such hospitals which I visited recently: one was Our Lady's Hospital in Ennis and the other was the hospital in Mullingar. The buildings in question are old and no great amount of money has been spent on structural improvements.  But it was a pleasure to go into those wards. They were clean, bright and cheerful and efforts were made at ward and hospital level to do something about the difficult, drab and unsatisfactory conditions.  The staff, doctors and nurses, and the local health committees buy curtains, they provide flowers in the wards and they provide the little amenities that change a dull, drab, depressing ward into a tolerable living place.</P>

In respect of many of the matters mentioned in this debate, any reasonable person will admit that they are not something of national policy, and are not something for which the Minister for Health or his advisers are responsible.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.</P>
      <P>An amount of £89,000 has already been voted in the current financial year for archaeological excavations by the National Museum, £85,000 of which was intended for the Wood Quay excavation. I propose to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in due course for a further amount of £62,000 for the current financial year.  The required provision in any subsequent financial year is a matter to be determined in the context of the preparation of the Estimates for the Public Service for that year.</P>
      <P>There are 19 professional assistants and 41 labourers engaged on the excavation of the Wood Quay site by the National Museum at present, under the supervision of an officer of the museum's permanent staff, who is fulltime on this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> As the portion of the site which is being excavated has been declared a national monument the joint consent of the Commissioners of Public Works and of the Dublin Corporation to the excavation work being done is required in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the National Monuments Act, 1930.  The present position in that regard is that, as announced some time ago, the commissioners and corporation have jointly consented to allow the period up to 9 December 1978 for excavation pending final decision by the Government on the future of the site.  The National Museum proposes to continue with the excavation work for the duration of the period authorised.</P>

It is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and a copy of the account with his comments, if any, thereon are included in the annual volume of Appropriation Accounts which is presented to Dáil Éireann and subsequently examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to interest incurred for personal, non-business, purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer to the four queries are as follows: (i) in 1853; (ii) some £16 million was forgone in the tax year 1976-77, which is the latest year for which figures are available; (iii) implicit in the provision&mdash;which, following a change in 1974, is now limited to £2,000 interest a year&mdash;is the view that certain bank interest can reasonably be included in the very limited category of outgoings allowable <Col N="1346" /> as a personal deduction for income tax purposes; (iv) it is estimated that some 146,000 taxpayers, being about 20 per cent of all taxpayers, were allowed a deduction for personal interest in the tax year 1976-77.</P>

      <P>Income tax relief for life insurance contributions has been available in this country since 1853.  The tax relief is given in order to encourage long-term savings by taxpayers and to encourage taxpayers to make a long-term commitment for the financial protection of their families in the event of unexpected death.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 320,000 taxpayers, being about 43 per cent of all taxpayers, were given the relief in the tax year 1976-77&mdash;the latest year for which relevant information is available.  The cost of the giving of the relief in that year was about £6 million.</P>

    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>(1)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown are therefore estimated.</P>
    <P>(2)  Chapter II of the Finance Act, 1974, provided for the taxation of farming profits as profits from carrying on a trade.  For 1974/75 the dates of payment of tax in respect of profits or gains from carrying on a trade were 1 January 1975, and 1 July 1975.  Accordingly, there was no receipt of income tax from farming profits in the calendar year 1974.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 428 and 429 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there is public concern about the condition of the flats at Fassaroe Park, Bray.  Bray Urban District Council requested me to make capital money available to them to enable them to finance certain work to the flats considered necessary by their consultant architect to alleviate problems of dampness and condensation caused mainly by insufficient ventilation and the improper use by the tenants of the heating system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> In reply to the council's request, I emphasised that the provision of new local authority dwellings for families who are urgently awaiting rehousing must of necessity take priority, that the limited resources of capital moneys available to me must be conserved for this purpose and that, consequently, it is not at present possible to allocate capital to any local authority to finance work on existing dwellings however desirable such work might be to improve the standard and living conditions of the dwellings. I have, however, suggested to the council that they examine the possibility of carrying out the work to the flats on a phased basis from the revenue available to them for repair and maintenance in conjunction with encouraging the tenants to have fireplaces or solid fuel burners installed with the aid of the grants and loans available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I received a request from the urban council to receive a deputation to discuss the condition of the flats but I have already informed them that, in the circumstances outlined above, no useful purpose would be served by the reception of a deputation to discuss the matter at this stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the exceptional and sustained increase in the demand for driving tests over the past year, there is at present an abnormal waiting period for driving tests throughout the country. The period is about 22 weeks in the Dublin area.  The number of applications <Col N="1366" /> for tests was over 94,000 in 1977 and, on present trends, this will rise to 110,000 in the current year.  Five additional posts of driver tester have so far been filled this year and I expect that four further appointments will be made in the next month or so.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 452 and 453 together.</P>
      <P>The distinction drawn between the grades of officer and servant in the local authority area generally is governed by section 2 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 as amended by section 26 of the Local Government Act (No. 9 of 1955).</P>
      <P>In the case of vocational education committees, the relevant statutory provision is section 23 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  Traditionally in the vocational education area, the term officer is applied to the teaching and administrative employees of committees and that of servant to other categories of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualification prescribed for the post of technician in a regional technical college is an appropriate national certificate or approved equivalent.  Holders <Col N="1378" /> of the appropriate national diploma may be allowed to enter the salary scale at the second point.  The qualification prescribed for the post of Class III teacher is a degree of a recognised degree-awarding authority or the certificate/diploma of one of the Department's teacher training courses.</P>
