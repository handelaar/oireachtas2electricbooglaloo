      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach why he refused to answer Question No. 243 which I addressed to him as Head of the Government and why he transferred it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs when it was clearly a matter that could only be answered appropriately by the Head of the Government responsible for the Ministers whom he had appointed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I referred to the Minister's statement in regard to re-organisation of local government and I recalled that a former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Molloy, did issue a discussion document on this very important matter.  It was a well presented document giving great food for thought and I am sure the feedback to the Minister was very valuable.  Since then the city has changed somewhat and we must now take another look at the matter.  I would suggest that Dublin, which has now become so very big, should be sub-divided into local councils and I would ask the Minister to consider bringing back local councils like the old Pembroke, Rathmines, Glasnevin and Drumcondra ones, so that we would have real local government. These local councillors should be elected by the people and given certain functions of a local nature.  These small councils would then send delegates to the city council which would have the overall running of the city.  In that way the smaller councils would be integrated in the structure.  In that way we would have real local government and we could build up a very healthy structure of civic government involving as many people as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last revision of electoral areas was hardly equitable when one remembers <Col N="1548" /> that a man in No. 9 area represents about 30,000 people, far too big a number for any one man to represent. It just cannot be done.  The No. 9 area has 60,000 voters and, if you multiply that by three, you get the total population of the area.  It is far too big to ask any councillor to look after it properly. Perhaps the Minister would refer to this when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Division of the city must come very shortly.  One of the problems at the moment weighing against progress is the rapid growth all the time.  This trend has been deplored.  It has been going on since the industrial revolution but it has become accelerated in recent years.  We made the mistake of trying to stop the drift to Dublin by making Dublin unattractive.  We developed industries in provincial areas. This was a good idea but unfortunately we forgot about the people in the city with no employment and we now have the awful spectre of 50 per cent unemployment. We must now reverse our policy.  We should, of course, make areas outside the city attractive but we should also have a balanced policy in regard to the capital city.  It is anticipated that the population in Dublin will reach 1,000,000 in due process of time and provision must be made for these people.  Again, city dwellers cannot just migrate to other areas and set up new homes.  They have been living for generations in the city and the Government, aided by private enterprise, must now start giving Dublin a new deal.  The deprived areas in Dublin cannot be matched anywhere.  They are no hope areas.  The people in these areas have stopped hoping.  The best merely survive and many of the others go under.</P>
    <P>We have to restructure vast areas of this city.  Last night I recalled the action of some industrialists at the beginning of the century when they built places like the Iveagh Trust flats and the Markets.  At that time that was a great advance and provided much needed accommodation in the city.  Today, the private sector will have to join the Government and the local authority in rebuilding part of the city in order to give hope to the people living in these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> The housing situation has improved greatly in recent years but we still have a housing problem in these areas.  We must have a look at the dwellings built in the thirties.  While they are still habitable and some families are happy living in them, they do not stand up to examination by modern standards.  We may be forced to do what the local authorities in Britain and the United States are doing: pulling down dwellings built about 30 years ago because the sociologists have discovered that some of those houses were not conductive to good living.  We may have to start not alone building more dwellings but carry out a greater clearance in the city areas.</P>
    <P>There are four or five areas both north and south of the Liffey which will have to be made reclearance areas because there are some very bad buildings there.  Although some people are content to live there, others may revolt; and who can blame them?  If one walks through one of these areas one is immediately aware of the depressing atmosphere.  What chance has any boy or girl born into any of those areas to get a proper education, obtain employment and become a good citizen?  These young people show their revolt in many ways, such as by acts of vandalism and so on.  We must bear with them.  We must correct our omissions and see what we have contributed to this type of violence. While we all deplore violence we must realise that we are to blame in part for some of it.</P>
    <P>The Government were criticised because the White Paper suggested they would not be giving as much attention to the rebuilding of the centre of the city as they should.  That White Paper says what I am saying: that we must bring the private sector to bear their share in the redevelopment of this city.  This redevelopment will be hampered by the very high price of land.  From this morning's newspapers one can see how house prices in Dublin have escalated.  It is almost impossible for the local authority to buy land in the centre city areas.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister for <Col N="1550" /> Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development look at ways of helping the local authority to buy land.  The finances of a local authority are not endless, and they find it almost impossible to acquire land in centre city areas.  We are building some dwellings in centre city areas. Each unit will cost approximately £25,000, because the local authority had to acquire the land, clear it and pay compensation.  Could we institute some kind of land bond so that the local authority could acquire land and the repayments would be spread over a number of years?  In this way they would not have to pay immediately for every acre they buy.  If somebody does not come up with a solution to this problem we will not see the centre city redeveloped and we will not have a living city.  Office blocks are no substitution for family dwellings.  There may be a reason for building office blocks on the north side of the Liffey because it might improve the appearance of these depressed areas.</P>
    <P>People who want to live in the centre of the city should be given the opportunity to do so.  Our first priority must be housing.  I appreciate the tremendous cost involved and that is why I say the private sector must play their part.  If industrialists at the beginning of the century recognised that they had an obligation to invest in the development of the city in which they made their profits surely there is still an onus on industrial and commercial enterprises to do this today.  We have seen gestures of this type from some go-ahead commercial and industrial enterprises.  I appeal to them to come forward with a plan and to show their faith in the city by injecting a plentiful supply of money to rebuild the deprived areas of the city and make it a good place in which to live.  It will be a tremendous task and will take the efforts of everybody&mdash;Government, local authority and private enterprise &mdash;but it must be done.  If the democratic State do not do it, some people who do not believe in a democratic State may try to achieve their ends by any means and this could lead to more violence.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned <Col N="1551" /> the progress being made to house itinerants.  There have been great strides made in this direction, but this is a very tricky problem.  We are all inclined to say &ldquo;Yes, we must house the itinerants but not where I live&rdquo;.  We must get over that attitude. This city has the most go-ahead body in the country to look after itinerants. There are several magnificent places for them.  The real answer is to integrate them into our society.  They should not be placed in special centres but in housing estates.  This raises a problem.  Many itinerants collect old scrap and it is not very nice to see a scrap heap in a residential area, and people resent this.</P>
    <P>We differentiate between the itinerants who do not settle down but who want to live in their roadside camps, and some of the well-heeled traders who live in luxury caravans, carry on their trade buying and selling on the roadways and who leave the sites in a disgraceful state when they move on. We may be planning some policy in regard to these traders.  They do the real itinerants a great injustice because the urban dweller and even the rural dweller is inclined to bunch them all together and to say that they are well off.  The real itinerant is not very well off.  There is something very tragic about a child begging on O'Connell Bridge or in Cork, Galway or anywhere else.  The child is the victim of the system, of lack of parental control or lack of care by the State.  I feel sure that under the present Minister there will be further headway in the drive towards giving itinerants a better way of life.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to all those people who voluntarily give their time and offices in trying to help the itinerants. In particular, I pay tribute to Mr. Bewley and to those unnamed members of religious orders who do so much to educate these children.  It may not be popular today to praise the religious orders but in this and many other fields they are doing colossal work which will be of lasting benefit not only to the itinerants but to our whole society.  I hope that all itinerant families who wish to settle will be <Col N="1552" /> given the opportunity to do so.  There may be historic reasons why they are itinerants but it is our job to give them every assistance to settle down and become good members of society.  Their children are deprived from the moment they are born and we must do everything possible to give them a better way of life.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to the workings of the 1969 Housing Act.  This was introduced in order to prevent people from demolishing habitable buildings without permission.  Local authorities are doing their best under the Planning Act and this Housing Act to ensure proper planning and to preserve as many buildings as possible.  It is just as important to preserve the existing stock as it is to build new houses.  The Act needs to be examined because it is weak in certain aspects.  It is no trouble at all to the ruthless developer.  A house on a good residential road may be left vacant for a while; windows will be broken and squatters will move in and the house will become derelict almost overnight.  Local residents will ask for something to be done and the developer will move in.  People will have anything rather than a derelict house full of squatters.  Under the Act the local authority have the power to go in and repair that house but I do not know of one case where this has been done. I am told that the local authority are not happy about going into such a house and repairing it because it could be said that they had damaged the house and the owner could bring an action against them.  The vast majority of developers are responsible people who want to do a good job but there is a minority who play all kinds of tricks, including the use of itinerants. They bring itinerants to live in a house so that they may knock it down and get planning permission more quickly. I would ask the Minister to strengthen the Housing Act.</P>
    <P>Two or three years ago we had a special conservation year which was intended to preserve the best things in the country.  Conservation is not an easy matter because the more industrialised we become the greater is the challenge to our existing amenities.  It is often very difficult to <Col N="1553" /> decide between the preservation of an amenity and the factory which will employ 100 people.  One cannot generalise about this problem; each case must be examined on its merits. We can, of course, have overall preservation areas but I often feel that we are hypocritical in that while we will not allow a factory which may pollute the air we do not object to our people having to go to some foreign part to find employment.  Once they are out of our sight we forget about them.  I applaud the efforts of the conservationists and the preservationists because they make us think about what we are doing, but we must have a balanced point of view.  We must remember the difficulty experienced by our young people in obtaining employment and bear this in mind, as well as our conservation laws, when considering each application for a factory.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister is creating jobs for young people in local government.  I applaud this and I hope that he will expand this policy.  A lot of work could be done by young people until such time as they take up a real career.  If we could give them this kind of interim work it would help them and help the country in general.</P>
    <P>Regarding the pollution of rivers, someone has said that local authorities are the worst offenders. However, all over the world there are big cities which have cleansed their rivers and brought back marine life. I pay tribute to the Greater London Council for the work they have done in regard to the River Thames.  A few years ago the Thames was so poisoned that to fall into it meant almost instant death.  They have spent vast sums on cleansing the river and they have now brought back fish life.  That river carries a tremendous amount of shipping from all over the world, much more than is carried by any of our rivers.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area the Grand Canal drainage scheme and the Dodder Valley drainage scheme will bring about a great improvement <Col N="1554" /> within two years.  The Dodder will be made as clean as possible and the Liffey will be much cleaner.  Any river which is used by shipping is likely to be polluted by oil.  We must tighten the laws and anyone who breaks them must be made to pay the cost of repairing the damage.  We must be really tough on those who unnecessarily or wantonly pollute air, land or rivers.</P>
    <P>The same applies in regard to our streets.  This city has not an enviable reputation regarding cleanliness.  There are, however, vast areas of the city where one will see very clean streets but we are still not getting the message across that the prevention of pollution starts with each one of us.  Throwing litter on the streets is the same as any other kind of pollution. Appeals to people do not seem to have the effect that we hoped for.  It is only a minority of people who litter the streets.  Perhaps the Minister would put forward a scheme in conjunction with the local authorities to keep Ireland beautiful. It is not just a matter of visual offence. It is a matter of economics because tourists will not come to a place that is not clean.  In that area many of the continental cities are an example to us.  They may err in other ways but one seldom sees littered streets in European countries.  I would ask the Minister to urge local authorities to step up their drive against pollution in all its aspects.  It is a matter of education and, while I hate adding to the burden of schools, I would ask the school authorities to appeal to their students not to pollute our cities or the countryside.  The young people are the future builders and the future government of the country and they should be encouraged, as part of their duty to their own community, to keep our country clean.</P>
    <P>Now that we are a member of the EEC we have greater weapons in our fight for the proper preservation of the environment.  I am not just speaking of the money that may be available for this purpose.  The peoples of the other eight nations in the Community are very conscious of the need to preserve the environment so that people <Col N="1555" /> may live proper lives in their own communities.  The technological age has brought problems.  Many people fear the nuclear plants although I do not know if we know enough about the whole matter to condemn or accept them.  However, all the time people are arguing about nuclear plants they are causing damage to their health because of pollution of the environment. It will cost a lot of money to prevent pollution but it will cost much more if we do not take effective steps in this matter.  I would urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about rebuilding the centre part of Dublin.  Other cities throughout the country have the same problem but not to the same extent. It is no consolation to tell us that cities like New York or London have this frightful problem; for some reason the centre of those cities has decayed also. It may be wrong to compare Dublin with New York or London because of the difference in size but basically the problem is the same.  We must face the fact that it will cost a tremendous amount of money to do the job I mentioned for our city.  I invite any Member of the House to walk around some of the deprived parts of this city. He or she will get some idea of what has to be done.  We could adopt some of our preservation policies to help in the matter.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to mention our canals.  The Grand Canal is in a fairly good state in most parts of the city but unfortunately the same cannot be said for the Royal Canal. We could start some major public works on both canals, particularly on the Royal Canal.  It would be possible to have a waterway almost to Belfast, to the west and to the south.  Our roads may become so overburdened with traffic that we may have to use the canals as a means of transport for some of our goods.  Apart from that, our waterways are a tourist attraction.  I realise the Minister has a lot to do but I hope he will give top priority to the rebuilding of Dublin city centre and to the preservation of the waterways.</P>
    <Col N="1556" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read carefully the lengthy submission of the Minister with regard to this mammoth Estimate for his Department.  While wishing him well in his job and while having little doubt that he will tackle it to the best of his ability, I should like to put some ideas before him which I submit with great respect and which I would ask him to consider seriously.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Estimate hits at the central problems of the environment in the broadest sense of the word.  I think the Minister is chained to some extent&mdash;I suppose it must be a voluntary submission&mdash;to traditional patterns of expenditure in this area.  The previous slavish practice of comparing like with like is found in the Estimate and there is no essential value or worth in that exercise beyond saying that we have spent a little more in some areas than was spent previously.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is time to reconsider if this approach is relevant any more because it implies that for all time the ratios of importance, the proportionality of expenditure and the relative importance of one heading to another heading is forever set out and will always be that way with little deviation. I should like to suggest to the Minister that social developments in this country, particularly in the last decade, point to the need for a major overhaul of the way we have been doing things under the aegis initially of the Department of Local Government and now under the Department of the Environment.  I had hoped that the change of name of the Department would herald some review or radical approach in this area but I have yet to see any evidence of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall try to confine my remarks to one of the major challenges facing us, namely, the problem of the city, particularly the inner city.  I know it may be tedious for some people to have to listen for too long to a discussion on the problems of the inner cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway or Limerick, but I want to ask them to be patient. I should like them to consider carefully that the thoughts I am putting forward are meant most sincerely and <Col N="1557" /> are put forward with a view to trying to get a constructive approach to this issue.  They are not a cheap endeavour at political point scoring.</P>
    <P>The problem of the inner city of Dublin is above and beyond any shallow political consideration.  No single Government is responsible for this position.  Our system of Government and the attitudes which apparently have permeated the minds of all Governments in relation to this problem are responsible.  Consideration of this problem is not evident in the Estimate before us.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister&mdash;and I have no doubt but that I will get a positive response&mdash;if he will be good enough in his own time and at his own convenience to come with me for three or four hours and visit parts of the city of Dublin.  I want him to take a guided tour, to meet local problems face to face, to meet people who are poor, to see a social environment which is a disgrace.  I want the Minister to walk through the streets of parts of this city which in anybody's eyes must be seen to represent nothing less than a scandalous neglect of our Christian duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say he understands the problem but, if he confronts it face to face, if he talks to the people of the area, if he smells the smells, if he experiences the squalor, if he sees the dirty children playing on street corners, he cannot fail to come away inspired with the desire to change these areas fundamentally.  Before I conclude I intend to ask the Minister to indicate to me his willingness to spend a couple of hours in this exercise which I believe would be&mdash;and I say this with the greatest respect for the Government&mdash; a most enlightening, educational and humiliating experience.</P>
    <P>The problems of this part of the city are manifold and complex.  Many of them are outside the traditional functions of the Government.  They are complicated by the greed of the private sector and the greed of the individual.  They are complicated by neglect and by blight not created deliberately by the Government.  Nor am I suggesting that there is any conspiracy on the part of this Government <Col N="1558" /> or the previous Government who must also shoulder their fair share of responsibility for the position in Dublin city centre.  Before I sit down I hope to outline the reasons for this.</P>
    <P>By any social criteria it can be shown and proved statistically, emotionally and in every other way, that the people of this part of Dublin city are deprived to a degree which is in conflict with the Constitution.  If they took a case, or if an interested group took a case on their behalf, to the High Court or the European Court&mdash;and I do not think such a proceeding is outside the bounds of possibility eventually&mdash;it could be clearly shown that they have been deprived of their constitutional right to equality of treatment.  The phrase, &ldquo;to cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo; can only be met with a mocking smile when you look at the way we cherish the children of Sean McDermott Street, Lower Gardiner Street, Foley Street, the Monto as it is called, and other areas in that part of the city.  They are consistently maltreated. They are born into deprivation. They live in deprivation and their future is grim.</P>
    <P>I want to know why the children of my area are not entitled to dream the same dreams as the children of any other nation.  I want to know why the children of my area are not entitled to follow the same star as the children of any other area.  They have that right and it is the duty of this House to ensure that they get that right.  As long as I have breath in my body that will be one of my fundamental concerns.  The only star many of them are following is the tail light of a Black Maria, unfortunately.  I welcome the increase in the Garda presence.  In itself that is a good thing but, unless it is accompanied by enlightened social improvements and radical reforms, it is repressive fundamentally.  It endeavours only to contain the problem and the symptoms of the problem.  The disease remains. It does not matter how many St. Patrick's Institutions or Loughan Houses you build, you will have to build more because the city will spawn this problem and continue to <Col N="1559" /> do so unless we tackle it properly. We are not doing that.</P>
    <P>The poverty in inner Dublin and in parts of other urban areas has to be seen and experienced to be believed. Reference to statistics is a good debating point but statistics are cold, and they can never quantify the deprivation or the hunger of people living six or seven to a third floor flat.  They cannot deal with the problem of a constituent of mine with ten children in two rooms and no husband, fearful of the prospect of coping with larger accommodation, unable to cope with the children she has, educated to believe she should go forth and multiply regardless of the quality of life for her children.  I want to know what this House will do about the future of those children.</P>
    <P>Pawn shops are disappearing in parts of the city.  The three golden balls, the symbol of poverty in some people's eyes, are no longer as common as they were.  The pawn shop is not the baseline of poverty, because the only people who can use a pawn shop are people with something to pawn.  The people I am speaking about own nothing and in some cases even the clothes they stand up in have been given to them.  I want to ask Members of this House, most of whom representing rural constituencies, how they can justify the fact that people are living on some of our social welfare assistance schemes.  Last Saturday morning a number of people came to see me whose only income is less than £15 a week.  In one case it was said to be £10.50 per week.  In many cases it is not enough to keep body and soul together.  It is an open invitation to crime and delinquency and, by any standards, is a scandal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters, nevertheless, are fundamental to the deprivation in environmental terms of our city.  Perhaps the vertical way in which the Departments are segregated without a regional authority may be part of the problem.  On some occasion or other there are few of us who do not say that it is somebody else's problem but the problem and the buck rests here.  However, we have not picked it up so far.</P>
      <P>Before I leave the theme of poverty I should like to mention a couple of points which are not referred to in the Estimate.  After all if poverty is at the root of city deprivation it is a legitimate expectation on my part that an Estimate for the Environment would at least deal in some respect with it.  I should like to mention that more than 105,000 children depend completely on dole for their survival.  Out of a total of 104,800 signing on the unemployment register in a sample week 16,000 got absolutely nothing.  The highest constituency percentage live in north central Dublin.  A total of 46,400 receive unemployment assistance of at most £10.70 per week for a single person while a wife and two children get £25 per week.  One could go on giving the sad statistics of neglect.  The depths of the problem in our inner city have not been plumbed or understood by a fundamentally&mdash;I say this with great respect&mdash;rurally based assembly which is Dáil Éireann.  That is why I reiterate my invitation to the Minister to accompany me on a visit to parts of the inner city of Dublin, if necessary with other Members, so that he can have first-hand experience of some of the problems that exist there.</P>
      <P>What is the environment of this area? J. Alan Winter in a book called &ldquo;The Poor: A Culture of Poverty or Poverty of Culture?&rdquo; states:</P>
      <P>While poverty itself is poorness&mdash; a lack of money&mdash;we all recognise that poverty is also composed of chronic unemployment and under employment, urban and rural slum environment, little education, broken families and poor physical and mental health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> That is the first difficulty we have with regard to this Estimate.  All of these are part of the whole and yet, strictly speaking, we are technically unable to deal with them as one.  They are not separate problems, they are part of one major problem, part of a problem which can be epitomised by the fact that we have never treated the inner city of Dublin and possibly other cities as being equal.  There is positive discrimination against the inner city of Dublin at many levels of Government and it must be changed.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of amenities with which this Estimate is in minor part concerned. We are told that £500,000 has been allocated to local authorities for environmental improvement schemes. That is in an Estimate of more than £200 million and that is in the face of the facts that the urban areas have not got equal rights with regard to amenities for children or for the aged. Deprivation in these matters is a fact that cannot be denied.  Figures supplied by Dublin Corporation to anybody interested show that in the inner city of Dublin something in the order of 3 per cent of the land is used for recreational and leisure purposes.  If one refined that further to see, for example, what we are talking about in terms of playgrounds the figure would be smaller.  From 1966 to 1974 there was a net loss of area of ground of almost 5 per cent in respect of leisure and entertainment in the inner city area. To talk about the pittance in this Estimate in respect of environmental improvement is a sham.  I am aware that it is twice what was there last year but that was also a sham.  How can we expect the children in these areas to grow up to be fulfilled citizens when we do not give them a patch to play on?  How can we expect them to be right when they never see a green patch from the day they are born, unless they get out of the city?</P>
    <P>The most recent figures issued by Dublin Corporation, which has a statutory responsibility in this area, indicate that of the land used in the inner city area for city central uses generally&mdash; there are numbers of acres for different uses including 86 acres for various <Col N="1562" /> types of buildings, 41 acres for streets, five acres for off-street car parking&mdash;of a total of 169 acres, public open space and playing facilities gets six acres. That land consists mostly of bald patches of rough terrain, the kind of terrain which is called to mind when one reads the work of the author of <i>Strumpet City</i> who spoke about Nicholas Street and the children playing what they used to call &ldquo;chaneys&rdquo;, played with pieces of broken delph or glass.  Most of the playgrounds that we deign to call public open spaces and playing facilities are such.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to ignore the fact that some meagre improvements have taken place and that there have been some legitimate playgrounds opened in recent times.  Every one of them has been achieved as a result of strong local pressure and has been ringed by the various Departments or local authorities as a concession.  These were provided in an area where children and people are at their densest.  I do not know if the Minister knows a great deal about rodents, otherwise called rats.  I should like to tell the Minister that some children in my area have rats as their playthings. That is the truth.  The Eastern Health Board will tell the Minister that they receive between 4,000 to 5,000 complaints annually about rats in Dublin city.  Those complaints come from people who bother to ring up but most do not go to that bother. Those complaints are dealt with by the health board and some improvement is usually effected, but the problem of rats stems from basic sewage matters, the treatment of refuse and debris over the years.  Rats will always be associated with the slum conditions which exist in parts of our city.  It is not too much to ask that rats, six of which consume the same amount of food daily as a man and who grow and spawn at a rapid rate, should be excluded from the city.  We should be able to segregate our children from this disease-carrying pest and give them a better atmosphere in which to play.  That has not been done so far and there is nothing in the Estimate to indicate that there is any radical revision of thought about the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> Although I am not that long in politics I have learned one lesson.  If one wants to get something done which may not necessarily please everybody, it seems to be the ground rule of most politicians, myself included, that it should be done as early in the term as possible so that whatever unpleasant side effects it will have will be forgotten.  I had hoped that a radical reforming zeal would have permeated the Government attitude after their massive success in the election and that this would have distilled itself into progressive and radical improvements in various Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Department of the Environment does not show that. The most striking thing about it for the Minister, as he says in his first sentence, is not what it is going to do to change the face of our society, not the major challenge facing him in one of the most challenging Ministries in the Government but a matter of figures&mdash;&ldquo;the most striking feature of this Estimate is its sheer size&rdquo;.  I suppose the novelty of its size is something that a Minister on the occasion of his first Estimate could take pride and pleasure in but I am somewhat concerned that this may indicate a lack of real understanding of the magnitude of the problem.  Perhaps that is not a fair comment but I do not think the most striking feature of the Estimate is its sheer size; its most striking feature is its lack of social oversight and the omissions which therefore relate to it.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why the Minister, or the Minister of State to whom I extend my good wishes for success in his job, should feel obliged to look at Estimates of previous years and say: &ldquo;Let us increase that figure or that by so much.&rdquo;  Surely they could say: &ldquo;Let us scrap the whole lot and let us ask people, public representatives, professionals in the field, our Departments and various other agencies, what is necessary in the context of the Department of the Environment.  Let us ask them is there a new way to approach the problems that we have not been tackling in a real way over the years.  We have approximately <Col N="1564" /> £200 million to spend; let us see what we can do with this money.&rdquo;  Why should we be able to spend tens of millions on roads&mdash;which I agree with in themselves&mdash;and only £.5 million on an area which has been traditionally neglected when the effect of this neglect is costing millions and will cost us more?</P>
    <P>The Environment Estimate pays no real attention to the planning of our city.  Not 200 yards from the front gate of this building there is a street that is now dead.  It is not even possessed by decent ghosts because the old houses that were there are gone. Instead, we have a monolithic canyon, dark and soulless at night and even soulless by day, ugly buildings with no life, no people.  I am worried that this is an indication of what the future of our city may hold.  That is modern planning; it is not Dickensian neglect, not the kind of blight we have in other areas such as Mountjoy Square: this was conceived under the aegis of the Department of Local Government or the Environment and brought into being in very recent years.  What is it? A utilitarian, functional street&mdash;which is good in itself&mdash;but nothing more and the people who use it live far away.</P>
    <P>At the corner of Waterford Street, North Cumberland Street and Lower Gardiner Street, in that area of the city, a person in a third floor flat, into which rain will probably be seeping because the roofs have never been replaced since the flats were built in the last century, can see from the window four massive car parks.  I am not against car parks but I do not believe they must be all on the flat; we could bury them underground or, if necessary&mdash;although I am not very happy about it&mdash;build some sort of multistorey car park.  The car parks are not bad in themselves but what is bad is that public representatives for that area had to fight for two-and-a-half years to get a patch of ground measuring about 30 yards square on which to put a few swings for children.  Even then the children must cross a busy road to get to it.  But there is no problem when it comes to accommodating the car.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> What about children sleeping rough in Dublin city?  Although estimates differ, is the Minister aware that there are probably about 100 children sleeping &ldquo;on the sticks&rdquo; so to speak, in Dublin every night, in the backs of open cars, in buses if they are parked on the street&mdash;as often they are&mdash;or in CIE garages or in parks, under ledges or elsewhere, living like rodents?  The task force referred to this problem in their report and that was the last any of us heard of it.  Is the Minister aware that there are old people in the city who pick their living from the dustbins? There are not day care centres in sufficient number to cope with them, give them a little warmth and kindness after a lifetime of work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what it <Col N="1566" /> does cover.  These are part of a social problem which the Department of the Environment or some Department should be dealing with and I presume it is the Department of the Environment but that Department is not dealing with it.  In the case of children sleeping rough, does the Eastern Health Board not have responsibility and where does the board get its money and its personnel from except from the local authority and the Department of Health?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be arguing with the Deputy.  I want to give him every possible latitude, but he will understand that Health, Social Welfare and other Departments have a responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate you have to do this.  It does not help me but I appreciate you are right and I will endeavour to respond as well as I can. I want to point to some of the problems not being tackled by the Government generally and by this Department specifically.  I am talking about the kind of thinking that created family accommodation on third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh floors in Ballymun.  That building was conceived and built by the Department of Local Government.  Part of this problem which the Chair has pointed to in calling me to order is that once that was built nobody seems to have assumed responsibility for the social context in which those families live.  That is bad planning, environmental deprivation.  How can <Col N="1567" /> we expect those children to believe they are being cherished equally when they spend their days, all their days if they are less than a certain age, in two rooms?  Mothers cannot let them out because there is no place to put them except down on the ground.</P>
      <P>The provision of play facilities and recreational amenities for city children has not been dealt with in the Estimate in any meaningful way.  It has never been dealt with properly by Governments and it is not being dealt with now.  Just more than one year ago three children in my constituency were killed because their playground was the railway track.  Apparently a railway track through a city area does not require any extra protective measures from the point of view of the natural curiosity of children.  The children are dead and buried but there has not been any action apart from some temporary soul-searching.  There has not been any resolution by anybody to say: &ldquo;We will learn from this tragedy and we will put proper investment into this part of the city because in the East Wall area and in similar areas it is necessary to pay more attention to our children because if our children are right, if we take care of them, the future will be sound.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I read a book once called <i>Children of the Sun.</i>  It is about children in Naples.  I was horrified, but the only difference is one of scale&mdash;we have fewer &ldquo;children of the sun&rdquo;.  There is, of course, the other difference that because of our street pattern in many cases our children never see the sun. This tragedy is heightened because around them they see dereliction and blight.  They see derelict sites left by speculators watched over by a Government who have not the moral courage to take the kind of action taken in other European countries.  Buildings have been closed up to hold together sites for future speculations while old people have no place to meet and young people have no place to play. These buildings should be looked at by the Department of the Environment and if necessary taken over by them after reasonable notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> In 1975-76 the only action taken with regard to the acres of dereliction in Dublin city was by Dublin Corporation. What did they do?  In a period of two years they issued notices under the Derelict Sites Act to 26 site owners.  That is the best they could have done because the legislation is not there and this Estimate does not even recognise that this problem exists. We are told that nationally there are about four million acres of derelict land but the Government have not any proposals to ensure that some of the waste ground will be taken over and used.  Fallen buildings come into the same category and they are similarly neglected.  Everyone knows what happens when a building is closed.  It happens also to the buildings adjacent and to the people living in them.</P>
    <P>What are we doing about the special interest categories in our cities?  Would it be too much to ask this Department, when considering plans and guidelines for building, to take cognisance of the special needs of the blind and the disabled? There is nothing about them in the Estimate but a form of words. In the past 20 years some 400 blind persons have left special schools in Dublin and there are still 300 of them living here.  I am not aware of even one public building having been planned or built which shows the slightest sensitivity for the blind or the disabled. On the contrary, meagre efforts on my part in the local authority elicited no response in regard to simple things like street furniture, by which I mean the placement of litter bins, letter boxes, parking meters, lamp standards, bus stops and so forth. There has been no attempt at rationalisation to make it simpler for blind people to walk on the footpaths.  It is far easier for each Department to go their own way, forgetting that the separate maintenance of these things is much more costly and expensive.  In my naivety I had assumed that it would be logical to put a bus stop sign on a lamp standard with a litter bin below.</P>
    <P>I hope the Chair will bear with me for a few moments when I refer to deprivation of facilities for the education of our children.  This is the responsibility of the Minister for Education <Col N="1569" /> and therefore I will not go into it in great detail, but because the problems caused by educational deprivation fall directly on the Minister for the Environment in terms of children on the streets with no facilities for them, they are a legitimate relevant concern.</P>
    <P>I will say only two things about this.  I may say in passing that I have admiration for the Minister for Education. I think he wishes to do a good job and that he is determined to do it.  He has the support of my party. So far, he has been forthright and helpful, but he said last week he did not believe city children are deprived educationally.  I would simply ask him whether he has read the study <i>Educational Opportunity in Dublin</i> by An tAthair Mícheál Mac Gréil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we cannot discuss education.  We can discuss buildings for educational purposes and their planning but we certainly cannot discuss education.  The Deputy is well aware of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking you for a little flexibility.  I am trying to make a very serious case, that the problems created by children who do not attend schools and who are therefore on the street are matters which the Minister for the Environment must face up to. There are parts of the city of Dublin where 80 per cent of children leave after national school&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment would not have responsibility for children leaving schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is debatable.  Is it not reasonable to assume that if children leave school in these numbers in the city something must be done with them?  If the Department of the Environment could decide to create study centres for them in the city where they would be able to study under the guidance of teachers and/or parents in an atmosphere which would not be such as apparently made them fall out of school, or if there could be some centre, hall or even a room to which they could go during the day, that <Col N="1570" /> would be a reasonable environmental concern and I defy contradiction on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Educational matters are the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  The question of school buildings as far as their planning is concerned would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the planning of the schools in the broadest sense of the word &ldquo;planning&rdquo; has led to a situation where, as Miss Joy Rudd in a study called <i>A Survey of National School Terminal Leavers</i> says, 15 per cent of all the children leaving national schools did not transfer to post-primary schools and this percentage was at its worst in Dublin city.  The national schools were concentrated in certain areas of the cities, particularly Dublin. When we ask about schools and the possibility of their closing we are told that the private sector is responsible.  I ask the Minister for the Environment with regard to the future planning of the schools&mdash;which in fairness he has promised to build in areas where they are closed&mdash;that he would consider this extraordinarily high drop-out rate.  Well over half our children leave at the age of 12 years when they are even legally obliged to be there until they are 15. That is a serious environmental problem and we have to come to grips with it.  It is not recognised in the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does not come under this Estimate.  It is a matter for the Minister for Education and the Deputy can raise it on that Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>He will tell me that his responsibility is for the provision of places and that he does not have any responsibility when they leave the place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>He certainly has responsibility for the age at which pupils leave school and all that sort of thing would be his responsibility as Minister for Education.  The Minister for the Environment has certainly no responsibility for leaving ages and education generally.</P>

    <Col N="1571" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my point.  I want to ask the Minister of State who is standing in today to consider the points I am putting forward. I am not trying to make political capital of them.  If we on this side of the House can help in having a joint approach to some of these problems my colleagues and I will do our best in that regard.  This is one of the most serious national challenges facing us and I want to put it in the strongest terms possible.  I am making a special plea to him to get the best from all possible resources.  The inner city of Dublin will not be made a political issue by this side of the House.  We will not put at risk the future of the environment of that part of the city and I have no doubt that the Minister is similarly disposed.  I say with the greatest respect, as these are early days yet for the Government, that the Estimate as put before us, apart from the redemption of the rates pledge which had to be done, is little more than the same Estimate as we had last year with a little more and in some cases a little less.  That is not the reforming zeal that we were promised or that I expected.  I am a Dublin person and I have pride in the city of Dublin and it is to the Department of the Environment that I look for hope in the future.  Yeats in one of his poems talks in a different context about Maude Gonne and he said she might be responsible for &ldquo;hurling the little streets upon the great&rdquo;.  It is a good phrase because it can be applied in a way to the inner city of Dublin.  The little streets are hurled upon the great in every sense of the word and the result is an urban shambles.  As Louis McNeice put it, there was at one stage a sort of seedy elegance about the city.  He said about Dublin:</P>
      <P>Grey brick upon brick,</P>
      <P>Declamatory bronze</P>
      <P>On sombre pedestals.</P>
      <P>The lines most relevant to Dublin are perhaps:</P>
      <P>And the bare bones of a fanlight</P>
      <P>Over a hungry door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many bare bones of many fanlights and many hungry doors, and there is no hope in sight at the <Col N="1572" /> moment that we will tackle this major problem in a fundamental way. I am one of a number of people who feel strongly that we should all be able to be proud of our capital city and that the Department of the Environment could provide a pioneering role and a great lead in that regard.</P>
    <P>But yet she holds my mind</P>
    <P>With her seedy elegance,</P>
    <P>With her gentle veils of rain</P>
    <P>And all her ghosts that walk</P>
    <P>And all that hide behind</P>
    <P>Her Georgian facade.</P>
    <P>Since the time of Louis McNeice, Behan and all the other people who walked the streets of Dublin when it had a quality of life which though financially poor was environmentally perhaps richer than we have now, there have been decay, degeneration and blight.  The financial improvement over the decades, which all but a fool must welcome, has meant that those who could escape got out and are getting out and indeed we encourage them.  The Department of the Environment give a £1,000 grant for new house first-time purchasers.  I would argue and can produce documentary evidence&mdash;not that it matters a damn at this stage&mdash;that that was not what was promised.  What was promised was a £1,000 grant to first-time purchasers of houses.  I though that was good because it was treating everybody fairly. I have here a case study of an urban community and it makes interesting reading about the fight for survival of a community.</P>
    <P>A small house in East Wall which could be sold for £7,000, £8,000 or £9,000 and would put a family on its feet is no longer attractive.  It does not qualify for the grant.  The young couple now are encouraged for the sake of that £1,000&mdash;a lot of money if you are trying to put it together&mdash;to leave the city and go out into the suburbs to occupy one of the houses that extraordinarily are able to be sold for something in the region of £10,000 when the local authority must build at a minimum of £15,000 per unit.  Some people wonder&mdash;I do not have to&mdash; how these houses can be sold cheaper than local authority houses despite the <Col N="1573" /> fact that they are being built primarily for profit.  These are the estates into which the young couples are moving with their one child or two children. The husband is at work all day, taking an hour to get there&mdash;usually back into the city if he has a job&mdash;and an hour to get back.  The wife is on her own with the child, which is a new experience to her, and as a young married man myself I can honestly say that is one of the most traumatic experiences that one can possibly endure, and I am not being even slightly facetious about it.  What has this young woman to turn to?</P>
    <P>We would be told that the Department of the Environment do not have responsibility for providing schools, shops, social facilities, churches, creches for the children or community centres.  They have responsibility for some of those but they do not carry it out.  There is no street lighting.  The streets are not even cleaned.  This is because they are not taken in charge. The private developer has not finished off the estate because the planning department have not concluded their part and so it goes on and on.  In order to redress this imbalance which will not really manifest itself for another year or so the Minister should make the £1,000 grant available to all first-time purchasers.</P>
    <P>I believe this is what was propagated before the election not only as an election pledge but because it was socially wise and just.  Not only would this help young couples but it would help also the building industry which was the main thrust of the grant.  To make the grant available to all first-time purchasers would create housing mobility in the city because a couple who wished to sell their house at, say, the East Wall or Ballybough for £9,000 or £10,000 would be able to sell it on equal terms and to buy a house elsewhere.  There are thousands of families on the housing list who are living in squalor. The Department are indicating in the Estimate and the Government are indicating generally in the White Paper that there is an acceptable level of housing deprivation.  Having regard to the number of people who are living <Col N="1574" /> in squalor I would ask the Minister to reconsider the question of the £1,000 grant.  It has serious implications. Both politically and in the interest of housing generally it would be an advantage to make the grant available to all first-time purchasers.</P>
    <P>There is a need for major roads. The Government are hellbent on approving proposals for major roads in the Dublin area that would cost in the order of £500 million at current prices.  I do not know whether that development is good but Dublin Corporation, perhaps reflecting their concern, have spent almost £300,000 in the past few years in having studies undertaken into the question of roads but there have been no studies in regard to the social impact of these roads.  Once again it is a question of hurling the little streets upon the great.  Housing requirements in the Dublin sub-region show that there is a real housing problem but some solace is being derived by the Minister by his implying that the larger families are being housed.  That is a misconception because families are smaller now although there are notable exceptions.</P>
    <P>The question of motorways should be seen in the context of population and in terms of a national transportation policy.  I ask the Minister to consider the impact of road proposals on local communities.  I am not advocating an end to road development works because we need roads but we must ensure that there is sensitivity in respect of a city which traditionally has been deprived since it was regarded by the rest of the country as being part of the Pale.  The Minister for Health told us recently that even in terms of health the people of this city are relatively deprived.</P>
    <P>The question of jobs is fundamental but that is the responsibility of another Minister.  However, the social consequences involved will rest with the Minister for the Environment. What is becoming known as the fourth world, that is, the world of the inner city, is a world that is far from bright and this Estimate does little to help.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that legislation is <Col N="1575" /> being prepared to provide for toll bridges.  There has been no request for such legislation, so it is difficult to understand why the Government should be acting in this way when there are so many pressing problems facing them, for example, the problem of crime in the city.  A recent report of the Garda Commissioner showed that Dublin is the real problem in this context and that this city's crime rate is relatively way beyond the rate for other areas.  Does this mean that Dublin people are more crime-orientated? It does not but their environment is crime-conducive.  There is nothing in the Minister's Estimate about that.</P>

      <P>Although there is the risk of a self-fulfilling prophesy, as the sociologists call it, I do not believe that talking of these problems makes them any worse.  The prophesy is being fulfilled.  To play games with the problem or to remain quiet about it will not make it go away.  It disturbs me to talk about such matters but it is necessary to focus the attention of the Government on the real problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would go further and express the hope that the Minister for the Environment would consider setting up a regional authority for Dublin city which would have real teeth and which would allow other Ministers to have the kind of responsibility which the Chair understandably indicates is not the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  That might be one way of tackling the situation.  What is needed is a frontal assault.  Government structure is ill-equipped to deal with a problem which is ingrained horizontally in a variety of social areas <Col N="1576" /> by a structure which is delineated vertically in a situation in which there are various Departments each dealing with separate areas of responsibility, one not knowing what the other one is doing except in a cursory way while there is no meaningful inter-relationship between Departments.</P>
    <P>Instead of talking of the reorganisation of local government we hear about the building of centres for children. I suppose Dublin will have the highest percentage of the children involved although the centre is being provided far from the city.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea finally in regard to the Royal Canal.  There is talk of a motorway being built on that waterway but I appeal to the Minister not to allow any such obscenity.  The waterways can be a wonderful amenity and if the Minister declines to go ahead with the motorway he will be doing something to redress the balance particularly in so far as the north city area is concerned.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister has considered my invitation to come with me and perhaps with other public representatives on a short visit to the inner city area where he would meet the people and see the problem for himself.  I am not suggesting that in any way the Minister lacks knowledge of the area but I would like him as a human being and as a Christian to see at first hand what the difficulties are.</P>

Perhaps it was unintentional but the previous speaker complimented them, too.  I suppose, when he read the Estimate speech he felt there was so little to be critical of that he spent most of his speech far from the Estimate but, in fairness to him he came back to it in the last few minutes.  I suppose that is a tribute to the benefits in the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an appropriate time to comment on the abolition of rates on private dwellings.  There is a provision of £80 million to compensate local <Col N="1577" /> authorities for the loss of revenue from the abolition of rates on private dwellings. When Fianna Fáil announced the abolition of rates on private dwellings the parties opposite told the country that this was impossible and that it was only a trap for the unwary voter.  The promise has been kept and the allowance in the Estimate before the House is proof that the people believed that Fianna Fáil would deliver.  The Government have kept faith.  The derating of private dwellings, which affects 850,000 house-holders, shows that this was a well chosen move.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that even with the phasing out of the two largest revenues, health and housing, rates had increased from £6.70 to £9.  This gives an indication of the amount of money required.  My county, in particular, have suffered this year because 1977 will be the base year in regard to the funding of local authorities from State funds.  Monaghan County Council did not allow sufficiently for the rate of inflation in regard to roads.  The result is that we found recently that we have come out very badly.  Would the Minister re-examine this point?  County Monaghan over the years made a sizeable contribution in the rate in the £ towards roads but, due to some error, they did not take cognisance of the inflationary rate and they now find that they can suffer in years to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the abolition of rates on community halls. He also indicated that he will be bringing in legislation and drawing up guidelines for community halls.  I suggest that in rural areas all halls be exempted.  The community hall is comparatively an innovation and is a very desirable one because it means that the people of all shades of religious and political opinions have come together and erected in some cases very elaborate community centres with a wide range of facilities which are very necessary in rural areas.  They got grant aid from local authorities for doing this.  Those buildings are now known as community halls.</P>
    <P>County Monaghan a few years ago sent a resolution to the then Minister for Local Government that all halls <Col N="1578" /> be derated.  In our county we have approximately 80 halls under three categories, community centres, parochial halls and Orange halls.  The total revenue which Monaghan County Council were collecting in respect of rates on those buildings was a little over £2,000.  While some of them were paying a large amount in rates very many of them, due to not being used, received exemption of rates.  The reply we received from the then Minister was that the derating of those halls was a matter for the Valuation Office. Now that this legislation is being introduced to exempt community halls from rates I believe it is an appropriate time for the Minister to exempt all halls except those which are for commercial use, which are usually situated in the towns.</P>
    <P>Commercial dance halls in rural areas are not a paying proposition.  The halls are used primarily for meetings, first-aid classes, sporting organisations, the ICA and the IFA.  The VEC hold classes in woodwork, needlework and cookery in those halls.  Some of those halls have a wide range of sporting facilities for the people.  Most of them receive no revenue from admission to their functions to compensate for the payments they have to make to the local authorities for rates.  I ask the Minister, now that this legislation will be coming before the House, to examine this matter very closely and exempt all halls.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to compensation for malicious injuries.  In most counties this only accounts for a few pence in the £.  In County Monaghan, because of our situation, this accounted for 20p in the £, which is a sizeable amount.  This increase was not caused by an increase in vandalism or malicious injuries.  While the State recoup the local authority for any damage caused by explosions which are attributable to events in Northern Ireland, road cratering and so forth, there is no money given for the expense involved in processing those cases through the courts.  The local authority have to pay the solicitor, the quantity surveyor and other people in assessing the claims.  They have to pay the Garda authorities for statements in relation to the claims.  Monaghan <Col N="1579" /> County Council have been pressing for a number of years that we should be able to recoup those expenses.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly low valuation in County Monaghan and there are no rates on lands with a valuation under £20.  Now, with the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings and outbuildings, the total rate in the £ which will be demanded from people will be for malicious injuries, which is a separate amount indicated on the bottom of the demand note.  The Minister will have to consider whether he should continue to collect that money when the collection costs will probably out-weigh the amount of money involved. In Monaghan a few years ago the collection rate for malicious injuries was only 3p in the pound but with the cratering of roads and bomb damage in the towns the rate has increased to 20p in the pound.  The people in that area should not be saddled with that.  The conflict in the North has brought death and destruction to many innocent families and to businesses in that area.  At a time when there has been a fall-off in the bombings and violence it is very disturbing to hear public statements by people like Mr. Mason, the Northern Secretary of State, which are calculated to incite revenge action against innocent people.</P>

    <Col N="1580" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Deputy suggested that the £1,000 grant should extend to all dwellings irrespective of the condition of them and mentioned that this would improve the building industry and create jobs.  It is hard to see the sense of his argument.  The £1,000 grant introduced by this Government shows the different approach of Fianna Fáil and the National Coalition to people building their own houses.  The amount of aid to be given was increased from £4.52 million in 1977 to £17 million this year for private house building.  Over the last number of years because of the low income limits and the small size of the grants it was very hard for a person to buy his own house.  The new £1,000 grant as well as the change in the income limits make it possible.  It is very satisfying that from July 1977 until February 1978 there was a total of 9,551 applicants for the new grant.  The indications are that more people will build their own houses and this is very commendable.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his brief dealt with housing cost variations.  There is cause for concern in that local authority houses cost from £9,000 to £12,500. The percentage of variation here should be examined closely.  Local authorities should consider having some of the houses built by sub-contractors so that an element of competition could be created.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the itinerant problem.  In County Monaghan the local authority aided by the Department built tigíns and community centres for itinerants.  In one case they were not occupied and the local authority in consultation with the Department decided to dispose of them.  It is really a pity that this should have happened as this had seemed an ideal set-up.  It was said that because the settlement was too close to the Border the itinerants had a habit of changing residence in order to vary their social welfare benefits and so on. The Government should examine this problem and see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reconstruction grants were also referred to.  The Minister is to be congratulated on raising the maximum grant from £400 to £600.  The Minister <Col N="1581" /> is also to be congratulated on doing away with the supplementary and paying the full grant from the Department. It was very frustrating over the last number of years where this supplementary grant was changed so often. In January 1976 one had to qualify for a supplementary payment before one could qualify for the local government payment.  Many applicants had to get two different sets of income figures from their employers because the local authority asked for a figure for one period and the Department of Local Government asked for a figure for a different period.  Apart from that, when the applicant looked for a loan application he had to secure another set of figures.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that.  Also very desirable is the reduction in the time limit within which one will be eligible for reconstruction grant aid which is to be ten years now.  Heretofore it was 15 years.  Nowadays when so many people are building additional and improving their existing accommodation the reduction in this time limit is to be commended.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker was critical of the attention being paid to the disabled and mentally handicapped.  The Department and the various health boards are now devoting a lot of time and thought to these people.  It is indeed desirable that they receive all of the facilities it is possible to provide.  The increase in the maximum grant to £1,200 will mean that it will now be possible for many mentally handicapped and disabled people to have provided for them bedroom and bath-room accommodation at ground floor level because many of them are unable to negotiate stairways.  The increase in the grant will go a long way towards the provision of that type of facility.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned also that there would be a more strict control on standardised building components.  The Department should also monitor very closely and have strict control over material prices.  I would hope also that all architects and consulting engineers involved in projects&mdash;especially Departmental ones&mdash;would be aware of the variety of products manufactured at home.  A few years ago, <Col N="1582" /> in the building of an Army barracks in Monaghan, we had the experience of consultants and engineers who recommended the use of imported tiles when there were tiles of equal quality being manufactured a matter of 13 miles away.  It was unfortunate that such men, commissioned to undertake the erection of that building, were not aware that they could get the same product in that area.</P>
    <P>In no sector has there been as favourable a reaction to a change of government as in the building industry.  In this House for years there was a battle of figures over the number of houses built, the number of grants applied for and so on but the stark fact was that there was increasing unemployment in that industry.  The numerous actions taken by the Minister since he assumed office should help to shrink the unemployment queues.  While the days of picture postcards depicting crumbling mud walls and cabins in the country have disappeared and while there has been a tremendous improvement in housing it will be a long time still before any Minister can boast that he has overcome the housing problem.  Mention was made earlier of city housing conditions but, bearing in mind an ever-increasing population, whether it be city or country, it will be a long time before the housing situation is rectified.  Nowadays with people marrying at a younger age local authorities find that there is an ever-increasing demand for housing and indeed for the better type of accommodation to which our people are entitled.</P>
    <P>Mention was made earlier also of neglect of the old.  Many local authorities are to be commended for the attention they are giving to the building of houses for old people. In four of the five major towns of the county I represent there are schemes in progress&mdash;some of the houses being occupied already&mdash;for the provision of old people's dwellings. In a number of cases there is being provided also a community centre to serve them where they can go for attention by a district nurse, doctor or some other qualified person.  Local authorities should pursue this line&mdash;<Col N="1583" /> the provision of a number of houses in a group of houses for old people, affording them the type of freedom they would not have in an institution. The figures at present available to us of people in such institutions is so high that local authorities must actively pursue the building of such houses for old people.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the matter of apprentices and the money he was making available for their training. Certainly he is to be commended for arranging that grants be made available to local authorities for the employment of 150 first-year construction industry apprentices, because the shortage of trade apprentices has been very evident in recent times.  Local authorities could do much to train apprentices because at present there are many local authorities and health boards with a fairly extensive variety of tradesmen.  Traditionally local authorities used tradesmen who had served their apprenticeship in other industries; such local authorities took these men but gave nothing in return.  Therefore I feel there should be a greater input of apprentices to local authorities particularly where there is a trade involved.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of road works I noticed that the Minister has made an allocation of a fairly substantial amount of money to the Derry/Donegal region for cross-Border development.  If I might quote what the Minister said in this regard:</P>
    <P>The grants I have made to Donegal County Council include allocations totalling £290,000 for six projects in North Donegal.  These projects form part of the programme for the improvement of the national route network in that area and have been confirmed in the report of the Study of Cross-Border Communications in the Derry/Donegal region, which was commissioned and financed jointly by the Government, the United Kingdom Government and the EEC.</P>
    <P>As one who has been involved in this cross-Border development and discussions, I welcome this allocation to these national secondary routes.  It is an indication that the Government and <Col N="1584" /> the Minister honour the commitment they made of involvement in projects of benefit to all sectors on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>The Minister should get his engineers to have another look at the classification of roads.  In Monaghan we have come up against a problem where over the last number of years it was not safe to traverse certain roads with the result that other routes had to be taken and these routes were never reclassified even though they were compelled to carry an increased volume of traffic.  In some areas there was no allocation made for the realignment of national secondary and primary roads because of restriction on finance.  I would ask the Minister to concentrate now on national primary roads because these are the main arteries.  From Derry to Dublin there is approximately 160 miles of road and the distance from the Border at Aughnacloy to Glasnevin is approximately 95 miles.  About 35 miles of that road are in a most unsuitable condition for the kind of traffic using it.  Last year about a mile of road was done but for quite a number of years before that nothing was done. More finance will have to be allocated for the improvement of these roads. There must be a re-examination and a reclassification of them.  The Minister's inspectors should check on surfacing.  There is a stretch of road north of Collon which has had a temporary surface for the last three or four years.  In other parts of the county roads have been permanently surfaced.</P>
    <P>Following on the closure of the railways there was an additional allocation made to counties to compensate for the loss of the railways. This allocation was of a temporary nature.  The subvention given to CIE represents roughly £10 per head of the population.  In 1957-58 there was a complete withdrawal of rail services from Cavan and Donegal.  A bus service was made available.  This service just about fills the bill and no more.  Counties which no longer have rail facilities for both passengers and freight should be given more money. Remember, they are paying their contribution per head of the population <Col N="1585" /> to the subvention to the rail system, a system which is of no benefit of any kind to them.</P>
    <P>When the planning committee was set up we were hopeful that there would be no more delays.  Apparently now the committee has a large number of appeals, just as many as the Minister had prior to the committee being set up.  These appeals have to be vetted very, very carefully.  Many aspects have to be considered.  Local authorities have to be consulted and so on.  An application sent in in September has still not been decided. Delay like this is very serious from the point of view of industrial development or large-scale housing construction. Such developments ought not to be held up and I would appeal to the Minister to do all he can to speed up decisions.</P>
    <P>Where the local improvement scheme is concerned I welcome the increased allocation from £1 million to £1.75 million.  There are almost 6,500 applications.  I would appeal to the Minister to provide all the money necessary to cope with the backlog of applications because there are people who cannot develop their farms since they are unable to bring in limestone, fertilisers, ready-mixed concrete and so on.  In some cases they cannot avail of bulk milk collection which is the in-thing now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish the Minister and his Department well.  I am not happy about the change of name.  There was strong pressure for a Department of the Environment but changing the name of the Department of Local Government was not the answer.  I regard it as a rather stupid decision because by far the greater part of the activities of the Department are concerned with local government and not with the environment. There was really no point in the change except that it was the in-thing. People were talking about the environment and it was decided that this was what they would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is&mdash;as I was when I was in charge of the Department&mdash;very anxious to see the right thing is done in every case.  He is lucky because I believe he has the <Col N="1586" /> finest group of public servants in his Department that it is possible to get. I found them so.  Those men and women know their job and do it well. They make recommendations but carry out the instructions given by the Minister. I hope the Minister will give those instructions to his Department and not leave them in the air as some of his predecessors did.  This excellent group of people will give him the best possible instructions and he will carry out the job as it should be done.</P>
    <P>Many people seem to think that a Minister has the full right to do what he wants in his own Department, but that is not so, because he is subject to overall Cabinet decision.  In many cases we found we could not do things we would like to have done.  Often the Department of Finance ensured they could not be done because the money was not there.  I do not want to criticise civil servants here because I have never done that.  In many cases either the advice given to me from the Department of Finance was wrong or the advice given to the Government was wrong.  If money could not be made available for certain things then and it can be turned up now, there is a grey area there which I would like to be able to probe.  Possibly I may get the opportunity to do so later.</P>
    <P>This debate has followed the traditional lines with Deputies dealing with their own areas, and that is only right. I believe that overall we must look at the way the Department propose to carry out their jobs in the year ahead. One of the things I am rather surprised about is the question of roadmaking. It is remarkable not so much what some Deputies know about roads but what they do not know about them. I have heard Deputies here and I have read reports of their speeches.  They seem to have set ideas.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a few facts straight.  For many years now the building and maintenance of national primary roads was carried by the Department, and that continues.  When I took over I found the building of national secondary roads was also carried by the Department but their maintenance was not.  I thought this <Col N="1587" /> was wrong and, with the agreement of the Government, introduced the system that the upkeep of national secondary roads would also be carried by the Department, and that is so still. In addition, as I had been a member of a local authority for 15 years, I found complaints again and again being made that while work was done where the Department decided it should be done the local authority representatives did not carry out work they felt should be done because they did not have adequate money unless they got it from the rates.  In order to meet that legitimate demand I made arrangements that there would be a block grant so that local authorities could decide where best that money could be spent.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the last Deputy talking about a certain section of a road not being surfaced for a long time.  If the local authority felt it was very important it could have been done under the block grant, but obviously it was not that important to them. Local authority representatives are excellent, dedicated people who carry out their job well.  I believe they should be given more authority, and that was one of the things I passed on to them. I would hate to think that that system would be changed and that this would not be done in the future.</P>
    <P>Nobody believes as much as I do that we need a first-class national road network&mdash;national primary, national secondary and the ordinary county roads.  I also believe the money must be made available from the State for this.  There is no point in the Minister or any other member of the Government standing up at a function or in this House talking about it being their idea that there should be roads built to motorway standards any place, that there should be ring roads or any other type of road done in a big way if the State is not going to put its money where its mouth is.  You cannot carry out work unless money is available and it is the State's responsibility to supply it.</P>
    <P>There is a national outcry to have in Dublin and other cities a road which will bring people around the <Col N="1588" /> city, not through it.  I think that is a necessity, but I want to make it as clear as I possibly can that as long as I am in public life I will oppose any proposal that a motorway or any type of major or minor road should be run through a city or town knocking down buildings, not alone the buildings for the area over which the road will run but making it uninhabitable for a distance of 100 yards each side of the road.  This is the sort of nonsense which has been talked about as being acceptable by those who propose to use it.  People living in the area where the road will be built have rights and their rights are paramount.  They must decide whether they are prepared to allow this disruption to occur.  I am sure the elected representatives of this city and elsewhere will not be prepared to agree that this sort of thing should be done just to oblige some people.  As I said, there should be ring roads.  We made great progress building roads around the city and around County Dublin and other areas but an immense amount of money was required.</P>
    <P>It would be great to have motorways, but do not forget that they cost a very great deal of money.  As I said 12 months ago, we are talking about the next century, and unless a miracle occurs that type of money will not be available here before then.  It is wrong that anybody at a public function should be tempted to give the impression that planning which would cost a great deal of money should take place and that it would be done next year or the year after. It will not be done that soon and the sooner such people face up to that fact, as I faced up to it, the better for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of bridges.  As I pointed out in the budget, over the years not enough bridges were built.  Over the last four or five years a big number of badly needed bridges were built over main roads and around towns.  I want to refer specifically to the bridge built at the back of the Custom House. This is an excellent bridge.  I use it every morning.  It has done a <Col N="1589" /> tremendous amount to relieve the bottleneck of traffic there.  I was surprised at two things.  First, some people claimed it would increase the volume of traffic going across that bridge.  They seemed to ignore the fact that until it was opened they had to go down to Butt Bridge, cross it in one lane, turn left and go back through the same streets, therefore creating the same problem, only it took longer. Second, I was surprised to read a sermon in which the clergyman talked about the authorities putting bridges before houses.  That bridge was badly needed.  Dublin Corporation&mdash;I assume he was talking about Dublin Corporation&mdash;were unable to spend last year and the year before over £1 million in each year which I had allocated to them for housing the people he was talking about, and it was returned through the national Exchequer.  Let us put things in their proper perspective.  I am sure that man is dedicated to his own cause and I am not challenging his right to make comments, but they should be relevant and a correct statement of the facts. That is the situation.</P>
    <P>With Deputy Keating, I would appeal to the Minister not to change the system with regard to East Wall and Dublin city centre.  Having read some of the documentation produced by the whizz kids of the present Government I feel that a climate of opinion is being built up to the effect that it is too expensive to house Dublin people in Dublin.  I am not prepared to agree with that.  For the first time in years I persuaded Dublin Corporation to ensure that the city centre would be rebuilt and I give them all credit. All shades of opinion within the corporation, including Deputy O'Brien who is now present, were prepared to do their bit.  A CPO which was turned down by a Fianna Fáil Minister in 1968 was reactivated and I signed it in order to allow houses to be built in East Wall.  The money was provided and it was spent, except for the £1 million in each year to which I referred.  Plans are being made and this year, next year and the following year the housing schemes will be going ahead.  I appeal to the <Col N="1590" /> Minister not to stop them now, no matter what his colleagues may say; otherwise his name will be linked with the desecration and knocking down of Dublin city centre.  It is now being rehabilitated and it would be a mistake if a decision were made to reverse that.  Some say it is better to move out to virgin country on the edge of the city but they seem to forget that services which are at present provided in the city centre will have to be provided out there also.  I appeal to the Minister not to fall into that trap.  The job has been started; let him keep it going until it is completed.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to the Minister not to be tempted into allowing the super office style building which many people would like to see.  This is an area where people should live.  While factories may be needed within these areas, he should not move from that stance.  He should ensure the continuation of the job which was well started by the previous Government and by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of roads, I wish to refer to the increase in grants. I can only talk about places such as my own constituency.  There is an increase of 2 per cent this year and this represents a decrease in actual money over the same period last year.  In addition, VAT will be charged for the first time on roads.  This is a circular type of taxation.  The money is collected and goes back into the Government coffers.  Why did the Department not take this into account when they were allocating the money?  There is no point in giving money to local authorities with one hand and taking it back with the other.  As a result of the combination of the reduction in money value and the imposition of VAT, Meath County Council will find themselves over £200,000 poorer than last year in regard to money for roads.  If this applies generally, as I assume it does, it is very wrong.  Naturally the Department will be to blame.  The Government and the Department of Finance must have known this and they should give back this money.  The alternative is a lay-off of road workers all over the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> I was listening to the previous speaker talking about planning.  I will again say something which I said when I was on the other side of the House. The biggest hold-up in planning is caused by the local authorities who do not treat any application as urgent. They deal with it in their own good time.  If they refuse a planning application or if someone objects, they are not in any great hurry in supplying the information for which they are asked. These are two reasons for the holding up of planning.  The third reason is not that the people running An Bord Pleanála are not doing their job but that there are not enough inspectors. Something will have to be done to clear the backlog.</P>
    <P>Local authorities now are far more lenient with regard to planning applications than they were when I took office.  However, we still see reports of people who have been refused planning permission in order to build a house where they want to build it.  I am thinking particularly of a person in the country.  On the radio this morning someone referred to a site in Dublin costing £20,000 and in my own area a site was sold recently for £8,000.  If someone buys a site at a reasonable cost, why should he not be encouraged to build a house?  This encouragement is not being given.  The Minister should ask local authorities to continue the liberal method of dealing with planning applications.  I am quite sure that An Bord Pleanála are doing a good job but the Minister should see to it that there are enough inspectors.  That is where the bottleneck occurs.</P>
    <P>I was listening to the Deputy from Monaghan talking about the extra traffic on the roads as a result of the loss of the railways.  He seems to have forgotten that it was a Fianna Fáil Government who were responsible for doing away with those railways and, secondly, that the allocation of money did not include certain areas to which he referred.  They got nothing at all. He probably did not look up his notes too well because the job to which he referred would have been done then if the money had been provided.</P>
    <P>I have very strong views on the <Col N="1592" /> question of water and sewerage.  We talk about the necessity for a clean environment but I do not believe it is possible for any country to have a clean environment unless there are adequate water and sewerage facilities. Money must be made available by the State.  From the earliest days of this State water and sewerage were not considered very important.  A certain amount of money was made available but even in my time it was not entirely adequate.  In view of the present situation, the money available this year is even more inadequate.  Apart from developing areas, to which most of the money seems to be going, there are many towns and villages with very poor water and sewerage systems, if any.  Possibly there was a water scheme of some kind and a sewerage system which may have been introduced about 100 years ago.  All those people are now looking for new sewerage schemes.  I set up a board to do something about clean water.  Nobody can do anything as long as we have a situation where housing effluent and industrial effluent is allowed to flow freely into lakes and rivers.  I did what I could in my time but I am quite sure that what I did was inadequate. The local authorities did their best with the amount of money that was available.  We will have to have a tremendous breakthrough.  During the four years I was in office more money was provided and more work was done than in the previous ten years but it still was not enough.  The major problem was still there.  I am not criticising the Minister or his Department for this.  All I am saying is that they and the Government will have to make an effort to get more money for this type of work.  If we are serious about a clean environment we must start with adequate water supplies and sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>There was an impossible situation in this city.  Everybody knew about it and plans were made but that was all. Nobody wanted to touch the hot potato.  Work was started and it proceeded slowly for a time and in the time I was in office a large amount of money was provided.  As a matter of fact, it was said to me on a number of occasions that more money was given <Col N="1593" /> to Dublin Corporation than should have been given to any one area.  That money was provided in an effort to clear the backlog.  When work on the sewerage system is completed in about a year's time there will be considerable improvement but it is unfair that so much money should have to be given to one area to the detriment of others.</P>
    <P>The same situation applies with regard to housing.  When I was in office I allocated to Dublin Corporation in particular more than 40 per cent of the entire amount of money available for local authority housing in an effort to break the backlog.  I was interested to hear Deputy Keating talk about the terrible conditions under which people are living.  This is true but the conditions are nothing like what they were some years ago.  One point that people seem to ignore is that while those in very bad housing conditions require housing, there is also a desire for an improvement in the standard of housing.  Some 15 years ago people would have been prepared to accept a certain kind of housing accommodation but they will not be prepared to accept it now and I think they are right.</P>
    <P>I am a little disturbed at a report that appeared in one of the Government publications that suggested that because of the extra effort that we made in the past few years&mdash;we did make that effort and there is credit due to officials in the Department, in the local authorities and the public representatives&mdash;we have now reached the stage where 70 per cent of those seeking accommodation from the local authorities are people who have only three in a family.  If this is suggesting that a man with a wife and child are not entitled to a house, that they must sweat it out in whatever bad accommodation they have until they have three, four or five children, that is not acceptable in 1978.  If the Minister allows this to be accepted by his Department as the norm he is making a very big mistake.  Every family is entitled to a house.  My view is that we should aim at a situation where young people who are getting married and who are unable to provide a house for themselves should be able to get <Col N="1594" /> a house 12 months after they are married.  This can be done.  The system we had up to now did not go that far but it was aiming at it.  I hope we do not go back to the situation where people had to wait seven years before they got a house.  The Taoiseach admitted to me that it was not unusual to be seven years on a local authority waiting list for housing.  It would be very wrong to revert to that system.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister saying that the standard of housing was good.  I assume he means he will keep it that way.  There will be a terrific outcry if an effort is made to go back to the bad old days when houses were built that were not fit for human habitation.  New houses were handed over to local authorities that were leaking and draughty and that had no heating.  Anything that could be wrong with them was wrong with them.  I know enough about them from my first few months as Minister when I had the unhappy experience of having officially to open some of them and when people were less than three months in the houses they had a long list of complaints.  I hope that situation will not arise again.  It can be prevented only by keeping up the excellent standard set by the previous administration with the assistance of the officials concerned.</P>
    <P>I am glad that agreement has been reached with tenants' organisations regarding rents and a purchase scheme. However, I am doubtful about the purchase scheme.  We tend to get an indistinct picture when something is seen in print because there are a few ways of reading what is set out.  The houses built recently, although they are excellent, have repayments that are far too high for people on average earnings.  The plan to increase the sum of £900 to £1,300 is not the answer. An effort should be made to ensure that these people can purchase their houses because once they do this they are no longer the responsibility of the local authority or the State.  They should be able to buy out their houses at a reasonable cost.  If this is not done the houses will not be purchased. Eventually they will require repair and far more money will be spent in this <Col N="1595" /> way than on what would have to be given by way of grant or remission of the purchase price.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at that scheme.</P>
    <P>Before I left office I gave a remission to those people who had purchased under the Fianna Fáil pre-1973 scheme.  I understood from some of the statements made in this House after the election that Fianna Fáil held that somebody who paid cash for a house would not be entitled to get a refund.  I raised the matter here on the budget debate&mdash;the Chair was rather doubtful that it was relevant&mdash; and I pointed out that the Minister had stated categorically that it was not the intention of the Government to do anything about it and had stated in reply to a question from a Fine Gael Deputy that the election manifesto issued in Dublin South-West which promised that this would be done was not his responsibility or that of his party.  I also produced a document here which said that the Taoiseach had stated in Cork that a remission would be given and, lo and behold, a notice appeared in the newspapers the week before last that a remission was being given.  The Taoiseach had got his lines clear and the fact that the statement of the Minister for the Environment was untrue and that he made rather a fool of himself does not seem to have entered anybody's head.  That was all right as long as the Taoiseach's lines were kept clear.  Nobody seemed to see the point that he was admitting that Fianna Fáil robbed those people.  That is what we held all along and that is why I changed the purchase system. I believed that the system in operation from 1968 to 1973 meant than an extraordinary exorbitant price was being charged for the houses.  I changed that system for the period for which I was responsible but I felt I could not go back any further except in respect of those people who were purchasing their houses by instalments.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to find that Fianna Fáil decided they would do something about it and, having done it, they attempted to claim they were redressing <Col N="1596" /> something we had done.  It was nothing of the sort.  It was a reawakening of the Fianna Fáil conscience to the fact that they had robbed people. They should have another look in the cupboard and I am sure they will find many people who were charged exorbitant rents over the period.  They should see whether they could refund some of the rents they charged.  Before I took office I found people who were unable to pay for food or clothing for their children because of the high rent they had to pay.  Fianna Fáil might have another look at this now that they have time.  Perhaps they will do something about it also.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing generally, I am of the opinion that a great start was made.  We built 100,000 houses in four years with the co-operation of everybody concerned.  It always riled me that successive Fianna Fáil spokesmen on local government, as it was then, challenged the figures produced by officials of the Department.  As I said, I believe the officials of the Department are excellent people and honourable people.  I am prepared to accept their figures.  I am glad they said recently we have almost reached our target for 1977.  I am sorry it was not completely reached.</P>
    <P>From the amount of money being made available, despite a statement in the Minister's speech that he proposed to build 26,800 odd houses, I have very grave doubts about that.  Nobody will be happier that I will be if the Government succeed in beating the target set, or go anywhere near it.  In view of the fact that it appears obvious local authority houses will get a very low rating in departmental finance, I am under the impression that they will fall short pretty badly.  I appeal to the Minister not to do what was done when the previous Coalition Government left office.  It took Fianna Fáil only one year to drop from a maximum of 8,000 local authority houses to slightly over 1,000.  That was a shocking situation and I am afraid something like that might happen again.  Under no circumstances should it be allowed.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about £30 <Col N="1597" /> million being given for the purpose of building additional houses.  It was said that the building industry would get an input of £30 million almost immediately. I have been looking around for that £30 million and I cannot find it.  Certain figures were given.  There was the question of £1,000 per house. A few months ago I asked a question about this in regard to my own constituency. I found 280 people had applied for it.  One qualified and even he was not paid.  Le conamh Dé I will be asking a question after Easter to find out what is happening.</P>
    <P>The application form for this £1,000 per house is so phrased that it will be extremely difficult to qualify.  Not only are you asked if you ever bought a house&mdash;I assume that means owned a house&mdash;but you are also asked did you or your wife ever own a house anywhere else.  I can see officials of the Department having a grand old time travelling around Africa, Asia and America to find out whether somebody had bought a house there and had not said anything about it.  If you do not give the reply to the question very definitely, and if you cannot prove what you say is true, you are in difficulty.</P>
    <P>Before the election there was a great to-do about this £1,000.  When challenged on television the present Taoiseach said he felt it would be very useful to put down as a deposit on a new house.  How you pay a sum of money as a deposit on a new house which you do not get until you are living in it I have not been able to find out.  I asked a few questions about it here and nobody seemed very clear as to how it could be done.  I am sure there were hundreds and possibly thousands of people who thought all they had to do was to put their names down for a house, say they were building a new house, make an application, and they would get £1,000 and could get anything they liked with it. This sort of codology was fairly effective. I will be interested to know how the money will be spent.  I notice the figure here of how much is being provided for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> I am perfectly satisfied the amount of money we were given was not adequate. The money was not available in the early days because of the recession.  Coming out of the recession I believed it would have been improved substantially this year.  The extraordinary thing is that this £1,000 will be paid to anybody who builds a certain type of house.  Whether this is the proper way to deal with these matters is something I have very grave doubts about.  There are people who can well afford to build their own houses and there are people who require great assistance.</P>
    <P>I notice the low rise mortgage scheme I introduced gets a passing reference.  I hope the Department will not sit on it.  This is one way in which they can help.  When all the t's were crossed and all the i's dotted, it was not exactly the scheme I thought it would be.  I hope a couple of changes will be made in it.  I had intended to do this myself.  One is that somebody who has been 12 months on the waiting list to qualify for the low rise mortgage scheme should not be required to have had a child for 12 months, a family of three.  This is a mistake.  My original idea was that people who were 12 months on the waiting list should be considered whether or not they had a child.  I know it has been ruled that they must have had a child for 12 months.  That is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>Secondly, people buying new local authority houses should be able to avail of this scheme.  This is one way in which very expensive new houses could be included.  I know it applies to many of them, but it has been ruled by a number of local authorities, and I assume by the Department, that some people who have been six or 12 months in a local authority house are ruled out.  This is a mistake.  It should be looked at again even if it is their first house.</P>

The relief does not specify the extent of the process of manufacture to which goods must be subjected before they can be regarded as coming within the ambit of the relief.  The recommendation in the report referred to by the Deputy that the relief should be substantially reduced or abolished in relation to specific items in order to provide an incentive for the manufacture within the State of by-products of those items could have a damaging effect on the industries concerned, particularly on their employment potential, without necessarily achieving the desired objective.  This appears to have been recognised by the authors of the report who qualify their recommendation by a statement to the effect <Col N="1604" /> that there were many other economic and public policy issues that would need to be considered before a move on the lines recommended by them could be contemplated.  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the initiation of a review on the lines suggested by the Deputy would serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. P. Barry</b> asked the Minister for Finance how the fundamental review of Government spending now being initiated differs from previous reviews and from the normal work in this area done by his Department; the number and grade of staff allocated whole-time to the review; the form it will take; when he expects the first and the final report of the review to be made; if the reports will be published; if any outside experts will be involved; and if he has issued any guidelines or directions for the conduct of the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Government spending is reviewed each year, when the annual departmental Estimates are being settled.  As part of their normal work the staff of my Department examine proposals for extensions of existing services and for new services involving extra Government spending.  In addition, my Department have expert staff who carry out in-depth analytic studies of selected issues.  The annual Estimates reviews, because of the short period available, do not permit a fundamental examination of each and every item of Government expenditure. I have set in motion therefore a comprehensive review which will extend over a short period of years and which will cover the entire field of Government expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, I intend that work on this review would be carried out as far as possible by existing staff&mdash; mainly at assistant principal level&mdash; either by redeployment or otherwise as appropriate.  In addition, we now have a corps of trained analysts, management accountants and other skilled officers throughout the public service and some of these will naturally be closely involved in this <Col N="1605" /> review work.  I might add that, while I consider it preferable at this stage that the work should be not constrained by an overemphasis on specific procedures, I have of course indicated in my financial statement some general guidelines for the review.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, reports on specific issues reviewed in the past have not been published in that they were regarded as internal to Government and part of the confidential advice given by officials to Ministers. However, in this case, the review will form an important part of the continuing series of Green (discussion) and White (decision) papers referred to in the White Paper on National Development.  Furthermore, it will also be an important part of the process of restoring stability to the public finances, because it will enable the Government to take informed decisions.</P>

      <P>Section 244 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provides relief in respect of expenditure incurred on scientific research.  The relief, which applies for income tax and corporation tax purposes, is given by way of deduction as an expense in the computation of trading profits and statistics relating to the various items of expenditure allowed are not recorded. To provide the Deputy with the information sought would require the carrying out of a special survey of all company accounts and it is not considered that the time and effort required for this would be justifiable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 31 January last, the practice of valuing domestic property is under review in the light of the abolition of domestic rates.</P>
      <P>However, in so far as the Deputy seems to be inquiring why any form of valuation of domestic property should continue at all, I can tell him that, as indicated in my reply to his earlier question, the up-dating of the domestic valuation base for each rating authority will have to continue. Otherwise the Government grant to the rating authority in relief of domestic rates would be based on a domestic valuation list which would become more out of date each year since no allowance would be made for additions to the list resulting from new house building and house improvements. Thus the rating authority would get less from the domestic rates grant than if domestic rates had been allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the actual method of keeping the domestic valuation list up to date, this can be done either by continuing to value domestic property on an individual basis or by substituting a method of valuation on an aggregate <Col N="1609" /> basis for each rating authority.  The issues involved in this question are complex however and no final decision has yet been taken in the matter. I regret that for this reason it will not be possible for some time yet to give the definitive answer which I promised the Deputy last month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The processing of potatoes at Tuam has been uneconomic for a number of years and heavy losses have been incurred during the past seven years.  This has been due partly to difficulty in procuring adequate supplies of raw materials at reasonable prices and partly to the very severe competition which the products have been encountering abroad. The decision to cease production has been taken by the company only after very careful consideration of all relevant factors.</P>
      <P>However, the company intend, when the present processing season ends, to commence a major engineering industry in its place.  There will be no displacement of the existing permanent staff of 65 which in fact will be increased by 33 extra full-time workers. The increased employment will, in fact, add £90,000 per annum to the company's payroll at Tuam.

In view of the history of loss-making at the plant and of the fact that employment is being safeguarded, and in fact increased, by the proposed switch to an engineering plant, I do not accept the implications in the Deputy's question.</P>

I put down the question originally to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and it is not my fault that it is being answered by the Minister of State, Deputy Wyse. Is it not an appalling reflection on the outlook for economic development in this country that we cannot process potatoes, the product for which we are world-famous.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the owners of fishing trawlers of whatever nationality operating within Irish territorial waters are liable to Irish tax in respect of profits arising from catches made in these waters; and, if not, if he will introduce legislation to impose such liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Owners of fishing trawlers who are resident in the State are liable to tax on their total profits whether those profits arise from operations within the three-mile limit which constitutes Irish territorial waters or outside that zone. Foreign trawler owners are not permitted to fish within the sixmile limit and accordingly the question of imposing a charge to Irish tax on such owners in respect of profits derived from catches within that area does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may, however, be concerned with catches made in the fishing zone ranging from six miles to 200 miles off our coast.  As he is aware, this zone is outside our tax jurisdiction and, because entitlement to fishing rights within it is at present <Col N="1618" /> the subject of discussion in the EEC, it would be premature at this stage to consider the introduction of fiscal legislation with respect to it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that most of the fishermen likely to fish in this zone are nationals of countries, including other member countries of the EEC, with which this country has concluded double taxation agreements. These agreements provide on a reciprocal basis that the profits of an enterprise resident in a partner country are taxable only in that country unless the enterprise carries on business in Ireland through a permanent establishment situated in Ireland.  The term permanent establishment does not include a fishing vessel.  The agreements in question are given the force of law by Government order under section 361 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and follow the lines of the internationally agreed OECD model.  As provided for in section 361, these agreements have effect notwithstanding anything in any enactment.  Because these agreements take precedence over ordinary domestic law they would negative any legislation introduced with the object of imposing a charge to Irish tax on trawler owners of partner countries who fish in the zone from six to 200 miles off our coast and who do not maintain permanent establishments in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Three-fourths of the Minister's reply was devoted to answering a question which I did not ask. That may have been an excess of courtesy on his part.  Does he not realise that it is intended under existing arrangements that foreign fishing trawlers will be fishing right up to the Irish coast in a short while?  I want to know when they are fishing in Irish territorial waters, which in law is the same as land, will the Minister consider applying the same taxation arrangements to them as apply to Irish trawlers, notwithstanding double taxation agreements?</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that it is envisaged that trawlers which belong to nationals of our partner states in the EEC will be fishing in a short while right up to the Irish coast, would he not agree that there is room for considering the taxation of them on the same basis as Irish trawlers are taxed notwithstanding that they do not reside within the jurisdiction?  Would he agree that there is a case for arguing, and possibly for enacting, an equivalence along the lines that if they are extracting fish from the sea they are doing so in a way which is analogous to extracting ore or minerals from land?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the price of maps which took effect from 1 January 1978 provides for normal cost increases in wages and materials, and also a further element to narrow slightly the gap between the actual cost of production and the selling price of Ordnance Survey maps, which will still be heavily subsidised.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that costs did not rise generally by 25 per cent in the year intervening between the last increase and the second last increase and that a 25 per cent increase is, therefore, a real increase to the people who are using those maps?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The public service, as defined for budgetary purposes, embraces the civil service, Army, Garda, teachers and health board staffs but excludes other branches of the public sector such as State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>I announced in my financial statement last month that the Government had, under their job-creation programme, made financial provision for the creation of a net additional 6,561 new posts in the public sector during 1978.  Four thousand, four hundred and seventy-one of these posts will arise in the public service categories referred to above.  Arrangements are being made to have these posts filled as speedily as possible during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Actual numbers employed in the public service in any one year are also influenced by factors such as the pattern <Col N="1622" /> of vacancies in existing authorised staff complements and the rate at which they are filled.  It is not possible, however, to predict the net effect of these factors on the pattern of public service employment during 1978.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if any plans or feasibility studies exist for the full or partial drainage of the Shannon catchment; and if he will arrange for their updating so as to enable an application to be made to the EEC for aid towards its drainage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>No scheme to deal with the problem of flood control on the Shannon and the treatment of the undrained portion of that catchment under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, has yet been prepared. There is no proposal at present to seek aid from the EEC to finance such a scheme.</P>
      <P>Following a recommendation of the Rydell report of 1956 preliminary investigations of the Shannon flood problem were carried out by engineers of the Office of Public Works and the Electricity Supply Board.  Their report, published in 1961, indicated that further more detailed investigations would be necessary before a scheme to deal with the flood problem and provide for the drainage of the catchment could be produced.  In view of the enormity of the task these investigations have not so far been undertaken except that the hydrometric survey being made of the country generally includes the Shannon catchment.  I am unable to say when the further investigations required are likely to be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the fact that money is now available from the EEC for drainage in the West of Ireland creates a new situation and that in this new situation it would be entirely justifiable for him to go ahead with studies which were suspended in 1961 and have them carried to finality so that a formal application can be made to the EEC within the next two years?

I am now seeking information on the surveys done on the Shannon by American experts.  I understand they came up with the question of banking the Shannon.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £201,684,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of December, 1978, for the salaries and expenses of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was referring to a number of things in the Estimate which I thought needed explanation and I should like now to continue in that vein.  The number of houses built must be continued at around 25,000 level for a number of years to come and in order to achieve that level, it will be necessary <Col N="1658" /> to have the local authority schemes kept up to somewhere between 6,500 and 8,000 houses per year.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest problems facing the Minister will, of course, be the provision of money.  While I know the present Government have increased the qualification limit to £3,500 for SDA loans and the amount which can be borrowed to £7,000 I believe they are miscalculating when they suggest this will solve all the problems.  To give that as a reason for reducing the number of local authority houses being built is, to say the least of it, a bit ridiculous and I would ask the Minister to look at it again because, if he follows that line, he will find before very long what I found, namely, that there is no point in increasing the amount of the SDA loan for someone who cannot afford the repayments. This is a very significant point and I am afraid that in the efforts to give the impression that something big was being done for the building industry the publicity attached to the increase in the amount for SDA loans was blown up and the mechanics of it were obviously not properly examined. Someone on an ordinary week's wages will not now apparently be considered for rehousing and he will find it extremely difficult to borrow £7,000 or, if he does succeed in borrowing it, he will find it extremely difficult to repay it.  This is no substitute for local authority houses and I would appeal to the Minister to continue building local authority houses and to expand the low rise mortgage or in some other way ensure those at the bottom of the income scale will not be left out in the cold.  They were left out in the cold by a Fianna Fáil Government before and I would not like to see that happen again.  I ask that the matter be well examined and some effort made to ensure that this policy does not work out in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction of the interest rates on a local authority SDA mortgage is something which all of us who held ministerial office had to look at from time to time.  It is always necessary to remember the high interest rate being paid by the State in borrowing the money but that is cold comfort to the <Col N="1659" /> people who have borrowed and are repaying it.  While the amount has been reduced following a very substantial reduction in interest rates generally, the interest rate on SDA loans has not been reduced sufficiently and I ask that this matter get immediate attention and a further reduction in SDA interest rates be considered.</P>
    <P>I come now to one of the main ways of financing housing, namely, the building societies.  It was my privilege to put through this House, with the assistance of Members on both sides, the most recent legislation dealing with building societies.  There was a feeling at one stage that the Bill should simply and solely look after one or other sectional interest, but that was not my idea, the idea of the Government or of the House so, when the Bill went through, it took into consideration a number of aspects which made good sense.  At the moment the interest rates paid on building society loans is fairly low and the interest paid on building society investments is still lower.  The building societies, with the immense amount of money they are now taking in, might have another look at the interest rates they are paying because it is the small investors from whom they are getting their money and those small investors should, in my opinion, get more than they are getting at the present time. I believe this could be done without increasing the rate to the borrower. Again, if they are not prepared to do that, they should have a good look at the rate they are charging the borrower.  Perhaps the gap between the amount they are paying and the amount they are getting is a bit too small.  Building societies borrow short and lend long.  That is one of their big problems but they have now got security&mdash;thanks again to the activities of the previous Government and to the officials of the Department who carried out negotiations and finalised matters before the change of Government.  There is now greater security in investing in building societies but a tight watch must be kept on the way building society funds are handled.  I am not saying that those <Col N="1660" /> who run those societies are not honest, reliable people, but they have their own interests and the interests of the societies to think about and it is from that point of view they will deal with their funds.</P>
    <P>With regard to the guarantee given by builders on the completion of houses, there may be a great deal of misunderstanding about this.  This guarantee was sought over a number of years.  Negotiations were carried out by officials during the period of the last Government and they were finalised with an official of the federation before the change of Government took place.  That should be on record.  The construction industry federation were very anxious to ensure they would have a big say and, while they have a say, it would be wrong if they had the entire say.  The Department must look after this aspect.  I believe this will do a great deal of good.  It should not be a political football and it was a mistake on the part of the Minister to give the impression that this was something he thought up and put into operation in a matter of weeks.  This is the result of a great deal of hard work over a number of years.  A number of speculative builders had no regard for anybody and the time had come when something had to be done to ensure these did not continue to operate in the way in which they were operating.  Most builders are decent, reliable people who do a good job and these others were dragging their name down into the mud.  I am glad this is now in operation but I repeat it was not something just thought up overnight.</P>
    <P>Two of the things the Government have done, things they made a song and dance about in their election manifesto and things which had a great deal to do with the result of that election, are the abolition of rates and tax on motor vehicles up to 16 horse power.  One of the things that should be remembered in regard to rates is the fact that rates generally were affected by the activities of the previous Government who took health and housing completely off the rates. Rates this year would be approximately £8.50 in the £ more than they would <Col N="1661" /> have been but for the fact that health and housing were removed from them. They were taken off everything, including all kinds of land and industry.  This was the difference between the previous Government and the present Government.</P>
    <P>Last year a decision was made to take one-quarter of the rates off housing and this made it much easier for the Government to complete something that had been started by their predecessors.  I am not quarrelling with the decision made but there is one aspect about which I am not happy. This year we had intended to take the remaining three-quarters away.  The present Government have taken away the full amount, and good luck to them.  However, they are claiming credit for something for which they are only partially or marginally responsible.  If health and housing charges had not been taken off the rates by the previous Government, the job of taking the entire amount away in one fell swoop would be very much greater.  In fact, it would be almost impossible.  They would not be able to find overnight another £8.50 in the £.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if local government reorganisation is going ahead.  Is it intended to take into consideration the fact that rates are not now the big source of cash for local authorities as in previous years and will this have an influence on the effectiveness of local authority elected representatives? It should not, but there is a grave danger that people at the top will take the attitude that as they are not paying the piper now they may call the tune to a much lesser extent.  This is something that would be opposed not only by those people opposed to the Government but by their own local representatives. I shall never forget when I took over in the Customs House the number of Fianna Fáil councillors who told me that they were in complete agreement with my decision not to do away with the 42 small local authorities as my predecessor had proposed. Those representatives will not have changed.  They are honoured that they are elected to represent their area on the local authority and that honour <Col N="1662" /> and responsibility should be left with them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of car tax, on one occasion I attempted to get the car tax from payment for petrol.  The reason that attempt foundered was that at the same time I wanted to have included third-party insurance.  If the Government stipulate that every vehicle on the road must have at least third-party insurance, the onus is on the Government to ensure that such insurance is available.  This Government, or some future Government must adopt that course.  At the present time there is a £5 charge on cars up to 16 h.p. which is a relatively small amount of money, but when one considers the cost of insurance it is obvious that many vehicles are neither taxed or insured.  That is entirely wrong.  There is the possibility that there will be many vehicles on our roads that will be a grave danger to the public because not alone do drivers not have a licence but they also do not have insurance.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk recently about insurance and the cost of full comprehensive cover.  I had full comprehensive insurance for a car for £87 with a certain insurance company. When I got a new car costing £3,000 and asked for additional cover for it I was quoted what they considered to be a reasonable sum&mdash;£400.75 per annum.  If they would do that to me who had a no-claims bonus, what would they do to a young person who buys an old jalopy?  The whole question of insurance is more important than road tax and I would ask the Minister to examine the situation seriously before it gets any worse.</P>
    <P>An extraordinary thing has happended quite recently.  The change of Government had nothing to do with it, but since the middle of last summer the number of road fatalities has increased out of all recognition.  For a period of three years there was a gradual decrease in the number and we were delighted that the efforts of the Road Safety Association and others were having some effect.  However, the graph has gone in the other direction. I do not know why, but for some extraordinary reason the number of <Col N="1663" /> people killed on the roads is growing daily.</P>
    <P>A definite effort will have to be made to prevent this slaughter.  We talk about what is happening in Northern Ireland but there are far more people killed here every week than are killed in a month in the troubles in the North.  The Road Safety Association are doing an excellent job but they must get more assistance.  However, one thing has happened with which I disagree and I cannot see why it was allowed.  I am referring to cases of drunken driving.  I do not understand why the tests carried out in such instances were abandoned.  There is some talk that they may be introduced in a stronger way.  Talk will never stop drunken driving.  The only thing that will stop it is a stringent application of the law and I would appeal to the Government to reintroduce the tests. A life lost cannot be replaced and there is no use in saying we intend to do something about it if we do not take action.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on increasing the improvement grants for houses and also for the provision of water and sewerage services.  This is something I would have done if I were in the Minister's place.  I am glad the Minister has taken action and that he has been able to get the necessary money.  It is extra-ordinary in this country that people tend to leave a relatively good house and build one that may cost the earth but which will not be a patch on the original dwelling if a few pounds were spent on it.  The Department should encourage people to keep their old houses in repair and should give grants for this purpose.  There are a number of charitable organisations in this city who are working on this aspect.  I had discussions with them and with the Archbishop of Dublin.  These people should be given financial assistance to help in this matter.</P>
    <P>The question of the inner city housing is tied up with keeping reasonably good houses in good repair. It is no use in saying they have gone beyond repair or that they are quite old.  Some of the houses throughout <Col N="1664" /> the country have been built for very many years and yet they are much better than modern ones.  Every encouragement should be given to local authorities and private individuals to help in this matter. Similar assistance should be given for the provision of water and sewerage schemes.  I do not think it was a good idea to centralise the administration of water and sewerage schemes, reconstruction grants and new housing grants.  I wanted them spread out throughout the country.  A number of local authorities took on pilot schemes and they did quite well.  A person examining a house for the purpose of a loan could also examine it for the purpose of finding out if it qualified for a grant.  The Minister would be well advised to have another look at this because that is real local government.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about house prices.  House prices again seems to be going out through the ceiling.  I was rather amused to see the document produced showing the index of house prices for the past month.  It showed no change from February to March.  I presume that is the correct situation but, if you go out to buy a house, that does not appear to be so. I am well aware that the certificate of reasonable value should not allow the price of houses to be exorbitant. I imagine the reason why the price of houses is going up so quickly is that the costs of the materials which make up the house have gone up.  A builder is blamed for increasing the price of his house by £1,000 at the same time as the £1,000 grant came into operation, but he is only reflecting the additional cost of the materials he is putting into those houses.  This has to be faced up to.  It is certainly not the fault of the Department that these things are happening.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I wanted to cover.  I wish the Minister well.  I am quite sure he is as anxious to see the Department properly run as I was.  I am quite sure he will get the same excellent co-operation from his officials as I got.  I am quite sure when he puts something before the House it will be based on the best possible advice.  I should like to warn him that <Col N="1665" /> he should not attempt to give the impression that he can press a button and produce endless amounts of money to do things which are necessary but for which the money is not available. I would have done them, and my predecessors would have done them, if the money had been available, but it was not there.  An impression builds up in people's minds that if they shout loudly enough they will get what they want.</P>
    <P>I will finish on the question of the planning board.  They are doing a good job.  They may be tied up because the technical advice in the inspection system may not be available as quickly as it should be.  Unfortunately, over the past five or six years, or perhaps a little bit longer, we have had professional protesters who protest against everything under the sun.  Nothing makes me so mad as when somebody buys a house in a new housing scheme and sees green fields all around him and wants to retain them.  That is not possible.  These people should catch themselves on and allow progress to be made.  The position is the same in regard to industry.  These people impede industrial progress.  I would ask them to be reasonable and see that it is not in the best interests of the country to do what they want done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. J. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of the Minister in opening this debate shows the scale and range of the activities of the Department of the Environment.  The Department are involved in the implementation of many of the main planks of the policies of the Government as enshrined in our election manifesto.  Rates on domestic and certain other properties have been abolished and alternative arrangements have been devised to finance the operations of local authorities. Road tax on private cars up to 16 horse power and on all motor cycles has gone.  The scheme of £1,000 grants and the improved housing loans scheme are putting new life into the private housing sector.  The substantially increased house improvement grants and the broadening of the field of eligibility for those grants are providing <Col N="1666" /> a major spurt to this important facet of our housing programme.  The additional financial allocations provided by the Government for roads, water and sewerage schemes, environmental works, and so on, are providing the extra jobs to which the Government are so much committed.</P>
      <P>In this contribution to the debate on the Environment Estimate I shall for the most part be concentrating on the particular areas of the Department's operations with which I am concerned.  To that extent, what I have to say will be selective.  This may be all to the good.  The Minister in opening this debate demonstrated the range and scope of the activities of the Department of the Environment.  He necessarily had to curtail his review of certain aspects of what the Department do.  I hope to deal somewhat more extensively with a number of important items.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully expressed concern that the Government's action on rates would erode local authority powers. This fear is entirely unfounded.  In his opening speech the Minister made it clear that the arrangements proposed would not interfere in any way with the discretion of local authorities to determine priorities within the rate in the £ they strike.  Local authorities will continue to exercise their best judgment on local priorities.</P>
      <P>The Government since taking office have demonstrated the sincerity of their intentions on job-creation.  No-where has this been more apparent than in the building and construction industry.  The prosperity of the industry is vital for the economy as a whole. The chronic unemployment situation inherited from the previous Government was worst of all in the building sector.  In the early part of 1977 the number of unemployed building workers reached a peak more than twice the level for 1973.  Once the new Government had taken office action was speedily taken to create jobs in building and construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional financial allocations were made last July for roads, water supply and sewerage schemes, and for environmental works, local improvement schemes, as well.  This approach has <Col N="1667" /> been reaffirmed by the further substantial allocations announced in the budget for 1978.  Opposition Deputies like to give the impression that the Government's measures on job-creation simply look good on paper but have no effect whatever on the ground. Unfortunately if they say this often enough, some people will be foolish enough to believe them.  This is why we on the Government side have to keep on putting the record straight.</P>
    <P>I am concerned in this debate with the job-creation record for the area for which I have responsibility, that is, the building and construction industry. The measures taken by the Government specifically to create jobs in building and construction have meant the creation of 1,670 new jobs up to the end of December 1977.  The vast bulk of these jobs were in areas for which the Minister for the Environment is responsible.  Road works alone accounted for 700 workers.  There are two points I should like to emphasise here.  First, all these 1,670 jobs are direct on-site jobs.  Consequently, they do not reflect the full extent of the employment created.</P>
    <P>There has been estimated spin-off employment in the building materials industry and elsewhere of about 500. Secondly for those of a doubting disposition these figures are for persons actually working.  They are based on returns supplied by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Apart from the specific job-creation measures, other steps taken by the Government have given a boost to employment. Here I refer particularly to the introduction of the £1,000 grant for the first-time owner occupiers of new houses and the increased loan and income limits for housing loans from local authorities.  The resulting increase in employment on house-building cannot be quantified in detail.  Past experience indicates that the increased activity in the private housing sector has meant about an extra 1,000 jobs by the end of December last.</P>
    <P>The initiatives of the Government in the early weeks of office were, of course, only the beginning of the Government's job-creation programme for <Col N="1668" /> the building and construction industry. The real impact will be seen this year.  Public capital expenditure allocations affecting the building and construction industry in 1978 amount to £458 million, an increase of £86 million or 23 per cent on 1977.</P>
    <P>This represents a substantial increase in real terms.  It is expected that it may be sufficient to create up to 5,000 further direct jobs.  As with the additional jobs created in 1977, careful records of the new jobs will be kept. Any critics of the programme can rest easy in the knowledge that when we claim jobs have been created we are speaking of people actually working and not simply of jobs on paper.  While remaining sensitive about the job-creation programme and consequently ready at all times to defend it against ill-informed criticism, the Government are not foolish enough to believe that the programme of itself is solving the unemployment problem.  What has been done shows a commitment to fighting unemployment in the building and construction industry.  By making a start we are creating an atmosphere of confidence in the private sector. Evidence of confidence being restored has been there since the autumn of last year.  I am sure the Government's belief is justified and will be vindicated by the increased building and construction output this year.  On the basis of the information available to date, output this year will top the £900 million mark.  This would see the industry back on the road to prosperity.</P>
    <P>When speaking about the construction industry Deputy Keating mentioned the position along East Wall in Dublin.  He told the House that children living in that area must play on the railway line.  My information is that children do not have to play on the railway.  I am told that immediately beside this area Fairview Park is located, a large and well laid out open space.  The well laid out Clontarf promenade is also adjacent to East Wall.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate to be moved at the conclusion of this debate provides £4.2 million for two schemes to stimulate employment among young <Col N="1669" /> persons.  The two schemes involved were put forward by the Employment Action Team set up by the Government to devise schemes for youth employment. The major scheme is for a programme of environmental improvement schemes to be carried out by local authorities.  I would not like persons to believe that this is, as one Deputy said, a &ldquo;sham&rdquo;.  This is an entirely new scheme.  The programme is expected to provide employment for young workers equivalent to 1,000 jobs of one year's duration.  Secondly, the works to be undertaken will have considerable environmental, recreational and amenity value to the community. The second scheme is somewhat more modest in its employment potential.  It envisages the employment by local authorities of 150 first-year apprentices to construction.  Nevertheless, it will afford an opportunity to young persons to learn worth-while trades like carpentry, plumbing, plastering, blocklaying and so on to meet the problem of shortage of certain skilled tradesmen in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister when introducing this estimate dealt at some length with the scheme of £1,000 grants for first-time owner occupiers of new houses.  I do not intend to go over the same ground. I would however, like to comment briefly on some recent spurious suggestions that, because all or most of the grants applied for have not already been paid, the scheme is of no benefit. This puerile attempt to discredit the scheme cannot succeed.  Everybody knows that, on average, it takes six to 12 months to complete a house.  The grant is payable only on completion and occupation of the house.  Bearing in mind that the earliest starting date under the scheme was 26 May 1977 it is only from now on that the grants will be maturing for payment in any number.  I know that the existence of a decent grant has been a tremendous help to young couples in buying their own homes.  In many cases it has meant the difference between being able to buy a house around the time of their marriage and having to wait to scrape together a deposit.  The trouble about waiting is that additional savings can very easily be eaten up by <Col N="1670" /> higher prices.  The result then is that many couples would end up never being able to achieve the goal of owning their own house.  The grant can be approved as soon as purchase has been agreed or before building commences, as the case may be.  By authorising the payment of the grant direct to their bank account, applicants will often be facilitated by the bank as far as a deposit or building finance is concerned.  The same applies in relation to bridging loans while people are waiting to have local authority loans approved.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger that the additional demand for new houses created by the Government's measure, combined with the additional money being injected into the private house industry, could result in increased prices of houses.  Such a development would ultimately tend to defeat the very purpose of the Government's measures.  I appreciate that new house costs will have to increase to reflect increased labour and material costs. We must do everything possible to ensure that prices are not increased further to facilitate excessive profit taking by builders, developers or speculators by exploiting what is a basic human need.  This is why I am very anxious to ensure that we have an effective form of control on the prices of grant-type houses and flats. These dwellings are benefiting substantially from State aids, whether by way of grants, loans or stamp duty exemption.  It is only just that the prices charged should be seen to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned, the system of certificates of reasonable value was extended last July to cover all grant-type houses and flats built for sale.  It was made a condition of payment of these grants that the builder of a house or flat should have obtained a certificate of reasonable value in respect of the price being charged.  Since taking up office I have studied the operation of these controls. I am satisfied that the method of assessment of reasonable value for the purpose of issuing certificates is a fair one and that it strikes the right balance between the interests of both <Col N="1671" /> builders and purchasers.  It is inevitable that there are some builders who do not welcome any form of control on house prices.  It is, however, clear that if they are building houses which are benefiting from public funds they must accept some degree of control.  Many purchasers although embarking on the major financial transaction of their lives very often have little experience of house prices and no knowledge of building costs.  It must be comforting to them to know that a particular price has been accepted by the Department as representing reasonable value.  The issue of a certificate also means that the plans and specification comply with the Department's standards.  It ensures that inspections will be carried out to check that the houses or flats are not being built to an inferior standard. This is of particular importance in the case of any dwelling which is not guaranteed.  I will be returning to this point again.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the fact that the scope of the controls had been extended to take in grant-type flats.  I am pleased to say that we have just recently issued the first certificates of reasonable value in respect of a flat development.  First-time purchasers of these flats will now be eligible for the £1,000 grant and they will all qualify for stamp duty exemption.  I trust that this refutes allegations and suggestions which have come from certain quarters that the Department are not serious about giving CRVs and consequently grants for flats.  As far as I am concerned there is no bias whatever against flats or in favour of houses. I think that flats have an important role in the private building sector particularly in the larger urban areas. There are a number of other flat projects for which applications have been received and examination of these is proceeding as quickly as possible. These will also be considered on their merits.  Certificates will issue if they are regarded as representing reasonable value at the prices proposed.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years reductions in prices of houses for which CRVs were originally sought amounted to more than £1½ million.  This is an in-controvertible <Col N="1672" /> reply to anyone who questions the value of the controls.  It is, however, by no means a full measure of the benefits to house purchasers. Indeed it could be said that they have most effect before the builder submits his price for examination.  I think it would be generally agreed that the system has been responsible for a much more logical and disciplined approach to pricing on the part of builders than was the case previously.</P>
    <P>Experience has also shown that there are a number of areas where the existing system should be tightened up.  It is intended to do so in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1977, which, as Deputies are aware, has already been introduced by long and short titles.  These amendments to section 35 of the Housing Act, 1966, will not involve any fundamental change in the operation of the scheme.  Rather they will be aimed at preventing any abuses of the system such as builders misleading purchasers or taking unfair advantage of them under price variation clauses.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to standards of building in the context of CRVs.  I would now like to expand on this aspect in the light of the new structural guarantee scheme which was referred to earlier by Deputy Tully.  It has long been recognised both among house builders and among the general public that there was a need for some system of guarantees on privately built houses and flats.  This need arose from the point of view of both protecting the purchaser against irresponsible builders and faulty workmanship and protecting the reputation of house builders in general.  The unscrupulous activities of a small number of dishonest operators which have been highlighted from time to time serve to reinforce this conviction.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is clear that the Department and the Construction Industry Federation as the representative of house builders had a mutual interest in developing a satisfactory guarantee scheme.  Such a scheme has been in operation since the beginning of this year and it is a tribute to the results of close co-operation in pursuit of a common objective.  I am confident that <Col N="1673" /> this spirit of co-operation will result in worth-while benefits to house purchasers.</P>
    <P>The scheme as announced last January provides for the preparation by the guarantee company of a register of builders who are qualified to participate in the scheme.  Before being admitted to the register, builders' financial and technical capacity to build houses or flats of a good standard is vetted.  I understand that the level of interest already shown by builders is very encouraging and that a total of 176 building firms had been registered by 22 February 1978.  I would expect that many people providing new houses for themselves will now, before committing themselves to a contract for the purchase or erection of a house, check whether their builder is registered under the guarantee scheme. Similarly, it is to be hoped that the various lending agencies will give all possible support to the scheme.  This is most important.</P>
    <P>It should be clearly understood that the Department accept no responsibility for any guarantee given by the company.  Nevertheless the Department have, through their housing inspectorate, a vital role in the operation of the scheme.  Each house for which a guarantee is sought will be inspected at three stages&mdash;foundation, roofing and completion&mdash;before a guarantee certificate is issued.  The Department will monitor closely the operation of the scheme by the attendance of two officers as observers at all meetings of the company.</P>
    <P>The guarantee covers any major structural defects arising within a six-year period after completion.  It is the builder's responsibility in the first instance to make good any structural defects.  In the event of default the guarantee company will honour the guarantee and may remove the builder from the register.  I want to stress that this scheme will be fully reviewed after two years of operation to see if it is fulfilling the need for which it was established.  If it is, then perhaps we can talk about expanding its scope&mdash; for instance, to cover a greater range of defects or to extend the six-year time limit.  But if, on the other hand, it is not proving satisfactory we will have <Col N="1674" /> no alternative but to consider other solutions.</P>
    <P>Before departing from the realm of private housing, I should like to refer to the present indications of the vastly increased activity generated by the house improvement grants scheme announced last December.  This is evident from a look at the volume of applications coming into the Department.</P>
    <P>In the period 1 January to the end of February 1978 we received 5,200 applications for reconstruction and water/sewerage grants whereas in the same period last year only 2,778 applications were received.  It was essential that the former Government's tendency not to encourage the conservation and improvement of existing houses should be halted.  Our housing stock is an enormously important national asset and not to encourage the conservation of such an asset was surely economic lunacy.  It was bad business and bad management.  In January 1977 instead of increasing the construction, water and sewerage grants to allow for rapidly increasing costs the Government decided to restrict eligibility for reconstruction grants to houses which complied with certain valuation limits.  No credible reason for this apparently illogical step was ever given.  It certainly never made sense to me.  What it did point to was a total lack of any comprehensive housing policy because conservation and improvement of existing houses must form a vital plank of any such policy.</P>
    <P>As with improvement grants generally, the maximum amount payable by the Department to local authorities for recoupment of grants in respect of the adaptation of houses to facilitate occupants suffering from physical handicap or acute mental illness remained inadequate.  The previous maximum of £400 had become totally divorced from the real cost of these alterations.  I am particularly pleased that this figure has now been trebled.  I am having the position about essential repair grants reviewed at the moment and I hope that, as with the reconstruction and water and sewerage grants, the maximum amount payable by the Department for these works <Col N="1675" /> will be increased.  This matter was mentioned by Deputy Deasy yesterday when he inquired about section 30 grants for essential repairs to houses.</P>
    <P>As regards road safety which was mentioned by previous speakers, apart from the direct investment in our roads system there are other important matters related to overall road policy on which I should like to touch.  Even though I dealt with some of them in the recent budget debate they are serious enough to merit adverting to them again.  Deputies, and I am sure the public at large are aware of the continuing intolerable level of road accidents.  Certain aspects of this deplorable situation deserve to be highlighted.</P>
    <P>Provisional figures show that 576 people were killed and 8,099 injured on our roads in 1977.  The figure for deaths is 51 more than the total for 1976, an increase of almost 10 per cent.  The increase in deaths recorded in the Dublin Garda Metropolitan area was almost 50 per cent.  In other words, last year an average of some 24 people suffered either death or injury in road accidents every single day of the year.  Is this not an alarming state of affairs for such a small country with such a relatively small population?  It is impossible to assess the grief and pain to which these accidents give rise, and my sympathy goes to all concerned.  A secondary, but nevertheless very disturbing, feature is the economic consequences of accidents.  In terms of medical services, Garda costs, damage to property and loss of output, it has been estimated at some £40 million in 1976 by An Foras Forbartha.  With more people killed and injured during 1977 and allowing for increased costs, the bill for road accidents will be even more staggering. If resources of this magnitude could be diverted to job creation purposes what an impact it would make on the economy.  I would appeal earnestly to all road users&mdash;motorists, cyclists and pedestrians&mdash;to exercise more care on the roads and to have a little more consideration for others. This would help in no small way to <Col N="1676" /> achieve a worth-while reduction in the accident toll.</P>
    <P>Apart from the contribution which could be made by a sensible attitude on the part of all road users, there are other factors which help significantly in lessening the level of carnage on the roads.  Over half the drivers on our roads are persons who had to undergo a driving test before obtaining a full licence.  I have no doubt that the knowledge and skill acquired to undergo the test has kept a bad accident situation from becoming even worse.  I would like to take the opportunity to remind all drivers who have undergone and passed a test to strive at all times to drive to the same standard.  While speaking of the test, there have been suggestions from time to time that a proportion at least of persons taking the test are deliberately failed as a matter of policy.  This is completely untrue.  The test standards are set at a realistic level and uniformly applied.  The emphasis is on ensuring that only those who can drive normally are issued with a full licence.  With a big increase in the number of applications for the test last year there has been a longer waiting period in most areas.  However, extra testers are now being recruited to cope with this demand.</P>
    <P>Periodic surveys over the past few years have shown that upwards of 80 per cent of cars have some defect or other.  Some are seriously defective.  It has to be said that this is a sad reflection on many vehicle owners.  It shows a total lack of responsibility, given the daily reminders of road accidents. Lights, brakes, tyres and steering are the items most commonly found defective. I appeal to all motorists in their own interests and in the interests of the public generally to have regular and effective checks carried out on their vehicles.</P>
    <P>In this general context I wish to acknowledge again the considerable effort being made by the Garda, An Foras Forbartha and the National Road Safety Association in the interests of road safety.  I will, of course, support their efforts to the fullest possible extent.  This year, as subhead L of the Estimate we are discussing shows, we will be spending almost <Col N="1677" /> £250,000 on the promotion of road safety through the National Road Safety Association.  The programme of the association for 1978 includes the continued expansion of the national cycling training scheme and the junior school warden scheme, the production of a further series of public service filmlets for television, continued publicity on reflective armbands and safety belts, and a series of general road safety posters.</P>
    <P>I should also acknowledge the contribution being made by local authorities in the field of road safety.  The guidelines issued by the Department to the authorities recommend that, in the selection of projects to be carried out by them under their annual road programmes, they should take positive steps to upgrade road safety design standards for all road users.  They could do this, for example, by the provision of non-skid surfaces, the elimination of accident black spots, the improvement of substandard junctions, the provision of pedestrian facilities and the improvement of the standard of public lighting generally.</P>
    <P>The number of motor vehicles on our roads continues to grow.  In 1977 for example, there were nearly 750,000. With this level of traffic one of the most pressing problems facing urban authorities is that of traffic congestion. It remains the responsibility of each local authority to determine the priorities in the expenditure of the funds made available to them by way of block grants.  Incidentally these grants have been increased this year by over £1 million.  In the allocation of the block grants certain guidelines have been laid down in relation to the selection of projects which include the installation of co-ordinated signal systems, one-way systems and other measures for the proper management of the road systems, including the operation of a traffic warden service. The enforcement of parking controls is in general the responsibility of the Garda, under whose aegis traffic wardens operate in Dublin, Cork, Athlone and Killarney.  A number of local authorities&mdash;Dundalk, Ennis, Naas and Tullamore Urban District Councils and Galway and Limerick Corporations&mdash;have already availed of the <Col N="1678" /> Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1974, to employ traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy yesterday advocated a more extensive use of traffic wardens by local authorities as a means of easing the flow of traffic in towns.  I am glad to say that, in addition to the towns I mentioned, a number of other local authorities are considering the implementation of the Act.  The Act empowers the local authority to provide a warden service for another authority. This procedure is being used by, for example, Tipperary (South Riding) County Council who have employed wardens and will deploy them as necessary initially in Clonmel and then throughout the county.  This is an arrangement which other county councils could consider.  I should like to congratulate the authorities who have taken the initiative and operated this scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards vehicle registration, I should like to say that progress in the computerisation of vehicle registration has been significantly faster than had been anticipated due to the abolition of road tax on cars not exceeding 16 horse power and on all motor cycles. At present details of about 200,000 vehicles, from the total vehicle population of about 750,000, are on computer files.  It is now expected that the national vehicle file on computer will be completed by about the end of 1979. The computerised records will be directly available to the Garda on a 24-hour seven days a week basis.  These records will be of assistance to the Garda in the administration of the road traffic law and in the areas of crime detection and security.  The records will also facilitate action on evasion of payment of vehicle excise duty.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy representing a predominantly rural area I have always been interested in the group water scheme movement.  Piped water supplies are a basic need for the economic and social development of rural areas. The progressive farmer needs piped water to ensure hygiene on the farm, to secure higher yields of good quality milk and to promote the healthy development of livestock.  Without piped water rural families are faced with the drudgery of drawing water to the <Col N="1679" /> house each day of the week.  Some 15 years or so ago a vigorous programme commenced to bring piped water to rural houses and associated farms.  It was not economically feasible for county councils to undertake this programme on their own.  For this reason special grants were instituted to encourage rural communities to undertake private co-operative water schemes, more commonly known as group schemes.  These schemes have been an outstanding success and the figures speak for themselves.  To date, piped water has been installed in nearly 57,000 houses by group schemes. Work is in progress on schemes to serve 8,000 more houses.  Some 200 further schemes are designed to serve an additional 8,400 houses.  Group schemes have given an estimated 40,000 farms access to a piped water supply.</P>
    <P>The success of group schemes is due, first and foremost, to the tremendous work done on a completely voluntary basis by scheme promoters and local committees throughout the country. The county councils play a vital role in stimulating group schemes actively by developing sources and laying pipes and main trunk lines to suitable take-off points for local group schemes and by providing financial and technical assistance.  It is right to mention the Department's group scheme inspectors who are available to advise and assist groups from the early stages right through to the completion of the water schemes involved. These inspectors are doing a tremendous job on the ground.</P>
    <P>Group schemes started from small beginnings.  In the early 1960s the typical scheme served 30 houses or fewer.  The number of houses provided with a domestic piped water supply by way of group schemes was just in excess of 1,000 annually.  Today individual group schemes may serve up to 600 houses.  The number of houses served each year is approaching the 8,000 mark.  Group schemes are now really big business.  Last year public and private investment in group schemes is estimated to have exceeded £4 million.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these successes, far <Col N="1680" /> too many rural dwellings and farms are still denied access to piped water. Schemes are becoming more expensive because of rising wages and material costs.  Schemes have increasingly to be undertaken in difficult terrain.  It was against this background that the Government decided to increase the maximum grant for a domestic water supply installed through a group scheme from £200 to £300 per house for schemes commenced on or after 1 November 1977.  The grant of up to £200 will continue to be paid for each potential farm supply catered for by a group scheme.  The result is very substantial increases to £3.1 million in the provision for the payments of group grants in 1978.  I feel sure that these measures will maintain the impetus of the group scheme movement towards the ultimate goal of piped water for every home.  What I have said about the campaign to provide rural dwellers with the basic amenity of a piped water supply should provide a measure of assurance to Deputy Deasy, who spoke yesterday about the plight of those without a piped water supply.</P>
    <P>The wide scope of the local government superannuation code may not be generally appreciated.  The code applies to both officers and manual workers employed by local authorities. The total number of pensionable employees is more than 35,000.  In addition the code covers approximately 30,000 health board employees, 6,000 employees of vocational education committees, 1,000 employees of committees of agriculture and 3,000 employees of other bodies, such as corporate bodies established under both health and local government legislation.  In all the superannuation provisions provide for no less than 75,000 employees.  The types of people covered include a wide range of persons&mdash;for example, doctors, engineers, road workers, nurses, administrators, general workers, agricultural instructors and so on.  The total cost of the benefits now being paid to pensioners by the bodies in question is estimated at about £18 million a year.  The local government superannuation code may well be exceptional in the extent and <Col N="1681" /> range of its coverage.  It is also unique in so far as no other part of the statutory functions of the Minister involves direct responsibility for such a wide diversity of bodies.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given put in perspective the background to the changes in superannuation conditions to which the Minister referred in his opening speech.  The changes follow from a report submitted in June 1977 by a working party set up by the previous Government.  The working party comprises representatives of both staff and management interests as well as officers of the Departments of the Environment, the Public Service and Health.  In accordance with the working party's recommendations, most of the changes and conditions form part of an inclusive package for which individual employees may exercise an option up to 31 May next.  Any employee who does not opt to have the new conditions applied to him has the right to remain under the superannuation conditions to which he was subject immediately prior to 27 May 1977, which is the effective date for the working party's recommendations generally.  The changes are being brought into effect in advance of enabling legislation.  It was considered essential to do this.  Otherwise there would inevitably have been a considerable time lag in introducing the new conditions.  There would be resultant hardship both for existing employees coming to retirement and for dependants of former employees.  I assure the House that it is the intention to press ahead as quickly as possible with new legislation under which statutory effect will be given to the new conditions.</P>
    <P>A manual worker who opts for the new arrangements may join a widows' and orphans' pension scheme similar to the scheme which has been in operation for the officer grades for some years.  This is a progressive step which will enable manual workers to make contingency provisions for their dependants by means of a relatively small contribution from their incomes. Manual workers in the local service have maintained for some years that they should have the same rights as officers in relation to a scheme of this kind.  I am pleased that their justifiable <Col N="1682" /> grievance in this respect is now being met.  I am also glad that the distinction which existed between officers and manual workers in regard to the payment of a lump sum on retirement is now being removed.  In future a manual worker will be able to qualify on retirement for a lump sum.  That sum, as in the case of an officer, can range up to one-and-a-half times his annual pay.</P>
    <P>Other changes of note relating to manual workers include the removal of certain restrictions in the reckoning of service for pension purposes, added years for a worker who is forced to retire prematurely because of permanent infirmity, and the ability to restore for pension purposes service given in past years which as a result of options made at the time was not pensionable.  The new arrangements provide that in the case of service given after 27 May 1977 by a manual worker both his rate of superannuation contributions and his rate of pension accrual will take into account his entitlement to social welfare benefits.  This new arrangement applies only to manual workers who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  Its effect is to give combined local authority and social welfare pensions of not less than half pay after 40 years service.  The thinking behind this new arrangement is that pension entitlement should be viewed as a whole.  It does not matter whether the pensions are paid by the State through the social welfare system or by the employer provided reasonable provision is made overall.</P>
    <P>A number of important improvements are being made in the superannuation conditions of local authority officers.  Unlike a manual worker who could always qualify for his full superannuation entitlement after 40 years service, an officer could not qualify for full lump sum until he had 45 years service.  An officer can now qualify under the new conditions for full lump sum after 40 years service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a proportionate increase in the amount of <Col N="1683" /> the lump sum where service is less than 40 years.  There are other valuable provisions which apply to both officers and manual workers.  Accrued superannuation benefit can be preserved until the age of 60 where an employee chooses to retire voluntarily before that age.  The minimum period of service to qualify for a lump sum and pension on retirement at age 60 has been reduced from 20 to five years. Extra years of pension credit can be purchased where service would fall short of 40 years at the age of 65. These are some of the changes being made in the superannuation conditions of employees of local authorities and other bodies covered by the local government superannuation code.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Planning and Development Acts, 1963 and 1976, provide for the planning framework within which objectives for the promotion of development by the provision of the infrastructure and other measures necessary to meet present and future requirements can be formulated.  These requirements will make great demands on resources, particularly in the case of services such as housing, roads and sanitary services.  With a rising population we must look to the industrial and services sectors to provide very considerable increases in employment.  The rate of urban expansion over the next 20 years is likely to be significantly greater than that which took place during the past 30 years.  Urbanisation on this scale will give rise to major problems for the local government sector.  These factors emphasise the need for carefully prepared development plans, providing an adequate framework for accommodating the development and services for such population growth.  The first five-yearly review of the development plans has now been completed.  It is expected that the reviews for all the remaining areas will be completed in the near future: they are 75 per cent completed at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of physical planning is to secure and maintain for our communities a satisfactory physical environment for living and working. The review of the development plans <Col N="1684" /> enables the general public and local organisations to play an active part in the planning process.  I would encourage people and communities to participate actively in the review of these plans.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the regional development organisations. The Department of the Environment will contribute £38,000 towards the running costs of the regional development organisations in 1978. These organisations were set up in 1969, their main function being to co-ordinate programmes for regional development. Their value rests on their ability to tackle problems at regional level, to reconcile priorities and harmonise development programmes so that local planning may be co-ordinated, and generally to facilitate local participation in regional development and present a regional view.  They are non-statutory bodies with modest resources who have been working in a quiet but useful way for the good of their regions.  A study at present being carried out in the midlands region is designed to produce a strategy for development in the 1980s for that region. That is being carried out by the regional development organisation.  I am glad to say that the EEC have recognised the value of such studies and are contributing half the cost of the midland's one.</P>
    <P>One of the main provisions of the Local Government Planning and Development Act 1976 was the setting up of An Bord Pleanála which was established on 1 January 1977.  The operations of the board have been facilitated by the arrangement whereby staffing services have been made available from the resources of my Department.  Provision is made in the Department's Estimates for the payment of a grant of £137,000 to the board.  The purpose of this grant is to meet the direct administrative and general expenses of the board, including remuneration of the board members.  I should like to thank the members of the board.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle would allow me 30 seconds to conclude.  The Minister's opening contribution to the debate, coupled with what I have said, should make it clear to all that a lot is being done in the local government <Col N="1685" /> and environmental fields.  Undoubtedly a lot remains to be done if the finances could be made available but our resources are not limitless.  All demands cannot be met at once.  In facing up to this situation the concern of the Government has been to keep up housing output, to develop infrastructure programmes of a sufficient level to serve the housing and industrial development programmes, ensuring that employment, on all programmes, is protected and expanded where circumstances allow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had of wishing the Minister well in his new office. However, I do not wish him to hold it too long, just long enough to enjoy it for a while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to speak about the new title of the Department&mdash;the Department of the Environment.  I feel that title should have been extended to include physical planning because the whole ambit of the area in which the Department is involved entails a large degree of physical planning.  If the name of a Department is to be changed it should be more meaningful. The title &ldquo;Department of the Environment&rdquo; would strike one as a portion only of the vast area in which the Department is involved.  Physical planing might have been incorporated because it is important that that aspect be highlighted at all times.  There is need for greater co-ordination amongst local authorities to ensure that the proper type of plans evolve on a national basis.  One often finds piecemeal development between one local authority and another but an overall physical plan would achieve the desired result.  While An Foras Forbartha play an active role on an advisory basis they might possibly play an active part as an arm of the Department in the physical planning aspect of its activities.  We know the great need there is for road improvement throughout the country.  We hear a fair amount of emotive talk about motorways, that they will blast their way through cities and annihilate all in front of them.  I do not think that anyone supposes that will happen.  Certainly nobody wants it to happen and <Col N="1686" /> it was never the intention that it should happen.</P>
    <P>It is important that we get our priorities in order.  We must have a co-ordinated plan on communications if we are to survive in any kind of a business world.  There must be a proper means of communication and contact particularly for delivery of our merchandise and manufactured goods. If one is travelling to the west, from the city out as far as Enfield is a glorified car-track.  If an industrialist comes over here to investigate the prospects of developing the west, that portion of his route may well change his attitude.  I have no doubt but that it will change his attitude if he notices that there can be long delays between his factory and the docks or wherever else he may want to travel.  The same can be said of the route from Dublin Airport into the city.  We have a major international airport but communications between there and the city, to say the least, are terrible.  It is important that within the Department there be a division of physical planning to take care of the infrastructure to ensure that it liaises with the various local authorities in order that the bits and pieces be tied together.  The plan must be a properly co-ordinated plan.  There must be no cutting across by one local authority of another local authority. Where regional developments such as water, sewerage, and other services are concerned, the local authorities involved in the region should co-ordinate to give a better service, cut costs and thereby ensure we get the best possible value in the most ordered way.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Department of the Environment is not absolutely correct. Possibly the title appeals to many people because there is a great deal of talk about the environment, but it is really only one aspect of the activities of the Department.  The activities of the Department should be spelled out really in a more positive way.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of argument with regard to housing and the progress made.  There have been claims and counterclaims as to how many were built and how many will be built. There must be no cutback in local authority housing.  The Minister's <Col N="1687" /> statement that two-thirds of all families now on the waiting list are families of three persons would seem to imply that we have more or less got down to the nitty gritty of the housing problem.  That is not the case. It is far from being the case.  In Dublin we still have a very serious housing problem.  Any local authority representative in Dublin will make that quite plain.  Up to 80 per cent of the representations made to us are made in regard to housing.  That is why I am concerned there should be no cutback in local authority housing particularly now when we have started to refurbish the centre city area.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal was new four years ago.  Now that it has got off the ground after many fits and starts it should not be allowed to die.  There will have to be an on-going programme of development.  I asked the Minister on another occasion if he would allocate a special amount independent of the general allocation for centre city housing to ensure there will be no cutback.  There is a figure in the White Paper of £26,000 per unit.  That figure is not correct.  It could not be correct by any stretch of the imagination and it is an argument used against centre city housing.  We must consider very forcefully the reasons why we need centre city housing.  There is a very strong social need to maintain the fragmented communities in the city. They must now be propped up and we must also try to bring back people who formerly lived in these areas. Building a community takes two to three generations and it is a costly process. This is an element that is not costed when we talk about house prices.  We must develop the existing communities.  First-class dwellings are being erected in the centre city in keeping with the general character of the area.  That cannot be quantified from an economic point of view and we should not try to quantify it because, if the population disappears, a concrete jungle arises and the vandals and the criminals lurk in the empty streets looking for easy prey.  If people are actually living in these areas their very presence acts as a deterrent to these people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> We have the infrastructure within the city.  We have unfortunately empty schools and empty churches.  We have amenities that are under-used while people in the suburbs are clamouring for the very same amenities.  Houses in which people can live are all that is required.  In the budget debate I suggested that the Minister for Finance should make some tax concessions designed to attract developers into rebuilding the centre city.  The Minister should examine into what grants he could make available to private builders.  There are sites which remain undeveloped and if it were made profitable for builders to develop them, I believe builders would develop them. We do not want lopsided development. We want a balanced society.  Very nice units are going up on the perimeter in the Leeson Street and Donnybrook areas.  These are units of 27 or 30 houses.  That is the type of development we need in the centre city and we will get it provided we give the incentive.  A developer is in there to make a profit and we must recognise that fact but we should encourage him to carry out development work in a socially desirable way.  The Minister for the Environment should consider the matter and ask the Minister for Finance to make some concessions in this area.  It is desirable and feasible. It is not pie-in-the-sky or a pious hope and it would provide much needed employment in the building industry.  Given that we continue with local authority housing in the city centre and that we encourage private developers to join in this work, we can look forward to a thriving and living city.</P>
    <P>Earlier in my speech I referred to roads and infrastructure in the outer parts of the city and to the general overall plan in the Department.  There is much emotive talk about motorways and their adverse effects on communities. None of us wants that. What we want is some ordered development on our roads.  It is obvious that the roads on the north and south side of the city are not suitable for present-day requirements. The Department will have to make known their intentions.  At the moment the situation is that the corporation <Col N="1689" /> are putting forward plans and the Minister is waiting to see what money he will give.  There is much to-ing and fro-ing but we are not getting anywhere. The Minister should state that in the next five years he will allocate funds of a certain amount for road development in Dublin city and the suburbs and the corporation could then plan on the basis of getting a certain amount of money each year. At the moment if a person wants to develop a property he may be told he has to move back 15 feet because there are proposals for roadworks that may not take place for 25 years.  That is completely undesirable but it is a situation that is occurring frequently.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment will have to take firm measures and instruct local authorities to submit their plans for a specified period.  In that way we would have some reasonable development, but at the moment we are getting nothing.  We should be able to plan for five years ahead so that local authorities may get on with the job in a realistic way.  It should be possible for them to make proposals that will be generally acceptable. As far as I can see, it is impossible to get overall acceptance for road proposals, but the proposals I have in mind should not create any problems. If we do not plan ahead for a reasonable period we are only wasting our time.</P>
    <P>The question of restructuring local government has been under consideration for quite some time.  It is important that we move reasonably quickly on this because with the removal of rates local authorities will be restricted to some extent in the way they spend money.  We should make local government as local as possible and bring it closer to the people to make it meaningful. In the Dublin area in particular local government is not local government whatever else it may be. It is a vast jungle, even a joke.  Most, if not all, local authority areas in Dublin are bigger than Dáil constituencies and there is a larger electorate in those areas than in Dáil constituencies. That is an anomaly.  It is a crazy situation.  It is not local government in the proper sense.  As far as I am concerned local government is <Col N="1690" /> involving people in local affairs and letting them have access to their public representatives.</P>

      <P>Leitrim has 22 councillors and it is not a constituency. In my constituency we have five councillors and yet the local authority area is bigger.  This gives an indication of the imbalance I mentioned.</P>

      <P>No. I want additional councillors, I want meaningful local government.  If we are serious about the matter we should restructure local government and the only way it can be done is by breaking up the authority.  We will have to talk about a new development authority for the new towns we are building, areas such as Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin. There is a vast area there that is completely unrepresented and that is out in the wilderness.  Some development authority should develop it, work it and co-ordinate it.  Eventually possibly we could have three townships with three corporations operating in that type of area.  That is the kind of ordered development we must have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Dublin scene we will have to break it up.  Possibly we could have a Greater Dublin Council like the Greater London Council, but we would also have the local authority, the local planning office, the local cleansing department, where people could communicate at a much more personal level than they can when we are operating at such a vast level as at present. <Col N="1691" /> This is very important.  I hope the Minister will bring a Bill before this House to deal with this problem.  If we are serious about this, let us be serious about it, and let us make it work.  At present it is not working.</P>
    <P>On the question of planning, there is the problem of industry.  We have to consider whether it is suitable and what its environmental effects will be. Have the Department any policy on the question of dirty industries?  Obviously dirty industries are a part of industry.  Modern technology still has not eliminated pollution and ancillary effects on the environment.  The Department should have a policy, if they have not.  There is no point in waiting until we have attracted an industry and then start thinking about it, and kicking it around the place, and hopping the ball from one area to another. The Department should decide on an area in which this type of industry can be located.  I am not saying where it should be.  Given that we have certain prevailing winds, and land which may not be suitable for farming or vegetation, there might be places where we could locate dirty industries.  Our lack of policy in this area means that the IDA are attracting industry which looks for permission to locate in a certain place and then there are objections.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Department to take an active interest in the proposed nuclear power station.  Power is in the brief of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, but people are concerned about the effect this nuclear station will have on the environment and on their general health and well-being. The Department of the Environment should make a study of this matter and make statements about it. They are there to protect the environment. Given that they are charged with protecting the environment, they have an obligation to say they want an inquiry into the building of a nuclear power station.  I am not against it, and I am not for it.  It is something new.  It has environmental hazards and the Department should hold an in-depth examination into them.</P>
    <P>Whether there is a conflict with <Col N="1692" /> another Department should not concern them.  They are charged with the job of looking after the environment. I hope the Minister will take an active interest in this and be seen to take an active interest in it and assure people who are concerned that any proposals will be examined minutely and that they will make recommendations and make investigations with regard to fall-out, disposal of waste, and so on. This matter is causing concern to a large number of people.  That concern should be alleviated in the early stages before the project gathers momentum. If there are well-founded fears the Department should spell them out, and if they are not well-founded the Department should spell that out too.</P>
    <P>Water and sewerage are dealt with in this Estimate.  It has come to my notice that there is a serious water problem in Dublin.  That surprises me, but it is a fact of life.  If we are having a water problem in March, what will happen in June, July and August if the weather is very fine?  We could run into a lot of trouble.  In my constituency for two or three weeks blocks of flats were without water and without sanitation because water pressures were lowered to cut back on water usage.  That is not good enough. While the Department may say this is a matter for the local authority, they have a responsibility in matters such as a serious water deficiency in our capital city.</P>
    <P>The Department should have this whole matter examined to see what can be done to alleviate the problem, if it is serious, as a matter of urgency. If contingency plans are required they should be available.  There was a water shortage in other flats as well as the ones I mentioned.  This is potentially a major health hazard.  It should be looked into.</P>
    <P>The question of air pollution was mentioned by the Minister who told us that local authorities, particularly Dublin local authorities, monitor pollution and had come to the conclusion that the level is reasonable.  While I do not doubt that statement I am never too happy about the situation in the city, particularly when one considers <Col N="1693" /> the number of buses and large trucks operating in our streets.  The amount of pollution they emit must be well outside any norm.  It is necessary that checks are kept on this sort of pollution in a city so congested with traffic.  We should take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the owners of offending buses, cars or lorries are penalised and made rectify any deficiencies. Offenders should be fined substantially. The Department should ensure that local authorities charged with a responsibility in relation to pollution keep a proper check on all vehicles.  It is important that the levels of pollution are kept down.  Those who live close to the city as I do are aware of the amount of pollution that occurs every night.  Each morning my car is covered in a black dust.  That is an indication of how serious the problem is.  The Department should insist on periodic checks being carried out, even by An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear that the Minister has plans prepared for the integrating of itinerants into society.  We all have our role to play in this regard. The local authority of which I am a member has done great work in this area.  Special staff have been assigned to deal with this problem, but more money should be given to that authority to help deal with the problem. We must continue this process at all levels in relation to education and housing.  I accept that it is not easy to eliminate such a problem because of the attitudes of the people involved, but we should make every effort.  It is comforting to see that we have this social conscience.  It is sad to see those people camped along the side of our roads during winter months.</P>
    <P>When allocating money for housing the Minister should bear in mind the need to provide housing for our elderly people.  A lot has been done in this regard in Dublin over the years but there are still many elderly people living in substandard and expensive accommodation.  We should strive to eliminate that evil and provide more housing units for our elderly people.</P>
    <P>I would be obliged if the Minister would look into the question of providing money for the improvement of <Col N="1694" /> hostels in the city.  It may be suggested that this is a matter for the Department of Health, but I believe that it should be possible for the Minister's Department to allocate money for the improvement of houses like the Iveagh Hostel and the hostels at York Street, Bath Lane and Tara Street.  Those hostels provide accommodation for many people.  This is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment because if those hostel close up the people who frequent them would have to be housed else where in the city.  Many men consider these hostels to be their home.  The Department should provide the money for the redecoration of them.  Some of those hostels are a little run down because the people involved in running them do not have the money to maintain them in the way they wish.  They are run by voluntary organisations who should be supported.  I believe in supporting such organisations because they give best value for money.  That can be interpreted as being a selfish attitude but those organisations have a great approach to such problems.</P>
    <P>Basically this is a housing problem. It was stated 12 months ago that the Iveagh Hostel was in danger of closing down and had that happened the people who use that hostel would have had a serious problem to face.  The State and the local authority would also have to face a serious problem.  We should not wait until the inevitable happens and then see what we can do. The housing is there and we should get behind the organisations involved and help them improve the accomodation. I do not see why a grant can not be paid directly by the Department to organisations like the Iveagh Trust to improve such hostels.  Such organisations are endeavouring to improve existing housing stock.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing grants I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to problems being faced by many private housing trusts.  The Iveagh Trust, who operate in my area are running into a financial problem because their fixed rents cannot be increased.  They must keep down the amount of repairs to the house because of this lack of money <Col N="1695" /> with the result that the housing stock is deteriorating.  If those houses are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that they will have to be replaced, the cost to the local authority and the State will be astronomical.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that consideration should be given to a direct grant from the Department of the Environment for renovation and upkeep of good housing stock.  For too long we neglected existing housing stock and said: &ldquo;We built 26,000 houses this year.&rdquo;  But how many deteriorated? What was the net gain?  As well as building 26,000, we must effectively consider what we have and what we can do with it.  A large number of houses, particularly those taken over as bedsitters and so on are allowed to deteriorate rapidly although fairly good incomes come from them.  They become glorified tenements.  Possibly under present law the Minister cannot do anything but if he is framing any legislation in the future he could look at the question of housing stock so that something might be done to avoid rapid deterioration of it because of the cost to society in replacing houses.  It is far better to have preventive medicine than the pill situation.  As well as building, if we can preserve the houses that we have, we shall have a real improvement in overall housing stock.  I should like the Department to consider (1) hostels and (2) housing trusts.  I am speaking particularly of the Iveagh Trust which embraces a very large number of flats.</P>
    <P>I should like to have the matter of financing the purchase of land and land banks examined.  We have had good stocks of land over the years and it is important to maintain them.  They were a factor in keeping down the price of houses.  With a good stock of land you could&mdash;and we did&mdash;sell to small builders.  This keeps costs down. It is important that money should be made available for the purchase and maintenance of land banks to ensure that we have adequate land for our housing programme.  If we must go in at the last minute to buy land we shall be nailed on the going rate.</P>
    <P>The Kenny Report may be implemented <Col N="1696" /> and that by its very terms will control the price of agricultural land. It has possibly lain dormant for some time but we should reactivate it to see if it has power to control the price of agricultural land <i>vis-à-vis</i>, development of building land.  That would also tend to keep down house prices.  We saw in this morning's papers the dramatic rise in house prices, roughly 15 per cent.  I do not blame the present Government for that; it is possibly due to costs of materials but the fact is there and if land also goes up it is another cost factor that will make houses very dear. It is important to ensure that local authorities have sufficient funds to keep up land banks.  The Department should examine the Kenny Report and see if it can be implemented.  In that context the constitutionality question should be examined and if possible the report should be implemented.</P>
    <P>The introduction of low-rise mortgages 18 months or two years ago was an excellent idea.  It gave those on housing lists the opportunity to buy on a subsidised mortgage.  It gave people in local authority houses or flats an opportunity to buy also.  In both cases we were removing somebody from the waiting list and we were gaining a flat or house which enabled us to remove another person from the housing list.  As in the case of most ideas like that we seem to have set a figure of £7,500 and forgotten to update it.  It is pointless to offer somebody a loan of £7,500 if the house costs £11,000 or £12,000.  What appeared to be a good idea at the outset becomes with the passage of time useless as costs increase.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of raising the low-rise mortgage figure to at least £9,000.  If it is less it will not achieve its purpose.  Now, when people go to buy, they find they cannot raise the difference between the £7,500 and the cost of the house.  I believe there is merit in the scheme and that it should be re-examined.  It worked very well in the beginning but there is not the same demand now because the difference between the cost of the house and the mortgage is too great. This is a pity.</P>
    <P>As regards the £1,000 grant.  I am <Col N="1697" /> unhappy about the fact that people must be living in the house before they get the grant.  I think £500 should be paid at some point in the construction and the balance when the house is finished, not necessarily lived in, because people often want to buy furniture before moving in and have not the resources.  Once the contract is signed and the house paid for, in a sense, the money should be handed over.  That could be considered and also the possibility of splitting the payment into two £500 instalments.  If £500 were paid at some stage it could help as an intermediate deposit.  Often a buyer must pay so much down and so much more at a certain stage.  The idea of the £1,000 was to help people to buy.  That was a good idea but let it be effective.  This could be done by providing £500 when a second deposit is required, and when the house is finished and has been signed over to the customer, he should get the £500 to enable him get the bits and pieces he requires to move in.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to have a look at housing densities, which are always a bone of contention.  There are differing points of view and some people are very hot on it.  Land is becoming expensive and it is a very valuable commodity.  It is our best natural resource and our main source of wealth and we cannot be eating it up by extravagance in our densities. I ask the Department to look at the whole question to see that we are not ill-using the land, as I believe we are. As the Department of the Environment they are concerned with the overall environmental effect on our society of whether we are putting in too many houses or not.  Let us see that we get the best value and the best type of environment.  I have said what I wanted to say and I thank the House for being tolerant with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a diversity of responsibility.  The change of name to &ldquo;Department of the Environment&rdquo; is significant and very welcome.  Environment embraces so many aspects of our life.  It includes the homes we live in, the roads that run in front of our houses, the footpaths, our park areas, our playing <Col N="1698" /> areas, the air we breathe and the water we drink.  It includes everything, so that is a very good title for this Department.</P>
      <P>The quality of life is a most important factor today and it is rather unfortunate that technology has so advanced in recent decades that much of the environment is in danger.  Not only our surroundings but the health of many of our people could be in danger as well.  The most important aspect of the environment is the type of houses we live in and their surroundings.  It is very important for families, and especially for the children, that they have adequate space to grow and to develop in a proper way.  We have talked a lot here today about the number of houses that will be built in the coming years.  I am more concerned about the number of people who will be able to purchase their houses or to obtain houses from local authorities.  If we build 20,000 houses at £30,000 per house, those houses will be sitting there without anybody going into them because people will not be able to afford them. I estimate for the average married couple earning, say, £5,000 a year&mdash; this is where there is only one income in the family&mdash;if they purchase a house at, say, £18,000&mdash;and you will not get a lot for less&mdash;they will probably have to borrow something in the region of £16,000.  If they borrow £10,000 their average repayment will be £23 per week.  If they borrow £20,000 their repayments will be £45 per week.  This is for people who have a fairly good income and are well able to buy their own houses. Even so no young married couple can afford to save enough money to be able to borrow the amount that they can afford to repay.  They are chasing the devil by the tail constantly.  The grant of £1,000 for a new house is a big help and very welcome, but even with that they need several thousand pounds before they can manage to buy their own home.  As I said in the budget debate, it is sometimes necessary for both husband and wife to work, and where young couples are trying to buy their own home it is not possible to do this unless both go out to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> I want to refer to local authority houses and the low-rise mortgage scheme which the previous speaker mentioned.  Anybody can be entitled to apply to Dublin Corporation for a house and the only criterion is to be in need of a house.  People who apply for a loan under the low-rise mortgage scheme are subject to a means test.  This seems rather strange when, on the one hand, you can apply for a house from Dublin Corporation, you can be eligible, you can be on the housing list and you do not have to go through a means test; you can earn any amount and still be entitled to be regarded as in need of a house.  But, on the other hand, when you apply for a loan under the low-rise mortgage scheme where the amount is only £7,500&mdash;and God knows where you will get a house in this day and age for that&mdash;you are not eligible if you have over a certain income per annum.  I ask the Minister to look into these two aspects.  He might decide that Dublin Corporation should apply a means test when they are putting people on their housing list, or else people who are on the housing list and are seeking a loan under the low-rise mortgage scheme should not have to go through a means test.</P>
    <P>Housing is one of the main issues that will be discussed under this Estimate but the pollution of our air and water, water schemes and so forth are of equal importance.  I was disturbed recently to learn that there are housing schemes in this city with no water supply at all for 12 hours a day and perhaps longer.  They have no drinking water at all for long periods in the day.  They have no water for sanitary purposes and in no way can they get their supply increased.  In one area the residents asked that a certain type of pump be installed whereby a water supply might be pumped to their homes which were on a fairly high ground level.  This apparently could not be done.  The law does not permit Dublin Corporation to instal such a system and thereby to help these people who are without water.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the very heavy traffic in old Dublin residential areas extending out to the suburbs.  The <Col N="1700" /> residents there are now on the main roads.  The houses are old.  The traffic has increased tenfold in the last few years and heavy lorries travel along those roads. The residents are very concerned because their houses shake at certain times.  They are terrified in case the structure of their houses is destroyed and that in a few years' time they will topple down around them.  I hope the Minister will ensure in his new roads scheme that adequate ring roads are built around the outskirts of the city to take away a lot of the heavy traffic causing such hardship to people living in those residential areas.</P>
    <P>I was very happy to see a new design in housing schemes with no main roads through the estates.  Only the residents are allowed to travel on the roads within those estates.  A main road goes to the entrance to the estates, from which there are cul-de-sac side roads which are used only by the residents on the different roads. This is a very good idea.  It is much better than what is happening in many of the estates, where the people eventually find themselves living on main roads and are continually shaken by the heavy traffic travelling on those roads, even through the night. There is another factor in relation to this which very few people think about, and that is noise.  Sometimes one is really not conscious of noise until it stops.  It can cause great stress to many people.  The noise of the traffic in the areas I have referred to also creates great hardship for those people.</P>
    <P>The other matter I am very concerned about, something which has not been mentioned by many people, is oil pollution.  Our beaches and strands are our greatest asset.  We have the most beautiful stretches of beaches and strands anywhere in the world.  I hope it never happens that there is a catastrophe off our shores.  It is imperative that, if such a thing should happen, we should be immediately able to combat it.  The Minister has set aside £75,000 in case such a thing should happen.  We also have a report on pollution control from the inter-departmental environment committee. <Col N="1701" /> This should be studied very carefully and we should always be ready in case our beaches are polluted with oil.  It is a very sad thing to see in a film or on television oil pouring in on the beaches killing all the birds and wildlife around and destroying everything for years to come.</P>
    <P>The condition of our rivers and lakes is particularly important.  If we are foolish enough to allow them to become polluted it will take decades to get rid of that pollution.  We are very fortunate that we still have clear water in our rivers and lakes.  We should learn from the mistakes made in the EEC countries.  Their rivers have become so polluted that nothing can live in them and nothing can move on them.  They are full of all types of pollution.  It is sad to see beautiful rivers, such as the Rhine and other rivers in France and Germany so polluted.  We should gain knowledge from those countries to control pollution in our rivers and lakes and not allow it to happen here.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to another type of pollution&mdash;litter.  I do not very often go to the cinema but I visited a cinema in the city with my two daughters about two months ago.  It was an evening show which started at 7 o'clock and I was absolutely appalled at the litter on the floor of that cinema.  If the Minister for Health had seen that litter he would have been upset because he had just started his campaign for hygiene and good health. The litter was so bad that I was almost up to my ankles in crisp bags, peanut bags and sweet papers of all kinds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please do not name the cinema, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  I considered writing to the cinema owner but I did not do so.  There were a lot of children in that cinema, because it was a film which attracted children. There was also many adults present. Children must be educated against throwing litter around.  We had a very clever campaign some time ago by Dublin Corporation with big advertisements in the newspapers of litter bins opening their mouths and saying <Col N="1702" />&ldquo;Thank You&rdquo;.  I believe it encouraged children to use the litter bins and put their litter into them.  There was an improvement in the litter problem on the streets.  When I saw this particular cinema I began to despair again and felt we had not got through to the children and that they would never roll up their sweet papers, put them in their pockets, take them home and put them in their dustbins.  It does not occur to many children to do that. I hope there will be another campaign to encourage people to retain their litter until they can dispose of it properly. There should be substantial fines for litter bugs.  The law provides that anyone caught throwing litter around can be fined but I have never heard of anybody being fined or being taken to court.  Perhaps if the law were implemented more often there would be more cleanliness.</P>
      <P>I will refer to the problem of waste. There are only three people living in my house but we buy daily and evening papers and books and we have a vast amount of waste paper.  The same applies to almost every household. Perhaps this waste paper could be recycled and used again.  I read somewhere that a ton of waste paper will save 15 trees.  I do not know how true that is, but if we chop down 15 trees to make a ton of paper we soon will not have any trees left because they do not grow that fast. Apart from waste paper there are waste tins and plastics which might possibly be recycled and used again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has made a provision of £110,000 to provide shelter for stray animals.  The problem of stray animals was discussed on numerous occasions by Dublin Corporation and I am sure the corporation and the county councils are pleased that this allocation was made. The problem in the city has grown out of all proportion.  Irish people are not very good to animals, they do not seem to know how to treat them.  They take in a dog or a cat or some other animal and after a week or two they decide they do not want it and just throw it out.  Apart from the fact that the stray animals are starving they are causing problems to the people in the <Col N="1703" /> city.  I hope provision will be made to have the animals collected.</P>
    <P>I attended a traffic committee meeting on Monday morning where we discussed the problem of drinking and driving.  I was informed that practically all road accidents occur between 10.30 in the evening and 3 o'clock in the morning, which gives an indication that drink causes most of the accidents. I hope that the breathalyser test will be reintroduced.  It was unfortunate that the test had to be dropped because of constitutional difficulties and so on.  Either that test or some other system should be introduced as quickly as possible.  In 1976 there were less road accidents than there were in 1977.  Pedestrians under the influence of drink are as much to blame for road accidents as motorists although that is not generally known.</P>
    <P>I was happy to note that the European Community set up a major environmental research programme costing in the region of £4 million to provide a scientific basis for community legislation in relation to the environment and all the aspects of it that we discussed here today.  I hope when a report on this programme is published we will study it and act upon it so that we will not make mistakes other countries made, so that we will have a good environment where our lakes and rivers are clean and pure and where the air is fresh.  This is one country where there is fresh air, fresh green fields and fresh water and I hope it will continue to be like that for a long time to come.  I hope we will never allow ourselves to fall into the trap of not being vigilant in watching for the problems which may occur.  It is much easier to prevent than to cure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote for the Department of the Environment provides a massive sum of approximately £206 million.  At first sight this might appear to be adequate, but on examination one finds, particularly if one is a member of a local authority, that much more could be spent.  However, I suppose we cannot expect the Minister to achieve everything in his first year in office.  I might say how pleased I was that he was appointed to this Ministry. <Col N="1704" /> I hope he will distinguish himself in this area in the years ahead and that there will be many successes as a result of his activities.</P>
      <P>I should like a clear indication from the Minister about whether it is intended to continue town commissioners and urban district councils or whether there will be a return to the thinking that anticipated that, because of low population, they would no longer be required.  The previous Government clearly indicated their views on this subject.  I hope the Minister will confirm that thinking by clearly indicating that he would afford people an opportunity of electing members to local authorities who would represent our citizens' views.  It is important in a small country that the voice of the people be adequately represented in smaller areas of population.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the establishment of the regional development organisations. We have now approximately nine of that type of organisation catering for a grouping of counties. They have permanent, whole-time staff appointed to them.  They and several other organisations co-ordinate views on matters such as tourism and so on.  But if finance is not specifically allocated to these regional development organisations I doubt if they can adequately perform their functions without being given a permanent place by the Department of the Environment. Even officials who work in those regional development organisations are entitled to know what role they will play in the future and if their services will be required, because they are of the highest calibre.  I was a member of such an organisation for many years.  Early on I formed the view that while we could make suggestions on, for instance land usage and transportation studies&mdash;and we did submit reports on these matters&mdash;we felt we had not adequate teeth with which to bite into the areas where our work would show real benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appears to have satisfied many people in his Estimate.  Certainly anything of benefit will be welcomed by the population generally. Most people nowadays recognise that anything one receives must be paid <Col N="1705" /> for at a later stage: we must be prepared to pay the cost of any benefits received.</P>
    <P>Certainly at present a massive sum of money could be spent on road structures. This may not be obvious to people who are not in local authorities. When road improvements are effected, one must think of the necessary expenditure on land purchase, the design of a particular scheme, the purchase of additional machinery and the unexpected problems encountered because of difficult terrains and so on.  We have been given £13 million by the European Investment Bank to establish better communications with industrial centres and with centres of tourism. It is important that expenditure in this area be confined to projects most needed.  We should place very high on our priority list areas that have had a lean time over the past eight or nine years in terms of tourism.</P>
    <P>I refer particularly to areas in the west and possibly also some in the north.  I am well aware of certain roads in County Clare leading to tourist resorts where, because of inadequate expenditure over a long number of years, they have deteriorated to such an extent as to be dangerous.  I would ask the Minister to have a survey undertaken of such areas, accompanied if possible by a definite allocation of funds where such danger is most evident. I might refer particularly to a road in Clare going west of Ennis to Kilrush where such danger is very evident, where even an expenditure of £1 million in the current year would make very little difference in rendering that road safe.  I believe the Minister is aware of this road, as he is of many other unsafe roads in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a rapid improvement being made in this matter for several reasons.  I can foresee very little industrial development taking place on the west coast, and in County Clare in particular, unless the expenditure I speak of is provided quickly.  At present very little encouragement is given to prospective industrialists to come into an area if there is not a sound and reliable road leading there. It is vital that it be recognised that, if <Col N="1706" /> we are to have diversification of industry, if we are to counteract the trend in western areas of high emigration and control it by placing small suitable industries there, our road structures must be improved rapidly.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that the ESB will provide in Kilrush a coal-fired generating station, which can subsequently be converted into an oil-fired station.  It will be one of the biggest in the country.  Back in 1973 the ESB made borings to determine the suitability of the terrain.  I can visualise a follow-up of industry there and so again it will be necessary to make money available for road improvements in and out of the area.  This is right on the banks of the Shannon where you have the greatest depth of water in Europe and the facilities that can be provided are unequalled in this island.  It is vitally essential that we should now direct our thoughts and energies towards expansion in this area.</P>
    <P>Under this Estimate opportunities will be provided designed to create employment as far as possible for a greater number of people.  Many years ago there was a tradition at Christmas time for local authorities to give a fortnight's work to unemployed men. That has been abandoned.  No alternative has been provided, though there is I suppose more unemployment assistance and so on.  It is a good thing to see the Minister recognising the necessity of giving youth some employment.  It is good to know that schemes will be drawn up in each local authority area and that three out of four employed on such schemes will be youth.  I do not know what the age limit is to qualify one to be described as a youth.  While this scheme is desirable there is no indication that those assigned to such work will be anxious to do the work or whether they will be suitable.  I would like to see married men, preferably married men with families, getting preference in employment, men who are anxious to work but who have not been getting the opportunity in the areas in which they reside.  However, I am glad these schemes are being initiated.  We will give them all the <Col N="1707" /> assistance we can in the local authorities of which we are members.</P>
    <P>There is scope for employment in the construction industry.  Since the foundation of the State local authorities have been providing housing. Because of the high price of land and escalating costs all round a great deal of the money allocated does not show the same return as it did once.  There has been an improvement in design but there is still room for more improvement. There should be competitions among architects to discover designs suitable to particular environments. There has been a noticeable improvement in design in private house building but it is not too evident in local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The NBA have contributed in a big way to our pool of housing.  I have seen new ground broken by a very young priest in my area who has built literally hundreds of houses.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will not allow me to name him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to voice my appreciation of the wonderful work done by Father Harry Bohan, a psychologist with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, who initiated a housing scheme in which private investors invested their money and local authority grants strengthened the fund.  Direct labour was used. Housing costs were considerably reduced and purchasers got their houses at much reduced prices.  This was new ground broken by this young priest. He also trained the Clare hurling team, a man of many initiatives.  The work provided in building these houses was most welcome and the scheme gave a real impetus to the pool of housing in the county.  People anxious to build their own houses might shy away from the excessive cost of land and the high cost involved in repaying loans either to building societies or to the local authority, but I believe people should face the future with courage and, if they have a housing problem, they should tackle the problem with courage and do the best they can to provide their own homes.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that the Minister's advisers advised the abandonment of the essential repairs scheme which was administered by local authorities. They provided the greater part of the cash and it was augmented by a very tiny sum from the then Department of Local Government, a sum of £80, really insignificant but a help to a certain extent.  I cannot understand the thinking of the people who advised the Minister that the scheme should be abandoned and replaced by a reconstruction scheme.  One would need to have been a member of a local authority to appreciate how the scheme benefited those of limited means. People who were disadvantaged in health, either mentally or physically, or old people could not carry out reconstruction work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the scheme will be reviewed but I suggest to the Minister that provision be made for those who are destitute. The local authorities provided for the total expenditure that was necessary to restore houses and I would like the Minister to consider this aspect.  An increase in the grant is not adequate. Any deserving applicant should be given all possible assistance.  I am pleased to hear that a better scheme is being implemented and I should like that the same provision be made by the Department of the Environment as was made by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Apart from roads most of the money spent by local authorities is allocated to the provision of water supply and sewerage schemes and in this connection I would mention group water schemes.  It is wonderful that there is such a spirit of co-operation in rural areas, where people come together and take the responsibility of providing a service for themselves and their neighbours, a service that has been enjoyed for decades by those living in cities and towns.  I am pleased that the Minister has seen fit to allocate additional moneys in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have been asked to help in the matter of road safety. They were always responsible in their approach to this matter.  They have provided adequate road markings and these have been of considerable help.  Any expenditure in this area is worth while.  I do not consider that the provision of highways has lessened the accident rate or improved the quality of driving here.  In fact, the reverse is the case.  The easing of bends on many roads has not resulted in a reduction of the accident rate but I think there will be a marked <Col N="1710" /> improvement in the future as a result of the standard of our driving test.  I have no doubt that with a very fine corps of testers in the Department a good standard will be demanded and our roads will not be as dangerous as they were in the past.</P>
    <P>The grant of £1,000 in respect of a new house was very attractive and there is no doubt that it will help many people.  However, the stipulation that a house must be completed and occupied before the money is paid might be reconsidered.  Formerly people got half the housing grant when half the house was completed and this was of great benefit.  If this facility does not continue it may discourage people from building their own houses and I would ask the Minister to consider paying half the grant when the house is at the half-way stage of completion.  This would be a great encouragement to people.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see that the Minister is making provision for suitable additions to the homes of mentally or physically handicapped people.  This is one area where we cannot be too generous. At the present time it is recognised that those in the greatest need are people who have some disability. I hope this scheme will be availed of generally.</P>
    <P>As his name suggests, the Minister has a serious responsibility for the environment and the eradication of pollution whether it is on the land, on the sea, or in the air.  In relation to air pollution, when factories are coming here from outside, and where there is a possibility of air pollution, every effort should be made to monitor the parent factory.  Local authorities may not anticipate that type of pollution, but it can occur and when it does occur local residents feel very uneasy and are doubtful about prospective industrialists who might site industries in areas where this pollution might take place.  Some years ago the same amount of thought was not given to pollution and the necessity to avoid it. There is an awareness now of the problem.</P>
    <P>In group water schemes there can be contamination in hilly areas.  Whole areas can be contaminated if the <Col N="1711" /> source of the water supply is polluted. Everybody has a responsibility to his neighbour in this regard.  It is vital that a constant watch is kept on possible areas of pollution.  Members of local authorities often feel there are long delays in giving approval to the schemes which they have approved and submitted to the Department of the Environment.  In each county many schemes have been submitted which have not yet been approved.  There are good reasons for this delay in many cases.  Even though the consultants may have gone through the necessary data, people in the Department decide further changes are necessary.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that we are spending £206 million, an adequate sum has not yet been provided to clear up the backlog which has been in the Department for quite a long time.  As regards our road structures and the provision of money to maintain them, our road system needs a greater injection of finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Such schemes need a really big injection of finance.  When we took over the rural improvement schemes from the Office of Public Works we did not get an adequate sum to administer them.  County councils in their wisdom said they would carry the load and administer the schemes.  We took over a backlog of work from the Office of Public Works and new schemes were also submitted by members of local authorities.  The increase this year will help to reduce the backlog and will go a long way but not the full way towards wiping out the list of schemes we have.  There is an ever-increasing demand to improve roads into laneways where there are two or three houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to continue on the basis of the discussion last night and say that, if we are to conquer this terrible cancer of unemployment, while job creation must contribute in a vital way to its defeat, I cannot lay enough emphasis on the necessity for job retention.  I am delighted that my thinking on job retention is relevant to the attitude and ideas of the Minister for Labour when he was in Opposition.  I should like to indicate why my ideas are so relevant to his thinking in Opposition. In a debate on economic and social policies on 3 November 1976, as reported at columns 1031 and 1032 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another item to which I want to refer in regard to job losses.  We have seen a huge number of receiverships, liquidations, companies getting into difficulties and jobs being lost as a result.  I believe the day is long past when, as a nation, we could afford to see such companies wind up.  I know the number given in reply to a parliamentary question not too long ago was frightening. There are other companies still in danger.  I believe that the simple process that has operated up to now <Col N="1713" /> of a receiver being appointed merely to sell off the assets at whatever price he can make to satisfy his clients is gone.  That is not sufficient any more with regard to such companies.  The emphasis must shift from the repayment of the debt to increasingly seeking the revival of that company, or part of it.  The social conscience&mdash;and we hear an awful lot about social conscience from those benches over there&mdash;with regard to workers and the economy at large demands this shift of emphasis.  Many jobs could have been saved in the past, many jobs in so many different industries.</P>
    <P>Those words were uttered by a very outspoken Deputy in 1976.  One can see his concern when in opposition but how can one now evaluate his attitude when in government since June 1977?  How can one relate his concern for job losses when in the space of about five months in his own constituency 400 jobs went to the wall?  How can I or anybody else accept that he or his associates in the Cabinet were concerned in the months gone by with regard to a large industry in my area, Ferenka, when it was suggested to them that the Government should subsidise this industry until such time as it was viable?</P>
    <P>This can also be said about a serious situation that exists at present in relation to another semi-State body.  I am referring to the association of Van-Hool with CIE.  If there is concern for job retention the money needed to ensure the viability of that industry and the protection of the jobs of 300 workers should be given by the Government. I will let the people draw their own conclusions.  Apparently, what one says in Opposition and what one does when in Government are contradictory.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Fianna Fáil manifesto and to an item which was high on the priority list of that party, their emphasis on the need to develop industries based on natural resources. That was worthy of support. However, when one considers that food processing must rate high on this list, <Col N="1714" /> how can one relate the emphasis in the manifesto to the Government's indifference to the closure of the Erin Foods potato processing plant in Tuam involving 200 jobs.  That town can ill-afford to lose that number of jobs.  It is unfortunate that this should occur in the first year since the establishment of Erin Foods that they showed a profit.  If the Government were sincere and concerned to ensure that jobs are retained they would see that there was a need to help Erin Foods.  Erin Foods should have been directed not to close this plant.  We now have a situation where the potato processing plant which was nurtured by employees and small farmers in the area over the last five years and had reached a stage where there was a guaranteed market for potatoes has gone to the wall.  That has happened due to the indifference of the Government.  Where is the concern for the retention of jobs there? How can one say that the manifesto promises are genuine and how can Fianna Fáil say that they are committed to creating jobs in such a vital sector of our agricultural industry when such a plant is being allowed to close down?</P>
    <P>On the basis of the Government's policies no impartial person can entertain any hope that the unemployment register will be reduced in 1978 or 1979 to the degree set out in the manifesto. The Minister for Labour announced some time ago that he had extended the Employment Incentive Scheme to the building and construction industry but can any Minister tell me if any job has been created as a result of the extension of this scheme? The Irish Congress of Trade Unions suggested the establishment of a national development corporation to assist in the creation of the new jobs that are necessary, but this suggestion has been turned down by the Government. We are all anxious to know why the Government adopted this attitude because there is merit in that proposal and many people believe there is a need for such a development.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what has been done in the public sector with the creation of new posts for teachers, gardaí and nurses, but I cannot see the logic in <Col N="1715" /> what the Government are doing in that direction when at the same time there has been a cut-back of approximately 25 per cent in the subvention to CIE this year.  That cut-back is bound to affect the employment situation in that semi-State body.  It is hard for anybody to appreciate or believe the genuineness of the concern of the Government for job creation when in their own area of responsibility, in the semi-State bodies, there is such indifference to job retention.  I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening and for a brief period this evening we heard a not very original or inspiring list of complaints about the alleged failures of the Government and unilateral statements about the level of unemployment but the actual facts about the positive trends in job creation have been ignored.  It is well recognised that there is a substantial level of new job creation in manufacturing industry, and it is gratifying to note that the recently established upward trend in job creation is being sustained and is on the increase.  The significant point here is that these gains are net gains and that as a result the manufacturing workforce is expanding fairly rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a nation we recorded the best industrial performance in the EEC in 1977 and we seem well set to repeat that performance this year.  In 1977 we were the only EEC country to increase our manufacturing employment; all others decreased.  Present indications show that there was a net increase of 9,000 after job losses had been allowed for in manufacturing industry here in 1977 and that the net increase in manufacturing industries alone in 1978 will exceed 10,000.  That does not take into account the increase in employment generally, because when the service industries, which can usually be taken as in the proportion 1:1 to manufacturing industries, are added to that and the number of job losses in agriculture subtracted, there is a substantially higher increase in jobs in the past year than 9,000 net.  It is worth observing in passing that the <Col N="1716" /> Government commitment in their manifesto of last May has not only been achieved but exceeded.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from these figures that manufacturing industry is making a tremendous contribution towards providing employment for our growing labour force.  This contribution is being sustained and increased in the face of intense competition in international markets for products and investment. Our manufactured exports have been increasing their share of world trade. In the home market a concentrated effort is being made, involving the Government, State agencies, distributors and the public at large, to assist Irish manufacturers to increase their market share and thereby to make a greater contribution towards complementing the job creation activities of exporting firms.  The Government's three-year programme for the promotion of Irish goods is expected to make a major contribution to achieving the Government's target of raising the level of industrial job creation over the next three years.  The small industry programme is also being intensified and the response rate to date, in terms of projects approved, is very encouraging.</P>
    <P>IDA approvals of new investment projects will provide the main basis of future job creation.  The IDA is operating for the first time in a very competitive arena where the increasing emphasis on attracting new investment by our EEC partners reflects the high levels of unemployment in these countries.  While unemployment in Ireland has been declining steadily as a result of job creation activity here, the situation in most EEC countries has been one of increasing unemployment. Despite the intensified competition for international investment, the IDA recorded over 24,000 new job approvals in 1977 and has set itself a target of 27,000 this year, which, given reasonable goodwill, I have every confidence they can achieve.  The significance of approvals of this magnitude lies not only in terms of the jobs to be provided but also in the major contribution that this new investment is making to broadening our industrial base, thereby reducing our historic dependence on a narrow range of relatively unsophisticated industrial activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> In view of the widespread recognition of the contribution being made by manufacturing industry to our economic development, it is a matter of regret and concern to contemplate the serious effects of strikes and threats of strikes on the national effort to increase the rate of economic growth.  The damage done is not adequately reflected in the statistics of man-days lost through stoppages. Such stoppages are only the symptoms of a deeper malaise affecting industrial relations.  Management is being obliged to spend an excessive amount of working time in sorting out disputes on the factory floor.  As a result, management effort and effectiveness in the essential areas of productions and marketing is being seriously diminished.  If work-flow were allowed to proceed with less disruption, the productivity of management and workers would increase significantly with beneficial effects in terms of increased output and employment.</P>
    <P>I am being constantly asked in the course of industrial promotion visits abroad about the position of industrial relations in Ireland.  We must face the fact that disruption of activities due to stoppages affecting public sector enterprises constitutes a major threat to our industrial development programme.  We have seen that continuing disruption of telecommunications services can cripple our export efforts in the short term and will damage investors' confidence in Ireland as a long-term base for investment.</P>
    <P>It has been intimated to me that the combination of a telecommunications stoppage with a disruption of Aer Lingus services due to industrial action could have serious consequences for oil exploration activity this year.  We stand to lose a vast amount of planned expenditure in this area and a setback to exploration activity will have serious consequences for the achievement of our economic targets.  I must say that I find it difficult to reconcile the poor record of industrial relations in public enterprises with the trade union arguments for greater public ownership <Col N="1718" /> in the industrial area as a proposition for achieving faster economic development. The record of disruptions of essential services in existing public enterprises augurs poorly for the smooth operation of State-owned industry in general and I think this is a point well worth reflecting on.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that I should draw attention to these matters at present. The two main disputes which are now in train are singly and collectively having a very serious effect on the standing of this country abroad particularly its standing as a suitable location for industrial investment.  This debate is about job creation.  To a very great extent industrial investment is job creation and job creation is about industrial investment.  If groups of individuals or institutions or groups of institutions want deliberately to so disrupt these basic essential services as to create the kind of difficulties we have today, it ill-behoves people who involve themselves in this kind of activity to complain about difficulties in job creation.  This would always have been so but, as I have already pointed out, it is more pertinent now, unfortunately, and more relevant than it ever was before because it is only in the last year or two that the IDA really began to encounter competitors abroad in the demand for industrial investment.  I do not think anybody else from any other country has yet built up the expertise that our IDA have acquired but those other countries will not be long in doing it.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the IDA having greater experience and expertise, one thing they do not have is more money to dispense.  We have seen an example of what will happen with the unlimited dispensing of funds as has been published within the past week or two, and we can expect more of that to happen, unfortunately.  Many of them will not be as easily identifiable as that industry which went to Northern Ireland because they will not, generally speaking, have made a commitment of some kind or other to the Republic before they change their minds and go elsewhere.  They will change their minds at an early stage.  This country is up against that difficulty also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> Notwithstanding these problems I have every confidence in the ability of the IDA and of the other agencies and bodies connected with this problem to overcome these difficulties and to achieve ever-increasing figures of job approval and job creation in this country. It is a pity that such a difficult job should be rendered so much harder for them by some of the things that are happening in this country today.</P>
    <P>I want to make reference to the three-year programme for the promotion of Irish goods which I launched in January which one of my Ministers of State, Deputy R. Burke, is actively involved in promoting at present. It was spoken of last night in a rather sarcastic and sneering fashion by Deputy Kelly who was very confident in his prediction that it would not succeed, that it would not create 10,000 jobs, that it was a fraud or some words to that effect.</P>

I have every confidence&mdash;and the first three months of that compaign give me ground for that confidence&mdash;that this programme will over its three-year life meet its targets, that it will switch 3 per cent of consumer spending from imported to Irish-made goods and that it will as a result of that and nothing else create 10,000 jobs in this country. Everyone in this country should be seeking to help that programme and help the Irish Goods Council to achieve these necessary objectives rather than taking up the attitude that unfortunately has been so marked in relation to it in the past couple of months.</P>

    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy J. Ryan to the situation in Van-Hool McArdle in Dublin.

Unfortunately, he has failed to resolve them, and I <Col N="1722" /> am afraid, knowing the nature of the difficulties, to a great extent they were impossible of resolution.

      <P>In any event, the situation is that the great majority of the workers concerned were entitled to go back to CIE, and of course I presume that those who have that option will exercise it to go back.  I am informed now that CIE offered jobs to the remaining redundant workers in Van-Hool McArdle who did not have that option.  The result is that there should be nobody out of employment as a result of the unfortunate liquidation of this company.  It is now a matter for the board of CIE to decide whether they themselves will resume bus building here or whether they will come to an agreement with another party to undertake this work.  I will be urging them to decide how they want to approach the matter as soon as possible, and when they have made their decision as to what way they are going to do it they will then get every encouragement from me to get into production as soon as possible. There will be premises available as soon as they are ready to start again. From the information I have been given by CIE there has not been any loss of employment as a result of the liquidation of that firm, and all the words spoken about it were spoken in vain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the UK employment subsidy in relation to the Irish subsidy, which I would have thought, from a normal reading of last night's debate, was criticised by Deputy Kelly but he will probably tell me that he did not criticise it. He spoke in bitter terms about it and regarded it as an inadequate response to the problems created by the British temporary employment subsidy.  I would like to put a few facts before the House in relation to it.  The first <Col N="1723" /> is that the various Irish industries, particularly the labour-intensive ones such as clothing, footwear, textiles and allied sectors of industry, have been hit by this British temporary employment subsidy from the very day it began about two years ago. They began, within a short time of its introduction, to see the way they were affected.  They saw jobs being lost and they approached the then Government and the then Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance.  They urged both of them very strongly to introduce some form of assistance which would alleviate the problems created by the British scheme.  There was a point blank refusal to introduce such a scheme.</P>
    <P>The various people concerned were told that the introduction of such a scheme would not be justified and would not be introduced by the Government. When I came into office I could see the difficulties that had been created.  I was apprehensive, to say the least of it, of the problems we would create for ourselves by introducing a scheme of this kind.  If we are going to get into competition with the British in financial disbursements to industry, whether of a capital or an operating nature, we cannot win.  We must lose in the long run.  In my view, we would be better off if we can avoid it, never to begin to run in a race we can never win. However, having had the opportunity to consider the matter and look at it at first hand over a period of months, I spoke to the Minister for Finance about it.  He agreed with my point of view and introduced a scheme in this year's budget which will last for as long as the British scheme lasts and no longer.</P>
    <P>The figure for the weekly payment in the Irish scheme of £5 per week has been criticised as being worth one-fourth of what the British scheme is worth.  It is considerably more valuable than that because the Irish scheme will be paid in respect of every worker in those various sectors of industry, whereas the British scheme is only paid in respect of those whose redundancy would otherwise be inevitable.  I understand it applies to <Col N="1724" /> approximately 20 per cent of the workers in those various sectors.  It seems to me that £5 for all your workers is more money than £20 for 20 per cent of your workers.  I do not think, whatever criticism of principle might be appropriate to a scheme like this, its inadequacy can be criticised.</P>
    <P>The EEC Commission announced in Brussels this afternoon that they were accepting the continuation of the UK scheme for a further year subject to significant modifications.  We have in general terms an idea of what those modifications are likely to be from the multilateral talks which took place recently in relation to this matter.  I understand that the modifications have not yet been officially announced.  We are, however, faced with the problem that this large and wealthy country, which has a great deal of spare cash to disburse nowadays as a result of the North Sea, has been allowed by the Commission to retain this system which it seems to us on the face of it distorted competition within the Community. We have first-hand evidence in the unemployment of our workers that it is distorted competition.  I trust that the Commission's action in allowing this large and wealthy industrial power to retain this particular aid to industry will be borne in mind when certain aids offered by the Irish Government to industry come up for scrutiny as they do from time to time.</P>
    <P>I was asked by my colleague to give Deputy Kelly the figures in relation to emigration.  He said that emigration had started again and that the Government were at fault.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously my colleague did not hear Deputy Kelly correctly if he did not say that emigration had started again and that the Government were at fault.  I got the figures from the Central Statistics Office.  The position is that in the year 1971 to February 1972, the year when the historic tide turned, there was zero emigration for the first time since 1841. In 1972-73 there was net emigration of 2,000 to 3,000, in 1973-74 4,000, in 1974-75 4,000, 1975 to February 1976, zero to plus 1,000 emigration.  From February 1976 to February 1977 there <Col N="1725" /> was net emigration again of between 3,000 and 4,000.  That was when the tide turned again unfortunately.  The Central Statistics Office have not yet worked out the figures for February 1977 to February 1978.  They will not be available for a while but their estimate is that the net emigration figure for that year will not be less than what it was in the year beginning February 1976.</P>
      <P>Various other points were raised which I cannot deal with now in the very limited time one gets in these debates. I want to say that this is the only country in the EEC increasing its manufacturing employment and it is the only country in the EEC where unemployment is decreasing.  Those things are being achieved in the face of many serious and fundamental difficulties. The Government's programme in this respect is on target.  I feel it should be the objective of all our people and of all Members of the House to see that the Government's programme is maintained and remains on target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no pleasure to address the House tonight on this motion.  Too many young and old people are out of work and too many of them are living in abject poverty.  No election is in sight, not even a by-election, so it must be clear to all disinterested parties that this motion is in no sense political.  The motivation of the motion is to pressurise the Government to change the disastrous policies they have adopted.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the recent history of unemployment.  The figures on the live register for this week are in excess of 112,000.  That is 3,000 greater than the figure for July 1977 when the present Government came to power. We all know that there are seasonal fluctuations in unemployment and that we must compare like with like.  We must compare this week's figure with the corresponding figure for last year. There are just over 5,000 fewer on the live register of unemployed than there were during the same week last year.  That does not mean, as this House has been led to believe, that there are fewer people unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> There has been a parallel increase in the numbers unemployed who are not registered.  More and more people coming on to the labour market for the first time are finding it difficult to get employment.  Even if there was only a 5 per cent increase in that figure in the last 12 months it would more than cancel out the reduction in the live register figures.  That being so the June 1978 figures, based on Fianna Fáil's estimate last June, should be in excess of 160,000.  It also means that the figure today would be considerably greater given that the number on the live register last June was 109,000. The total unemployed on the live register was estimated by Fianna Fáil at 160,000.  The figure on the live register has gone up by 3,000 and the unregistered number of unemployed has gone up by we do not know how many thousand.  That means that the likely number of unemployed at the moment is somewhere around 170,000. That is an alarming if not a revolutionary situation.  The number of unemployed on 5 July last year was 109,000 which was 8,000 less than the figure for the first week in March 1977.  In four months the reduction in live register unemployment was 8,000, so it is reasonable to assume that without any intervention from the Government there should be a parallel reduction in the next four months.  We should expect a figure of 104,000 in the first week of July of this year without any intervention from the Government.  I doubt if that figure will be achieved. There is very little to encourage the hope that it will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In analysing the unemployment figures for last week I noted an increase in the numbers on short-time employment.  That is very discouraging. If the unemployment figure on the live register for 5 July 1978 is reduced in the way it was last year during the same months it should reduce to 104,000.  With the additional money to be provided we should reasonably expect to have below 100,000 unemployed by July.  Unless the attitude and policies of the Government change there is no chance that that figure will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I listened with absolute sadness to <Col N="1727" /> the speeches of the Ministers for Industry, Commerce and Energy and Labour.  There was no hint of any positive suggestions or action from either of the Ministers who are responsible for job creation.  There was no encouragement to the young people to expect anything on the horizon.  To be fair, the Minister for Labour introduced an employment action team. When launching this team last August the Minister said that the emphasis would be on action.  As the House knows from replies to questions put to the Minister a few weeks ago there has been neither employment nor action. The team is only a cover-up, a charade for Fianna Fáil inactivity.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation is alarming and it makes the Government's budget strategy wrong in an historic way.  It is alarming because the only identifiable successful policy in combating unemployment lies in the Employment Incentive Scheme. The Minister for Labour mentioned how successful this scheme was in January and February 1978.  The Employment Incentive Scheme is a carryover from the National Coalition Government.  Alongside this we have what can only be described as a most favourable atmosphere, an unparalleled 5½ per cent growth in GNP in 1977, greatly increased output, and massively increased exports.  All these were brought about in part by Coalition policy and by last year's National Pay Agreement which was full of restraints and which increased competitiveness and maintained industrial peace.</P>
    <P>Why then, with £20 per head subsidy available and such growth has industry not come across with more jobs?  I believe the answer is to be found in comparative statistics now available to us.  The National Economic and Social Council Report No. 35 on Population and Employment Projections 1986: A Reassessment, in Table A.5, sets out Sectoral Productivity for 1974.  At the top of that table it is shown, in brackets, that the Republic of Ireland = 100.  Given the Republic as 100, in agriculture, British productivity is shown at 172 and the <Col N="1728" /> Benedelux countries&mdash;that is, the Benelux countries with Denmark&mdash;at 193. What of industry?  The Republic of Ireland is shown as 100 and the Benedelux countries as 188.  In services the Republic of Ireland is shown as 100 and the Benedelux countries as 153.  That does not even include a more productive country such as Germany.  There-fore the fact is that we, as a country, are under-productive, that industry and agriculture are grossly over-manned. It takes two Irishmen to produce what it takes one European.  Yet Government strategy is to put all of their eggs in the one basket, that of private enterprise.  Private enterprise must be as competitive and productive as its rivals if it is to survive and to be competitive its costs must be lower. If Irish industry employs two people where a European industry employs one the only thing that saves it is the weak £.  As we know, the £ is strengthening on the exchange rate and, given the weakness of the United States' economy, it is likely to streng-then even further.  Therefore, the basis of the Government's policy must be considered very weak.  Yet the very cornerstone of Government policy is to wield jobs where there are already twice too many.  Historically this is wrong.  It is like trying to sell ice to the Eskimoes.  God knows most people on the other side of the House would not even attempt it.</P>
    <P>Our only hope is to be competitive as a race, to produce as much per man as is done in other countries.  Yet the budget and all that went before it was full of incentive for the rich, indeed for everybody except the ordinary working man.  One thing a businessman must be to survive is businesslike. Even with the additional carrots in the budget private enterprise will in no way be encouraged to employ more people, certainly not on a long-term basis because, as every businessman knows, they are already greatly over-manned.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that besets us in addition to that of under-productivity. It is the question of under-participation of women in our economic activities.  I am not necessarily advocating that every married woman go out to work but I am stating <Col N="1729" /> that there is an irreversible social and cultural trend in Europe and here under which married women in increasing numbers are going out to work or remaining at work after marriage.  I elicited the information in this House from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development that the participation rate in Ireland compared with the rest of the EEC was just under one to two, in other words, just less than half the percentage of Irish women were at work than in Europe.  Yet even the most pessimistic job creation needs take no account of rising female participation rates.  The National Economic and Social Council Report, No. 35, to which I have already referred says we need to create 28,000 new jobs annually.  That report ignores the two major problems to which I have referred&mdash;the under-productivity of the Irish worker and the under-participation of Irish women in our economic activities.  If those two major omissions are taken into account, possibly our job creation needs are as high as 40,000 annually.  I believe they should be taken into account because as long as we, as a country, have not got true full employment, then we may expect a less than enthusiastic response from the Irish worker to productivity arrangements and so on, because inevitably there is an element of protectionism, that of protecting their own and their colleagues' jobs when a situation of high unemployment obtains, as it has here for a very long time.</P>
    <P>The necessary and desirable changes not alone on the employment front but in social and cultural matters also can be achieved only by full employment. This budget has been described as anti-social. I described it in the budget debate as an ideologically conservative one and so it is.  There is no under-estimating the consequences of the Government's policies in undermining the industrial relations situation.  Since coming into power the Government have persistently and consistently aided and abetted the wealthy at the expense of the poor with, on the one hand, the abolition of wealth tax and, on the other, no increase in children's allowances. We had the spectacle of the Government rushing in in a most <Col N="1730" /> curious fashion to bail out the investors of the Irish Trust Bank.</P>

Incidentally, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you were not here for the comments of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, but those suspicions have been well fed tonight by that Minister, the Minister primarily responsible for the Ferenka disaster.

We have the situation where there will be no increase in old age pensions, no increase in children's allowances, subsidies removed from basic commodities like cheese and town gas abolished and, at the same time, we can have across-the-board the abolition of rates. Now the abolition of rates is a very good thing for the vast majority.</P>

      <P>I will not get into an argument with you because that will not benefit the unemployed but I genuinely believe there is need for the Government to cry &ldquo;Halt&rdquo;, to stop and look again at what they are doing to the workers and how they are alienating them.  The Government must stop and try to create confidence in the workers so that there will be industrial peace because it is only in an atmosphere of industrial peace that jobs can be created.  I have mentioned Ferenka.  I have mentioned the Posts and Telegraphs dispute and I must mention Van Hool in my own constituency. Three hundred jobs down the swannee.  Government inactivity.</P>

      <P>The boatyards too and I think there were jobs lost there in the Minister's own constituency and <Col N="1734" /> now New Ross as well.  It seems to me the only answer this Government have to unemployment is emigration.  That seems to me patently clear&mdash;emigration and stop women working.  Married women have no right to work. That is the attitude of the Government. Others can emigrate.  That is the solution.  How else can we explain the situation where there are 5,000 fewer registered unemployed on the live register and that in a situation where there has been huge economic growth, unparalleled growth, a huge increase in output, in exports, £50 million in the January 1977 budget for job creation and yet not one person less, taking into account the registered and unregistered, out of jobs.  That is a damning indictment.</P>

      <P>I do not support this motion.  It is absolutely unfair to say the Government have done nothing to help the unemployment situation since elected to office.  It is equally unfair to say they have no plan.  Last night it was said no one should take credit for the fact that there had been an increase in the civil service.  The posts created have been in the Garda Síochána, where an increase in personnel was very badly needed, and in teaching personnel, an increase designed to improve the pupil-teacher ratio in our schools.  We should be proud of creating these jobs.  The manifesto was a plan and that plan cannot be completed in nine months. The budget was geared towards the creation of jobs.  In the public sector there will be approximately 11,000 jobs and large sums of money will be spent on health and education to create employment.  The building industry was also helped to a considerable extent. The money allocated for sanitary services and environmental schemes will create much-needed employment in local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can say that youth unemployment is not directly affecting this city and the country generally.  Some 50 per cent of the population are under the age of 25 and of the total number unemployed 44 per cent are under the age of 25.  There is no doubt that thousands of young people are still unemployed.  We are not denying that. <Col N="1735" /> The Employment Action Team that was established, and which was criticised in this House, was allocated a small sum to get it started.  It is fair to remember that probably it is the only group in the last few years that has unions, employers, youth organisations and the Government sitting down together to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>From what I have heard, the youth groups are very happy that somebody is working for them and that they are getting a chance to be involved.  A sum of £900,000 has been allocated to Dublin Corporation and the chief architect dealing with amenities and the park superintendent are working on a system that will finish on 31 March to decide how the jobs will be created. That will happen in a few weeks.  The Ballyfermot employment scheme will provided interesting information which we did not have previously because a census was not carried out in 1976.  An EEC survey is proceeding at the moment and that will give similar information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time at my disposal I want to comment briefly on a few of the reactions from the far side to the speeches made from these benches.  I noticed when he came in this evening the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy had done me the honour of reading carefully the speech I made last night.  Although he was not here himself he had got the carbon copy of the report and had gone through it.  In his characteristic way he saw fit to pick out a reference that I made to the Buy Irish campaign and, while quoting only one or two sentences from my speech, he tried to persuade the House that I had attempted to blacken the campaign. Of course I did nothing of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I said was that I wanted to call a truce for a few moments in the debate in order to reiterate my support and the support of this party for that campaign.  This was not the first time that I said that or that it was said from this side of the House but, of course, it was far above the Minister's honesty threshold to say that.  I had deliberately interrupted the flow of my <Col N="1736" /> otherwise critical remarks in order to say that we wanted to express our wholehearted support for the scheme. This was not the first time we did this; we started the current phase in regard to the Guaranteed Irish symbol.</P>
    <P>What I said last night, and what I wish to repeat now, is that Fianna Fáil introduced this matter which should be above party politics into their election manifesto, coupled with an arbitrary number of 10,000 jobs, and thus made it into a party political matter.  Although I would not myself stay away from Buy Irish functions&mdash; and I do not believe the Minister was right when he said that Deputies from my party do so&mdash;if anyone has politicised that campaign it is the party opposite.  It should never have been part of a political manifesto and it should never have been made the subject of a pretence that a party, by sponsoring a scheme of this kind, could turn out so many jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister took enough trouble to read that part of the speech but I noticed he was as coy as the shrinking violet or weekend crocus I mentioned a moment ago in regard to some of the other things I said which bore directly on his Department.  There was not one word from the Minister about the Employment Action Team which has not produced one single job up to this minute.  There was not a single word from him about something that is not the responsibility of the Minister opposite but his own responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the industrial development consortium.  It is an absolute dead duck and I am not saying that to damn it.  It was a dead duck from the word go.  It could not have been anything else because of the terms on which it was constructed. Although it was intended as a leg of the Government's job creation programme it could never have been something that created jobs.  It has no budget, it has no statutory basis, no officers, no programme, it does not do any business and it does not create any <Col N="1737" /> jobs.  Naturally it was a dead duck from the word go.  If the Minister put it on a different footing, if he turned it into a real consortium, nationalised or otherwise&mdash;I do not care which&mdash; we would support it if it was worth supporting.  From the beginning it was a dead duck and it remains one.  The Minister took time out of his busy day to read the carbons of my speech last night but he did not have anything to say about my words on that topic.  I have noted that.</P>
      <P>The Minister was quiet enough about the building industry.  Last night I asserted that the figures for November 1976 and November 1977 show that in spite of the colossal up-turn in the general economy and the end of the recession&mdash;even if there had not been a Government in the country or if the British were still here there would have been an up-turn in economic expansion and activity&mdash;the difference in the building industry figures was 641 jobs and this is in an industry that is in the Fianna Fáil Party's pocket.  The figure of 3,170 jobs mentioned by the Minister for Finance cannot be found anywhere.  The difference is 641 jobs.  After all the expenditure, after all the hand-outs and the grants, that is the difference in the employment figures for November 1976 and November 1977, the latest date for which figures are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the Buy Irish campaign appears to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to be relevant here.  I made it relevant last night by talking about it.  If it is a party matter now, it is he and his side who have made it such.  He let fall a very significant, revealing and, from his point of view, a very wounding expression in the course of his speech this evening.  He did not say a lot about the amendment and he said little about confidence in the Government to produce a plan.  There is not a word about such a plan, about youth employment or about any of the things we are supposed to be talking about.  It did not suit him to talk about them.  However, when he was talking about job creation in the years ahead he let fall a very revealing phrase.  He said it as though it was as natural and was to be taken <Col N="1738" /> for granted as much as the fact that the sun will rise tomorrow.  He referred to the fall in agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>That is an axiom and a cliché in most of the industrialised world.  We know that the number in agricultural employment will fall, that according as machines do the work the number at work will tend to fall because there is no necessity for people to scratch and harrow the ground with their hands.  Even the greatest Jackeen knows that much.  However what the Minister did not understand&mdash;and the fact that he used these words shows his total lack of understanding and the lack of understanding in his party&mdash;is that this country is unique in the EEC in having as much land derelict, under-developed, undrained, unused as would make a small state.  We are not in the same position as the Belgians and the Dutch.  They can talk about a contraction in agricultural employment. Every square yard of their country is used.  If I travelled to where Deputy Killilea lives I would see fields in which nothing is happening.  I would see fields half under water, fields growing thistles, ragwort and dock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been seeing that since I was a child.  To talk in this easy, off-hand way as though a constand decline in agricultural employment was built into the social and economic future of this country shows a shallowness and an empty-headedness of thinking on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party of which they should be ashamed.  The future for this country lies in the land, in what can be got out of the land and in the processing which can be done on the land's produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I find that kind of attitude on the part of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, a man who is supposed to be responsible, and is gladly responsible, for the industrial sector which comprises and contains food processing, I say to myself: &ldquo;God help us, if that is what we have come to that we can listen in this Dáil in a single day to what we heard at Question Time about the Tuam potato <Col N="1739" /> processing factory having to close down, and also listen to a blandly throwaway subordinate clause in a sentence about the constant contraction in agricultural employment.&rdquo; That is our field for expansion.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Germans, or the Dutch or the Belgians have jobs of a different kind up their sleeves.  Perhaps they can expand employment in heavy industry.  Perhaps there are technological areas which they can more easily exploit than we can.  They have not got 3,500,000 acres of derelict land.  If they had, you would not hear anything from the Dutch or the German Ministers for Industry, Commerce and Energy about a contraction in agricultural employment.  With their relatively low unemployment figures, if you gave the Dutch or the Germans 3,500,000 acres of derelict land, you would be very surprised at what they would do with it, and you would hear quickly enough about their unemployment figure falling.  You would hear no more about the constant contraction of agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>I know all about the difficulties of land structure, the difficulties of tenure, the constraints within which the Land Commission have to work, and so on, but that is the growth area and it is the only growth area we have.  It is acknowledged that we are in fierce competition for mobile industry.  We cannot succeed.  Even if the IDA worked 24 hours a day&mdash;and no body works harder than the IDA; I have often complimented them in this House and I do so again&mdash;they could not succeed in the long run in over-coming all competition and in closing the employment gap by manufacturing industry alone.  It cannot be done.  The main assets, the real assets we have are the land and the sea.  These are assets which the Fianna Fáil Government, by throwing away the 50-mile claim, by sabotaging it within a week of Mr. Fix-It.  Mr. No Problems coming into Government.  He sabotaged that claim&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Just because the English, the French, the Germans and the Dutch experienced a fall in agricultural employment, where their land has been properly exploited for hundreds of years, the Paddys must look forward to the same thing.

      <P>The last thing I want to say bears on the general features of the economy and the general bearing of the economy's profile on our employment situation.  I am reminded of a speech made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy on the budget.  If you could imagine a member of the supreme Soviet coming in here and making this speech, you would get about that much understanding and about that much honesty.  He came in here two weeks ago and made a budget speech in which he attributed absolutely, without exception, every single thing of a favourable kind in the economic indicators we have seen in the past eight or nine months to the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government. I know that is politics.  We made mistakes. They won the election and good luck to them.  Believe me, in my heart I do not grudge them a fair chance, and I will do nothing underhand, or dishonest, or unfair to make things difficult for them.  When I meet that kind of thick attitude, that kind of thick, deceitful and ignorant approach to politics, I despair.</P>

      <P>I know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you are a gentleman and I mean that sincerely.  I have a document which is a measure of the kind of crookedness we have to deal with on this side of the House.  On the domestic scene and for domestic consumption, it is all right to blame everything on the Coalition and it is all right to say: &ldquo;Since we took office the sun has popped up over the horizon.&rdquo; If I had more time I would be able to enlarge on the symbolism of the cover of this official publication <i>Ireland Today</i> issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The smiling visage on page 2 is that of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and, from internal evidence&mdash;I can pick references to figures which have changed since&mdash;I can tell he wrote this article about the beginning of February of this year.  He said:</P>
      <P>The recovery stems from renewed industrial activity and is export led ... This expansion was achieved despite growing international competition and the all-too-familiar  lack of sufficient buoyancy in world markets ... this improvement reflects the slowing down in the rate of increase in world import prices and the recent strength of sterling.  However, it is also the fruitful outcome of the income restraint achieved in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a great day for Ireland when <Col N="1742" /> at least in something intended for foreign consumption we get a bit of the truth from the Government?  He never said that here.  He never told us here that the difficulties we had, and still have, in regard to our economy, unemployment, and everything else, were to some extent, if not a very large extent, influenced by larger factors. There was not a word about that.  Lies and half-truths and <i>Izvestia</i> stuff are good enough for us here.  It is only when he would be ashamed to tell anything but the truth before a foreign audience that we get the real story.</P>
    <P>The real story is that the employment possibilities this country has are enormous.  They are not being grasped. An attempt is being made to create the impression that employment is being improved by the creation of a large number of public service jobs for which Governments in the old days would have apologised.  They would have apologised for laying that burden on the people's backs.  The real wealth of the country and the real trends of economic history cannot be discerned from anything we hear from the Government because they are afraid to face up to the truth.  It is a sad reflection on the Government that they have to go to something intended for consumption by the Japs before we can get the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not take up the 10 minutes because I believe this is a matter that should have been dealt with by private notice question.  I am seeking information, not to make a statement.  I merely want to ask the</P>
      <P>Minister why a convicted murderer was at large for seven days without the general public being told of it.  The history of the case is well known; it has received plenty of publicity in the week-end papers.  I am disappointed that the Department of Justice have still remained silent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that I do not know all the facts of the case.  I shall not therefore accuse the Minister of something I am not sure of, but I am sure that there is general alarm particularly in the area where the crime was committed.  There are people there who gave evidence during the trial and they were afraid when they heard this man was at large.  Does the Minister believe that he was doing justice to these people?  This man could have acted out of revenge, remembered the names of the people and could have taken his revenge when he got out of jail.  They should have been told he was at large.  This is a matter of sufficient importance to have been dealt with, in my view, by private notice question.  It is important to allay the fears of these people who feel that <Col N="1745" /> their lives are in danger and that there is some threat to them.  I believe the Department of Justice have fallen down in not meeting that demand.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as being against parole nor am I against the parole of a person convicted of murder, but this is a particular case and the murder was a gruesome one.  The whole circumstances of the case would suggest to me, if I were Minister for Justice, that particular care should have been taken.  I would support the liberal views of any Minister in power in dealing with an application for parole.  After all, this man served 11 years and in the normal course he should have been discharged as many murderers are discharged with normal remission of sentences for good behaviour and so on.  I wonder why this man was continuing to be kept in prison.</P>
    <P>Why did the Department of Justice not make the public aware that this man had broken parole and absconded? Why, when the news was leaked to the press and became public property through the medium of the national newspapers, did the Department still remain silent?  My purpose is not to take up time; my reason for raising the matter on the Adjournment is that I want the Minister to make known the facts of the case.  There may be considerations in the case with which other people including myself would have sympathy.  There may be hidden factors which would lead us to make the same decision as the Minister for Justice made, but we do not know these facts.  The case is such that we demand a full report.  I hope the Minister will deal with the matter in every detail in his reply.</P>

      <P>The phrase &ldquo;a high security risk&rdquo; has been used here and it was used in a draft question that the Deputy submitted in relation to &ldquo;a high security prisoner.&rdquo; This man was certainly not in that category.  He was currently imprisoned in Arbour Hill Prison, Dublin which is certainly not a high security prison but one from which no prisoner would have any great difficulty in escaping.  During a period of one-and-a-half years beginning in April 1974 he was transferred by the then Minister for Justice to Shelton Abbey, Co. Wicklow.  This is an open prison, just a house, no walls or locks or anything of that kind. He could have walked out at any time if he wanted to.  The previous Minister for Justice allowed this man on a regular basis beginning in April 1977 to attend religious services accompanied by a private citizen.  This practice has now been going on for nearly a year. The last occasion on which he attended a religious service with this civilian was, I think, on 5 March of this year.  He did not return after that service.  On two previous occasions <Col N="1747" /> prisoners convicted of murder who were out on parole failed to return to the prison at the specified time.</P>
      <P>Both of these occasions, which were not connected with each other, occurred in 1974.  The then Minister for Justice did not make any statement to the newspapers in respect of either of these two cases.  As far as I can recall there was no demand, out-raged or otherwise, genuine or mock, put up in this House that the then Minister for Justice should have issued statements in relation to those two convicted murderers.  One hesitates to differentiate between different prisoners or to seek to ascribe degrees of gruesomeness to murder, but certainly the two who absconded in 1974 were murderers who had been found guilty of murders of undoubted brutality. There was very little detail of how this prisoner carried out his crime because the body was not discovered for a long time afterwards and it had been destroyed by lime.  The crime in question took place more than 12 years ago.  This prisoner has been in prison for an unusually long time, but efforts have been made to prepare him for his ultimate release, and naturally it is part of the preparation of a prisoner for his ultimate release that he, in common with many other prisoners, should be paroled from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment eight persons who were sentenced to life imprisonment for murder are on temporary release under the supervision of the welfare service while residing in their own homes or in accommodation provided for them.  One person similarly sentenced goes from prison every day to his place of employment, while three others are allowed regular outings from prison.  Of this total of 12 eight of the 12 cases was approved by the last Minister for Justice.  In none of the cases can it be said with certainty that the person concerned is not going to commit serious crime again, but it is felt and hoped that the risk involved is low.  No Minister for Justice can guarantee that any prisoner is not going to commit crime again, but there has to be an element of risk when people are paroled.  On the other <Col N="1748" /> hand, one is dealing with human beings, and these abnormally long sentences which are sometimes served after somebody is convicted of murder can have the effect of totally crushing the spirit of any individual.  It is the duty of the Minister of the day and his officials to seek to rehabilitate such people.</P>
    <P>Statistics sometimes can be of some use and interest, and I would like to give very brief statistics in relation to this matter.  Taking the extreme case of murder it is interesting to note that in the past 35 years no instance is known where a person who was convicted of murder in this State was convicted of another murder subsequently.  It is also interesting to note that in recent times only three persons&mdash; including the person now in question&mdash;who were serving life imprisonment for murder absconded while on temporary release. The two other offenders involved, who, as I have already said, absconded in 1974 were subsequently apprehended, one of them after some days and the other after about a month.  No statement was issued by the Minister of the day or the Department at the time. Those two prisoners have been on temporary release on several occasions since then.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister or the Department have acted in any improper way here.  If they were to issue statements in relation to this matter it would certainly be against all precedent and it would in my view be against the better judgement and wisdom that should be exercised on an occasion like this because it would only creat scares and publicity, and it would frighten people unnecessarily. It would perhaps force the man when he sees himself described in the newspapers and so on as dangerous or, as he has been described here tonight, a security risk, to contemplate things he would not otherwise contemplate.  I am satisfied that in every way the proper and appropriate steps have been taken in this case and I hope that the Garda will have every success in their task in apprehending this man.</P>

      <P>I wish to put on record that I appreciate the information the <Col N="1749" /> Minister gave and the way he gave it, but in fairness to the man would it not have been better to do that immediately the escape became public rather than have it brought up and discussed in this House?</P>

    <P>Urgent cases do not have to wait for the periods specified above but are dealt with as soon as possible depending on the degree of urgency.  The following developments will improve the situation in the specialties referred to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Paediatrics: The Western Health Board, after a number of unsuccessful competitions, have recently appointed a paediatrician for Castlebar General Hospital who will take up duty on 1 July 1978.</P>
    <P>ENT: An additional ENT surgeon has recently been appointed to Galway Regional Hospital and as from 1 February 1978 four additional out-patient clinics per month are being provided at Castlebar General Hospital.</P>
    <P>Orthopaedics: At present orthopaedic surgeons from Merlin Park Hospital, Galway provide out-patient clinics in the North-Western Health Board area.  The North Western Health Board is in process of recruiting two orthopaedic surgeons to provide services in the board's area. These appointments will enable the orthopaedic surgeons employed by the Western Health Board to concentrate on services for the board's area.</P>
    <P>The provision of information to Roscommon local health committee would be a matter for the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>The information in respect of last year is not yet available but I will forward it to Deputy Doherty as soon as possible.  I will also forward the figures for ophthalmology in respect of County Mayo to the Deputies shortly.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organisation has recommended that dental services should be provided on a dentist to population ratio of 1 to 2,000.  This ratio implies a need for approximately 1,560 dentists in Ireland as compared with 888 dentists currently registered. <Col N="1639" /> This ratio does not, however, take account of the effects of fluoridated water supplies in preventing dental caries nor of the impact of the employment of operating dental auxiliaries.

The claims of four of these persons were allowed without delay, but it was not possible until fairly recently to give decisions on the unemployment benefit claims of the remaining three as there were insufficient contributions on their insurance records to enable them to qualify.

      <P>These schemes come into <Col N="1650" /> the devolved works category and my approval to the layout plans is not necessary.  However, since the housing authority decided to submit them to my Department for consideration, they have been passed to the inspector for the area, with whom the council's advisers would, in any event, be consulting locally under the devolved procedures. The inspector will convey his views directly to the council's advisers in the near future.</P>
      <P>The layout plans indicate gross densities of the following order: Kildare, 8.2 houses per acre; Ardclough, 7.7 houses per acre; Prosperous, 13.0 houses per acre.</P>

      <P>The only proposal before my Department received on 6 February 1978 from Meath County Council about the schemes listed by the Deputy is a claim for a capital allocation to finance the schemes.  The procedure in regard to the examination of, and the making of a decision on, that claim is indicated in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 339 of today's date about certain Kildare housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Meath schemes are all devolved schemes&mdash;that is, schemes of sixty houses or less&mdash;the council is not required to submit plans for my approval.  With the exception of the Trim scheme which forms part of an overall housing project in excess of sixty houses, details of the densities of the other schemes referred to by the Deputy are not available in my Department. <Col N="1651" /> In the case of the Trim scheme, the gross density is estimated to be 8.1 dwellings per acre.</P>
