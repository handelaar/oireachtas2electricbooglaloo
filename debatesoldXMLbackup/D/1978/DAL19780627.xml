      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is his policy to encourage Government Ministers to visit Northern Ireland, both officially and privately; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: When I met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan, last September we agreed, with particular reference to Northern Ireland, that it would be of mutual advantage to improve practical co-operation on economic matters and that officials of the two Governments would meet to review arrangements and opportunities for this.  In my view, the same considerations apply to official and private visits by Government Ministers both to and from Northern Ireland. Such contacts help to dispel suspicions and create deeper understanding and I fully support and encourage them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: May I ask how many times, if any, the Taoiseach has been to Northern Ireland in the past ten years other than for funerals or ordinations of Catholic bishops and <Col N="1862" /> if he has met any leaders of the Unionist side there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have been to Northern Ireland other than to funerals and ordinations of bishops. I have not formally met any Unionists there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be helpful to his understanding of the Northern Ireland situation and his enunciations thereon if he did make frequent visits to Northern Ireland and if he met leaders of the Unionist side there?</P>

      <P>: The consumer price index is compiled quarterly on the basis of prices actually charged.  These prices are the averages of a large number of price quotations collected from an extensive panel of retail and service outlets.</P>
      <P>If the maximum price increases permitted for the items specified were implemented in full in all types of retail and service outlets and for all brands of the commodities concerned, it is estimated that the increase in the consumer price index would be 0.4 per cent on the mid-May 1978 level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will provide an estimate of the annual cost of the export profits tax relief scheme, in terms of tax revenues forfeited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why, in view of the apparent economic recovery during 1977, advances made by Fóir Teoranta during that year showed a 75 per cent increase on the previous year; and why the total amount of loans written off by that agency <Col N="1864" /> showed an increase of 50 per cent on the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I assume the Deputy is referring to certain data in the report and accounts of Fóir Teoranta for 1977 released generally by the company after their annual general meeting on 10 May 1978.  Total facilities approved by the company during the year were £5.981 million as against £3.426 million in the previous year, an increase of 75 per cent.  Total disbursements, however, were £5.6 million in 1977 as against £2.05 million in 1976. The increase in advances was due mainly to a limited number of large cases which required a significant amount of assistance during the year. A further reason may have been that the resources of certain companies were depleted during the recession and their circumstances were such that they were unable to get the necessary finance from normal commercial sources to take advantage of increased trading activity.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to write-cffs it would seem that he is referring to the provision made by the company in 1977 for both actual writeoffs and against the possibility of future losses on advances.  The total provision at £2.435 million was 32 per cent higher than the 1976 figure of £1.847 million.  The total of actual write-offs during 1977 was £571,000 compared with £234,000 in the previous year.  However, £343,000 of the 1977 figure related to firms which had closed in 1975 and 1976, in other words before the economic recovery of 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will outline the criteria applied by the Central Bank in assessing banking profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Central Bank have informed me that, in assessing the profits of the associated banks, they take account of:</P>
      <P>1.  general economic conditions, including the real rate of economic growth and the rate of inflation;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> 2.  the rate of taxation;</P>
    <P>3.  prudential requirements, having regard to currently accepted supervisory standards;</P>
    <P>4.  a reasonable level of dividend.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank consider that the profits of a bank should be such as to enable them to maintain an adequate ratio between total capital employed&mdash; that is, subscribed capital and reserves&mdash;and gross assets, after making provision for taxation, dividends and other contingencies.  The associated banks are currently expected to ob-serve a ratio of not less than 6.5 per cent.  In order to achieve this, a rate of pre-tax profit in the region of 23 to 26 per cent is regarded by the bank as appropriate in present circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the Government have endorsed the recent decision of Irish Life to establish a building society; and whether such a State-owned building society will be granted monopoly status, thereby eliminating wasteful competition, duplication of resources and unnecessary advertising and administrative overheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Under the Building Societies Act, 1976, it is the function of the Registrar of Building Societies to decide, within the powers conferred on him by that Act, whether or not to register a society.  The question of Government endorsement does not arise.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Minister for the Environment to a similar question from the Deputy on 25 May 1978.  Since I am, as Minister for Finance, the major shareholder in Irish Life, I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that under existing law an Irish Life building society would not enjoy any special privileges and no change in that position is contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has seen an advertisement <Col N="1866" /> for merchant bankers (details supplied) in which they make their services available for the investment of Irish capital overseas; and if his Department have any proposals for the monitoring of the investment of such capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have seen the advertisement.  Controls on investment of the type in question are exercised by the Central Bank on behalf of the Minister for Finance to ensure that there is no reduction in the amount of domestic funds available for investment in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Could the Minister indicate whether or not the permission of the Central Bank will be necessary before any funds can be invested abroad on foot of an advertisement such as that referred to in the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, it would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can the Minister say if he has given any direction to the Central Bank or made his feelings known to them in regard to the export of capital of this kind and whether he would propose to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: No, because there is no export of capital involved.  The mechanics by which it operates do not result in any outflow of capital.  Perhaps I should explain: there is a deposit made in Irish pounds equivalent to the amount being borrowed abroad.  An account is opened in respect of that and the bank concerned then borrow in the foreign currency the equivalent amount.  There is no outflow of Irish capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Minister clarify the matter?  Even though there is no outflow of Irish capital as such, is it not the case that the interest on the foreign borrowings will have to be paid for by Irish funds and that this represents an outflow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand that in certain cases there can be an actual small inflow involved because of the way the operation works mechanically. Certainly there is no loss and it is <Col N="1867" /> subject to the approval of the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Minister state if the Central Bank publish figures of the amount of capital that may leave the country as a result of this or other capital investment schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I have indicated to the Deputy, capital does not leave the country as a result of this kind of scheme.  With regard to other statistics published by the Central Bank, I would have to refer the Deputy to the quarterly and annual reports of the Central Bank that are laid on the Table of the House.</P>

      <P>: The current budget deficit for 1978 is estimated at £405 million.  Government borrowing is arranged to meet the Exchequer's overall borrowing requirement, of which the current budget deficit forms a part. The pattern of borrowing in any year depends not only on the financing needs of the Exchequer at the time but also on the sources of finance available. It is not possible, therefore, at this stage to predict the composition and terms of the Exchequer's overall borrowing in 1978.</P>

      <Col N="1870" /> Details of current expenditure are published in the 1978 budget booklet. For the current supply services, the expenditure is set out in greater detail in the volume <i>Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 1978</i> published prior to the budget.</P>

    <P>NOTE: The figures shown are <i>receipts</i> of tax.  Tax on foot of 1978-79 assessments on full-time farmers will, when the Finance Bill, 1978, is enacted, be due and payable on 1 January 1979.

Perhaps the position is somewhat confused by what I referred to about the due date for payment of income tax by full-time farmers in respect of the current income tax year.  The date will be 1 January 1979 and that does not bring it within <Col N="1871" /> the current budgetary year.  That may have confused the issue.  I do not think there is any difference involved in the summation of these figures and the figures given already.</P>

As I stated then, the appro-val of cross-Border routes for customs purposes requires the agreement of the UK customs authorities with whom negotiations have taken place regarding the Derrylin/Ballyconnell road. While full approval of this road is not possible at present, agreement has been reached whereby residents on either side of the frontier who hold special passes issued jointly by the Irish and UK customs will be allowed to use <Col N="1872" /> the road for the conveyance of certain categories of goods.

      <P>While the increase in the price of butter can be attributed to the increase in the price of milk arising from the EEC farm prices agreement (including Green £ adjustment) which came into effect on 22 May, the increases in the case of bread and cheese arise from other factors, namely, higher wages and other processing costs.  The extra subsidy that would be needed to offset the announced increase in the price of butter is estimated at £2.4 million for the remainder of 1978.

      <P>Where I have the power to appoint members to the board of a semi-State body I take into account, in making such appointments, the range of experience and general suitability of the appointees, as well as the desirability of ensuring a reasonable rotation of directors.</P>
      <P>Apart from my assurance that, in relation to the appointment to which the question relate, I had regard to those criteria, Deputies will appreciate that it would be invidious of me to comment on any particular appointment to the board of a semi-State body.</P>

He also served approximately ten years as a director of the company.  He has excellent experience and would appear to be ideally suitable.  At the annual general meeting, the general manager of the company praised this person the Minister sacked for his unique and valuable contribution to this company.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I did not sack the person in question.  I appointed that person to this board originally when he was an executive of the company.  His term of office had expired and I did not renew it.  In no way could my failure to renew that appointment be regarded as a reflection on the individual involved. The circumstances are now different from those in which he was appointed by me.  I would suggest to the House <Col N="1879" /> that the general proposition that if somebody is appointed to a State board he then has some kind of right or entitlement to perpetual renewal of his appointment in the absence of his proving to be unsatisfactory could not be accepted.  I think it would be generally agreed that there ought to be some rotation on boards of State companies and, in this case, some contribution towards rotation was being made by the non-reappointment of the person in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: By implication in the question the only apparent unsuitability of the person is that he is a Fianna Fáil man.  I am afraid I cannot <Col N="1880" /> accept that somebody who is otherwise well qualified should be debarred because he is a Fianna Fáil man.  In view of the fact that the question was raised, I must add that even in relation to the board in question quite a number of appointments were made by the previous Government.  It is fair to say the person I propose to appoint is at least as well qualified as any of them and a number of them are prominently associated with the Coalition parties.  In that context I should remind the House that, during the period after the election and before the change of Government, well over 100 appointments, in the main, to boards in every vacancy they could create or think up.  This was done by a Government who had been defeated by the people.  If there is to be any question of raising the political affiliations of appointees of this kind, I do not think any Deputy over there can afford to open his mouth.</P>

This exemption applies also for corporation tax purposes.  The provisions seem to give adequate recognition to sporting organisations. There is no apparent need for amend-ment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the small allowances received by the veterans of the War of Independence are subject to income tax; if so, if he will review the position, in view of the meagre amounts <Col N="1882" /> at stake, and the very limited numbers of veterans in receipt of these allowances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: In general pensions and allowances are treated as income for tax purposes but it is only where a person's total income exceeds the total of his or her personal allowances and reliefs that liability to income tax arises.  In this connection the increases this year in the personal allowances including age allowance are relevant.</P>
      <P>In the cases of those veterans of the war of independence to whom special allowances are payable, it is likely that in most cases there will be little or no liability to tax.</P>
      <P>Legislation enacted in 1976 extended the PAYE system of tax assessment and collection to public service classes and other categories including holders of military service pensions and special allowances. Because of practical administrative difficulties, it was not possible to apply the change in relation to military service pensioners until this year.  The change has had the result that, in some cases, tax has been deducted provisionally from military service pensions and special allowances. Where refunds are appropriate&mdash;as is likely to be the case in relation to any holders of special allowances who may have been affected&mdash;such refunds will be made very soon.</P>
      <P>The change in tax procedures in relation to holders of military service pensions and allowances came to my notice only very recently.  At my request, the Revenue Commissioners are making suitable adjustments to their procedures in these cases so as to obviate any concern or upset.</P>

      <P>: Are the Government prepared to give time, either of the time allocated now or additional time, for the purpose of passing the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1978, in the name of Deputy Eileen Desmond?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Government do not propose to give time during this session because of the very wide implications and possible repercussions generally if the Bill in its present form happened to be enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept that the Taoiseach and the Government have reservations that I do not share about certain aspects of the Bill.  It is generally accepted that the part dealing with the validity of existing adoption orders <Col N="1915" /> made by the Adoption Board, according to opinion of senior counsel, seems to be of a doubtful nature, and that extreme mental anguish is caused to many thousands of adoptive parents in relation to this doubt which hangs over the orders.  Will the Government, without prejudice to us pursuing at a future date the other aspects of the Bill which we regard as of extreme importance, be prepared to accept the portion of the Bill which deals with adoption orders and make time available for it to be passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy Cluskey approached me about this and we discussed it reasonably and responsibily together.  I indicated the Government's general objections.  I certainly share Deputy Cluskey's concern for adoptive parents and that concern is shared by the Government.  I assure the Deputy that we are very conscious of the need to relieve the anxiety of adoptive parents in this respect as soon as possible. The Minister for Justice, who is immediately responsible had a number of meetings with the representatives of the adoptive parents, the last one being not later than about 10 days ago, and indicated to the delegation from the adoptive parents group the Government's concern and gave them assurances as to the Government's interest and willingness to do whatever is necessary.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, they made it clear in a public statement that they were satisfied with the assurances given by the Minister.  It is not appropriate at this stage for me to comment in any detail on the Labour Party's Bill but initial examination of it suggests that it is probably inadequate to secure even what appears to be its main objective while on the other hand some of its proposals could have repercussions far beyond what I assume the sponsors intend.  I need only refer to the suggestion of deleting certain words in Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution. Article 41.1.1º of the Constitution says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable <Col N="1916" /> and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the Bill seeks to delete the words &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible&rdquo; from the Constitution. Even a very superficial examination indicates that that could have very serious repercussions.  There is also a suggestion of dealing similarly with the &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; right of the family in Article 42.1.  As I have indicated there could be far more serious repercussions arising which could not be contemplated now if we were to adopt the Bill in its present form.  It is better to await the examination by the Government and by the legal advisers to the Government which is being conducted as expeditiously as possible.  I hope that in the early future the matter can be resolved to the satisfaction of the adoptive parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are fully conscious of the family unit as the basis of our society but when the Taoiseach quotes the Constitution in relation to the family is he aware that there was a recent court judgment which does not define, for instance, an unmarried mother and her child as a family unit under the Constitution and that the Constitution as interpreted by the courts has indeed a very conventional and narrow concept of the family unit? The opinion placing in doubt the validity of the adoption orders dating back from 1953 to 1976 and those which have been made since, was given in March 1977.  Have the Government any draft legislation with a view to correcting that situation in relation to adoptive orders?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Taoiseach has raised issues, the interpretation of which I do not agree with.  This matter should not be a matter of party politics and I am anxious as is the Taoiseach, I believe, from the private conversation <Col N="1917" /> I had with him, that this should not be a matter of party politics.  If the Government wish to introduce a Bill confined solely to the question of the adoption orders at this stage we will facilitate its passage through the Dáil before the recess.  Any reasonable person will accept that, as the Dáil is going into recess until October sometime, the anxiety and mental torture of many thousands of adoptive parents, due to the uncertainty that has been raised regarding the validity of the adoptive orders since 1953, should be relieved immediately.  I know that in order to do so it would be necessary to have a constitutional amendment requiring a referendum, but if the Dáil unanimously passed a Bill which called for an amendment of the Constitution and was to make provision for a referendum to be held, it would strengthen the court in any actions that may be brought before them in this area.  It would also give considerable relief to the large number of people placed in this intolerable position, where they have in their custody as their own over a long period of years, children who may be claimed back through the courts because of the uncertainty of the orders made since 1953.  We will withdraw our Bill if the Taoiseach is prepared to submit a Bill in the Government's name that deals only with that aspect of the adoption orders.  We will pursue the other aspects of the Bill that the Taoiseach does not agree with at a future date.</P>

      <P>: I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I am merely saying that that is one of the matters that requires very close consideration.  I have consulted with the Attorney General about doing something quickly.  What the Deputy has just suggested&mdash;the <Col N="1918" /> validation of adoption orders&mdash;is one such matter that I discussed with him.  Having fully in mind the anxiety that adoptive parents have I can only say to Deputy Cluskey that even that limited assurance, which would remove anxiety, is not a very simple matter either and requires very detailed consultations and preparation for the purpose of legislation, if that is decided.  I can assure the Deputy that we are proceeding with all possible expedition and haste and with full appreciation of the difficulties and anxieties to which he referred.  I could not undertake to introduce a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I know the House has to get through a lot of Estimates.  I do not want to hold up the House unduly but there are a couple of matters I want to put in the Taoiseach's presence which arise fairly under his Estimate and which I will not have another opportunity of putting to him.  One of them concerns the functioning of the Government Information Services. The other concerns a matter which falls at least partly within the sphere of operations of the Attorney General. I want to protest&mdash;I agree it is not a very serious matter and I am not trying to inflate it into something more important than it is&mdash;against the practice I have observed here over the year whereby questions addressed to office-holders are if possible, shovelled onto their colleagues.  I am afraid I have to say that the Taoiseach himself has been as much an offender in this regard as anybody else or else it was his advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put to the Taoiseach about six weeks ago a question of relatively trivial importance&mdash;I could not put it any higher than that&mdash;concerning the propriety of the Government Information Services issuing on formal paper&mdash; in other words as an official communication&mdash;a speech made by the Minister for the Environment at some <Col N="1924" /> sort of function in his own county which was of a plainly party political content.</P>
    <P>Under the last Government a clear definition was maintained&mdash;or, at any rate, an attempt was made to maintain it, and I do not recall it ever being breached&mdash;whereby office holders who wished to put out political statements got the facilities of the Government Information Services but on plain paper and marked &ldquo;As requested&rdquo;.  In other words, the thing ostensibly, as far as the naked eye could see, had been issued by the responsible Ministers themselves.  Statements with a party political content were not issued by the Government Information Services officially.</P>
    <P>For the third time, this was quite a trivial matter but the office holder responsible was the Taoiseach himself because the Government Information Services comes under his aegis and that question was shoved on to the Minister for the Environment who has no responsibility for the Government Information Services.  It was he, or one of his script writers, who wrote the speech but the responsibility, which I was seeking to explore, rested with the Taoiseach for the issuing of this highly contentious party political statement under an official guise.  I do not want to inflate this out of proportion.  It is a trivial matter but I have to assert that issue of principle in regard to the functioning of the office.</P>
    <P>The second thing I want to say is that the office is being used far too much by this Government&mdash;I must confess I did not naturally track the behaviour of the last Government with the same jealous eye as I do this one&mdash; for the purpose of putting out what are naked constituency statements of purely constituency interest to the office holder concerned.  I could produce many examples but this is not the time to do it.  One will suffice, and I regret having to mention this Minister twice without giving him any notice or without his being here&mdash;I have nothing in the world against the Minister for Defence; it is an accident that this is the first script I pulled out of my files&mdash;but this is a speech he made which was issued by the Government <Col N="1925" /> Information Services, with blue and green print and an embossed harp, at the opening of a show house for the O'Malley Construction Company Limited at Castlelawn House, Headford Road, Galway on 17 April at 5 p.m.</P>
    <P>No. 1, this has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with his function as Minister for Defence.  No. 2, the location of it tells me, and tells anybody, that this piece of advertisement for this company, this piece of back slapping, is simply a piece of constituency log rolling and I say it is wrong to use the Government Information Services for the purpose of putting out a statement like this.  There is, I admit, nothing objectionable in it.  I could not judge the housing situation in Galway. I have no fault to find with the content but the Minister is Minister for Defence and he has no business using his official position, which gives him access to the Government Information Services, to issue what are essentially constituency boosts for himself via this service.</P>
    <P>I will leave that topic.  I hope the Taoiseach has got the point.  In a more specific way, I want to say I was disappointed at the response given the other day by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to a question I tabled, but which I was not here to pursue because I was abroad, in regard to the progress of a matter which is equally under the aegis of the Attorney General as it is under the aegis of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I wanted to know&mdash;it was not the first time I inquired&mdash;what was the reason for the delay in the arbitration of our dispute with the British in regard to the Continental Shelf.  The reply the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave&mdash;a very short reply&mdash;was in essence that the nature of the arbitral tribunal to adjudicate the issue was an important one requiring careful consideration of a host of varying factors.  Now that answer would be unexceptional were it not for the fact that in May of last year, to my own knowledge, the tribunal which was going to arbitrate this matter was agreed between the two sides.  I frankly cannot recall whether or not it was at that moment still a matter of <Col N="1926" /> confidentiality but, in case it was, I will not say what it was, but I recall the tribunal was agreed during my brief term of office as Attorney General, if not before that because I was concerned with it also as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I am very unhappy at the delay of over a year which has taken place. from my own personal experience.  I am inclined to believe&mdash;I am guessing because I have no evidence other than past experience&mdash;that it may very well be the British who are to blame because I recall that they dragged their feet for a very long time in regard to the issue of arbitration, in the first instance, and we had to take some fairly drastic steps on paper at least to push them into agreeing finally.  I think it is a bad thing that there should be this delay of a year because the present juncture&mdash;this is only my view; the Taoiseach may be otherwise advised&mdash;is peculiarly favourable for pressing ahead with this claim.  The position is far, far stronger because the decision in a recent arbitration between the British and another state established&mdash;I will not say principles&mdash;but certainly the decision was reached on the application of principles which would be peculiarly favourable to us were we to press ahead with this arbitration.  I cannot be sure but that in another 12 months' time some other arbitral findings will disturb the somewhat uncertain pattern of international practice in this regard and we may not get such a favourable chance again.  I would like to know in terms more specific than the Minister for Foreign Affairs used last week what the reason is for this delay.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will not be able to tell me off the top of his head and I will understand if he cannot but I would like to know the reason, whether anyone on our side is to blame and, if not, whether the Taoiseach will take a personal interest in pushing this thing ahead to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In relation to his own Department, why are there two separate subheads in regard to what would seem to be the same general activity of information on public relations services?  On page 7 of the Book of Estimates under subhead D there is a sum of £6,000, the same figure as that in 1977.  In the details this is marked down as publicity, bulletins, booklets and so on whereas, under subhead A, there is an allocation of £75,700 for the Government Information Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: In reply to Deputy Kelly, a great many Deputies try to exploit&mdash;I am not making any allegation against Deputy Kelly in this respect&mdash;the fact that the Taoiseach is first on the Order Paper for answering questions on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and many questions are submitted to the Taoiseach in his capacity as Taoiseach which are clearly relevant to other Ministers' Departments. It is a very big extension of the Taoiseach's responsibilities, or alleged responsibilities, to try to make him responsible for every aspect of administration in the total concept of Government. The questions that are transferred from the Taoiseach's Department to the appropriate Ministers are questions obviously for those Ministers. That fact should be well known, and is well known, to the Members who submit these questions.  Because of the system that has resulted in long delay in reaching certain Ministers' parliamentary questions, depending on the order of seniority of these Ministers, the tendency has been to submit questions to the Taoiseach, in the first instance, in the hope that they would be answered quickly.  If that were the case and it were permitted to continue, <Col N="1928" /> the Taoiseach would be on his feet all day every day during Question Time.</P>
      <P>In relation to the particular question referred to by the Deputy, it appeared to my officials that it was a matter for the Minister for the Environment; and they consulted with the Ceann Comhairle's advisers, as they do in all cases on these matters, before the question was transferred.  As to the subject matter of the document to which the Deputy referred, that is a speech issued on the paper of the Government Information Services.  I do not know the full context of the speech but I should imagine there was matter in it which was appropriate to the Minister's Department.  Therefore, apart altogether from its alleged political content, there must have been&mdash; and here I am open to correction&mdash; matter in it which it would be appropriate for the Government Information Services to disseminate on behalf of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested that the Government Information Services should not issue a statement on behalf of a Minister on what he regards as a trivial matter because the Minister could have had that speech printed on his own departmental notepaper and published generally.  As far as I know, departmental notepaper is a better quality and therefore more expensive notepaper than the Government Information Services notepaper.  In the long run perhaps there is a saving to the public service and to the Exchequer in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: What the Deputy says is very trivial and I do not think he should pursue it to any great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the rival claims to the sea around Rockall, I can answer the Deputy's question off the top of my head because I try to keep in touch with important matters.  A decision was taken by the Deputy's administration to submit the solution of that problem to a tribunal and there <Col N="1929" /> was tentative agreement on the form of tribunal.  Since then the position has changed and it has been suggested that a different kind of tribunal would be more appropriate.  That matter is being pursued at present with the British authorities and I believe an acceptable form of tribunal will be agreed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan queried £75,000 on subhead A for salaries.  That is clearly for the Government Information Services. I understand that Miscellaneous Expenses&mdash;booklets, brochures and so on&mdash;are met from subhead D&mdash;£6,000. I do not see the distinction very clearly, but that is the explanation I have been given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: As the Minister and his Government have now been in office for almost one year, it is perhaps appropriate to examine the activities of the Department of Health during that period.  Unfortunately, the rather unsatisfactory way in which we are asked to see through a myriad of Estimates in a very restricted period of time leaves me in the position that I would almost prefer not to have to speak in this restricted way.  There are a few comments which are appropriate, in view of the parliamentary discussions which took place during the year and of the activities of the Department.</P>
      <P>It would be fair to say that the occupant of the office of Minister of Health took up duty with a fanfare of publicity and has continued in that office with a constant veneer of publicity.  However, there comes a day when the review bodies, the consultations, the investigations, the working parties and the considerations have to stop.  There comes a time when the reviews have to be reviewed, the consultations finished, the investigations concluded, the working parties make a report and the considerations are considered.  In the last 12 months I do not recall a single area where the Minister in a reply in this House has ever been able to say that any investigation, consultation or consideration had been concluded or that any working party had actually reported and that something had been done on foot of that report.  After a year in office I think we should suggest that, instead of working parties, the Minister should set up a search party to go out and find some of these people who have been very magnanimously taking the burden of decision-making from the Minister and allowing him the full range of his considerable talent for garnering publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair for us to ask now what has this Minister, who came in so full of <Col N="1931" /> promise, actually delivered.  At the end of Question Time today he ventured to suggest that in the course of this year we have seen the commencement of Beaumont Hospital, the commencement of Tralee Hospital, and the commencement of an extension for the Mater Hospital.  He also suggested the commencement of Cavan Hospital, but Deputy Fitzpatrick dealt adequately enough with that to show it was not valid.  I repeat that not a single project was initiated by this Minister or by this Government.  The single item that stands to the credit of the Minister is that he advanced the plans for the commencement of the building of Beaumont hospital, a hospital that had been decided on by his predecessor. The site had been decided on and the plans were well advanced before the Minister took office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The site had not been bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: Indeed, the Minister by his action delayed the plans for Cavan hospital because he transferred to Beaumont the team of design consultants appointed to Cavan.  This meant that another team of consultants had to be appointed for Cavan Hospital thereby retarding the hospital's progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in full agreement with the decision which has meant that the physical building of Beaumont is now under way but it is proper that one should express a certain amount of caution and that the Minister would heed that caution.  It is said often in hospital-building circles that every hospital is obsolete on the day it opens, that this is due to the length of time taken from conception to completion because by the time of completion there are already far more modern, more advanced and more sophisticated ideas on the drawing boards of hospital architects throughout the world.  In that context it is fair to express a degree of caution regarding the taking of plans for a hospital at Wilton which were conceived about 10 years ago and using them as the basis, almost as the entire blue print, for the building of a hospital at Beaumont, especially when <Col N="1932" /> one bears in mind that the architect for the hospital at Wilton was employed specifically, because at the time he had just completed work on a hospital in Scotland and it was considered that his designs for the hospital there, which was of a size similar to the one at Wilton, could help in advancing the building of Wilton hospital. The idea for that hospital in Scotland was conceived about 1950.  If we trace back the plans for Beaumont we find that the idea for it as it is now being built physically emerged somewhere in Scotland almost 30 years ago.  Although we are told that modern hospitals are obsolete on the day they are opened, here we have a hospital that is not simply a copy but a second-hand copy of another hospital.  There should be an examination of the different design areas at Beaumont to ensure that in so far as possible the more modern ideas are incorporated during the building process.  On another occasion I endeavoured to put forward that suggestion in the House but the Minister did not appear to be receptive to what I was saying.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints and criticisms from some professional people engaged in the field of medicine regarding the lay-out and the provision of facilities at Wilton.  When I suggested to the Minister that he should pay attention to that situation his reply was that it is not always he believes what he reads in the press. That is not good enough.  If professional people&mdash;theatre sisters and others&mdash;engaged in the work of ministering to the sick point to a lack of facilities or to bad design in relation to their hospitals, it is hardly fair to say: &ldquo;I do not believe it so I shall not do anything in that regard in respect of a replica hospital being built in Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While accepting that the Minister has seen begun under his aegis, but not by way of his initiation, those hospitals that he mentioned today during Question Time, is it not fair to ask him what has happened to those hospitals he mentioned so frequently a little more than a year ago?  What about, for instance, Roscommon, Tullamore and Monaghan hospitals from which the <Col N="1933" /> Minister enjoyed considerable political mileage and acclamation, translated into votes, presumably, because of his promise that they would not be downgraded, that he would ensure that not only would they be continued at their then levels but that they would be upgraded? There has been a marked lack of verbosity from the Minister in relation to Tullamore hospital since he came to office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: If so, will an obstetrician-gynaecologist be provided at Roscommon to allow the maternity unit there to operate satisfactorily?  If there is no problem in regard to Tullamore Hospital perhaps the Minister will confirm that it is intended to appoint an obstetrician-gynacologist both at Portlaoise and at Tullamore <Col N="1934" /> and also a paediatrician bearing in mind what the profession have said, that is, that two obstetricians must be appointed to each of these hospitals if the maternity units are to continue to be serviced after three years from now.</P>
      <P>The people of those two areas should be delighted to hear that sufficient qualified staff are to be appointed.  The local health board, too, should be very pleased with the news. The only ones who may not be pleased are Comhairle na nOspidéal who during the past couple of months have informed the health board that they would not allow those two units to continue and who invited the health board to make the unpalatable choice as to where the single maternity unit should be.  That is not the business of the health board who had asked that the units be continued at each hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that the Minister will be glad that I offered to speak on this Estimate, thereby providing him with the opportunity of giving a clear and categorical assurance that he intends seeing Tullamore and Portlaoise hospitals upgraded.  He may avail of the opportunity of replying to give a categorical assurance, too, that Monaghan hospital will be upgraded. I am not inviting the Minister to do anything he did not promise a year ago or even 18 months ago.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree but the time involved in regard to these hospitals extends back for more than two years when they were made political footballs of and tossed around like corks on the sea, not only by the Minister but by the Taoiseach and by their local parliamentary colleagues in the constituencies concerned.  I have visited those areas and have spoken with the people who believed the promises would be fulfilled and I am inviting the Minister now to reassure them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An undertaking in the Fianna Fáil manifesto was that in government Fianna Fáil would see the setting up of an all-party committee on health matters.  I was out of the country last week on public business and shortly before I left, after the Minister being a year in office, I was contacted to know when would be a suitable date for holding the first meeting of that committee. A few months ago, when I tried to find out when the all-party committee were to meet, the Ceann Comhairle ruled my question out of order because this all-party committee was not a Committee of the House.  I did not understand that this proposed all-party committee was not to have responsibility to the House, was not to deliver reports to the House and was not to be involved in the discussion of health matters on behalf of the House.  One would have thought from the Minister's contribution to the Supplementary <Col N="1936" /> Estimate of the Department of Health on 8 December last that this all-party committee would have a great deal of importance.  I ask the Minister to listen to his own words very carefully. He said at column 1065, Volume 302, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The committee of the House will be set up very shortly and I look forward to them performing a very useful and important role in the administration of the health services.</P>
    <P>We have since elucidated that the committee will not be a committee of the House.  The committee was not set up very shortly after 8 December last.  The first attempt to set this committee up was a fortnight ago.  I suggested that it should meet this week but I have heard nothing since.</P>
    <P>Early on in his occupation of the office of Minister for Health the Minister promised us a major review of the Mental Health Act and said that it was urgent that there should be a nucleus of legislation in this field.  We have not seen it.  In Private Members' Time during the last few months we have discussed various issues, including the dental services.  Apart from the appointment of a dental adviser we have not heard a single commitment or decision on the Minister's part towards the improvement of the dental services which we made very clear were inadequate.  During Question Time over the past year a number of Deputies have outlined the lack of services for the physically and mentally handicapped.  Nothing has been done to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The item which has possibly drawn the most attention here is the income limit for eligibility for health services for non-manual workers, which still stands at £3,000 a year.  The Minister in this field at least has made a definite decision.  He is resolutely against extending that income limit and has used the excuse that he hopes to introduce next April a pay-related insurance scheme for health services.  Quite apart from the inequity to those noneligible people being deprived of health services, which continue to be costly and for which the Minister recently sanctioned an increase of 20 <Col N="1937" /> per cent, he has not outlined the method by which he intends to introduce this pay-related insurance scheme. We have been given no indication of the burden which will fall on the employer and the employee and what share the State expects to take up as the remainder.</P>
    <P>The social welfare insurance stamp now pays for over 80 per cent of all social welfare benefits paid as opposed to social assistance payments.  The total amount brought in by the health stamp at the moment is approximately £16 million and the entire health services are over £380 million.  When one bears in mind the areas of the health field of that £380 million that will not be covered by the insurance contributors there will obviously be a gigantic shortfall between the existing revenue from the health contribution stamp and the revenue the Government would like to see if a national pay-related health insurance stamp is introduced.  This issue causes considerable worry to many people because the Government have given no indication of what burden they expect either the employer or the contributor to bear in the insurance stamp.  It is now time for us to hear how it is intended that this scheme will be implemented and the percentage the ordinary individual will have to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I must remind the Deputy that we have 40 other votes to get through.  I cannot stop him even if I wished to do so.  If I remind him that we have 40 votes to get through, many of which are very important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: I am quite sure the Chair has no wish to stop me.  I am about to finish my remarks.  I believe, after reading the Green Paper issued a fortnight ago, that we have hard times ahead, particularly for everybody who will be asked to become involved in this health insurance field.  It is better if the harsh realities are outlined to them now.  When I spoke on the Supplementary Estimate last December&mdash;I would like to repeat it now&mdash;I referred to what was said when the eight health boards were set up following the advice of McKinsey in 1970. <Col N="1938" /> He recommended that after five years in operation the structure and achievement of those health boards should be reviewed.  The health boards have now been eight years in operation and no review has been carried out.  Even though I dislike review bodies and working parties, which remove the responsibility of decision-making, I believe that a review of the effectiveness of the health boards and the level of services they are providing should have been carried out, as was recommended by the initiators of the revised health boards scheme.  I invite the Minister, even now, to consider introducing that.  The situation with the Department of Health, as has so often been the case with that Department, is that they have sailed gaily along in their own relentless way while the helmsman was being photographed on the quayside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the general question of hospital building, on the one hand Deputy Boland castigates me for setting up working parties and says it is an excuse for not making decisions. On the other hand, when I do something positive in the form of getting Beaumont Hospital under way quickly, he advises caution.  I should be grateful if Deputy Boland would make up his mind and indicate precisely what role he thinks I should be following.  If he wants me to be cautious and not get on with doing things then let him say so.</P>
      <P>The activities of the Department of Health are at a record level.  We have a nationwide programme of hospital building under way.  This programme is being pursued as rapidly as possible and it will go a long way towards meeting the needs of the people for a modern hospital structure for the foreseeable future.  As I mentioned, Tralee is under way and I hope Wilton will be commissioned this year.  A major redevelopment of the Matter is under way.  St. James's Hospital and Beaumont are under way.  We are proceeding as rapidly as possible with the planning of Cavan Hospital and I hope to be able to make an important announcement about it soon.  Letterkenny and Sligo are also in the pipeline. All over the country there is a massive building campaign of hospitals under way.  Even from the prejudiced point of view of Deputy Boland, he has no case to make in regard to hospital building.  The same applies in regard to every conceivable health facility.  Health centres, homes for the mentally handicapped, sheltered work shops and a range of health facilities are being pushed ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deeply resent Deputy Boland saying that nothing is being done in the mentally handicapped area because that area is receiving full-time attention from me; indeed, I am very proud of what we are doing this year.  It is misleading, false and prejudiced of Deputy Boland to suggest that nothing is being done in the mentally handicapped area.  We have a building programme of £17½ million under way to try to make up for the neglect of previous years in so far as the provision <Col N="1940" /> of places for the adult mentally handicapped is concerned.  Furthermore, as most Deputies who take an interest in these matters know, we have improved the allowance for families who keep their mentally handicapped children at home.  I have also announced that we intend to provide a support service for families who wish to keep their children at home or who are waiting for a place.  These are positive improvements in the area of mental handicap.  If what Deputy Boland says in this regard was allowed to go unanswered, many people could be upset.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with what Deputy Boland said about the all-party committee.  That committee is under way.  I cannot understand why Deputy Boland says he has heard nothing about it because all the members were notified last Friday that there would be a meeting this Thursday.  Furthermore, every possible attempt was made by me and my staff to make sure that Deputy Boland was kept informed and I made every attempt to facilitate Deputy Boland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: I pointed out that I was away last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The meeting that was to be held last week was postponed for that reason.  I went to great trouble to find out what Deputy Boland's convenience was in regard to the setting up of the committee.  It is unfair and mean of him to say these things in the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland also referred to the Mental Health Bill.  The preparation of this Bill, which is a complex piece of legislation because it deals with a difficult and sensitive area, took longer than I anticipated primarily because various people had to be consulted about it.  The consultation process took longer than I anticipated.  I now have the legislation in outline and I shall soon be putting proposals for the legislation to the Government.  I am quite confident that the legislation will be circulated during the summer recess and that we will be able to take it in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> On the question of the hospitals, Deputy Boland need not be unduly excited about them and he will not be in a position to make capital out of them.  The manner in which hospital development is dealt with at all levels is a cause of worry and concern.  There are a number of people who take attitudes about this matter and who indulge in activities in regard to it who seem to be unconcerned with the health of the people, not concerned with getting the best service for the people.  In certain areas there is an undue preoccupation which nearly amounts to an obsession with the status of hospitals, not with the service and facilities being provided for the people, not with getting the best structure, but simply with the status of local hospitals.  It becomes acute at certain times and in certain places. All I am concerned with is endeavouring to ensure that people get the best possible service, having regard to the resources available to us.  There is no problem in regard to Tullamore and Monaghan.  I have indicated that these hospitals are to be retained as county hospitals and that they are to be developed to the extent that is needed to service the people in these areas.  I have asked Comhairle na nOspidéal, and they have agreed, to provide the level of staffing necessary in both hospitals to satisfy the needs of their areas.  In spite of Deputy Boland's suggestion, there are no problems in regard to them.</P>
    <P>As some Deputies who have studied this area know, there is frequently a conflict between the best medical answer and the best social answer. Sometimes these two conflicting pressures have to be reconciled.  I am sure there is not great satisfaction for Deputy Boland to talk about the Roscommon situation.  I said there is a problem in regard to the Roscommon situation.  The federation arrangements will come into operation on 1 July for a trial period.  All the problems involved have been settled and the federation arrangements will come into operation on 1 July with the proviso that the situation in regard to the maternity unit is still unsettled.  Not everybody is thinking clearly in regard to this situation.  The one thing that <Col N="1942" /> people should keep in mind in regard to maternity units is that we will never get to grips with the problem of eliminating mental handicap until we have proper maternity units.  Anybody who becomes emotional about keeping a maternity unit in a particular area should bear that in mind.  The onus of responsibility is on them if they insist that a maternity unit should be kept in a particular location when we know that the proper level of service cannot be provided in that place.  It is not just a question of providing a service for the mother.  Lurking behind the problem is the deadly question of mental handicap.  If we do not make the right decision in regard to maternity units we can have an avoidable level of mental handicap.  That is all I have to say on that.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to the maternity unit at Roscommon hospital is not yet resolved.  I am endeavouring to resolve it but on one hand Comhairle na nOspidéal have taken a very strong stand and on the other, the Western Health Board have taken a different stand.  If Deputy Boland can derive any satisfaction from the fact that these two major bodies, both pursuing the best interests of the people as they see them, take a different view of what should be done in Roscommon hospital in regard to maternity services, he is welcome to it.  However, I shall try to resolve the situation as satisfactorily as possible.  I have not done so yet but I shall continue trying. The rest of the situation has been resolved and the federation arrangements will come into operation as I said for a trial period.  I hope they will work out satisfactorily and if they do not, we shall come up with some other proposal or suggestion for the benefit of the people of those areas.</P>
    <P>In general&mdash;I appreciate there is a time problem and I do not want to take up too much time&mdash;I think impartial observers would acknowledge that in most areas of the Department of Health since I assumed responsibility for it there has been progress, that considerable developments have been undertaken and whereas all the things we might desire for our health services have not yet been achieved, <Col N="1943" /> nevertheless, in most areas if anybody asked me a question about any particular area I think I can point to either something having been achieved or at least having been undertaken.  On that, my case rests.</P>

      <P>Because of time constraints I am not able to give the House a detailed progress report of the various activities comprehended by my Department but I shall endeavour in reply to the debate to deal with any particular points Deputies may wish to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have no wish to delay the House unduly but I must avail of the opportunity presented by this most unsatisfactory method of dealing with a large number of annual Estimates in such a short space of time.  I should like to ask the Minister for information on four main points. What progress, if any, has been made towards evolving a national transportation study and has the Minister decided to proceed with the formation of what was described in the election manifesto as a national transport council, body or authority?  The Minister will agree that it is recognised by <Col N="1946" /> everybody concerned in the transport industry that there is urgent need for rationalisation of our national transport services and for the formulation and implementation of a cohesive, integrated national transportation strategy.  The Minister, through his party's manifesto, did indicate that they were thinking on those lines and there was a definite commitment given to set up a national transport council or body.  What progress has been made in this regard?</P>
      <P>My second point is one that is causing great concern and has been the subject of much public comment in the news media and has been raised at Question Time in this House.  I refer the Minister to the comprehensive rail plan submitted to him by CIE on 1 January this year.  Some weeks ago, in the Minister's absence, his Minister of State, Deputy Fitzpatrick, had questions from me and other Deputies in regard to what has happened to CIE's rail proposal.  It is a matter of great urgency because this proposal of CIE could be described as a two point programme, one relating to the electrification and modernisation of Dublin suburban rail services and the other to the modernisation and replacement of rolling stock at present rapidly becoming worn out and antiquated.  I understand that during the recent Whit weekend CIE were unable to provide the normal suburban rail services because rolling stock had to be made available for the holiday rush to the provinces and the seaside.</P>
      <P>The situation is very serious.  The Government have had the proposal for the past six months.  The Minister of State recently pointed out here that it had to be submitted to other Government Departments and so on.  There is great concern about this proposal. Could the Minister let the House know whether a decision is imminent and can CIE be assured of the necessary finance to proceed with this urgently needed rail modernisation programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the Minister's responsibilities as he is now Minister for Tourism and Transport.  I very much favour the identification of tourism with the Department of State. <Col N="1947" /> There is general agreement with that.  I should like to know from the Minister how the tourist industry is faring this year and what are the prospects. Secondly, and most important, will the Minister state whether he has taken any new initiative in relation to the development and promotion of tourism, to the development of accommodation in reports and so on?</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like some indication from the Minister with regard to what is happening in relation to EEC policy in the whole area of transport. Has any progress been made towards including two systems of transport that hitherto have not been the subject of any consideration by the EEC but which are of vital importance to this country, namely, aviation and sea transport.  I should be glad if the Minister would throw some light on those questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>: My point relates to a local matter that is of interest to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and to my colleague, Deputy D'Arcy.  Although we have not got a guarantee, I trust that a token Estimate for all Departments will be introduced in the autumn so that we may discuss the activities of the Departments.</P>
      <P>Secondly, perhaps the Minister or his officials may have some information regarding the development of Rosslare Harbour.  I realise the Minister may not have that information now but there was a promise that work would commence in September.  Is that still the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>: In relation to Deputy Corish's point regarding a general debate on the Estimates, as the Minister for Health and Social Welfare pointed out, it is not strictly a matter for me. However, I am sure that if he consults with the whips it might be possible to come to some arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of a transport commission.  I have advanced quite considerably in relation to the formation of a transport consultative commission, as was referred to in the manifesto.  The Deputy will appreciate that we had to consult with quite a number of Departments <Col N="1948" /> who have an interest in this area.  I have got their views and I hope in a reasonably short time to announce the type of commission we propose to set up.  I hope that is a satisfactory answer so far as the Deputy is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the CIE proposals, at the outset I wish to refute certain newspaper reports that arose out of the publication of the Green Paper, that the Government have decided not to go ahead with capital investment in railways, with particular reference to the Dublin suburban system.  That is not the case.  The Government have not yet made a decision on this matter. The position is that CIE have put forward proposals for electrification of the Howth-Bray line and they are being examined by my Department in consultation with other interested Departments. The Deputy was informed recently by the Minister of State in reply to supplementary questions that this was the position.  He will appreciate that the proposals would cost quite a considerable amount of money and it is understandable that it would take some time to come to a decision on the matter.  I am awaiting replies from the Departments that are most involved.</P>
    <P>As the Dublin Transportation Study and the 1971 McKinsey Report on CIE recognised, the suburban railway plays a very important role in transport arrangements for the greater Dublin area and this fact has been recognised fully by the Government.  As I said a moment ago, in a situation when substantial additional capital investment will have to be incurred in any event in replacing rolling stock and signalling of the suburban system in the next few years, I think it will be agreed that it is necessary to examine in some depth the options ranging from electrifying the railway, as recommended by CIE, to maintaining the service as it is or making a variety of changes.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that where there are many complex issues, as there are in this instance, all of them have to be considered before a final decision is taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism, Deputy O'Donnell will be pleased to know that <Col N="1949" /> there has been an upsurge this year. The Government, as I mentioned on a number of occasions, are taking a special interest in tourism.  The fact that the name of the Department includes the word &ldquo;Tourism&rdquo; signifies the importance the Government attach to this matter and to the job possibilities available through tourism. This year we have increased the allocation to Bord Failte by 12½ per cent. As the Deputy is probably aware, the NESC are examining our tourism potential in order to give us a further idea of the road we should follow.  The tourism situation has improved considerably and we look forward to an increase in the number of visitors this year and, as a result of this, to the number of jobs that will be created.</P>
    <P>This year quite a number of improvements have taken place.  For example, there has been the introduction of duty-free facilities on cross-Channel routes, the introduction of free depreciation for hotel investment, the approval of a major development plan for Rosslare Harbour and the approval of the B&amp;I proposal for a jet-foil service between Dublin and Liverpool.  Improvements have also been made in many other areas that will help considerably the situation with regard to the development of tourism.  I have asked Bord Failte to review the entire accommodation position, I expect to get a submission from them soon, and this will help me in considering how further development of the tourist industry can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The fourth question the Deputy asked related to EEC policy on transport. There was a recent meeting of Transport Ministers in Luxembourg which approved a programme for air transport.  This will be followed up by the Commission, and the Council of Ministers will be discussing aviation matters at further meetings.  The Council spent a considerable time on discussing marine matters such as the prevention of pollution at sea and the means to deal with these problems. There will be further discussions on these matters in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish had a query in relation to Rosslare Harbour.  The scheme <Col N="1950" /> is estimated to cost £3¼ million and to take three years to complete from next September, when CIE hope to be able to place the contract.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are two aspects of the Minister's responsibilities on which I should like to get some information.  The major issue in the past six or eight months has been the prolonged industrial dispute in the telecommunications section which left a huge backlog of out-of-order telephones and, of course, of applicants for new telephones and telex connections as well as a rapid increase in applications for computer data lines and so forth.  Time does not permit me to go into detail on these matters but I should be obliged if the Minister would inform the House what is happening in relation to the industrial relations situation in the Department. Are we right in hinting that the Minister has set up some kind of examining body to go into the whole industrial relations structure of the Department, with particular reference to the telecommunications sector?  The Dail is about to adjourn for three or four months and people have been asking me, and no doubt other Deputies, if we can be assured that during that period the telecommunications services will be available without interruption.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether within the current examination he is carrying out into the industrial relations situation he will include a feasibility study on the question of hiving off the telecommunications services to a semi-State body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> In relation to broadcasting, I should like to know if the Minister is aware that there is an enormous demand for local radio.  There is evidence of this in the growth of pirate radio stations. I do not know what is the thinking of the Minister and the Department in relation to this question.  He must realise that there is an enormous demand for local radio.  He has three options open to him.  One is that the Government would make adequate finances available to RTE to enable them to proceed with plans which I understand they have submitted to the Government for the provision of a local radio service under the control of RTE.  The Minister has been sitting on these submission for a long time.</P>
    <P>His second option is to set up an appropriate licensing arrangement to control the pirate stations.  Some such arrangements will have to be entered into.  RTE are unable to meet the demand for local radio in the major provincial centres.  I should like the Minister to indicate what are his proposals in this matter, particularly in relation to pirate stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will be brief.  I should like to ask the Minister what progress he has made in relation to the pirate radio situation, for the principal reason that his apparent delay in sorting out the problem is causing major headaches for the planners of future radio-TV services for which he is responsible.  I ask the Minister to indicate firmly to the House that he considers his primary role in this new development as being one of protecting, and extending where necessary, the role of public service broadcasting. The growth of the pirate radio stations, whatever about their legality and whatever about their licensing, has created a situation in which the whole concept of public service broadcasting has been called into question.  We look to the Minister to defend that concept and to extend it to ensure its maximum flexibility to meet this challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of points of detail in relation to the Estimate I should like to make two other comments to the Minister.  One is in relation to subhead <Col N="1952" /> L. 1, which is the grant for general purposes to RTE.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider transferring responsibility and authority for collecting licence fees directly to RTE.  The cost of collecting these licence fees in the Minister's Department is almost £1 million, according to the Book of Estimates, out of a total amount collected of some £14 million.  There is no indication in the Estimate of how this figure of £900,000 was arrived at.  Was it arrived at on an exact calculation of the time of the officers involved? Was it arrived at simply by thinking of a figure and doubling it? Whatever way it was arrived at, it seems to be extraordinarily high.  I have no doubt that RTE could do the job considerably more efficiently and more quickly.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make in relation to the detail of the Estimate is to ask the Minister why subhead A.1 includes a sum of £3,000 for legal and other expenses in connection with commissions and inquiries, whereas the cost of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission is included under subhead L.1 in the amounts which are actually deducted from the licence fees before they are transmitted to RTE. I should like the Minister's comments on those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have not a great deal of time this evening to go into any of these Estimates in any great detail.  It is a shame that we should put through the House an Estimate for over £150 million in such a short time.  However, this has been agreed, for whatever reasons.  I should like to draw to the Minister's attention a deplorable situation in County Dublin.  In many new housing estates residents have been in occupation of their houses for over two years and they are unable to obtain telephone connection.  A number of people who moved into my constituency have had to move out of it because they were unable to get telephones.  A local public kiosk would solve many problems if the Minister has difficulty in getting sufficient lines to connect whatever percentage of the residents of these estates have applied for telephones. Many residents are in dire need of telephone communication with doctors, <Col N="1953" /> or ambulances, or whatever services they need, or even to get in touch with their friends.</P>
      <P>They have written to me, and I am sure to other Deputies representing the County Dublin area, seeking the provision of a public telephone at least.  We get a stock reply from the Department which means nothing. They promise a telephone in six or eight months, time and, when we write to them in six or eight months' time, the period is extended for a further six or eight months.  It seems to run into years now before new housing estates can have telephone contact with the rest of the county, or the city, or the country.  I appeal to the Minister to provide at least one public telephone in each new housing estate.  I know it is not easy to keep up with the development of the county and that many people are looking for telephones.  I do not know what the figure is, but I am sure upwards of 80 per cent of the people in these new housing estates apply for and eventually get telephones. The Minister should try to provide one or two public telephones in these areas until the lines are available for private telephones.</P>
      <P>People look for some telephone connection and a public telephone is provided when the telephone service is being installed in the houses, with the result that the public kiosk will not pay.  I understand the Minister's Department are not prepared to provide a public kiosk in an area where it is not likely to pay, but surely a public telephone or two would pay in an area with 800 houses, no matter what the cost of providing them.  We harp constantly on the question of damage to public telephone kiosks but, in some housing estates in Tallaght where public telephones were provided before the private service, no damage was done because they were constantly in use.  In fact, there were always queues.  This is an indication that such a service would pay.  Even if it did not pay, the Minister should be prepared to give this service to people moving into these new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Department should accept that a public telephone in rural areas is a social service.  The Minister <Col N="1954" /> should reconsider his decision and his predecessors' decision not to provide rural public telephones unless they were likely to pay.  I do not think that is a proper attitude on the part of a Department providing this kind of service.  Remote areas are more entitled to this service than built-up areas in which there is likely to be greater use. In the latter areas, every second, or every fifth, or every seventh house will have a telephone which can be used by neighbours.  In the remote areas where very few people have telephones, it is far more important that we should provide public telephones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to make a few very brief comments on difficulties somewhat similar to those mentioned by Deputy McMahon.  We both represent the same sort of areas which are developing more rapidly than any other part of Europe.  There are bound to be teething problems of one sort or another.  There seems to be some lack of co-ordination and planning between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and housing development generally.</P>
      <P>We are trying to find jobs for people. There is something wrong when we realise that people living in an estate which has been in existence for a couple of years can have their post delivered in the afternoon only.  It must be a question of postmen, or sorters and postmen.  There must be some answer to it.  Some people get their post delivered at 8 o'clock in the morning and others cannot get it delivered until the afternoon.  This problem should and could be rectified by the Department.  I should like the Minister to say something about that when he is replying.</P>
      <P>Another complaint I hear frequently since the prolonged strike is that it is taking far too long to rectify the situation. In many cases it is even worse than it was when the strike was on. Perhaps the Minister would say something about this and advise the House as to when he hopes and expects things will return to normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McMahon that it is a matter for alarm when estates are in existence for two years and nobody <Col N="1955" /> has a telephone, even priority cases.  I do not know whether it is a question of waiting for delivery of materials that must be ordered for several years.  I know there was an element of that kind some time ago and I do not know whether it still exists.  It is really a dangerous situation in certain instances where people on whom others are depending for their professional skill, such as doctors and nurses, have not telephones. Business people who have had telephones in other situations cannot get transfers because the groundwork is not done and the lines are not there.</P>
    <P>I think we have the worst telephone repair service in the world.  It must be the worst and it must be the most expensive.  It must be due to one of two things.  Perhaps we have the most obsolete equipment which simply cannot be repaired.  Perhaps the technicians are not well qualified or do not care an awful lot.  It may be a combination of both these factors.  Technicians come and go&mdash;I do not know at what cost&mdash; but they are no sooner gone than a telephone is broken down again.  There must be an explanation for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of the Industrial action taken by the Irish Post Office Engineering Union.  It will be agreed that a great deal has already been said on behalf of all the parties involved in or affected by this dispute and I see no useful purpose in raking over the issues and trying to apportion blame.  It can be safely left to the good sense of both sides to learn from experience.  Now is the time for looking forward and I have confidence in the ability of the people concerned on both the staff and the management side to face the future in a spirit of goodwill and co-operation and to work together to recover the lost ground and to develop an efficient telecommunications system which will satisfy the requirements of the users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the present situation, the discussions on the claim are continuing at the departmental conciliation council under the chairmanship of <Col N="1956" /> the director of the Labour Court's conciliation service.  In accordance with the arrangements accepted for the ending of the industrial action, these discussions are proceeding as quickly as possible and, of course, it would be open to the union if they were not satisfied with the progress to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister. Under the terms of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration the proceedings of the departmental council are confidential and it would be inappropriate, therefore, to comment further on the claim at this stage.  Needless to say, I hope that the claim will be settled quickly and I am sure the Deputy would agree with me.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked a question about the review of the staff rules and regulations and the mediation committee. The various proposals which were put forward by the ICTU for the ending of the industrial action included a recommendation that there would be a review of the grievance and disciplinary procedures and rules and regulations which had been under consideration by the Departmental conciliation council and that this should be continued under a mediator nominated by the chairman of the Labour Court. This recommendation was accepted both by the staff and the Department and this review is proceeding.  The review is intended to be wide-ranging and I would hope that when the council have completed their deliberations an improved framework of staff relations will be agreed.</P>
    <P>The proposals also included a recommendation that the existing grievance procedures be improved by the provision of a mediation committee also presided over by a mediator appointed by the chairman of the Labour Court. This committee has been established by agreement and problems which could not be resolved in direct discussions have been referred to the mediation committee.  Any issue of difficulty which, having been processed through the grievance committee, still remains unresolved can in future be referred by either side to the mediation committee and if agreement cannot be reached then the mediator will make a recommendation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1957" /> As the House is aware, the Government announced in their pre-election manifesto their intention of examining the desirability of giving autonomy to the telecommunications service and of modernising the postal service.  I have been giving detailed consideration to both these matters and I expect to make an announcement in respect of these very shortly.</P>
    <P>The other matter raised by the Deputy related to broadcasting.  Pirate broadcasting is in the news.  The operators of these stations have been securing publicity that conveys a sympathetic and, might I say, even an heroic impression of their activities.  Of course, they themselves have been using the airwaves for this purpose. What is overlooked is the fact that these operators are acting in open defiance of the law.  They have appropriated any frequencies that suit their purposes.  They are operating on whatever power they choose for themselves. They are a potential menace to radio services generally.  The question of introducing fresh legislation to help combat pirate broadcasting is under consideration at present.  It will be appreciated that I am unable at this stage to give details of what will be covered in any draft legislation on this matter, but I would hope to introduce a Bill in the next session.</P>
    <P>RTE's proposals for a local radio service for Dublin and other radio developments are still under consideration. The issues involved are somewhat complex and certain aspects of long-term broadcasting policy also have to be taken into consideration.  I am dealing with that as rapidly as I can.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon raised the question of the telephone service in the new housing areas.  He will appreciate that very considerable difficulty is experienced in meeting demands for telephones in many of the new housing estates, especially in Dublin.  The main problem in the provision of telephones in newly developed housing estates is that it involves extensive local cabling schemes.  Even if the Department had adequate resources it would be difficult to carry out schemes of this type in advance of the completion of the <Col N="1958" /> houses.  Ducts for cables are provided at the building stage of estates where telephone demand is likely to be high. Until this is done cabling cannot be undertaken and the distribution of wiring to individual houses cannot proceed. We are doing what we can in relation to this to try to speed up the provision of telephones.</P>
    <P>Kiosks in urban areas are provided, in general terms, only where they are expected to pay their way and where the existing kiosks are not adequate to meet the demands on them.  Kiosks are provided in new housing development areas in accordance with the general urban kiosk policy, but the Department do not insist on the usual conditions being fully satisfied in such housing estates, particularly where, because of cabling and other difficulties, delay in providing private telephones is unavoidable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister consider providing public kiosks in estates? People cannot understand why the builder can have a telephone on the site when he is there but when he is gone there is no phone whatever on the site.</P>

      <P>: I cannot give the Deputy a commitment but I will look into what he has said.  Reference was made to the problems in relation to the postal services.  I accept that in recent months there has been some impairment of the smooth functionings of the postal services by certain temporary factors such as, for example, the breakdown of mechanical mail-handling equipment in the central sorting office which could not be repaired until the technicians' industrial action ceased.  Understandably, we also had teething troubles in the early stages of the five-day week in some areas and because of the interim arrangement in force for the carriage of first-class cross-Channel mail.  However, the position is being gradually improved as these difficulties, which are having constant attention are being ironed out.  Our postal services are exceptionally good compared with those in many other developed countries.  That does not mean that we are not all the time trying to go forward.</P>

Deputy Horgan raised the question of subhead K.1 and L.1 and asked why both appeared to provide for the same type of expenditure.  K.1 refers to the Post Office Users' Council, and the cost of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission is deducted in calculating the grant under L.1 paid to RTE.  I am sorry that I have not long to deal with the many matters raised but I think I have dealt with the most important ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I cannot help but criticise the speed at which these Estimates are being pushed through. To those of us who are new this is a great opportunity to learn how these moneys are spent in the different Departments. The amount of time spent in county and urban councils, and even in business premises, on estimates is necessary.  We waste a lot of time in this Dáil on matters which are less important than the Estimates.  As a new Deputy I make that comment in passing.  It is a great mistake that we move hundreds of millions of pounds in Estimates here today in a matter of a few hours whereas days and weeks are lost fiddling over small technical points in Bills.  I have had this aired at party level.  I understand that we will have no other opportunity to discuss these Estimates unless the Whips agree that time be made available.</P>
      <P>I have looked through the Estimate for Agriculture and picked out a few points.  I am told that I can have only a very short time to make these points and so I have picked out a few that I think necessary to mention.  Under the heading of Educational Research and Advisory Services is subhead B8, Scholarships and Training, for which £216,000 was provided this year and £174,000 last year.  This amount of money, out of approximately £22 million, under that heading is very small for a very important area of agriculture.  The need for agricultural training has been fully recognised and that is borne out by the number of applications received by county committees of agriculture.  I can speak only for the figures in my county where the present applications are 75 for 25 places.  Unfortunately, the 50 unsuccessful candidates cannot avail of this type of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said previously that there is a definite need for a minimum basic training before any young man goes into agriculture.  The Minister's Department would need to take a serious look at this.  I am prepared to accept that under EEC directives other training takes place in the county committees of agriculture, but you cannot beat the training given in these colleges.  The present <Col N="1961" /> one-year course is the minimum that any young man taking up farming today should accept in his own interest and in the interest of the State.</P>
    <P>I expressed views before in relation to the question of disease eradication. Approximately £19 million has been allocated under this heading.  While the figures look good at the moment they looked reasonably good this time last year but deteriorated as time went on.  There should be new initiatives under this heading.  Progress has been slight over a 10-year period in this field.  While the Minister claimed that he has taken certain steps, the steps taken are not sufficient.  There is a massive abuse of moneys made available under this heading by certain farmers. I have not seen any legislation put into operation to stop this abuse. The changing of ear tags is one famous abuse which has been going on since the schemes to eradicate bovine tuberculosis began.  I have no doubt that officials of the Department know that the ear tags for brucellosis cows are being changed as well.  I cannot understand how the Department have not come up with some way of detecting this abuse and bringing these people to justice so as to stop the abuse and the spread of disease.  If we are to make real progress new initiative must come into operation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the lime and fertiliser scheme, the Minister reduced the estimate from £5,625,000 to £2,375,000.  This was a mistake.  It has been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the land needs lime and phosphatic manures.  The Government took the subsidy from the phosphatic manures and not from lime but I am afraid that having interfered with the one they may interfere with the other. The amount of money given here is insignificant and it should not have been reduced.  The land lacks and always has lacked lime and it will be some while before we bring the land to the point where there is sufficient lime so as to get the maximum production. Other manures are useless without the lime.</P>
    <P>There has been quite an amount of agitation in relation to the question of subsidies on milk and dairy <Col N="1962" /> products.  In today's <i>Evening Press</i> there is a heading &ldquo;Milk Famine looms over price dispute&rdquo;.  My understanding is that price fixing for agricultural products is carried out by the EEC.  After long drawn-out negotiations we got an 8 per cent increase.  I cannot understand why the Minister has not given this increase having promised that it would take effect from 22 May 1978.  We are now at 27 June.  Approximately two or three weeks ago I asked a Parliamentary Question in relation to this and the Minister said it was under active consideration, but decisions have now been taken by the liquid milk producers of the Leinster area that milk will be diverted next week to manufacturing creameries.  This disruption of the flow of milk to our cities is a grave mistake; it does nothing but harm all round.  This occurred before and we had experience of it during our term of office when in 1972 the differential between liquid milk and manufacturing milk was eroded.  We found that in the winter of that year liquid milk producers stopped producing milk and milk had to be imported to the Dublin area from the Munster area.  This is a most unsatisfactory arrangement.  I appeal to the Minister to stop this diversion and to give these people, even at this late stage, their just entitlement which he negotiated on their behalf.  The Minister stated that there were problems with the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy but as Minister for Agriculture the Minister can fix the price for liquid milk whether or not he gets the agreement of that Department.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Estimate that in relation to intervention there is a slight reduction from £19,350,000 to £18,900,000.  I presume that the action taken by the Minister to stop heifers going into intervention makes this saving possible.  The intervention system is a safeguard for the agricultural community in relation to surplus products.  Any watering down of intervention is against the interests of the farmer and I appeal to the Minister not to water it further.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister is <Col N="1963" /> taking Lands along with the Agriculture Estimate.  We had a debate on the question of the 20,000,000 land bonds not so long ago.  A case was made by Deputy Fitzpatrick that this only provides six months' work for the Land Commission.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank Deputy D'Arcy for his contribution and like him I regret that time will not permit the House to have a more exhaustive discussion on this important topic.  I, like the Deputy, find myself in the position of having very little control over the way in which the House conducts business, but it is not possible to do it in any other way.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy D'Arcy's observations with regard to the desirability of farm training and it is for this purpose that I introduced, a few weeks ago, the Agriculture (An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Bill, 1978.  I hope that the House will deal with the Second Stage of that when it resumes in October.  It is one of these urgent pieces of legislation that I regret we did not get to deal with before the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy D'Arcy and others will appreciate that the passage of the Finance Bill took precedence over that and every other Bill.  When that Agriculture Bill passes through the House the direction of agricultural trading and advice will pass into the hands of the council of the new body.  I am confident that the council will direct the business of agricultural trade and advice in the manner best related to the needs of agriculture.  Like Deputy D'Arcy, I recognise not only the need for change but the state of evolution in which the whole business of agricultural trading and advice is at present. I would expect that in the next decade we will see very large changes in the whole approach of the agricultural industry and its use of specialised advice in that sector.  It is in order that the legal framework in which our agricultural trading is held will be sufficiently flexible to tolerate and encourage desirable change that I look forward to the rapid passage of the Agriculture <Col N="1964" /> (An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta) Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>I have very little quarrel with Deputy D'Arcy's remark that our progress over the years in the elimination of animal disease&mdash;first of all, of bovine tuberculosis, because that is the one we are longest attending&mdash;has been disappointing.  Without wanting to throw any spanners in the works, it must be plain to everybody, because it is undeniable, that the most serious blow that animal disease eradication got in the recent decade was the virtual stoppage of the programme for a period of two years.  One could not but expect that there would be a rapid increase in the incidence of reaction, both in regard to brucellosis and TB, in the cattle herds of the country.  This did happen and was inevitable.  Reactors were left unidentified.</P>
    <P>I agree also with Deputy D'Arcy that there is a great deal of abuse throughout the whole system of disease eradication.  There are umpteen different kinds of abuses, and for that purpose we will be introducing legislation immediately after the Summer Recess which will increase penalties for offences against the code of disease eradication, especially against people who engage in tag-switching and cheating herdowners and taxpayers also. This situation is intolerable and I believe the farmers are finding it intolerable. I think I can confidently look forward to their co-operation in a new effort not only to weed out reactor cattle among our herds but to weed out the people who are profiting by it. These are the people who are maintaining the situation in which disease eradication cannot be finalised.  We cannot contemplate in the future a more or less endless disease eradication scheme.  We must begin to think now in real active terms of terminal dates after which we will be able to say to ourselves that the incidence of bovine tuberculosis, and brucellosis later on, has been reduced almost to vanishing point.  I am not so sanguine as to think there will be total elimination&mdash;there never is; disease has not been eliminated anywhere&mdash;but one can reduce its incidence to almost negligible proportions, when the economic <Col N="1965" /> gain to the country and its herd owners will be very significant.</P>
    <P>There is another pressing factor in this disease eradication question.  It is that we may find ourselves no longer in a position to export meat to our colleague countries in the EEC.  There is no room at all for messing, or for tolerance of criminal practices within the disease eradication scheme&mdash;and I regret to say that they exist.  I want to inform the House of my intention to see that they are winkled out, because we cannot afford to carry them with us.  I want to say to Deputy D'Arcy that new initiatives have been taken.  I accept what Deputy D'Arcy says, that it is all very fine to get a few encouraging figures&mdash;we have got them and are duly encouraged&mdash;but I am not such a fool as not to recognise that, as he said, they may well slip.  It is necessary that the public be told, as frequently as figures are available, how we stand, how the campaign against disease is progressing, whether or not we are winning, because it would be a stimulus to everybody concerned to see that we keep on with it.  I know it is not easy, that there will be a great many difficulties ahead, but we must be prepared to face them.</P>
    <P>I regretted the removal of the phosphate subsidy.  The House will appreciate that on the question of the deployment of available money within the agricultural sector one must have regard to the most pressing needs.  Let us say if consideration were to be given to increasing the compensation rates for reactor cattle&mdash;and I believe them to be inadequate&mdash;one must weigh their value against the use of the available money in some other direction.</P>
    <P>There is another factor involved we must all bear in mind.  We are reverting from a situation in which agriculture was in a depressed condition. We had to be in a depressed condition when we were more or less bound hand and foot to the United Kingdom market before our entry to the EEC, when our exports to third countries, before they were known as &ldquo;third countries&rdquo;, were bound by severe quota restrictions.  A new situation obtains now in which production in agriculture is going up steadily. <Col N="1966" /> Farm incomes are going up in a satisfactory way, in real terms, as against 1973.  I think there was in increase of 27 per cent&mdash;I am speaking from memory, but that is my recollection of it.  Indeed farm production is visibly expanding.  There is a new confidence being felt within the agricultural industry.  One can see it as one travels the countryside&mdash;fairly hefty construction works going on in farmyards and big land improvement works as well.  In that context farmers can very much stand on their own feet now. There was a time when farmers' incomes had to be maintained through price supports.  That time has gone. Farmers, as a group of people, are very anxious to show not only that they can stand on their own feet but that they will be very glad to do so.</P>
    <P>Assistance was given to phosphate fertiliser distribution because a great many farmers found it impossible to buy this fertiliser out of their incomes and so it was necessary to subsidise it.  Needless to say a subsidy is always welcome but the necessity for it now is not as acute as it was.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any great need for alarm or despondency in regard to the price of what one might call urban milk.  My Department have been having discussions with representatives of liquid milk pasteurisation and products with regard to a voluntary scheme of pay on a quality basis.  These discussions were finalised on 12 June and the question of revising the minimum prices paid for liquid milk are now under active consideration. Other Departments have to be consulted in regard to aspects which are of interest to them.  These consultations are taking place and a decision will not be unreasonably delayed.</P>

      <P>: In regard to the exclusion of heifers from intervention, there is in my opinion an over-reliance on intervention.  There is no need to resort now, as there was in the past, to <Col N="1967" /> intervention.  We would, of course, always need to have the safety valve of intervention available but, having said that, it would be much better for ourselves and for the development of the meat industry if we got out into the market place and sold there.  We can do that, I believe, with a great deal of advantage.  It must be remembered that we need the heifers which might otherwise go into intervention for breeding purposes.  It is bad practice to slaughter potentially suitable breeding animals and we should try to avoid that as much as possible.  Nobody has lost by the closing off of intervention to heifers.  This closing off was our own act.  It had nothing to do with the EEC.  I believe it was the right thing to do.  We do not have to walk with a crutch when we can stand on our own two feet so why should we rely too much on supports of that kind?</P>

    <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose, as has been the practice in previous years, to treat the six Votes for which I am responsible as one group so that there may be a <Col N="1970" /> general discussion.  The total Estimate for all the Votes for which I am responsible is £88,799,000 made up as follows: Vote 23, Office of the Minister for Justice, £3,099,000, Vote 24, Garda Síochána, £70,592,000, Vote 25, Prisons, £9,518,000, Vote 26, Courts, £3,408,000, Vote 27, Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, £2,113,000 and Vote 28, Charitable Donations and Bequests £69,000.  This compares with the total Estimate for these six Votes of £77,022,000 in 1977 made up as follows: Office of the Minister for Justice, £2,639,000, Garda Síochána, £62,031,000, Prisons, £7,738,000, Courts, £2,905,000, Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, £1,667,000, and Charitable Donations and Bequests, £42,000.  The total provision for the present year is therefore £11,777,000 more than the corresponding figure for last year.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice caters for the staff and the service of the Department's headquarters and shows an increase of £460,000.  This increase is accounted for mainly by a substantial increase in the provision for criminal legal aid, increases in staff, increased salaries, wages and allowances consequent on the application of the national wage agreement, increase in the provision for compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted and increases in travelling and subsistence allowances.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice I have responsibility for a great variety of social legislation, adoption, the whole area of family law which raises the problem of deserted wives, their rights against their husbands and rights to the family home, annulments and guardianship of children and also the question of rent control, ground rents, landlord and tenant law, censorship of publications and films.  There are other areas with a high legal content for which I have responsibility such as the Land Registry, the Public Record Office, charity commissioners and the operation of the courts themselves.

      <P>Prior to the last election we heard a great deal from this Minister and his party about their commitment in that area.  High sounding sentiments were expressed suggesting that once in power support would be given and steps would be taken to ensure that, to use their own words, &ldquo;crime becomes unprofitable and where not prevented it is speedily detected&rdquo;.  In the context of the spate of armed robberies we have had and the huge sums stolen from the Minister's backyard in recent weeks, this commitment takes on the appearance of a sick joke.</P>
      <P>I would like to relate this point to the actual details of the Estimates because there was a specific commitment that whatever technical equipment, manpower or overtime was necessary, it would be provided to deal with the increase in the crime rate.  To combat modern criminals it is necessary to have modern technology and equipment available to the Garda.  That point seemed to have been recognised by Fianna Fáil before they came into power but I wonder has it been recognised since they came into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Garda Síochána Vote, under the heading &ldquo;Equipment&rdquo; the amount being voted is £987,000 as opposed to last year's figure of £985,000, an increase of £2,000 which in real terms, taking inflation into account, is a very considerable reduction.  Does this indicate a commitment to provide the necessary technical equipment to enable our force to combat modern crime? Without having the opportunity of going into this in any great detail, this seems to indicate a total lack of <Col N="1972" /> commitment.  There is a need for an expenditure of funds to provide whatever equipment is necessary.  Why is it not being provided?  Why is that figure, in real terms, being considerably reduced?</P>
    <P>In the same area the question of overtime arises.  Recent comments from Garda spokesmen indicate that there has been a very severe cutback in overtime.  Again, if we look at the figures we find that the estimated amount for overtime is only marginally greater than that for last year.  My suspicion would be that a very large part of that Estimate has already been spent in the current year and that for the remainder of the year this trend of cut-back will continue and those promises &mdash;that there would be ample overtime for them under a Fianna Fáil administration&mdash;probably not made in writing but implied to the members of the force, will not be kept.</P>
    <P>The Question then arises as to whether there is a serious commitment of the part of the present administration to combating crime, doing more than talking about it and providing the necessary funds to fight it.  I have to question seriously the Minister's commitment in that area, taking into account the recent record.  We find that already this year far more has been stolen by way of armed robberies than during the whole of last year.</P>
    <P>The other aspect to which I wish to refer is the Minister's commitment regarding the improvement of facilities at the Land Registry.  This is related also to the ground rents issue.  I do not propose to re-hash that issue but I am interested in hearing why there is not provision for more staff to deal with the problem in the Land Registry, other than those provided for in the Estimate.  The increase in the number being provided for between 1977 and 1978 is from 330 to 361, an increase of 31.  In this connection there arises two big questions.  There is the question of the existing arrears which, the Minister is well aware, can run into many months.  Everyone who must deal with the Land Registry has complaints in this regard.  The efforts made to reduce the arrears do not seem to be very satisfactory.  In saying this I am not <Col N="1973" /> casting any aspersion on the staff who are most co-operative but whose numbers are inadequate.  Their accommodation is not adequate either.  Apart from the ordinary work of the Land Registry the Minister indicated that there would be a substantial increase in the number of personnel to deal with the ground rents legislation.  So far as I can remember this increase was to be of the order of from 60 to 70 people.  Bearing in mind the commitment to deal with arrears and also the commitment to recruit additional staff to deal with the ground rents legislation, how are these commitments to be reconciled with an estimated increase of 31 in the Land Registry?</P>
    <P>In his short opening statement the Minister refers to his responsibility for various items of social legislation.  I am glad that he has reminded himself about this because for the past 12 months I have been wondering whether we would see any positive reference in this area.  During the year there have been references to many items being under consideration, being examined and so on but one must question the basis of the positive commitments that were made prior to the last election and one must ask whether these commitments were genuine.  In some areas there were serious and specific commitments while in other areas the commitments were serious and general.  The record to date shows that the Government have not honoured either the general or the specific commitment.  It is clear that on any of these issues the Government are vaccilating, kicking to touch.  I assure the Minister that from this side of the House we will be insisting during the coming 12 months that the serious reforms that are necessary in so many areas of the law will be dealt with on a positive basis and that concrete proposals will be produced so that no more will be put off or pushed aside by suggestions that so many of these items are being considered. I can give the Minister a short shopping list of what is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I shall relate what I have to say to the Estimate and shall give the Minister a &ldquo;shopping list&rdquo; of the various heads.  The Minister referred to criminal legal aid.  There is a commitment to extend and improve the legal aid system in criminal cases but this commitment has not been honoured.  There is a commitment, too, in relation to civil legal aid.  It is significant to note that the amount estimated in the current year for civil legal aid is £1,000.  Is that an indication of an improvement in civil legal aid this year?  The answer is obvious.  In addition there are such items as the new tribunals in relation to family law, the informal consumer tribunals, reform of the children's Act, removal of anachronisms in relation to women's law, the age of majority and our adoption laws.  We had reference to the latter today and we shall have it again in 12 months' time.  To complete the &ldquo;shopping list&rdquo; there are such questions as the legitimacy laws, the married laws, reform of our prisons and so on.  In respect of each of those the Minister may expect to hear from us again.  We guarantee to continue to remind him of his responsibility in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like the Minister to tell us what is the situation regarding school attendance and to let us know where his responsibilities begin and end in this area.  My information is that there are many areas in which children from ten onwards are not attending school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question I wish to put to the Minister relates to the selling of cider and wine to young people who have not reached the age at which they would normally be served with drink. My reason for asking the question is that to my knowledge these beverages are being sold to young people in areas in my constituency and that this situation is the cause of much trouble. <Col N="1975" /> For example, in one school in the area damage to the extent of £22,000 has been caused during the past year by cider-drinking teenagers.  The situation got so much out of hand that 84 parents working on a rota basis assumed responsibility for protecting the school each evening until after midnight. There seems to be no point in reporting incidents of vandalism to the Garda because they will merely ask what they can do.  This is a shocking situation.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention is that itinerants in the County Dublin area are looting wholesale.  They have been reported so often to local gardaí that people no longer consider worth while the effort of reporting such incidents. What is involved is looting on a big scale.  I suspect that this situation is associated closely with roadside trading because the itinerants have outlets for the goods they steal.  Every second house in the district in which I live &mdash;and I live about 12 miles from the city centre&mdash;has been looted more than once.  I have been a victim on two occasions recently.  On each occasion the goods taken were to the value of a few hundred pounds.  That represented a substantial loss so far as I was concerned.  If we are to allow that sort of situation to continue it will seem as if we are giving up the fight.</P>
    <P>I am told that in the rapidly developing areas in County Dublin a person can hardly leave his house without it being looted or squatted in. I understand, too, that much of the trouble associated with teenagers which occurs in local dancehalls and other places of amusement is due to teenagers being able to buy quite freely inferior cider and wine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like briefly to draw the Minister's attention once more to the anomaly that exists regarding public house licences, a situation that is having an effect in the fast-developing areas of County Dublin where it is not possible to obtain a licence for a premises within a mile of an existing licensed premises.  When one considers the development of the three towns in the <Col N="1976" /> county and the tremendous increase in population it is hardly necessary to go into detail in order to outline the difficulties involved.  I am not by any means one who advocates making available alcohol any more freely because I consider that far too much alcohol is consumed, but I do not think that prohibiting a licence within a mile of an existing one is helping the situation.  The situation becomes much worse because there are larger public houses particularly in the three new towns I have spoken about.  There is a greater distance for people to travel.  They are not encouraged to walk for their nightly drink or weekly drink but are encouraged to take out their cars.  We have a Bill later on tonight which might be a more appropriate time to deal with the matter. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to this great anomaly which exists in the licensing laws, particularly in relation to County Dublin.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the deplorable state of district courthouses.  It is about time that his Department took responsibility for them.  It is deplorable to ask district justices, members of the legal profession and gardaí as well as the people summoned to attend them, to go into those courthouses and stay in them for any length of time.  There is one district courthouse in my constituency where it is not possible to get everybody interested in a particular case into it never mind those waiting to be called. They have to wait outside sometimes in very inclement weather.  The situation is not helped by the Minister's Department not having responsibility for district courthouses.  I would like him to discuss this matter with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to see that those courthouses are kept in a proper state of repair.  Courthouses for far too long have been the responsibility of local authorities.  I have no doubt if they were the responsibility of the Department of Justice they would be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are worried about the Minister's attitude to security.  He gave the impression recently that he is pretty happy with the situation.  I do not think that is correct but that is the <Col N="1977" /> feedback I am getting from my constituents. We know there is a great increase in the number of gardaí and that foot patrols are more evident in the streets.  This is due mainly to the efforts of his predecessor but no doubt the Minister claims his share of the credit for it.  Despite this fact the amount of crime has risen.  People wonder why we have an increase in armed robberies.  The Minister's attitude to the efforts recently of some Members on this side of the House to have a certain debate take place in the House has given the impression that he is happy with the situation.  He did not have the courtesy to come down into the Chamber, despite the fact that he was in the lobby when the debate was taking place, to answer the points made from this side of the House.</P>

It appears that a number of local authorities are not doing all they should be doing in regard to the proper maintenance of some district courthouses.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Many of the areas in which legislation is required were referred to these bodies by the previous Government.  A little knowledge is an extremely dangerous thing.  The Deputy was loud in his condemnation of the fact that provision of only £1,000 was made in the Estimate for civil legal aid.  I am not going to educate the Deputy, but he should ask for advice on the purpose of a token Estimate and then he would not be going off at half cock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister telling us that we will have civil legal aid before the end of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am telling the Deputy to seek advice from some member of his party in regard to token Estimates.</P>

      <P>: If the Minister gives a commitment I will accept it, but the Minister has no intention of giving a commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputies O'Keeffe and McMahon questioned the commitment of the Government to security. There is no reason for anybody to question our commitment to security. Not alone did we make a commitment but we are honouring it.  We can defend ourselves in regard to commitments whereas those who were here before us up to 5 July last cannot do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister should not be going back too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I beg the Deputy's pardon.  I will go back as far as I like.  If I cannot talk about something that happened 12 months ago then I have no business being here.  In regard to ordinary crime, up to 5 July last the Garda were not allowed to do their job, <Col N="1983" /> Since I came into office on 5 July a determined effort has been made to combat the increase in crime which was rampant at the time.  Approximately 600 extra gardaí have been put on the streets in the 11½ months since then, with 400 or 500 more to come.  That is something Deputies should remember. I ask Deputies O'Keeffe and McMahon to ask themselves&mdash;Deputy McMahon should know; Deputy O'Keeffe was not here and I would excuse him&mdash; how many gardaí came out of the training centre in the year prior to 5 July 1977?  Then let us talk about commitments to combat crime.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with a most serious allegation by Deputy McMahon.  He was not manly enough to say it in his own name but he adopted the &ldquo;duirt bean liom go ndúirt bean leí&rdquo; attitude, that he was told that in the case of the recent robbery that took place at Barna, County Limerick, it was rumoured that these people had friends in the Cabinet. I think that is a highly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I was not referring to a particular robbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: My interpretation of what the Deputy said was that the armed bank robbers have friends in the Cabinet or in the Government.  That is an outrageous, slanderous, incorrect and most serious allegation, highly irresponsible and typical of the Deputy who made it.  It is without foundation and I am glad that eventually, despite many slippery turns on the Deputy's part, he withdrew it.  It was disgraceful that the Deputy should try that sort of tactic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I was giving the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is completely untrue and he knows it to be untrue.  He is trying to be mischievous and cause trouble.  He will not succeed.  He says many people are worried about the Minister's attitude towards security being one of complacency.  I should like to assure the Deputy&mdash;it is not necessary in the case of the public because they know it to be untrue&mdash;that there is no question of complacency on my part as Minister for Justice or on the <Col N="1984" /> part of the Government in dealing with criminals, whether ordinary criminals or subversives.  Let that be clearly understood. If the Deputy wants to play politics with it he may do so but he may expect that he will be dealt with as he should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Bank robberies did not start happening since 5 July last.  In 1975 we had 153 bank robberies; in 1976, 185 bank robberies; in 1977, 298 bank robberies and in 1978 up to 26 June, 106 bank robberies.  If the Deputy wishes to throw stones I could throw them also&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>: Has the Minister given figures for armed robberies?  I spoke about armed robberies, not bank robberies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am talking about bank robberies as a whole.  I am now categorically stating that the number of armed robberies in 1975 was 153; in 1976, 185 and up to 26 June this year, 106&mdash;which I would hope nobody approves of on either side of the House. I trust we would all be committed to see that everything that can be done will be done to prevent these things happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Was not the Minister's message a year ago that there was one answer to armed robberies and that was increased overtime?  Now that he is in office it is cut back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy Kelly is wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister spoke last February 12 months and the whole of the speech was based on the relevance of overtime to the stamping out of armed robberies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Again, I say Deputy Kelly is wrong in that.  I did say that there was very great need&mdash; as there was&mdash;for a much stronger Garda presence on the streets to combat ordinary crime and, at the time of a certain train robbery, I did say that there was a great deal of protection of large consignments of money because&mdash;it was not admitted but it was known to be true&mdash;at the time of a certain train robbery there <Col N="1985" /> was no protection whatever, armed or unarmed, because the Minister for Justice of the day had given a direction four weeks earlier that the cut-backs on overtime were to be observed irrespective of whether or not security was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister when in Opposition talked non-stop on the question of overtime.  It was the only solution he had to offer, more and more overtime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is untrue.  I suggested that as far as ordinary crime was concerned there was great need for more gardaí on the streets. I certainly said that and I say again that there is further need at present, despite the much stronger Garda presence on the streets since 5 July last, for more gardaí to combat crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not want to annoy the Minister but my distinct recollection and the recollection of everybody else on this side of the House is the Minister's simple solution for the problem when in Opposition was more and more overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is untrue.  The Deputy has not his facts.  Let him please get them and come back at a proper time and I shall debate the matter with him.  If the Deputy were interested and had something worth while to offer he could have come in here at 6.15 as we did and he would have had time to contribute to the debate irrespective of whether he had his facts.  I am glad he did not do so because he has not facts.  If the Deputy wishes to raise the matter at Question Time and wishes to put down questions we can talk about it.</P>

      <P>Section 3: In page 6, lines 8 to 17 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1)  In relation to a proposed merger or take-over, title to any shares or assets concerned shall not pass until&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Minister, in pursuance of section 7 (a), has stated in writing that he has decided not to make an order under section 9 in relation to the proposed merger or take-over, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the Minister has stated in writing that he has made a conditional order in relation to the proposed merger or take-over, or</P>
      <P>(c)  the relevant period within the meaning of section 6 has elapsed without the Minister's having made an order under section 9 in relation to the proposed merger or take-over,</P>
      <P>whichever first occurs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Bill as introduced, a proposed merger or take-over would not take effect unless it had been notified to and cleared by the Minister or the stipulated time for clearance had expired.  We believe this would mean that all transactions carried out by any persons who had proceeded without notifying would be invalid: for example, the payment of wages and salaries, the hire or dismissal of personnel, the buying or seling of goods.  Indeed, every contract entered into would be invalid.  As will <Col N="1998" /> be appreciated, this could have unforeseen and, perhaps, unforeseeable consequences.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed amendment it is intended that only the passing of title would be invalid, leaving valid all the other transactions to which I have referred.

      <P>Section 7 (b) provides for the referral by the Minister of a proposed merger to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices for investigation in relation to all of the scheduled criteria.  However section 8 (2) provides that the examiner's report of his investigation shall contain his opinion as to whether the proposed merger concerned would operate against the common good in respect of any of the scheduled criteria.  It has been suggested that the examiner would be in a position to isolate one criterion and confine his report to a statement that the proposal would operate against the common good in relation to that criterion.

    <P>Under this proposed amendment the Minister will have power to make an additional order to validate retrospectively a purported merger.  A condition of such an order with retrospective effect could be that the enterprise concerned would have to divest themselves of any shares over the 30 per cent as required.  For example, if an enterprise acquired 35 per cent of the shares of another enterprise, they could be required to sell off 5 per cent of the shares in order to bring the shareholding down to the 30 per cent limit in the Bill.  In the Bill as introduced there is no power to validate a purported merger, and this amendment, with amendment No. 1, will go a long way towards easing the concern which has been expressed by many people about the severe implications of a proposed merger proceeding without notifying the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Order, 1978</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 15 June, 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that on 26 October 1976, when the Second Stage of the Worker Participation Bill was being moved, the House was told it was not possible at that time to determine in advance the sizes of the reconstituted State boards in question.  The view was that it would not be appropriate at that stage to prescribe board sizes in the Bill as it could limit the discretion of the Government Ministers concerned. <Col N="2000" /> It was felt to be desirable and appropriate that the Ministers should have discretion in determining the size of the boards to take account of the appointments to the boards of members elected by employees.  The solution adopted was to allow the new board sizes to be prescribed at a later stage by affirmative order.</P>
    <P>For that purpose, section 23 of the Act empowers the Minister for Labour, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and other appropriate Ministers, to prescribe by order in relation to each of the State bodies designated in the Act the number of members or directors of the reconstituted boards, including the number of employees to be appointed following an election by the workforce.  Where the total number is a multiple of three, elected representatives must constitute one third.  Otherwise the proportion of elected representatives must be rounded upwards to the number which is next above one third.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of section 4 (4) of the Act, a draft of any order to be made under section 23 requires the prior approval of the Oireachtas by way of affirmative resolution of each House.  The intention behind that provision is to ensure that there would be no diminution of the authority or responsibility of the Oireachtas in determining the appropriate size of the State boards concerned.</P>
    <P>The present order, which has been laid before the House in draft, is designed to comply with the requirements of section 23 of the Act in so far as five of the seven State bodies are concerned&mdash;Bord na Móna, British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, Electricity Supply Board and Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta. The effect of the proposed order is that, as from the date on which it is made, the size of the boards of the five bodies will be fixed at 12 members, of which four&mdash;that is to say, one third of the total&mdash;will be elected by the workers for appointment under the Act.  As the maximum size of the existing boards is seven, except in the case of the sugar company where it is ten, the overall <Col N="2001" /> increase in board sizes will be five of which four will be reserved for members elected by the employees. The increase in the sugar company will be two.</P>
    <P>I have not included Aer Lingus Teoranta or Córas Iompair Éireann in the draft order because consultations in these bodies have not reached a stage where decisions on board sizes would be appropriate.  When consultations have concluded I shall be pleased to bring forward the relative draft orders before the House to reconstitute the boards of these two bodies.</P>
    <P>I have already made regulations for the conduct of elections under the Act which were laid before the House on 1 March 1978, in accordance with section 4 (3).  This draft order represents the next step towards bringing the Act into operation since it specifies the number of board seats which may be contested in elections.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I am very anxious to proceed with the implementation of the Act.  In that connection it is relevant to mention that there have been consultations with all the interests concerned about the election procedures and about board sizes.  I would, therefore, recommend that the House approve the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am very concerned about the delay in introducing this order affirming a Bill which was passed 15 months ago, and introduced by my colleague, Deputy M. O'Leary, the responsible Minister in the previous Government.  I appreciate the need for consultation before its introduction, but 15 months seems unnecessarily long, and because of this I suspect the sincerity of the Minister in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this development, particularly on the size of the board, was conveyed to the Minister and his colleagues last November.  I hope this delay is not an indication of a lukewarm approach to worker participation by the Minister and, perhaps, his colleagues. I sincerely regret that the Minister has not accepted the recommendation of ICTU that boards <Col N="2002" /> should consist of 15 members, thereby ensuring five elected directors of each State enterprise.  I am convinced that the arguments of congress are sound and reasonable, and furthermore that the Minister supports their recommendations. I am appealing to him to make further efforts to overcome the opposition of his colleagues, because the success of this development depends on a full and genuine contribution by all members of the Government.</P>
    <P>A 15-member board would, under the provisions of the Act, include five elected members.  In my view it is essential for the successful operation of the system of worker-directors in State enterprises that there should be not fewer than five elected directors. Most of the enterprises concerned cover a variety of operations, have a wide geographical spread, employ different categories of staff and have a relatively large number of trade unions.  These factors must influence the desirable number of elected directors.</P>
    <P>In the case of CIE, for example, there are the clearly distinct road passenger service, road freight, rail operations and workshops.  Bord na Móna have several major peat production and briquette locations.  The Irish Sugar Company have four sugar factories apart from food-processing operations. In the ESB there are the separate operations of electricity generation, transmission and distribution, as well as large technical and administrative areas.</P>
    <P>In each enterprise there are distinct occupational categories, that is, general operatives, craft workers, technical and professional staff, and administrative workers.  Most significant perhaps, there are many trade unions in each of the enterprises.  It is clearly desirable that the major union interests, whether large individual unions or groups of unions, should be satisfied that there is a fair prospect of their being represented among the elected directors. Otherwise their commitment may be less whole-hearted and there could well be resentment and frustration that would be damaging to the prospects of the success of worker participation as envisaged under the Act.  Even a cursory examination of the union <Col N="2003" /> structure in the enterprises indicates the impossibility of reconciling the need for broad representation of employee-union interests with fewer than five elected directors.</P>
    <P>For all these, and indeed other reasons, I consider it essential that there should be five elected directors on each of the boards.  Otherwise there is a grave risk of jeopardising the successful implementation&mdash;in the spirit as well as the letter&mdash;of worker participation as envisaged in the Act.  I recognise that the arguments we have set out are stronger in the case of some of the seven enterprises than they are in others.  The benefits of uniformity of board size in the seven enterprises will, however, be obvious and need not be elaborated here.</P>
    <P>I regret that CIE and Aer Lingus are not included in the order.  I understand and accept that further consultations are necessary in the case of these two enterprises and I sincerely hope the Minister will arrange to have a separate order made in time for elections to be held very early in 1979.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael O'Leary, during his term of office as Minister for Labour, was completely committed to this worth-while idea of worker participation and was able to convince his colleagues in Cabinet of the necessity for the legislation introduced in 1976 under which this order had been introduced today.  I hope the Minister and his colleagues are equally committed to this idea.</P>
    <P>Finally I hope this order today is only the bridgehead for advancing this idea of worker participation into the private sector.  I look forward to greater activity in this field in the coming session.  Notwithstanding the defects in the order, particularly the fact that it does not provide for five elected directors, my party will not oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>: At this stage I have been in office for almost a year only.  Deputy Ryan and the House must be aware that extensive consultations were needed on the election procedures in the State boards.  Deputy Ryan referred <Col N="2004" /> to the delay.  I would have wished to introduce an order covering the seven companies but, because further consultations have to take place with CIE and Aer Lingus, this was not possible.  I was most anxious to introduce a comprehensive order and I thought it better to cover as many boards as possible rather than having piecemeal orders covering one or two at a time.</P>
      <P>Account was taken of the views of congress on the size of State boards, as account was taken of other interests and other views.  Twelve-member boards seem to be acceptable and on balance seem to be desirable in this our first exercise in worker participation. I am anxious that this first venture should be successful.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned the multiunion situation.  I am fully aware of that.  I am sure he will agree that even five would not have solved that problem because of the widespread number of unions.</P>

This order gives an opportunity to those five companies to go ahead and finalise the arrangements for elections. I hope all five but at least three, will be having their elections this year.  As soon as consultations have been held with regard to the other two companies, I will be only too pleased to bring another order before the House. On my part there will be absolutely no delay in introducing that order as as soon as the consultations are concluded.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Estates of Deceased Persons and Inheritances and on Gifts) (United Kingdom) Order, 1978,</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 16th June, 1978.</P>
    <P>This draft order confirms a Convention signed on behalf of the Government of Ireland and of the Government of the United Kingdom on 7 December 1977.  A White Paper containing the text of the Convention has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Copies of the draft order containing the text of the Convention were laid before Dáil Éireann on 16 June 1978.</P>
    <P>Section 66 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, provides that an arrangement entered into with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation shall have the force of law here if the Government make an order accordingly.  Before such an order can be made, a draft of the order must be laid before Dáil Éireann and a resolution passed approving it.  Deputies will find the text of the Convention scheduled to the draft order now before the House. A separate memorandum has also been circulated with the draft order explaining the effect of the provisions.</P>
    <P>The Convention sets out arrangements for the relief of double taxation as between Ireland and the United Kingdom on estates of deceased persons and inheritances and on gifts.  The taxes in question are the Irish capital acquisitions tax, namely, gift tax and inheritance tax, and the United Kingdom capital transfer tax.  The previous arrangements between the two states for the relief of double taxation on death became obsolete as a result of the abolition in both countries of the former death duties in 1975.  The Convention is based on a Model Convention prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a body of which both states are members.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly outline the main features of the Convention in the order in which they occur in the text of the Convention.  Article 4 recognises the <Col N="2006" /> right of each state to claim domicile according to its domestic law.  Where both states claim the domicile, rules are set out to determine which state takes precedence, that is, which state has the fiscal domicile.</P>
    <P>Article 5 affirms that each state retains the right to levy tax according to its own law.  It also deals with the situation where both Ireland and the United Kingdom have a claim for tax in respect of property situated in a third territory by setting out criteria for determining in any particular case whether Ireland or the United Kingdom should have the primary claim for tax in relation to such property.</P>
    <P>Article 6 indicates how the situation of property shall be determined for the purposes of the Convention.  Article 8 is the main provision dealing with the elimination of double taxation.  The Article provides that each state will grant a credit against its own tax for any tax liability in the other state on property situated in the other state. In cases where domicile is claimed by both Ireland and the United Kingdom and property in a third territory is involved, the state with the secondary claim, as determined by Article 5, will be required to grant a credit for the tax of the primary state on the property in question.  The Article also provides that in Ireland any credit being allowed in any particular case will be given only to the person who actually pays the tax imposed in Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Article 9 declares that a claim for a credit or for a repayment of tax in accordance with the Convention has to be made within six years from the date of the event in respect of which the claim is made.  Article 11 provides for consultation between the Revenue authorities of the two states in order to eliminate any element of double taxation that may arise contrary to the provisions of the Convention.</P>
    <P>Article 14 deals with the dates of operation of the Convention.  The Convention is retrospective to the introduction of capital acquisitions tax in Ireland and of capital transfer tax in the United Kingdom.  It shall, therefore, be effective in Ireland from 28 February 1974, in respect of gift tax, <Col N="2007" /> and from 1 April 1975 in respect of inheritance tax, and it shall be effective in the United Kingdom from 13 March 1975 in respect of capital transfer tax on a death, and from 27 March 1974 in respect of capital transfer tax on other occasions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I recommend that Dáil Éireann approve the draft order.</P>

      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill which has been passed by the Seanad is primarily concerned with the offence of driving or being in charge of a vehicle while having a concentration of alcohol in the blood or urine in excess of a prescribed limit.  As the House is aware, this law was first enacted by the Oireachtas in 1968, following a report by a commission established to examine the issue of driving while under the influence of drink or a drug.  The 1968 Act has itself been amended on one occasion; its operation has more than once been suspended; procedures have been revised from time to time; regulations have been made and amended to meet changing circumstances and to deal with problems which emerged in specific court decisions.  Nevertheless, the Director of Public Prosecutions found it necessary some months ago once more to suspend the taking of proceedings under the existing legislation. The proposals in the present Bill are designed to provide a substantial deterrent to those who feel they can continue to avoid the consequences of the criminal action of driving while their capabilities are impaired by drink or by drugs, and to establish a clear framework within which those who wilfully break the law can be brought <Col N="2008" /> before the courts and punished appropriately.</P>
    <P>It was a central theme of the 1968 law, in order that the new principle would be acceptable to the people generally, that the protection afforded to the individual charged under it should be spelt out in the greatest detail possible.  The Act and the regulations made under the Act accordingly prescribed in great detail the procedures to be followed by the gardaí, by medical practitioners called in to take blood or urine specimens, and by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety who carry out analysis of specimens of blood and of urine sent to them by the gardaí.  Even the equipment to be used &mdash;syringes, bottles, seals and so on&mdash; were subject to statutory regulation. Court procedures have tended to centre on proof that the prescribed procedures and other matters were observed in every minute detail.  The proofs sought in court included proof that the examining doctor was a registered medical practitioner; that the syringe used was actually supplied by the medical bureau; that the prescribed wording of the caution by the garda had been read to and understood by the defendant; that printed forms and certificates used in the course of a prosecution cited precisely the references to statutory matters and that the required procedures within the medical bureau were minutely observed.  As a result, accused persons found it possible to secure dismissal of prosecution often on a technicality, however trivial or almost frivolous, despite the availability to the courts of a certificate of the director of the medical bureau that the blood-alcohol level of the accused exceeded, and in many cases substantially exceeded, the prescribed limit.</P>
    <P>During 1977, the incidence of dismissals of prosecutions and the apparent inequality of treatment of such cases by the courts became such that the Director of Public Prosecutions decided in October 1977 that no further proceedings under the existing breathalyser system would be initiated pending a review of the statutory position. That review has been timeconsuming and has involved constitutional <Col N="2009" /> issues as well as examination of a great variety of court decisions on many points.  I would like to have been in a position to bring the new proposals before the House at a much earlier date, but this was simply not practicable.  I therefore appreciate the co-operation shown by the House in facilitating the urgent consideration of the Bill today.  We all agree that the trend of road accidents demands positive action in so far as legislation can assist in reversing it.  A high proportion of accidents involve drivers who have consumed an excess of alcohol. There are of course many reasons why accidents occur&mdash;speed, road and weather conditions, fatigue, mechanical failure, and so on.  But we are concerned here with the type of case where a driver is not capable of exercising normal control for the reason that he is, by his own action, under the influence of alcohol, or a drug, or both alcohol and drugs.  I have no doubt that the House is anxious to take strong action to curb this abuse; to produce an effective deterrent which will show that these actions cannot be tolerated or be pursued with impunity; and, where the law has found such persons guilty of an offence, to put them off the road.</P>
    <P>Under the 1968 Act, the limit of blood-alcohol concentration, known as BAC, was set at 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. This limit is high by European standards and it is proposed to reduce it to a new limit of 100 milligrammes of alcohol to 100 millilitres of blood.  In association with this change, it will also be an offence to drive or be in charge of a vehicle while exceeding an equivalent concentration of alcohol in the urine&mdash;the limit in this case will be 135 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of urine.  Urine testing will be available too where drugs or a combination of drugs and alcohol are in question.</P>
    <P>A case can be made to reduce these limits even further.  I believe the proposals in the Bill are reasonable.  Some countries which have lower limits also have a two-tier system, where penalties for the lower BAC are less severe than those for the higher limit.  We have opted for a single limit with correspondingly <Col N="2010" /> severe penalties.  This limit is the same as that in the USA where driving conditions may, indeed, be even more difficult than ours.  We should, in my view, give effect to this proposal and examine its results without prejudice to the possibility that even more stringent measures may be found desirable in the future.  My hope is, however, that the effects of this Bill would not depend merely on the limit actually fixed, but would show people that drunk driving is itself an evil thing.  Anything we can do outside the legislation to bring this home to the drinking driver will be done.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that setting a limit of 100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood does not mean that a person having less than this concentration is altogether immune from prosecution and conviction. It is a statutory offence to drive while one's ability is impaired by the influence of alcohol or drugs, no matter how low the concentration may be.  But it would, under the Bill, be a specific offence to have more alcohol in the blood or urine than the prescribed limit.</P>
    <P>A major principle of the Bill is to remove from the law a number of requirements which oblige the Minister to prescribe details of matters which are not of evidential value.  These include details of the procedures followed within the medical bureau.  We must be mature enough to accept that eminently qualified medical personnel in the bureau carry out and certify blood or urine analysis at least as conscientiously as any qualified analysts elsewhere whose findings we can accept for the gravest of personal reasons without making an issue of their procedures or their qualifications. But in eliminating these details from the statute book, we must protect the right of the person charged to produce evidence, if he finds it possible to do so, in his own defence.  To achieve this, the Bill provides that when a person gives a blood or urine specimen, he will be handed a sealed portion of that specimen, which he may have analysed independently.  It will be open to him to present an independent analysis in court should he find this appropriate, <Col N="2011" /> and it will be for the court to decide the case on the evidence presented to it.</P>
    <P>The commission on drunk-driving visualised the establishment of blood alcohol content by means of breath analysis.  Breath analysis is not to be confused with the screening test, that is, blowing into a tube or bag, by which the presence, but not the level, of blood alcohol can be indicated.  The screening test if positive is, under existing law, followed by arrest and the subject is brought to the Garda station. That procedure is not affected by the Bill.  The existing law enables the gardaí at the station to require a subject to undergo breath analysis or to give a blood specimen.  Breath analysis has not so far been so used here. Scientific developments since 1968 have produced different types of apparatus which are capable of measuring blood-alcohol concentration by breath analysis.  The apparatus is capable of giving both visual and print-out evidence of blood alcohol content.  While no change in our law is necessary to enable such apparatus to be used at a Garda station, the present law does not enable the gardaí to use breath analysis at the roadside.  The Bill would make provision for this contingency.</P>
    <P>The mandatory disqualification from driving of a person convicted of excess alcohol concentration in his blood or urine will be retained and will apply to offences under this Bill, as will be the power of the courts to impose penalties of fines and/or imprisonment. The maximum fine is being increased to £500.  The other amendments proposed do not affect the principles on which the present law is based.</P>
    <P>Subject to enactment of the Bill, therefore, which I would propose to bring into operation as soon as this can be done:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The existing roadside screening test will continue.  This will normally be the first step taken by a garda.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A person suspected of an offence may be arrested without warrant <Col N="2012" /> and brought to a Garda station for breath analysis or blood test.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A person who is required to give a blood specimen may opt to give a urine specimen instead.  Where a urine specimen is given, a concentration of alcohol in excess of 135 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of urine will indicate that an offence had been committed.  This relates to the concentration of 100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Breath analysis may be used by the gardaí at the roadside, as well as at a Garda station, which they are already entitled to do.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Where drugs are suspected, or a combination of drugs and alcohol, a urine specimen may be required for testing.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A person giving a blood or urine specimen will be obliged to comply with the requirements of the designated medical practitioner in attendance.</P>
    <P>&mdash;When a doctor takes a blood or urine specimen, he will seal it in two portions one of which will be given to the subject, who may arrange for its independent analysis if he so wishes; the other portion will be sent to the medical bureau for analysis as to the concentration of alcohol in the blood or urine, the result of which will be communicated to the subject and to the Garda.  The doctor will complete a certified statement as at present, authenticating the specimen as to the person, the time and the place where it was taken, and so on.</P>
    <P>&mdash;When the medical bureau has carried out its analysis in accordance with normal professional practice to establish blood or urine alcohol concentration, they will issue a certificate of their findings in a prescribed form. The Bill provides that the certificate of the bureau, which will be admissible in evidence, will be proof of compliance with statutory requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2013" />&mdash;It will be an offence for a person not to comply with the instructions of a Garda in relation to screening or testing procedures.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The penalties on conviction will, as at present, include disqualification from driving and, at the discretion of the Court, a fine up to £500 and/or imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope that the House will give this Bill the urgent attention which is warranted in present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In accordance with the assurance which I gave to the Taoiseach in regard to this Bill last week on the Order of Business, our party are prepared to facilitate the passing of this Bill through the House tonight.  At the same time, I would like to put on record that I and my party feel ourselves in a dilemma in regard to this Bill.  It deals with a very serious matter, the offence of drunken driving or driving a mechanically propelled vehicle with an excessive amount of alcohol in the blood to such an extent that the judgment of the driver is impaired and he ceases to be capable of exercising proper control over the vehicle.  That in substance is what is in the Bill and for that reason we regard it as serious and urgently needed.  That is so because it is almost as reckless to go out on the highways of this country with a motor car while the driver is under the influence of drink or while his judgment is impaired by drink as it is to discharge a firearm in a crowded thoroughfare.  For that reason we consider that this Bill should get a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I must deplore the fact that the Bill was introduced here in the dying days of this Dáil session and at a time when it had no hope without the co-operation of the members of the Opposition of being cleared through the Oireachtas in the ordinary way.  That is to be deplored because it places the members of the Opposition in the position that if they do not allow the Bill a speedy passage through the House they take responsibility for depriving the Garda and the law enforcement agencies of this <Col N="2014" /> measure which is a necessary measure. On the other hand, when we give it a speedy passage through the House there is a danger that it will not be as thoroughly vetted and investigated as it might be.  However, balancing one set of circumstances against the other, and having regard to the serious offence which is being dealt with, the desirability of passing it through the House and the desirability of vetting it thoroughly, we have come to the conclusion that the proper thing to do is afford the Bill a speedy passage through the House, and that is what we are doing.  If the Minister has any doubts about the constitutionality of the Bill or any of its provisions he should submit it to the Supreme Court for a decision on whether its terms are strictly in accordance with the Constitution. It would be very undesirable that the Bill when it becomes an Act should run into the same type of trouble as did the other Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the history of this sort of legislation, as far back as 1872 we have had the offence of being in charge of a carriage&mdash;a horse-drawn carriage of course&mdash;while under the influence of drink or while unfit to exercise proper control over the horse and carriage. Not until 1933 did we have the specific offence of driving while drunk.  That was an offence introduced by the Road Traffic Act of that year which made it an offence for a person to drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of drink and imposed serious penalties such as fines, which according to money values of those days, were substantial, a sentence of imprisonment on the driver and automatic disqualification from holding a driver's licence. Coming fairly closely on the Road Traffic Act of 1961 we had the Road Traffic Act, 1968, which for the first time introduced the offence of driving a mechanically propelled vehicle while the driver had in his blood a concentration of alcohol in excess of 125 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood. I am fairly familiar with that measure because I was spokesman for my party on Local Government at that time.</P>
    <P>The Bill was introduced following the report of a commission on driving <Col N="2015" /> while under the influence of drink or a drug, which was set up by the Minister for Local Government in 1961.  It is worth noting that in 1968 not alone did we accept the advice of the commission of 1961 but we went beyond that.  The commission of 1961 recommended the introduction of a blood test and that the permitted amount of alcohol in the blood should be 125 milligrammes to 100 millilitres and recommended that that should not be an absolute offence. The commission recommended that that should be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the driver was unfit to drive and that the onus would then shift to the driver to prove that notwithstanding that concentration of alcohol in his blood he was in fact fit to drive a car.</P>
    <P>We had a long discussion on that proposal when the 1968 Bill was going through.  One school of thought, with which I agreed, was that we should accept the recommendation of the commission and make the concentration of alcohol in the blood <i>prima facie</i> evidence only.  All through that debate I argued in favour of the <i>prima facie</i> concept as against the conclusive concept. Whether I was right or wrong in regard to making the excessive concentration of alcohol in the blood an absolute offence, I accept the proposal of the Minister to make it an absolute offence now.  It is worth recording that, if the then Minister and his advisers had not made so many things conclusive, had not used the measure to make certificates of the doctor and of the bureau conclusive evidence, the legislation would have stood up and would not have proved unworkable.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his introductory speech, the regulations which his predecessor made under the 1968 Act provided elaborate procedures for taking samples of blood, for analysing them and for conveying the result of the analyses to the Garda.  These were challenged in the courts from time to time and many dismissals were obtained. One of the fundamental objections to the Bill was brought to the Supreme Court, which ruled that a certificate which purported to be conclusive evidence against the accused was unconstitutional.  That was a vital <Col N="2016" /> flaw in the 1968 Act.  It resulted in the introduction of the 1973 Act, which attempted to cure the constitutional flaw.  If the Minister had not sought to make the evidence of the certificate conclusive we might not be here this evening.</P>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to reduce the permitted concentration of alcohol in the blood from 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres to 100 milligrammes per 100 millilitres.  That is a reduction of at least 20 per cent.  Many think that it should be reduced still further to 80 milligrammes per 100 millilitres. Those who put forward that argument say that in fixing it at 100 milligrammes we are higher than many other countries.  That is only partially so, because in considering the permitted concentration of alcohol in the blood we must bear in mind that we are not using the concentration of alcohol in the blood as corroborative evidence of drunken driving, that we are not using that to back up visual evidence of drunken driving or the evidence of a doctor in regard to drunken driving.  Here, as distinct from other countries, we have a new and absolute offence of driving with this concentration of alcohol in the blood. If the technical proof shows that a driver has this concentration of alcohol in the blood then, irrespective of whether he produces the best medical evidence or other evidence to show that he was still capable of driving a motor car and exercising perfect control over it, he is still guilty of the offence created in 1968, which is being reinforced now on a sticter basis. That is the difference between us and most other countries.  If we had time to go through the various other countries we would find that in a great percentage of them there are two tiers of offence&mdash;driving while impaired and driving while seriously impaired&mdash;and the concentration of alcohol is used as <i>prima facie</i> or corroborative evidence. For that reason the reduction from 125 to 100 milligrammes was necessary and reasonable.  According to this report, three small whiskies or two-and-a-half pints will amount to 100 milligrammes.  This is a reasonable step forward, a reasonable tightening of the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2017" /> The Bill also increases the penalties from the present figure to a maximum of £500 and leaves the imprisonment penalty at six months.  Many people would agree that these penalties, especially the imprisonment penalty, is not sufficient and that a person who takes a car out while unfit to control it should be subject to a heavier penalty than six months' imprisonment. For an explanation of the £500 and the six months we must look to the Constitution. I say that in explanation of what the Minister is doing because the Supreme Court has ruled, I think, that where a fine of a greater sum than £500 is provided the offence in question ceases to be one fit to be tried summarily in the District Court.</P>
    <P>I think the Supreme Court has ruled also that where a sentence of imprisonment is longer than six months the offence ceases to be an offence fit to be tried summarily in the District Court in accordance with our Constitution. If that is so, if we were to impose sentences of more than six months and fines of more than £500, if the end result was that cases of drunken driving could not be tried by a district justice but had to be tried by a judge and jury we must be frank with ourselves and admit that we would have fewer convictions rather than more.  That is the reason that the penalties are as provided here.</P>
    <P>In this modern age, in which a motor car is regarded as indispensable, when people will do almost anything to get a motor car on the best terms possible, including votes for Fianna Fáil&mdash;as the last general election showed when the carrot of no road tax was held out to the electorate&mdash;the most effective deterrent, nearly as effective as imprisonment, is the penalty of taking away a driver's licence.  A young man at present will regard himself nearly as well off in prison as being at large without his motor car.  The Minister has left the mandatory disqualification period of 12 months for the first offence as it was in 1933, as it was repeated in 1968.  The Minister might have considered increasing this.  A forward step was taken by one of the Ministers predecessors in office.  I think <Col N="2018" /> it was the late Deputy Everett, a member of the Labour Party and a Minister for Justice in a Coalition Government, when he divested himself of the right in certain cases to restore driving licences removed by the court.  Until that bold and brave step was taken Ministers for Justice were under all sorts of pressure from their supporters and people in the country generally to restore driving licences taken from people for a variety of offences, including that of drunken driving.  Since that time in 1948, or whenever it was, no Minister for Justice ever sought to take back the power of restoring a driver's licence which had been taken from him by the courts.  Now one must go back to the courts to have one's licence restored. I am in agreement with the fine of £500 and the six months' imprisonment for the reasons stated in regard to the jurisdiction of the courts.  However, perhaps the question should have been considered of increasing the period of disqualification.</P>
    <P>The next thing the Bill does is to close, in a constitutional way, a lot of the loopholes that became apparent in the Acts of 1968 and 1973.  As the Minister said, those Acts made certain certificates&mdash;whether signed by the doctor or bureau&mdash;absolute evidence. The Supreme Court held that that was an intrusion into the rights of the courts and in effect was administering justice which is reserved by the Constitution for courts presided over by judges appointed in accordance with the Constitution.  It is now proposed that these certificates will not constitute absolute evidence but will be evidence against the accused until the accused proves the contrary.  I admit&mdash; and this is one of the things that worries me about the Bill&mdash;that there are cases in which it will just not be possible for the accused person to rebut those certificates even if, for example, the samples of blood were not properly taken.  That is one of the drawbacks in the Bill.  However, I suppose that is one of the things we must balance against the protection of the innocent person who is in danger of being slaughtered by drunken drivers and the freedom of the individual.  But <Col N="2019" /> there are precedents for it.  We are not embarking on new ground.  The old Customs Consolidation Act of 1896, I think it was, contained a similar provision. Many Acts passed by this Oireachtas in more recent times contained this limited shifting of the onus of proof.  It is not something that is to be encouraged.  Indeed it is only right to say, on behalf of this party, that it is not something this party would lightly agree to or accept&mdash;that this is not to be taken as <i>carte blanche</i> or an unqualified precedent.</P>
    <P>We will have sufficient time&mdash;if I do not speak too long&mdash;to go through this Bill section by section.  However, let me make one general remark.  It was said in the Seanad and elsewhere that what we need in this country is a bit of education in regard to our drinking habits and in regard to the spending of our spare time, particularly in regard to the latter.  I do not speak as a tetotaller or as somebody who does not tolerate alcohol, far from it, but I am convinced that we do not know how to use our spare time in a sensible, healthy and harmless way.  We are moving into an age when everybody has more spare time.  It is not so long ago that many people worked six days a week.  We have passed from that to the five-and-a-half-day, into the five-day week, and we may be moving on towards the four-and-a-half-day week. I am afraid that most people in the country regard the lounge bar with its facilities as the only acceptable place in which to spend their spare time.  It is not so very long ago that there was a carnival craze in this country, in the form of large marquees, with dancing seven nights a week.  There was nothing wrong with that; there was the attitude associated with it, but there was no way that such a carnival would be a success unless it was cited convenient to a public house.</P>
    <P>We have now moved out of the carnival era and today we have the dance, the hop and the disco.  There is only one way in which these are a success and that is if they are held inside a public house.  I believe that is due to the fact that we have not sufficient <Col N="2020" /> experience or knowledge of other ways of enjoying ourselves other than drinking and it is high time there was established here a Minister with responsibility for leisure.</P>

If one accepts the principle that human life is sacred, then it is sacred on our roads just as much as it is sacred in any other walk of life. Our discretionary control on our roads is limited because of mechanical defects, weather conditions and so on but, to the extent that individual drivers have discretionary control over the lives of others on our roads, this legislation is an absolute necessity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has given us the history of the previous legislation.  All of us are well aware of the loopholes and defects in the 1968 Act.  Anything that closes the loopholes availed of by lawyers for the benefit of people, who on the face of it were guilty of putting human life at risk on a discretionary basis, is acceptable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell, on Committee Stage, will deal with the permitted level of alcohol.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, there is a pattern of social behaviour which revolves around drinking until fairly late at night. Drinking goes on long after public transport has ceased to operate.  The majority of people now live in urban areas within reach of a public transport service.  It seems to me therefore <Col N="2021" /> that, if we really want this legislation to work as against merely bringing a great many prosecutions under it, which is not, I think, the intention anyway, there must be some alternative method whereby people can travel home safely, after having had three or four drinks, without breaking the law.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be one of the critical points when it comes to implementing the provisions of the Bill.  I can see a situation where someone will be stopped by a garda, tested and found to have an excess of alcohol in his blood.  That person could make the case that he was not drunk.  An unacceptable level of alcohol is an absolute offence; but, if he has no other method of getting home, there will have to be some recognition of that fact.  I am not now talking of someone down in Kerry in the Minister of State's, Deputy O'Leary's, constituency. It would probably be much easier for him to get home than it would be for someone on St. Stephen's Green at two o'clock in the morning.  Unfortunately that can be the reality and I would like to see the Minister recognising that.  Hopefully, the Bill will have a major impact on the way in which people behave socially but, if they want to ensure they do not break the law, some kind of facilities by way of alternative transport will have to be found for them.</P>
    <P>One must consider practicalities.  If people lose their licences there will be pressure on the courts and others, because cars are required to enable these people to do their jobs.  They will be disqualified simply because they had three or four pints but were perfectly capable of driving.  I am trying to underline one of the impacts and suggesting that some form of alternative transport should be available.  I would hope the Minister between now and the drafting of the regulations would consult with the Minister for Tourism and Transport and CIE as to the possibility of a late night skeletal public transport service in major towns and cities so that no one could stand up in a court and state that he had no other way of getting home other than his own car.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is only right and proper to put on the record the concern I have at the delay in introducing this Bill.  In October 1977 the Director of Public Prosecutions indicated that he was no longer able to enforce the law under the 1961 and 1968 Acts as amended, in particular in relation to the breathalyser.  That was the signal for immediate action.  That action was not forthcoming from this Government. I have to put on record my condemnation of them for the delay in this regard.  I appreciate the complexities involved but this was something to which extreme urgency, extreme priority, should have been given.  In the first quarter of 1978 we had an increase in road deaths from 81 to 149 and in the injury total from 1,400 to over 2,000.  I trace a large part of those increases to the fact that our roads were open for the drunken driver because the breathalyser legislation was not operable.</P>
      <P>I heartily welcome the introduction of the Bill at this late stage except for one point.  Tonight we are spending a total of three-and-a-half hours putting this Bill through all Stages.  I accept that the pressure for so doing came from this side of the House, but we wanted to ensure that this legislation would be on the Statute Book before the recess.  This Bill when enacted will gain the attention of lawyers all over the country who, I can assure the House, will spend a lot longer than three-and-a-half hours studying its provisions.  They will be doing so as part of their job to defend people charged thereunder.  We had the problem of the 1968 Act and the regulations made thereunder and we all know the loopholes that were discovered therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the way to put through legislation of this nature.  I believe that good legislation requires proper passage by way of discussion on the floor of the House and a teasing out of the various sections, a fine-combing as it were.  The one worry I have at this stage is that the fine-combing necessary for a Bill of this nature, and which will not be given now, will be given in other forums throughout the country, to wit, the courts of justice. <Col N="2023" /> My fear is that in so doing many of the apparently small points will result in defendants being able to evade the terms of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope we are not putting on the Statute Book an Act which will result in several coaches-and-four being driven through it but I am afraid the danger is there.  I know from my days as a practising lawyer of the careful attention given to words, commas and phrases in preparing a defence on a serious charge for any defendant.  That is the care and attention that will be given by the lawyers to this legislation and that is the care and attention that should be given to it by this House. Unfortunately in the situation we are in, time is not being made available for so doing.  I appreciate the time is not available before the recess but this Bill should have been before the House months ago.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Bill in general meet with approval from all sides.  There may be a point or two raised for discussion but in general the spirit behind the Bill is acceptable.  There are two basic things I would like to suggest. Again drawing on my experience as a practising lawyer, it always struck me as unjust and unfair that a person who was hopelessly drunk and driving a mechanically propelled vehicle received the same penalty as somebody who was slightly over the limit.  It is all very well to look at the penalties of £500 and six months' imprisonment and so on in the Bill, but the practical situation is that the main deterrent, the main penalty, imposed by the courts is the automatic 12 months' disqualification. If one assessed the record of drunken driving offences under section 49 and the cases which were successfully brought to a conclusion under the old breathalyser legislation, one would find in 99 per cent of the cases that this was the main penalty imposed. The monetary penalty was virtually of no consequence.  I believe it would be better law and a greater deterrent to have a situation where somebody who is slightly over the limit would receive a certain disqualification and somebody who was seriously over the limit would receive a greater disqualification. <Col N="2024" /> I suggest, when any future revision of this legislation takes place, that a penalty of a graduated period of disqualification, depending on the alcohol level, might be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this Bill will solve the problem of drunken driving, of the deaths and carnage on our roads, unless, at the same time, it is accompanied by a positive effort on the part of the Government and the people to re-educate our public attitude in regard to drink.  Too often we have the conception of the drunken driver as the hard man, the man who is either in receipt of sympathy or merriment but never is regarded as somebody who, while behind the wheel of a car, could be a lethal killer.  This is something that will have to be brought home to the people.  Deterrents will help but I am suggesting that a positive campaign along the lines of advertising through the newspapers and television planned in a proper fashion will probably achieve a greater result.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House approve of the spirit of this Bill and are prepared to co-operate in every way with its passage.  We are anxious that it should achieve the effect which is desired. I am somewhat concerned with the fact that this Bill will not commence immediately on being enacted; it will require a commencement date to be ordered by the Minister.  I appreciate that a certain number of regulations will have to be brought into force to enable it to be implemented. I assume that these regulations have already been fully prepared, that the ground has been laid to put this Bill into action straightaway.  I would ask the Minister to give me an assurance that this Bill will be in operation within a matter of days or weeks rather than a matter of months. Otherwise our rushing the Bill through the House tonight will be of no avail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>: Although I appreciate that the time for discussion of this Bill is short and while not wishing to delay the House there are a few brief comments I should like to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other Deputies I welcome the Bill but I am surprised and a little annoyed, too, at the delay <Col N="2025" /> that has occurred in bringing this legislation before the House.  I was surprised, too, to hear the Minister say that some long discussions had to take place first.  On four or five occasions during my term as Minister loopholes were found by clever lawyers in the legislation that existed then. With due respect to those two lawyers who are present.  I have no admiration for the clever lawyer who goes to the trouble of finding a loophole in legislation of this kind in order to have acquitted some drunken lout who has killed or injured people on the road. Because loopholes were found in the Act the excellent officials in the Department took the necessary steps to remedy the situation, but the Act continued to operate.</P>
    <P>I was appalled that the Director of Public Prosecutions saw fit to cancel the legislation, because so long as the general body of drinkers were under the impression that the Act was in existence they were deterred to some extent from driving while under the influence of alcohol.  At least, many of them were afraid to drink too much before driving, but once the Act had been put into cold storage there was a huge increase in the number of deaths on the road.  For the past 12 months the situation has been becoming increasingly worse.  For the more than four years that I had the privilege of being in the Minister's seat I was delighted that with the co-operation of everybody concerned, particularly those in the National Road Safety Association and in other road safety organisations, the number of people being killed on the road was decreasing all the time.  But if only one person were killed, that would be one too many.  Suddenly, however, the trend went the other way, and there is no reason for that change other than the cancellation of the legislation, which led to the creation of an impression among some drinkers that they could do as they wished.</P>
    <P>Would anybody suggest that a person be given a loaded gun and sent out onto the roads seeking somebody to shoot?  There is a corollary between such a hypothesis and the drunken driver.  Somebody said recently that it <Col N="2026" /> was a drunken driver's own affair if he should have an accident, but unfortunately that is not the case, because the drunken driver puts at risk also the lives of those other road users who may not have had as much as a drink.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that drink is only one of the reasons for people being killed on the road, but I recall some years ago a test being undertaken at a well-known hospital as a result of which it was found that in 80 per cent of road deaths the alcohol intake of the victim had been greater than the limit permitted.  Recently I heard a commentator on radio say that this is still the figure.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that the proposal to reduce the intake level by one-fifth is correct, but I think we should be much more strict.  Those of us who have been abroad are aware of what is the situation on the Continent. For instance, in Sweden if one drinks at all one is not allowed to drive, so that people there going out for a night are sensible enough to arrange for somebody to drive who will not take a drink for that evening.  There is no such situation here.  People like to think of themselves as the hard men or women when they are drinking, that they must take the few extra drinks. The result of this sort of thinking is that night after night people are seen coming from public houses and being helped into their cars by friends and then proceeding to drive home.  It is only a matter of luck that far more people are not killed as a result of such behaviour.  The regulation should be as tight as possible.  As has been pointed out already, people should be made aware that it will not be necessary for them to have a half dozen whiskeys or ten or 11 pints of beer before being unfit to drive, that three half ones or approximately two-and-a-half pints of beer will put them beyond the statutory limit.  That point should be publicised as much as possible.  Although it may be argued that a person can consume drink in relation to his physical size and that, consequently, a big person could take more than a small person, the limits that are being set are considered suitable criteria for a normal person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> The Act should be put into operation as quickly as possible.  If necessary, the President should be asked to sign it as it emerges but definitely before the tourist season reaches its peak, and that is near at hand.  It is a time when many people are killed on the roads. I am not speaking as a member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association because we are not intolerant, as Deputy Fitzpatrick seemed to suggest we were, of alcohol in any circumstances. We do not object to people having a drink provided they can carry it, but if they must drink they should take steps to ensure that they are not afterwards the cause of tragedy either for themselves or for somebody else.</P>
    <P>Even if some smart guy finds a loophole in the new Bill, the Minister should ensure that it is not cancelled, because to cancel the legislation would result in the carnage starting all over again.  This is merely an amending Bill, but since there has been such a delay in dealing with the matter it would have been better to have introduced a whole new Bill dealing with every item that could possibly cause trouble.  If the Constitution is the cause of preventing more severe penalties being imposed at district court level, it is time that this additional reason for bringing in a new Constitution be used by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank the Deputies for their contributions and for their co-operation in the Bill's passage through the House.  This is an indication of their awareness of the seriousness of the matter involved.  Both Deputies Fitzpatrick and O'Keeffe referred to the lack of opportunity to debate the Bill and to the long delay that has occurred since the previous Act was suspended by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I assure the House that this delay was unavoidable. The Bill could not have been introduced before now because it was not ready.  I would have wished dearly to have been able to introduce it in the week after the Act had been suspended, but I am sure Deputies will agree that it was very important to go into detail regarding the reasons for the failure of the other legislation and <Col N="2028" /> to bring in legislation that will work rather than to bring in another Bill in which loopholes would be found also. This involved consultations with the legal profession, with the Attorney General's Office and indeed with some of those members of the legal profession who found the loopholes in the last order to ensure that we do not fail this time.  Of course, neither I nor anybody else can guarantee that loopholes will not be found in this Bill, but it is our sincere hope and belief that it will succeed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick gave us a good <i>exposé</i> of the difference between conclusive evidence and the <i>prima facie</i> type of evidence.  He dealt with this very well, and I would like to express my appreciation of that fact.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said that persons prosecuted may not be able to dispute evidence of certificates sent to the court. Under the 1968 Act a person who gave a specimen could ask for a second analysis by the medical bureau.  This Bill now provides that the subject concerned will at the Garda Station be given a separate part of the specimen sealed which he can take away for independent analysis, the results of which he can bring into evidence during his defence.  Deputy Quinn made a case for providing public transport for people who want to go out to do some late drinking, or some form of transport to transport them home.  I believe that this kind of amenity would be an encouragement to people to take the extra drink.  I do not wish to be over critical of the suggestion, but that is my reaction to it.  We cannot provide that service under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the time taken to bring in the Bill.  He said that a long debate&mdash;regrettably we cannot have it now and have the Bill&mdash;would have served to ensure that the Bill would be amended if necessary to ensure that it is workable.  There was a very long debate in 1968.  I came in then and I think it was debated before I arrived.  The legal people then found the loopholes.  Surely it was more beneficial to go into the reasons why those were found before bringing in the Bill, to try to close the gaps which existed in the previous Act, <Col N="2029" /> and to bring in a workable Bill.  If the choice had to be between that and the long debate plus a short research programme into the Bill the opening is left for the legal profession again to do the same as they did the last time.  I would prefer to have had a longer debate, in fairness to all the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully regretted that the DPP suspended the Bill.  As he probably knows, neither I nor any of my colleagues or any Government have any control over the decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It was purely a matter for him.  Deputy Tully also suggested that I might ensure it would not happen again.  There is no way that I know of that I could ensure that if he decided to suspend any section of this Bill at any time in the future we could stop him.</P>

In studying the Bill I noticed references to drug, alcohol and an intoxicant, which is a word used in section 10.  Is there any danger that, by specifically providing for an apparatus for indicating the concentration of alcohol in the breath or blood, power is not being provided to the bureau to assess the level or effect <Col N="2032" /> of drugs?  Is there any danger of there being a loophole in the Bill because power is not given to the bureau to deal with an intoxicant?  There is a specific reference to apparatus in relation to alcohol.  As there is not a specific reference, and therefore a specific power, in regard to drugs or the other item defined in the Bill as an intoxicant, is there any danger that the bureau may be considered not to be empowered to approve apparatus in regard to those items?  It is a technical point.</P>

Subsection (2) (b) refers to alcohol in the blood or urine and to the presence of drugs in the urine.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 37, to delete &ldquo;100&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;80&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that there must be no delay in pushing this Bill through both Houses, but I would be failing in my duty as a legislator and as a medical doctor were I to allow this Bill to go through with provision for a level of 100 milligrammes of alcohol as the upper legal limit.  When the 1968 Bill was introduced I tried to persuade my colleagues that a level of 80 milligrammes was the upper limit of normal, but I must confess that I failed to persuade them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must make the charge that vested interests in this House are opposed to the lower level and it is a terrible shame that we should bow to these pressures.  I am sorry to have to make these charges but lives are at stake and we are obliged to do something about it.  There is no argument in favour of a limit above 80 milligrammes of <Col N="2034" /> alcohol.  There is no rational argument in favour of it in 12 countries&mdash; Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Spain, Switzerland, UK, West Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.  In eight of them the upper limit is 80 and in the remaining four the upper limit is 50.</P>
    <P>As a doctor I would say that the lower limit of 50 be applied but I know I would be asking for too much and therefore I opted for 80 milligrammes. Above the limit of 50 milligrammes of alcohol, driving skill becomes significantly impaired.  The reflex reactions and general responsiveness are blunted above that level. Above 80 milligrammes no person is capable of driving a car.  It has been proved in all these civilised countries in Europe that drivers are killers above 80 milligrammes.</P>
    <P>I know that vested interests are still pleading for a limit of 100 milligrammes&mdash;the publicans and the alcohol industry.  It would be a shame if we were to bow to them when we know that arguments exist in favour of the lower law limit of 80.  In Britain serious consideration is presently being given to lowering the level to 50.  I know the Minister is a sincere and honest man and I appeal to him seriously to consider the amendment.  I did not put down the amendment for the sake of argument.  We could go happily into the recess knowing we had done a responsible job as legislators. I am confident that we are taking this carnage on the roads seriously and doing something positive about it.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept the sincerity of the Deputy's contribution and his intention in what he is trying to do. The figure was formerly 125.  We decided to reduce it by 20 per cent to 100.  I should like to think that this Bill will not solely catch the drunken or incapable driver but will have a deterrent effect on many people.  That is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the average level in the past in the case of people prosecuted was around 200, a disgraceful level by any standard.  Deputy O'Connell named <Col N="2035" /> other countries, and I accept the low figures which he gave for each of these, but it is also true that many of these countries have a two-tier system.  For instance, Sweden is very tough in regard to drunken driving and puts people in jail for week-ends and releases them to work for the remainder of the week.  They have a figure of 50 at one end and 120 at the other.  Some member States of the EEC also have the two-tier system, ranging in some countries for the more serious offence to 150.  Even in Northern Ireland they have figures of 80 and 120 as far as I remember.</P>
    <P>While many have a figure as low as 50, not too many have the single figure of 80 or less.  Some operate on a single figure basis.  The country that compares exactly with us&mdash;I do not say their history is good on that account&mdash;is the United States.  We consider that a drop from 125 to 100 was appreciable, something that would really hit the public attention and bring home to them the seriousness of what was happening on the roads.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody should think that if a person is asked to submit to breath analysis and found to be under 100, perhaps as low as 50, he is immune, I should say that if such person appears to the garda to be incapable and unfit to drive, he is not immune from prosecution and may be charged on clinical evidence&mdash;I think that is how the legal personnel refer to it.  People will be no more immune than in the past.  Prosecutions can be brought under different Acts or sections just as people were prosecuted since the suspension of the previous legislation without use of the breathalyser or urine or blood tests.  A number of people have been prosecuted on clinical evidence and convicted.  I want to make that clear.  It is very important that nobody should assume that if he is under 100 and seen to be incapable of driving he will be immune from prosecution.  He can be proceeded against.</P>
    <P>We decided to drop the figure from 125 to 100.  We believe this will bring home very forcibly to the public what <Col N="2036" /> is involved and how serious a view we take of this in common with members of the other parties.  If it is found that this Bill will not have the desired effect it will be reasonably easy to amend this section or the few sections involved and reduce the figure to 80.  We should at least give the proposed new figure a trial.  I believe, as many others believe, that it will have the desired effect.  If it fails and we still have many people being killed and maimed on the roads as a result of drunken driving we shall have no alternative but to bring the figure down further. We will do this if necessary.  A further ground for our decision to put the figure at 100 was that if you go through the report of the 1968 Commission on which many professions and sections of our society were represented&mdash;legal, medical, Garda and many others&mdash;you find that there was a difference of opinion and eventually they recommended 125 after a long deliberation.  That was included in the 1968 Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, we are prepared to amend if this Bill is found not to have the desired effect, but we believe it will achieve the desired results because of the 20 per cent drop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As I said in my Second Stage contribution there are pros and cons in regard to the proposal for a lower permitted alcohol content than 125 milligrammes.  But in considering the matter and in making comparisons with other countries we should bear in mind that we are introducing or confirming an absolute offence.  That is very important.  In some countries the concentration of alcohol is used as evidence of drunkenness or inability to drive a car which can be rebutted by medical or lay evidence.  Here that evidence cannot be rebutted.  The driver found with more than 100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood when this Act is law will not be able to call any evidence to show that notwithstanding that finding he is fit to drive.  Whether he is fit or not he will suffer the penalty exactly in the same way as the drunken driver, fine, perhaps prison and certainly will be put off the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> In other countries also, as has been said, there is a two-tier system.  There is the offence of driving while impaired, driving while badly impaired or driving when unfit to drive.  We are having one offence only.  According to the information I have I reckon that 80 milligrammes would be the equivalent of three small whiskeys approximately. A survey carried out by a road safety organisation of 5,000 suspects brought in by the police&mdash;I do not know whether here or in England&mdash;showed that 50 per cent of those suspects had over 200 milligrammes of alcohol or had consumed about a half bottle of whiskey.  I do not represent any vested interest, either the publicans or distilling or brewing interests, but I think that a reasonable approach to this matter in the first instance is that we are bringing down the permitted amount from 125 to 100 milligrammes.  That is a substantial amount.  The real deterrent will be to frighten people and to bring home to them the consequences of drinking and driving.  The Bill can be amended later by a one-line Bill if no other flaws are found in it and if it is thought at some stage that the permitted level should be 80 milligrammes. Those are my views of the Bill, having read it and having considered the position in other countries where they have different types of offences and a two-tier system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister did not surprise us in his response.  While his offer to review the Bill was welcome, unless the Department and the National Road Safety Association are prepared to establish an elaborate monitoring system the offer is meaningless.  If this Bill goes through without our amendment and if there is some reduction in road accidents, as one would reasonably anticipate, without the review and without adequate monitoring we will not be able to know if it could have been more effective had the level been lower.  I should like the Minister to comment on what proposals the Government have, either directly or through the National Road Safety Association, with regard to this matter. That is our first response to the Minister's offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2038" /> The point comes back to the basic principle around which this amending legislation hangs, namely, the question of the sacredness of human life and the function of this legislation, which in the main will be its deterrent effect. The fact that we know the law exists hopefully will deter many people from drinking and driving.  Nobody in this House seriously expects that the Garda, with the limitations on overtime and in view of their other responsibilities, will be able to man every road in the country during the weekend in order to stop cars and implement the breathalyser test.  As we see it, the legislative intent is in the deterrent component.</P>
    <P>The Minister is of the view that a reduction to 100 milligrammes is adequate.  Our view is that the dramatic increase in road deaths, as instanced by Deputy O'Keeffe on Second Stage, is too great to rely on the reduction proposed by the Minister.  For example, if it was found that we were saving too many lives&mdash;if one could accept the nonsense of that argument, to reverse the Minister's offer on its head &mdash;we could relax the provision in a year's time and bring it up to the 100 level.  Significantly, the Minister is not opting on that side.  He is opting the other way around.  It will not give much consolation to the relatives of those killed on the roads.  Nobody has attempted to calculate the actual financial cost to the State in the case of a road fatality.  It is a rather macabre thing to do, but insurance companies sometimes get walloped with the court's assessment of the financial cost, which is based on a somewhat weird system of assessment.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is proposing to write into the legislation a major deterrent to avoid the unnecessary killing of human life.  In its own right that is an acceptable objective, but there is also a materialistic objective in that any death, from the time the ambulance is called out until the burial of the deceased, costs the State an enormous amount immediately.  It can also be reflected in the loss in terms of investment from the time the person was born, taking into account the education he received, not to mention the emotional stress caused to the relatives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> Constant monitoring is essential, and without it the Minister's offer is meaningless. He did not indicate in his proposal that it was his intention to have a strict monitoring or that he would review the level after a year based on statistics to be made available to all Members of the House and unfortunately we cannot accept his offer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have listened with interest to the views expressed.  My comments are an attempt to present a balanced approach to this issue and not as my party did in the Seanad where this amendment was introduced, to push the viewpoint totally to reduce the level from 100 to 80 milligrammes. I say that from the practical point of view it appears this is not acceptable to the Government.  I put the view in the hope that it will make an impression on the Minister, who has an honest and sincere approach to this problem of road deaths, and in an effort to secure some kind of guarantee by way of figures being produced that can be assessed by the House and also a guarantee that amending legislation will be produced if necessary.</P>
      <P>A few points occur to me in relation to the controversy as to whether we should have a figure of 125, 100 or 80. The figure of 125 milligrammes was suggested by a commission some years ago.  Road deaths have increased quite considerably since then, as has the number of vehicles.  I do not think the fact that there was such a high figure ten years ago would have the same relevance today because of those factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, it appears that positive law must have public support to be implemented fully.  I detect a feeling among probably a relatively large section of the community of considerable toleration for drunken driving.  I come back to the suggestion I made on Second Stage that this toleration will have to be eroded, and it is all the more important in the context of this suggestion and our discussion of what we might do in the future in relation to this matter.  If there is a strong reaction at the moment against too low a level there <Col N="2040" /> is a danger that it will be totally unacceptable to a large section of the community.  I would not go out on a limb either way.  I accept the point made by my colleague.  I should like to see a constant review of the operation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>From experience I can bear out the figures given by the Minister.  Most of the breathalyser certificates I have seen were in excess of 200 and I have seen some of them well up to 300.  It is these appallingly high figures we must stop first because anybody driving a car in that situation is so reckless that it is tantamount to a common law offence.  What I should like to see the Minister doing is monitoring the results. I do not think that would be too difficult.  Then we could have an analysis at six monthly intervals of results shown by the bureau.  If the Minister were to assure us he will do this and make figures available at regular intervals and that he will review the situation accordingly I would accept that he is making a genuine approach to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the question of monitoring, there are monthly reports compiled by the Garda and sent to my Department.  There is monthly monitoring in that way, and An Foras Forbartha bring out an annual report based on the figures.  If the figures were appallingly bad we should not wait for such an annual report.  I suggest that the monthly monitoring will serve to reassure the House that we will know what is going on, that we will know if it becomes necessary to reduce the level from 100 to 80.  It is all-important to know that we will have monthly monitoring&mdash;that we will not have to wait for an annual report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>: In all serious or fatal road accidents, is the blood alcohol level taken?  That is the only way we can monitor properly.  That is what we must undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is not possible to do it in the case of every road accident. If a garda believes that drinking is involved he will take the necessary action, but if an unfortunate person is killed it will rest with the <i>post mortem</i>. <Col N="2041" /> That information is available from <i>post mortem</i> examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept the Chair's concern about the time, but if this section were got over it would be plain sailing from then on.  From reading the Bill I am not clear about how this will work.  I am talking about medical monitoring in the Medical Bureau and whether monthly figures of such monitoring would be made available.  If a person is stopped by a garda and if the garda forms the opinion that the person is drunk and that he should take the breath test, and if that test shows that the alcohol level is so much, what we should like to know in order to make sense of this whole thing is the number of tests that were above 100 and the number between 80 and 100. Then we would have a percentage.  It is not clear from the Bill what the procedure will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: If blood samples were taken and sent to the bureau we would get the reports.  In the case of road deaths it would be a matter for the <i>post mortem</i>.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have got to examine reports and correlate the blood alcohol levels and the number of road accidents.  I am suggesting that in every serious road accident blood tests should be taken and the reports of them published.  There are many serious non-fatal accidents in which people are maimed for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): There were 192 people killed on the roads in the first four months of 1978, an increase of 50 per cent on the same period last year.  It is generally admitted in regard to mechanically propelled vehicles that the two greatest causes of accidents were alcohol and speed, and I do not <Col N="2042" /> think we can analyse one without having regard to the other.  I submit that the Road Traffic Act simply is not being enforced.  When did anybody see a speed trap on any of our roads?  I believe the gardaí have been called off road traffic work.  Anybody who reads local newspaper reports of court cases will see it is rare to have anybody charged with speeding, although we all know there are cars flying through the country at speeds of between 70 and 85 mph when the national speed limit is 60.  One could be accused of speaking softly about driving while drunk but here we are pulling down the permitted consumption of beer to two pints, if my mathematics are correct.</P>
      <P>That was a move in the right direction, but we are now in a period when the number of cars on the roads is multiplying and the national speed limit is being ignored.  The Minister and the Minister for Justice should direct their attention also to that aspect of the slaughter.  Perhaps I could be accused of getting into politics when I say this.  Since the troubles in Northern Ireland and since the Garda have been used for other purposes, and with the cutback in overtime, there is simply no presence of road traffic enforcement gardaí on the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: The kind of information we would like in a monthly or quarterly form from the medical bureau would be: the number of cars stopped by the Garda, first, to get the total samples, and the number of people who in the opinion of the Garda needed to take the breath tests and consequently the number of people who had a blood or urine specimen taken: from that specimen, the percentage over 100 level and the number between the level of 80 and 100.  The latter components of that list are the critical ones.  Without that kind of information it would be very difficult to make sense of a review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the question of the medical bureau dealing with the number <Col N="2043" /> of people stopped by the Garda, this cannot be done by the bureau. The medical bureau can deal with the number of samples over the limit in the Bill, whether blood or urine.  They cannot relate them to any specific accidents.  They will make monthly reports based on their tests and analyses. The Garda will make their monthly reports.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are talking here about the alchometer and the refusal to take the test, and it is a good defence to the charge of refusing to take the test from the alchometer to show that the defendant offered to permit a designated registered medical practitioner to take a specimen of his blood.  Will there be an obligation on the arresting officer to indicate to the defendant that he has this option, that he can nominate a designated medical practitioner to take a sample of blood in lieu of the test which he has just refused? This seems to be an option which should be pointed out.  If the ordinary blood test is taken, that will prove the situation one way or another, but the defendant may not be aware of this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is an option for the person but the garda does not have to indicate that.  He can opt to give blood and if he chooses to do so he will have the opportunity, but it is not for the garda to point this out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: On this clarification of options, it seems that the regulations which are now in draft from should make it very clear that a person has the option of giving a blood or urine sample and should be asked.  If someone is asked to give a blood sample <Col N="2049" /> and refuse, he or she should be told that there is an option.  Many people could be quite nervous and upset by the process of being taken by the gardaí and they should be put at ease. The regulations should specify exactly what is happening and people should be told what their options are.  Someone who is arrested should not be expected to know the law to that extent in advance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister has the power under regulations to specify the way in which section 15 is to be administered. If I am right in assuming that, it would be positive and humane to indicate to people that someone who is brought to a place or to a garda station should be told in advance what is happening and why he is being brought there and what his options are under law.  I do not think it is up to that person to be in a legally informed position sufficient to assert his rights.  He may be under some form of stress.</P>

      <P>: In the last Act and the regulations made thereunder, there were very technical rules laid down and it was very much because of noncompliance with those rules or because of the failure to prove compliance with those rules, which was more often the case, that the system broke down.  The Minister has nudged the balance in favour of the prosecution to that extent. I can see reason for it, but at the same time it is important that a defendant should be given as much opportunity to be made aware of his or her rights. Even though the onus of proof is not now on the prosecution to prove A, B, C and D, there should be a standard procedure whereby a defendant is made <Col N="2050" /> fully aware of his or her rights under the Act and the options open.  Otherwise there would be an unfair bias against the defendant who could be in a totally nervous state not altogether related to drink.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: This section deals with procedures following the provision of specimens under the alchometer or failure to so provide.  The first point is one of draftmanship.  In subsection (1) there is reference to a person who provides a specimen of his blood and the alchometer indicates that he has committed an offence.  It is odd that the alchometer should indicate the commission of an offence.  Possibly the reading on the alchometer might indicate the offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is a small drafting point.  The second point is in regard to the requirement of the defendant to sign a document for a member of the Garda.  He gets a statement and acknowledges receipt of it by signing his name.  An offence is quoted for failure to sign his name.  What is the need for that?  Secondly, what would happen if the man was so drunk that he could not sign his name? Is this overdoing the situation? It is a bureaucratic approach. Not alone must we have this alchometer indicating a state of drunkenness but there is the absolute creation of an offence for failure to acknowledge receipt of such a statement by signing his name.  Is there a necessity for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <P>: He will be liable to three months in jail for refusing or being unable to sign his name on this document.  It does not matter whether it is a copy or not, an offence is created of refusing to sign a receipt. What is the need for him to sign a receipt for a statement setting forth his conviction as a result of the reading of the alchometer?  I am all in favour of strict enforcement of this law but I do not like to see unnecessary offences created.  This is a statutory offence subject to three months in jail for a man failing to sign his name for something that seems to be utterly unnecessary. I do not see the justification for it.  The point could arise that the man would be unable to sign his name yet there is an absolute liability on him to do so because the failure to do so makes him guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 and/or three months in jail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>: The first point the Deputy made is as to why it is necessary to ask a person to sign this duplicate.  I ask the Deputy to visualise the situation out on the side of the road where there is one garda and the person concerned.  That garda is entitled to have some evidence of the presence of that person there.  The signature on the duplicate is evidence of that.  If he has not some evidence the fellow could go away and say that he was not there at all.  If the man is so drunk as to be incapable of signing this duplicate he will have to be brought in anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: The follow-up to that would be that there may be a very good reason for carrying the receipt, in fact a <i>laissez passer</i>.  We are being theoretical about the possibility of this, but could someone be stopped, tested with an apparatus out on site, found by virtue of this process to have in excess of 100 milligrammes, sign the chit and then drive off?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The position under section 16 is that if a person who is detected is very drunk, so drunk that he does not know where he is going, he is obviously guilty of an offence and he will be charged under one or other of the sections and will be liable to six months in jail, a fine of £500 and disqualification for at least 12 months.  That is understandable, but this same man may be presented with a document which he is asked to sign and which he does not even see.  If he does not sign it he can be convicted of not signing it and sentenced to an additional three months or a substantial fine.  That seems to be creating an unnecessary additional offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not like this section which is a bit sinister in its approach.  Section 19 (1) provides that it shall be a good defence for a person who refuses to give a sample of his blood or urine to prove that he has a good reason for refusing to give a sample, presumably a good medical reason.  Subsection (2), which is a most objectionable section, goes on to say:</P>

    <P>Notwithstanding subsection (1) (b), evidence may be given at the hearing of a charge for an offence under section 49 or 50 of the Principal Act that the defendant refused or failed to permit the taking of a specimen of his blood.</P>
    <P>Presumably the prosecution will not even be obliged to say that he had a good reason for doing so.  That is going too far.  It concedes the entitlement of the person who has a good medical reason for not allowing his blood to be taken to refuse to have it taken, but then the prosecution, in a prosecution for clinical drunken driving, can trot out the offence to blacken the man by saying that he refused to have a sample of his blood taken.  I object to that section.</P>

In the latter case that always seemed to me to be unjust.  There should be some graduation of penalty.

      <P>: Postal deliveries in the areas in question have been running somewhat later than normal.  This is mainly due in the case of the Leixlip area mentioned to a new postman being unfamiliar with the area, a position which should rectify itself shortly. In the other area it is largely because of unsatisfactory house numbering, the correction of which is, I understand, having the attention of the residents concerned.  Continued housing growth is also a factor and in the light of it a review of delivery arrangements is at present being carried out with a view to improving delivery times where practicable.</P>

      <P>: The figures sought in the question, other than current strengths in the sub-districts of Portlaoise, Tullamore, Mountmellick, Abbeyleix and Birr, are as set out below.  Because of security considerations relating to the protection of Portlaoise Prison, strengths in these sub-districts have been increased, but it would not be in the public interest to disclose details.</P>

However, the USSR has not done so.  In general, parties to the Food Aid Convention are cereal-exporting countries, whereas the USSR has been a net importer of cereals in recent years.  In the circumstances, therefore, I do not feel it would be appropriate for me to take the action proposed by the Deputy in relation to this particular matter.</P>
      <P>On a more general level, however, I can assure the Deputy that in various international fora, the member states of the Community, together with other OECD countries, have frequently urged the countries of Eastern Europe to take a more active part in aiding the countries of the developing world.</P>

Article 24 contains additional provisions which were introduced consequential on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976.  The idea of compulsory site notices was considered at the time but was rejected because of certain practical difficulties. I have received no complaints that the present provisions are unsatisfactory and consider that they should be allowed to operate for a reasonable period before any further change in the regulations is contemplated.</P>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 18 and 19 on 20 June, this particular alternative examination structure was introduced on a temporary and provisional basis from 1976 to 1979 inclusive and an evaluation of the project is now being undertaken by the curriculum unit of my Department.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I am prepared to arrange for the holding of the alternative examination again in 1980.</P>
