      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last Deputy Edward Collins asked that certain aspects of the treatment of a question tabled by him in January last should be investigated by me and a statement made to the House.</P>
      <P>The text of the question, as printed on the Order Paper, was&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education if he is aware of the unnecessary pressures being put on post-primary leaving certificate and matriculation examiners by the points system being used by university authorities as an entrance selection method; and if he will make a full statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>and this question was answered by the Minister on Wednesday last, 1 March. The Deputy states that the question tabled by him had the word &ldquo;examinee&rdquo; in the text and not &ldquo;examiner&rdquo; as printed.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should explain that the General Office are under instructions to process all questions without delay so that time is not lost in getting the questions to the Departments concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> Each question is read immediately by one of the staff and if it is clear to him that the question requires amendment which may affect the meaning he endeavours to contact the Member concerned to put the position to him. The General Office may also, without consultation with the Member, make grammatical and drafting changes where the meaning is not involved. The question is then typed on stencil and stencilled copies are sent by hand to the Department.</P>
    <P>In the case of Deputy Collins's question no change other than a lowering of capital letters was necessary.  The question was, however, in manuscript and I should explain here that the writing in many manuscript questions received from Members is difficult to read and in such cases the officers in the General Office clarify the outline of letters and words before passing the manuscript to the typist.  The writing in this particular question of Deputy Collins as in many others by the Deputy was of this nature.  In fact, 12 clarifications had to be made to it.  The officer did not, as suggested, write a letter &ldquo;r&rdquo; over the second last letter of the word now in issue.  He had to firm out the last half of the word which he clarified as &ldquo;iner&rdquo;.  The officer was sure the word was &ldquo;examiner&rdquo;.  Had there been any doubt in his mind as to the word in question the matter would have been queried with Deputy Collins.  I should mention that the question was on the Order Paper from 31 January last until it was answered on 1 March.</P>
    <P>Apart from the work done in the General Office on questions before they leave the office it will be appreciated that, as questions are dispatched very promptly to Departments, problems of order and so on may subsequently be discovered here in relation to a question and on the other hand a Department may seek clarification of something in a question.  The office endeavours to settle all such problems and where any doubt arises as to the intentions of the Member he is contacted and if unavailable the question may be temporarily withheld from the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>No queries or doubts were raised at <Col N="1035" /> any stage in relation to the question by Deputy Collins.  The staff dealing with questions in the General Office state that they were not asked to show the original version of the question to the Minister or his staff nor did they do so; neither did the Minister or his staff seek any clarification in relation to it or raise any point whatever on it. As I have already said, the question was on the Order Paper some five weeks.  In all that time the office had no intimation that there was anything amiss in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Collins's statement that he wrote the word &ldquo;examinees&rdquo;. I am sorry that the error occurred.  It is a very rare type of error.  I hope that we will not have another although it is obviously impossible to guarantee against a recurrence.  The best insurance against this sort of error is for Members to see to it that their questions are in typescript or where this is not feasible then in clearly legible manuscript and I would ask the co-operation of all in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for your attention to this matter.  I too regret what happened, especially in view of what the Minister said.  He stated that his own civil servants had raised a query on the question.  I took objection to the fact that in those circumstances his staff did not see fit to raise the query with me.  When the General Office queried what was intended, a reference should have been made to me.  I regret further the cheap political jibe of the Minister on the occasion he answered the question and I would ask him to withdraw his remarks.  I concur with the Chair and hope this will not recur.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1978: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House by going through every section. Last night I made the point that as I understood it the 10 per cent increase across the board would not be <Col N="1037" /> sufficient to alleviate hardship on many of our social welfare recipients in the event of a sudden increase in the cost of living, which in my view is inevitable.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to implement the 10 per cent increase in social welfare benefits, and the Minister has promised to keep them under review at all times.  He has told us he has proposals in relation to pensions and insurance for the self-employed.  I have great doubts about this being applied in certain areas and I will deal with that at the appropriate time.  The Minister has told us that a real increase will be effected in the standard of living due to these increases.  I am afraid that will be eroded long before 12 months and accordingly I am sorry there is not a proposal to give a second increase in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Old age pensioners are finding it increasingly difficult to get their due pensions because of delays in the processing of their claims.  It seems there has been a return to many years ago when each item of property was assessed as part of their means.  An increase of £1.25 in today's values is not enough.  Indeed it is a disgrace to offer that kind of increase to an old person who has had such difficult times and who has no hope of another improvement until next year.  There is a problem in regard to claim processing in cases where old age pensioners transfer their property or their holdings to relatives.  The transfer section of the Land Registry should be examined in detail in this respect.</P>
      <P>Unemployment assistance rates in both urban and rural areas have been increased.  This is welcomed.  However, there is a situation in which young men at present eligible for unemployment assistance are being assessed in an unfair way.  If they are staying at home the value of that as board and lodgings is being taken into account.  This reduces the allowances of some of those applicants to amounts as low as 50 pence.  This is an insult.  That form of assessment should be dropped and I urge the Minister to do so without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Farmer's dole&rdquo; is a term that has been bandied about for years.  Abuses <Col N="1038" /> in regard to that benefit have been highlighted to an enormous extent, a lot more than the good that has come out of it.  It was introduced as a purely temporary measure years ago and it is ironic that anybody who has used that assistance for the purpose for which it was designed is often criticised for being well off and still in receipt of this.</P>
    <P>There has not been an increase in benefit for people whose valuations are between £50 and £20.  In Connacht alone there are 11,028 people with valuations of between £15 and £20. All of these have been affected by the Minister's decision.  In Mayo there are 2,455 people with such valuations and they do not receive any increase this year.  Neither do those with valuations of more than £20.  They can have their allowances assessed on a factual basis, but in this regard I am afraid there is lack of recognition of the physical barriers these people have to cross, of the fragmented holdings and the low level of agricultural potential of the soil.  As a result, many such people have to work much harder than people on more compact agricultural units and due recognition has not been given to this.  Social welfare officers making factual assessments should walk each of the portions of such fragmented holdings to see for themselves how such social welfare applicants have to try to make a living.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in relation to farmers' assistance from the point of view of claim processing.  Because this applies only to the 12 western counties, I suggest that the Minister should consider decentralising that section of the Department.  We have adequate land banks in my constituency to provide a site for a new building.  It would speed up claims and centralise the office in the region in which the assistance is being paid.  It would provide some employment for building workers and it would facilitate the work of social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>The introduction of unemployment assistance for women is welcomed but I suggest the Minister should pay it retrospectively to the date the Government took office.  If these people are to <Col N="1039" /> be assessed on the same basis as young male applicants their payments will be very low.  This provision will increase the number on the live register by 50,000 to which we can add the 50,000 young males already on the register.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with the residence test for old age pensioners. It was time that was abolished and I am grateful to the Minister for having done it.  It affected a dwindling section of our people but it caused serious hardship for them.  I should like to suggest to him that people who retire from the US or Britain to Ireland should not have contributory pensions from those contries taken into account when being assessed here for old age pensions.  It was Disraeli who said that to be conscious one is ignorant of a fact is a great step to knowledge.  I do not know the legal implications as between the countries involved but it appears to me that when people return here to retire from another country, if originally they had to leave this country by necessity or by Government neglect and achieved their contributory pensions, through their own diligence and hard work in another country without any assistance from this country, they should be entitled to that pension and should not be assessed on it when they return here.</P>
    <P>The housekeeper allowance has been extended but I am worried because often the plight of a widower is much worse than that of a widow.  If a man's wife dies leaving four or five children he may have to give up a job to look after them.  If one of the children takes over the duties of housekeeper she may have to forfeit the right to education and consequently to a job later on.  I therefore urge the Minister to review this position.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine some anomalies which have existed and one of them is the bottled gas scheme. Nowadays there are very few parts of the country not serviced by electricity. I have been in touch with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to try to extend the provisions of the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1976 to cover many areas at present <Col N="1040" /> not qualifying.  Many old age pensioners regard gas as very dangerous and they are afraid to use it.</P>
    <P>The free telephone rental scheme is a very welcome move, but I ask the Minister to consult again with his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;who is busy at the moment&mdash;with a view to extending and according priority rating to those old age pensioner applicants.  The telephone to an isolated old age pensioner, whether in an urban or a rural setting, means communication with the outside world and a breaking down of the barrier of the loneliness from which too many of our old age pensioners suffer.  If present connection trends for telephones continue many of the present old age pensioner applicants for free telephone rental will not be around when their telephones are connected, because the Department at this moment are connecting telephones which were applied for some two or three years ago.  I understand that the Minister is to accord priority rating where possible to these people, but it should be a much greater priority than is accorded to them at present.</P>
    <P>In a rural area when a telephone is applied for there may be only one applicant, but by the time that telephone is installed there may be many applicants.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were to increase his labour force for the erection of the necessary poles, laying cables and so on, the rental paid for the telephones installed as a result plus the income generated from them would at least meet the amount of dole being paid to such workers presently unemployed. This point is worth considering.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the stamp increase.  I consider it somewhat savage.  Contributions are up by 18 per cent for social welfare and 28 per cent for health.  We discussed this yesterday and there is no need for me to go into detail on it.  I would like to congratulate the Minister and his staff in the Department for the fact that the Department are still running.  I simply cannot understand how the Department of Social Welfare function as efficiently as they do at this moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> Within this House are Deputies and Senators and outside are public representatives who are constantly making representations to the Department about various claims.  They receive acknowledgments, make further representations and receive further acknowledgments.  They receive final reports which if negative are appealed, and they receive further acknowledgments and further representations, and it goes on and on.  This adds enormously to the workload of the staff in each section of the Department.  The Minister is a highly intelligent individual and I am sure he is going to take a detailed look at the whole Department of Social Welfare in relation to efficient running to see how it could be made more efficient in the operation of those claims.  There are so many pieces of legislation relating to social welfare benefits and allowances that many people do not understand or know what they are entitled to or what criteria are applied in relation to their applications.  The Minister should consider taking time on either radio or television now and then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He should also use the newspapers and pamphlets or leaflets, and the information should be co-ordinated and made as simple as possible, so that anybody who thinks he or she may be eligible for an allowance may go ahead and claim it.  The efficient running of the Department of Social Welfare is an enormous problem, and on that I sympathise with the Minister.  I am told that they get 50 mail-bags of letters every day.  If they do they must have a staff constantly typing acknowledgments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time next year, when the Government will be introducing a second budget&mdash;if they have not introduced one before then&mdash;the words of the Minister will be tested and we will know whether a real increase in the standard of living has been a result of his action in this Bill.  In his reply <Col N="1042" /> I would like him to illustrate what he considers to be the poverty line in this country and how many people are estimated to be living under that line. This is a priority and it is an area that I am sure he will look into in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everybody wishes the Minister well in his years ahead of him.  It has been said by a number of Deputies that the Department of Social Welfare is an extremely important Department.  It is also becoming a very much more complicated Department than it ever was before. In this Bill there are many things with which I disagree in the most profound way, but it is hard to realise that a Bill of this kind was once quite unthinkable if one thinks about free electricity&mdash;a valuable advantage in these days&mdash;or the telephone proposals, the free transport scheme, the free fuel.  In its own way at a very low level it is a comprehensive approach to community effort, to helping the under-privileged that was quite unthinkable only, say, 20 years ago. Therefore, one cannot feel too down-hearted at the relative lack of progress. Some progress has been made and some is being made.  The basic conflict here is that the general approach of the socialist in looking at this kind of thing would be an attempt to secure a fair and equitable distribution of the wealth of the community within that community.  That happens to be one of the provisions of the Constitution, though one can hardly believe that, looking at society as it is.  The approach of conservatives, as would appear from their actions over the years, is that broadly the structure of society and the economic structures represented by class should be preserved intact, and that is what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years in these countries, in Britain as well as in Ireland, the development of the welfare state has not really led to any great or significant redistribution of wealth.  There is still the same small minority who have an enormous amount of wealth and there are the others for whom the kind of welfare scheme included here is provided, that is the extremely clever and very sophisticated method of taking <Col N="1043" /> much of the impact out of protest in a society broadly known as benevolent capitalism.  This means simply the recycling of the workers' incomes within the same group of people &mdash;the workers funding directly and indirectly all of these benefits&mdash;but giving the general impression that the Government have become more concerned for their welfare.  In fact it is the pressures from growing literacy in society which are demanding better measures of egalitarianism.  However, for what it is worth one must comment on it as it is.</P>
    <P>We have failed to secure a fair and equitable distribution of wealth.  The big test for the Minister in the next three or four years will hinge on his views and beliefs in this area and, more important, on how his actions will manifest themselves during that time.  Recently a Central Bank economist, Mr. Brian Nolan, gave us figures based on a survey he had undertaken in 1973.  The survey showed that more than 74 per cent of our gross income went to 50 per cent of householders and that less than a quarter per cent went to the remaining 50 per cent of householders.  There was that other figure that was mentioned so often&mdash; 5 per cent of the population owning 75 per cent of the wealth&mdash;but Mr. Nolan's figures are the most recent available.  His report shows that a quarter of the total income went to the top 10 per cent of our people.  The other interesting fact is that the bottom 10 per cent of the people got only 1.5 per cent of the wealth.  Obviously, then, there is no serious attempt to bring about an equal distribution of wealth.  All Government Departments have some social consequences but none more so than the two ministries that the Minister has the privilege of controlling&mdash;Health and Social Welfare.  Therefore, it is on the basis of the performance of these ministeries that he will be judged in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As a Member of the Government there are limitations on the Minister's freedom in this regard but there is involved a very important point of <Col N="1044" /> principle and it will be interesting to see whether the Minister is prepared to push his principles to the point of accepting the past policies of the retention of the rigid class structures that exist in our society or whether he will try to bring about a greater measure of social justice for all.  The policy being pursued in this Bill of attempting to take money and recycle it in the form of welfare benefits is also the policy of the Minister's predecessor. In one of his budget statements the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, said that the State would be involved to a lessening extent in this area.  That Government in which there was a Labour Minister for Health also shared this belief in the perpetuation of society broadly as it is.  There was an attempt to extend the benefits but not to touch the really wealthy groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very important responsibility here.  He referred correctly the other day to his apparent indignation at the idea of the old poor law approach to social benefits.  This is the workhouse concept but the Minister insisted that while he is in office the sense of stigma attaching to benefits will be shed.  As everyone knows the person who had recourse to the workhouse was destitute.  While he was in the workhouse he was humiliated and was made aware in no small way of his dependence on those who provided him with shelter.  He was given work to do so that there was no question of his getting something for nothing.  At that time there was a general stigma attached to social welfare.  I recall that in my time there was one workhouse where the children were all numbered. They had tags on their clothes as if they were convicts.  The system then was that if a family went into a workhouse, the father went one way, the mother another way and the children yet another way.  That happened relatively recently.  It will be seen, then, that what we have now is an advance, albeit minimal, on the situation which prevailed then.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kenny said, the Minister must endeavour to let us know what is his general attitude to social welfare benefits.  There is yet a hang-over <Col N="1045" /> from the poor law days, the idea that anybody who takes an old age pension, a widow's pension or even free transport or free health service is doing something wrong or at least that there is something demeaning about what he is doing.  That idea is fostered to some extent.</P>
    <P>Having regard to present circumstances I do not believe that unemployment figures either here or elsewhere will fall.  There is a great crisis in Britain in this regard where they say they need 2,300,000 jobs by 1981, that, otherwise, 2,500,000 of their people will be out of work.  In Germany where 6,000,000 are unemployed it is reckoned that if 9,000,000 jobs are not provided by 1985 the present unemployment figure will continue.  The situation is the same in the US.  I cannot visualise any significant reduction in the unemployment figures in my time.  This situation creates a great burden on any society.  The Minister's Department are concerned almost exclusively with caring for the unemployed. Most people are prepared to accept that the widow, the aged and the sick must be helped but we all tend to resent the idea that anybody should be happily unemployed.  In other words, there is the idea that in some way those people should be made suffer.</P>
    <P>We all tend to resent the person who need not turn in for a day's work like the rest of us.  There is that basic envy of the person who is considered to be a layabout or who would not work even if he were offered a job. It is popular to promote this kind of attitude at a time like this and it is in this sphere that the Minister will have to take a stand in regard to this idea that people who take benefits that they have not earned are feather-bedded within the welfare society or are not making their contribution to the demands of the State.  There is a general idea in relation to welfare benefits that only people who in some way are not very thrifty or not very careful about their accounts, or who are not anxious to work hard, fall into need of such benefits.  There is a clear evasion of the reality of life in our society.  It is very difficult to pull one-self <Col N="1046" /> up by one's bootstraps.  A few people do so and it frequently does them damage because they think that they are rather special people; they are the lucky ones who got away. Many people cannot better themselves in a society such as ours.</P>
    <P>A survey of the people going to Trinity in recent years showed that the representation of working-class groups has not changed since the sixties.  Most of the people there come from the employer, managerial and professional class and they represent 70.5 per cent. Only .8 per cent are from the agricultural or industrial worker class. Nobody chooses not to have an education if he can get one.  There are many factors involved such as registration fees, the cost of books and the lack of a sufficient income.  The son of an unemployed man or of a tradesman is very unlikely to end up in a high income type job, though access to such jobs has improved because of the technological education in vocational schools.</P>
    <P>The low income family is an educational problem in the Republic, unlike Northern Ireland or Great Britain where grants are so much better.  The costs of maintenance, books, travel and capitation fees make it very difficult and a person who is down the line financially and economically is not there by choice.  He is there because of the structure of our society and he is completely innocent.</P>
    <P>Equally, a person does not choose to get sick.  No matter how careful or long-sighted one is, one does not know what kind of sickness one will get or how long it will last.  A lady who loses her husband and becomes a widow cannot budget for that and cannot look ahead.  Above everything, the poor man who loses his job cannot be blamed.  It is obviously the responsibility of the State to see that there is full employment.  There is not a hope for many&mdash;at least 100,000&mdash;in our society.  Regarding the men who worked at Ferenka, the sudden cessation of employment was an appalling shock.  When will they get work again? This is happening universally.  It is the innocence of these groups that I should like to emphasise.  It is most unfair <Col N="1047" /> that they are harassed and criticised in the media by some economists. People will work if the jobs are there. They have to work in such circumstances. Turning against those dependent on those of us who pay taxes, directly or indirectly, by snide or offensive remarks is most unwarranted. This is something on which the Minister should take a stand.</P>
    <P>In relation to people who are unemployed, there is one very distressing development which I believe will continue and with which the Minister is acutely involved.  There is a progressive increase in the number of people who are unemployed for increasingly long periods and who, because of this, are moving down the income scale.  I am referring to people who received redundancy money and pay-related benefits in addition to the flat rate and people who were on the flat rate and who then moved from the flat rate into the position of getting no income at all or getting unemployment assistance.  As everybody knows, a man may work for 30 years and he simply makes himself eligible for a limited period for unemployment benefit and after 15 or 16 months he receives unemployment assistance.  Deputy Kenny asked if the Minister would talk about the people who are below the subsistence level.  I cannot see how anyone could fail to accept that all these people, the widows, old age pensioners and those receiving unemployment assistance, are living on pittances.  I except those receiving unemployment benefit because it is possible that they may be above or at the subsistence level.  The average payment is £13.60 and the rate of unemployment assistance is £11.75.</P>
    <P>In his other role as Minister for Health, the Minister might consider carrying out a survey into the level of malnutrition amongst people receiving unemployment assistance payments, unemployment benefit payments, widows' and orphans' payments and old age pensions.  In Britain they carried out a survey of malnutrition amongst old age pensioners, who were then receiving a higher level of payment than was available here.  The survey showed that there was a high <Col N="1048" /> level of malnutrition amongest people on those payments.  How can we justify this kind of thing in a society which has just relieved wealthy tax payers of about £10 million?  It is indefensible.</P>
    <P>Between 1976 and 1977 there was a large decrease in the number receiving pay-related benefits on top of the flat rate.  In 1976 the figure was 20 per cent and in 1977 it was 17.5 per cent.  Most people seem to think, and it is generally put about, that people who are unemployed are doing all right because they are getting pay-related benefits or big redundancy payments or have some other unknown income.  In spite of the myths about this subject, pay-related benefit is paid to only one in six people on the unemployment register.  In the same period the number of people on redundancy declined from 4,000 to 3,300 and only 3 per cent of people on the live register actually get redundancy payment.</P>
    <P>What is happening now is that people are unemployed for longer periods.  Some 50 per cent of people on the live register are unemployed for a period of six months or less and a third of people on the unemployment register are unemployed for a year or more.  Taken together with the wage agreements which have pushed down living standards and the failure of successive Governments to deal with the unemployment crisis, there has been a progressive assault on the standard of living of families who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>Of the 105,000 people on the live register 16,000 got no payment at all although they were unemployed.  Obviously, they were dependent on others who were paid minimal amounts. Some 46,000 of the 105,000 are on unemployment assistance and they have 60,000 dependent children. Therefore, if this is a below subsistence payment&mdash;and I believe it is&mdash; there are 105,000 people, 60,000 of whom are children, who are living in these conditions.  Is it not a completely shameful situation that this should go on?  At the same time that we allow this kind of thing to continue, we do not increase the wealth tax as we should have done and we reduce the <Col N="1049" /> corporation profits tax, the capital gains tax and VAT on farms.  What serious justification can the Minister give for penalising 60,000 children, the dependent, defenceless members of our society?  They are penalised in so many ways.  Not only do they have to live on bread, margarine and tea for most of their lives so that they are undersized, underweight and suffer from malnutrition&mdash;a very bad start from the health point of view&mdash;but they will also find themselves unable to get second- or third-level education. Being unemployed through no fault of one's own is penalised by our society.</P>
    <P>Of the 105,000 on the live register 42,000 are on unemployment benefit. Some 24,000 are on a flat rate and there is no supplement.  Incidentally, despite the enormous figures mentioned, the average supplement is about £7.  Some 15,000 are married and their dependants number 43,000. Therefore, 100,000 children are living in families in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  Is that not a scandal?  Is nobody surprised or upset about it? And now we are asking for increased contributions.</P>
    <P>Whether a person is employed or unemployed, the assault is directed specifically against the worker.  The wage agreements became wage cuts. Over the period of the various wage agreements from 1970 to 1977 the wage rise was 94.3 per cent and the price rise was 103.4 per cent.  This society directs its assault on the worker while easing the burden on the wealthy class. Members may have seen in the last few days an advertisement on the back page of newspapers which stated, &ldquo;Tax refugee anxious to return to Ireland.  Wants to buy a house, £200,000 available&rdquo;.  Is that not totally revolting in its barbarous insensitivity in what is meant to be a poor country such as ours: £200,000 just for the house?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear these things in mind when he is defending his Department and the moneys he will be paying from time to time.  I am certain that as time goes on there will be more of these assaults on the unemployed. <Col N="1050" /> It will be said it is time they were put out to work, that they were put into the Army or that their allowances were cut because they cannot continue to be dependent on the rest of us, the taxpayers.  Of course, it is one of the most carefully fostered myths of all that these people in some way are getting hand-outs from the wealthy few.  As I said earlier, with modern benevolent capitalism the wealthy do nothing whatever to fund the schemes.  It has been very cleverly arranged by those who believe in this kind of thing to see that they pay the minimum.  Far from the poor wallowing in the alleged comforts of such schemes, it has been found that it is the middle income group who take up the schemes.  The poor do not go for all the services.  As Deputy Kenny said, many people do not know about the benefits available and no serious attempt is made to help them to know about what is available.  In a survey of the free meals scheme in Britain it was found that there was a 30 per cent failure to take up the scheme and in that figure much the highest percentage not taking it up were the poor people who needed it most.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the payment of tax about which the wealthy classes complain through their leader writers that it is going up and up all the time, in fact the people who mostly exade tax, according to various surveys, are the so-called entrepreneurial groups, the self-employed, medical people who work in private practice and consultant practice, legal people, lawyers, wealthy farming classes of whom there are a percentage, and people with investment incomes.  Those are the people who fiddle their tax accounts.  Those are the people who do not pay their way and who run for cover from even the minimal wealth tax introduced by the inter-Party Government and head off for wherever it is with their money and then come back when it is safe.</P>
    <P>The ordinary wage earner or salary earner pays his way simply because he has to pay his way through the taxation system.  He is not able to evade even if he wishes to evade.  In regard to who pays this money which <Col N="1051" /> the Minister will be handing out in various forms of welfare benefit from time to time, there is a common fallacy about the unemployed, the widow, the old-age pensioner, the blind, the disabled and health service people that, in some way or other, wealth is being transferred from the wealthy to them through the services.  That is not true either.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the taxes paid by the worker, the ordinary people, the mass of the people are very considerable. Because they are paid in the form of purchase tax, or value-added tax, or direct or indirect taxes of one kind or another, they do not seem to be quite as dramatic as other taxes like the capital gains tax or the wealth tax appear to be if you read the leader writers' moans about the weight of these taxes on the wealthy classes.</P>
    <P>A very interesting document to read on this subject was issued by the magnificent organisation the National Economic and Social Council for which most of us should be deeply grateful, a wonderful organisation throughout the years of their existence. Recently they produced a document called &ldquo;Universality and Selectivity Strategies in Social Policies&rdquo; which is well worth reading by anybody interested in social welfare generally.</P>
    <P>A good case is made for believing that the consumer pays most of the taxes, not only his own through direct and indirect taxation.  For instance, a landlord in deciding how much rent he will charge assumes he will be paying tax and therefore the rent will include tax and the flatdweller who pays the rent for his flat is, in fact, a ratepayer in the sense that rates are paid.  Equally, when any of the great industries produce a commodity for sale, it is no problem for them to include in the price of the item for sale a part of that price which will meet their tax needs.  Therefore the so-called employers' contribution to all of these benefits is a very doubtful entity, putting it at its best.  The consumer pays not only his own contribution through tax and through the increased contribution asked from him by the Minister, but also he pays in indirect tax, in rates and on consumer items.  If <Col N="1052" /> Guinness have to pay a lot of tax, all they do is put a farthing on the pint.  The consumer pays the farthing, pays their tax, and Guinness go on declaring bigger and bigger profits every year.  That is no problem to them.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of a welfare state or a welfare society is a myth in the sense that it is the community deciding they will distribute their welath, in the words of the Constitution, to achieve a fair and equitable distribution of that wealth.  That does not happen.  To say that the wealthy minority have softened their hearts and are more concerned about the widow, the orphan, the old age pensioner, the blind, the disabled, the sick, is wrong.  That has not happened.  Whatever about the total truth about that, one important fact comes out of it, that is, the responsibility on the Minister to highlight these realities about who pays in a society such as ours.  The money is not coming from the pockets of the wealthy few to fund these services.  It is coming from the pockets of the people who benefit from the services, the sick person in bed, the old person, the disabled, the unemployed, or whoever it may be.  As is known, one has to pay into redundancy schemes, insurance schemes of all kinds, unemployment, health insurance, and so on.</P>
    <P>That being so, it would seem to me to be quite wrong for the unemployed or those who benefit from these services to be harassed in any way directly or indirectly by implication by people who criticise them and say they are benefiting from the State and not putting anything back.  They are putting everything back.  They are funding these services themselves.  In the next three or four years, if the present trend continues where in Britain there is such an enormous level of unemployment that they cannot take our emigrants, the Minister will have to give serious consideration to the development here of persistent high what you people call structural unemployment.</P>
    <P>A person who has worked for 30 years, kept a good house, a good standard of living, looked after his children, fed them, clothed them, tried <Col N="1053" /> to educate them and give them a good opportunity in life, is now kept on subsistence level unemployment benefit for a minimum period of 15 months, or 18 months, or whatever it is.  It is a relatively tiny period.  As I showed, a growing number of people are now being pushed forcibly down in their living standards because they are losing redundancy, pay-related, flat unemployment rate benefit, and are on subsistence level.</P>
    <P>In 1976, 45 per cent of the people were on assistance and in 1977, 52 per cent of people were on assistance. Obviously this will increase.  Is the Minister content about this?  It is very sad to think adults responsible for young people are being forced gradually to watch their aspirations being negatived completely and even their existing living standards eroded and reduced as a result of the meagre benefits paid to them in unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister propose to make any stand with his Government to see that unemployment benefit will not be the lowest benefit paid out to anybody and that this benefit will be related by him to some sort of link with the household budget to ensure that it will not be as low as subsistence level, that it will be at least sufficient to give people a chance to look after themselves and their families reasonably well?  As the Minister is aware from his constituency work, there are still certain people administering those services who do not appear to have learned that the days of the poor law are over.  They are still administering it in the style of the old relieving officers of the old poor law administrators. People will not go to those officials because they are frightened of them.  They will not do so because they feel such officials humiliate them, harass them, question and cross-question them and, eventually, make them afraid to look for any of the benefits to which they have a perfect right because after all the money does not come from those people, it is taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of the means test, whether a service should be a selective one for a small group <Col N="1054" /> of people within a community or whether it should be universal, rather like the British universal health service, or whether the service should be related to the needs of people rather than to the economic standing of individuals in society.  The Minister must know that this has become an infinitely complex subject.  While the provisions of this Bill are grossly inadequate they are much better than previous Bills in the provisions but not in the amount of money because that is worse.  The assessment of means is something to which I have great hostility.  My earliest experience is in relation to a health service and I recall talking to Bevan at that time.  His attitude was that he was ideologically opposed to a means test but, even more, he believed that administratively it was an absurdity because the administrative machinery provided to administer a particular social welfare service cost so much that one was better to make it a universal scheme rather than a selective one.  The documents in relation to such schemes are so incomprehensible, certainly not capable of being understood by anybody except those with a wide knowledge of the subject, that one must long for the type of scheme where there is eligibility because of citizenship and because of need.</P>
    <P>It has always struck me as being very incongruous in a society which is so concerned about the preservation of the privacy of the family, the individual and so on, that we should be so wedded to the idea of accepting this means test assessment.  Anybody who has attempted to help people in their constituencies to decide whether they are eligible for any of these benefits knows what I mean.  There is an inquiry into the income of the family, the income of dependants and the various dependants of the dependants. There is a difficulty where a wife does not know what her husband earns. The whole business is a humiliating experience and, frequently, a disturbing one.  In most cases it is a confusing experience leading to various repercussions. The individual is left with the feeling that it is not worth bothering about, as I have been told.  People have told me they would not seek a particular benefit because of the <Col N="1055" /> humiliations associated with it.  There are historical associations and a difficulty in deciding the various family incomes, the question of overtime, weekend money and bonuses.  There is the idea, like that which exists in the United States, that people ought to phase themselves down in their income in order to come into benefit in a health scheme.</P>
    <P>The whole question of eligibility where a means test is concerned has become more frustrating, complicated and difficult to assess.  One also gets a general feeling in the community of confusion where people know of others getting benefits but are not aware of the background details.  That leads to a conflict within a community between the beneficiaries and those who do not benefit.  The whole thing in its effect is very retrograde.  This problem of the application of a means test has grown up over the years.  The Minister is aware that the grand provision of the Health Act of 1947, an Act introduced by a Government of the Minister's party, was the pre-no-means-test at point of use provision.  Obviously, it was a wonderful system, it worked well, was efficient and was not over used. In fact, it is not being used at all at present.  The system worked itself out because nobody, with the exception of a hypochondriac, chooses to get sick. The general principle of universality is obviously one associated with a socialist approach to society and one which might not appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>When one takes the various provisions in the Bill, the telephones, fuel, transport and so on, and the fact that the Minister must try to decide on eligibility, one must come to the conclusion that the Minister has a much more complicated job now than any of his predecessors had.  I should like to know his attitude.  Does he share the belief that people are not paying at point of use but they are obviously paying in taxation for the various services?  Can the Minister establish that the people who benefit from these services have a perfect right to them as a result of that?  Is the Minister concerned with the question <Col N="1056" /> of take-up of a service?  It is notorious that in a means-tested service there is a deficiency in take-up. It is not used by the optimum number of people and is not really working efficiently.  If the Minister is not interested in the humanitarian side of his Department is he interested in its efficient operation, that is making the best use of the money he is paying out? Does he want the optimum number of people to avail of the services?</P>
    <P>That is a very important point.  If that is so he will, first of all, have to defend the rights of people.  As Deputy Kenny said, he will have to mount a programme of information and provide a simplified version of the provisions of the various schemes&mdash;they are very complex.  He should promote this scheme in the same way as they promote the various commodities in the advertising programmes on television. This should be done with a little bit more drive than the existing Department of Health advertising programmes. If the Minister wants an optimum take-up of the services is he prepared to begin an educational information service in regard to the kind of facilities available and for whom within the social welfare code?</P>
    <P>Some people appear to be quite happy that this money is not being spent.  More and more people are going on to assistance and this means that less and less money is being paid out by the Department of Social Welfare to the unemployed.  Some Ministers have taken the view that the less they spend the better.  If the Minister accepts the general thesis that the consumer is paying for those services and has a right to them the logical follow on seems to be to explain as simply as possible to the consumer that those are his rights and this is how he can get access to them.</P>
    <P>There are a few general approaches to that kind of thing.  One idea is known as the passport form of approach where the individual who is in benefit from one service reaches 65 years of age and comes in for benefit as an old age pensioner and is then automatically informed that he or she is in benefit in relation to all the other parts of the social welfare code and <Col N="1057" /> there is no need for that person to apply for free electricity, free transport, free fuel or any of the other services. Those services should automatically be made available to the recipient.  Would the Minister agree with that kind of approach to the administration of his Department and the services under it?</P>
    <P>There is also the package scheme where there are a number of benefits. If an individual is eligible for one he is then informed that he is eligible for all the other services and is automatically given them.  Would the Minister agree with that?  It is quite obviously a fundamental change in the approach of successive Ministers for Social Welfare over the years.  I feel it is a perfectly legitimate one and is long overdue. If the Minister is really serious in his suggestion that we should end the poor law approach to social welfare he should take this more positive approach to the administration of the social welfare services.  It is pathetic to see the difficulties people find themselves in begging to get access to the various social welfare services.  It must be possible so to restructure the services that a person coming of age into benefit of one kind would automatically benefit from all the other services and would be informed of the benefits he is entitled to.</P>
    <P>I, together with other Deputies, deplore the fact that children's allowances were not increased.  This is completely inexplicable in the context of giving away £10 million.  Over the years most of us have asked for increases in the old age pension, widow's pension and children's allowances and I recollect many Ministers saying they could not afford those increases.  This is one occasion on which the Minister simply cannot say that.  The Government could have afforded to increase those benefits either by retaining the various taxes which were omitted, corporation profits tax, capital gains tax, wealth tax or by increasing them, taking the money off the wealthy people and giving them to mothers of young families by increasing children's allowances.  We have had an extra-ordinary reversion this year of the old Fianna Fáil approach to this kind of problem.  I recollect that most of those benefits have come from successive <Col N="1058" /> Ministers in Fianna Fáil Governments. They can claim credit for most of the social welfare code.  This reversion of traditional Fianna Fáil policy is a very disturbing one.  It is particularly inexplicable in our society where we encourage large families.  I saw last night at one of the political clinics a lady who has ten children.  This is the kind of pitifully dependent individual in our society who should not have been passed over and whose children should not have been passed over in favour of the wealthy class, the refugee coming here to buy a £200,000 house.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a question recently in relation to an old people's home in our constituency in which there are gas fires and electric heating. I asked if those people could get money <i>in lieu</i> of fuel under the free fuel scheme.  A very welcome provision in the Bill is the fact that girls can get unemployment assistance.  I believe the figure for young unemployed boys and girls is 60,000.  Is it not one of the most poignant indictments of capitalism that those young people will go straight on to the labour exchange and on to this miserable unemployment pittance? The social and economic consequences to those young people is immeasurable because they will be trying to get married, rear families and get jobs for which they are not eligible.  The whole sorry story is reflected throughout the European countries.  I understand that 40 per cent of the six million unemployed in the EEC are under 24 or 25. We must be grateful, I suppose, for benefits received.  It is good to see that they will be brought into the unemployment assistance scheme.  I had thought that the figure was 17,000 until I read in the brief that something like 60,000 will apply.  They will not all be eligible but an enormous number of people will go on to the live register. I wonder if the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, bears that in mind when he talks about a progressive reduction in the numbers applying for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has reduced the old age pension requirement for emigrants to 15 years.  That is a welcome development because most people who <Col N="1059" /> went abroad went because they had no choice.  This Minister is taking on this most important and influential Department at a very fascinating time in our history.  We all agree that we have moved from one very grim and harrowing era in our lives into a new kind of approach, where we at least accept communal responsibility for the underprivileged in our society. When I talked about this kind of thing 20 or 25 years ago I always had to hide behind a speech by an English priest about the British welfare state. At that time if one talked about this kind of thing one was considered a communist.  I felt that by hiding behind this article I would be considered respectable.  It was called &ldquo;The Welfare State, a Christian Opportunity&rdquo;, and I suppose in a way that is what it has been.  There is no doubt that this is a Department in which an enormous amount of work can be done. It will be a very testing and instructive Department for all of us in relation to the Minister who occupies it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill dealing with a very sensitive section of the community and it must be appreciated that they are very vulnerable.  Deputy Browne referred to the amount of money involved.  If the money is used in the right direction that is all right.  At no time was I satisfied that the amount of money paid out by any Government in the field of social welfare, was adequate. It provides just an existence.  While it looks as if the figure will increase, there will be no increase in the standard of living of the people in receipt of social welfare benefits.  I suppose the type of money required to increase their standards of living is just not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire and appreciate many aspects of this Bill which I consider to be a step in the right direction but I am disappointed with the children's allowances. As Deputy Browne pointed out, it would have been traditional for Fianna Fáil to have increased the children's allowances.  In relation to the reduction of the old age pension age limit that is not traditional.  I am not <Col N="1060" /> convinced nor are many other people that Fianna Fáil were ever prone to making reductions in the age limit. The age limit had not been changed for years.  In the 1972 budget, Deputy Brennan, as Minister for Social Welfare, said that to reduce the age limit would cost £13 million which was too much.  That was after a decade which could be considered a boom period, when most of Europe had full employment. The Minister for Social Welfare should have been in a position to reduce the age limit then.  At that time our unemployed were neglected. Now other countries are doing very well on our emigration figures.  A lot of Irish talent went to Birmingham, Coventry and such places.  Our unemployment problem then was solved by emigration.  I am also disappointed that there will be no review of the social welfare benefits during the next 12 months.  For the past four years there has always been a review in October. Despite the fact that there will be no review this October I am sure that the Minister will be forced to show his charity by extending increased benefits.</P>

      <P>It was a great thing for the social welfare recipients that we had a change of Government in 1973.  The money given to the unemployed and underprivileged in the last four years has reminded this Government that they were lax in the past.  It is very hard to give an explanation as to why the age limit of 70 for old age pensions was never reduced.  There are many thousands of people who have not yet reached the age of 70 who are now enjoying the benefit of an old age pension.  There are many thousands who have not yet reached 70 years of age and, were it not for the change of Government, they would have neither a contributory nor a non-contributory <Col N="1061" /> pension.  The Minister and his party had no intention, good, bad or indifferent of doing what the Coalition Government did.  There was a similar situation in the means test.  If someone sold a few dozen eggs in the years prior to 1973 there was a reduction <i>pro rata.</i> The Fianna Fáil Governments have done good things where social welfare recipients are concerned but a change of Government is no harm because we learn by our mistakes.  The gap between Northern Ireland, Britain and ourselves was very wide indeed but by the end of 1977 the gap had been narrowed considerably.  That was a step in the right direction.  I am not anxious to enter into political dialogue because our function here this morning is to help the underprivileged.  Nothing gives greater pleasure than cushioning the underprivileged as much as possible against the cost of living.</P>
      <P>With regard to the prescribed relative's allowance, I do not believe this is operated in the way it was intended it should operate.  We are not getting the best value we could.  Take the case of a married woman with seven or eight children living with her parents or her husband's parents.  She will not qualify for the allowance.  Naturally she is not able to look after the parents and the children.  If she were given the allowance she could employ some little girl and pay her out of her allowance and that would enable her to look after the old people.  That would be money well spent.  We know what it costs to keep old people in institutions. We all know that these old people are very reluctant to leave their local surroundings.  It is a sad experience to visit these institutions for the aged and see them sitting around, depressed and scarcely talking to one another.  We should do everything to keep these old people in their familiar surroundings.  It has been said that we are a people prone to hospitalisation. Statistically our rate is higher than in any other country in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers referred to the booklet. The booklet could be simplified. If someone comes for help, invariably one has to read the booklet all over again because it is so complicated. Prospective recipients of social welfare <Col N="1062" /> find it difficult to complete the necessary forms and so they call upon public representatives to fill them in for them. I appeal to the Minister to simplify the booklet.</P>
    <P>It has been said that doctors disagree. A man unemployed through sickness, possibly for a fairly long period, will be called before a board of referees and examined by the Department doctor who finds him fit for work.  He has sent in a certificate the previous day from his own local doctor saying he is unfit for work. The result is that for six weeks or two months he has no income.  He is so confused and frustrated that he does not know whether he is well or ill.  Until such time as agreement can be reached between doctors in a case like that the unfortunate man should not be deprived of social welfare.  It may be argued that he can seek home assistance.  This is degrading.  He has to go to the area officer and tell that officer the Department have turned him down.  In the end he is caught between three people, to say nothing of his wife and family.  Something will have to be done to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Very often the criticism is made that social welfare recipients do not want to work.  Some of the people who are criticised may actually be ill.  Some may have lost their jobs because a factory has closed down or a business has let staff go.  If these people are offered alternative work it may mean a complete change and it is not always easy to adapt to change.  If they refuse jobs they are turned down and kept again in suspense for five or six weeks.  That is an embarrassment and a hardship. Again there is an appeal and they have to go before another board.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the inspectors who conduct these appeals. I attended an appeal with a recipient recently.  I was really amazed at the knowledge of the Department inspector concerning farming and everything in rural Ireland.  He was very kind-hearted and courteous, and the person who went in very frightened came out full of confidence that all civil servants are not the tyrants we were led to believe they are.  That made a great impression, <Col N="1063" /> not only on the lady who was with me but on myself.  I should like to say in the presence of the Minister that I was very proud not because the recipient was successful but because of the manner in which that man dealt with the case.  We can all be proud of that.  I sincerely hope the Bill will serve the purpose for which it is intended and that next year the Minister may be in a position to give a little more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been fairly well received by the House and I want to express my appreciation to all Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate and made a variety of mainly constructive suggestions about social welfare in general and its administration.  I assure Deputies that we have taken careful note of the various points made regarding administration of the services and they will be fully and adequately considered and any improvements which appear to be possible will be effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the administrative details, a few points of principle were made by different speakers to which I should like to reply briefly.  First, I think there is fairly general acceptance by the House that the 10 per cent increase this year in present circumstances is reasonable, particularly in view of the fact that if the increase in the cost of living works out as expected, there will be a real increase of 6 per cent in the income of social welfare recipients.  Some Deputies adverted to the fact that there is no October review included in the provisions.  As I mentioned by way of interjection to Deputy O'Brien, the increase in the cost of the stamp which is included in this legislation includes 52p&mdash;35p for the employer and 17p for the employee &mdash;in respect of the increases made last October.  Those increases were promised by the Coalition Government but were provided by us.  We have to pay for them now.  I want Deputies opposite to understand that if they are opposing the stamp increases I propose in this legislation they are opposing the 52p which is relevant to last October's increases.  If they are opposing that <Col N="1064" /> increase in the cost of the stamp they are, therefore, indicating that those increases should not have been made last October.  I want to make clear exactly what they are doing when they say they are opposing the increase in the stamp proposed before the House.</P>
    <P>Of course they are also opposing the improvements included in the budget.  These must be paid for.  There is nothing new in that; it is a well-established statutory system that when the benefits are increased or extended corresponding increases must be made in the stamp.  The increases which were included in the budget, as I set out in my opening statement, require an increase of 82p in the ordinary rate of contribution, 55p from the employer and 27p from the employee.  Will the Deputies in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties oppose that?  If they do, and if they are successful in their opposition, the increased benefits announced in the budget cannot be paid.  Statutorily, we shall be unable to pay these benefits. These are two specific points I want to make in regard to the proposals in this legislation for an increase of £1.50 in the stamp.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, Deputy Boland particularly, referred to the lower paid workers and their situation.  He inferred that we gave a £1 reduction in January and that we are taking it away again.  That is not so.  We reduced the stamp from the level at which it was and, on a purely arithmetical basis should be, for the lower paid worker earning less than £50 per week.  We reduced that by £1 in January and the reduction still applies.  But, in addition, we are making a further reduction, adding a further benefit for the lower paid worker in what we are doing here because, for the lower paid worker as every other worker the stamp should go up by £1.50 but we are not permitting it to go up by £1.50 in the case of the lower paid worker.  We are knocking 50p off the increase that should be made and that is distributed between the employer, 34p and the employee, 16p.  We are giving the lower paid worker a further reduction of 16p.  As a result of the January increase and what we are doing here if a person is earning under £50 per week he will be paying £1.16 less for his <Col N="1065" /> insurance stamp than he should be normally paying on a strictly statutorily calculated basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne made a speech which was of very great interest and outlined his philosophy.  One would naturally be sympathetic to a great deal of what he said.  I do not want to follow him down the various sociological and philosophical paths which he trod but I should like to assure him that the Government, and I as a member of it, are quite determined that in so far as any person is entitled to a social welfare or health benefit he or she will get it.  We have no principle of trying to save.  We would regard any attempt to conceal from any individual or section benefits to which they are entitled as bad administration.  Once there is a scheme and rates fixed for it everybody entitled to benefit from that scheme at those rates should and must get the benefit.  That is our philosophy. We try by every means at our disposal to give effect to that principle. We have an information service in the Department of Social Welfare.  I think they are improving all the time, establishing better systems of communication, better methods of getting the message across to the public.</P>
    <P>Recently, in response to an appeal made directly to me by the unemployed association, we inserted large-scale advertisements in the Sunday newspapers in regard to supplementary welfare allowances to direct the attention of supplementary welfare recipients to what they are entitled, to what the rates are, how they should go about getting the benefits, and how they can appeal and if anything else like that appears necessary from time to time in the future, we will do the same.  We tried an interesting experiment in the case of the new telephone scheme, exactly along the lines Deputy Browne was talking about.  We sent out notices to all the people we thought should be entitled to avail of this.  We circularised them informing them of the scheme and of their impending participation in it.</P>
    <P>It is our policy to provide the best possible benefits we can and then make sure that everybody who is entitled to them avails of them.  It is bad administration, <Col N="1066" /> bad government, bad politics and bad social policy to bring in a scheme on paper and then hope people will not apply for it or know about it. I reject that sort of approach completely.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked about the differences between the figures I gave and those mentioned by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.  There was really no difference between the two sets of figures.  The gross cost of the increases is £55 million but the actual cost to the Exchequer, which the Minister for Finance referred to in his speech, is £33.2 million, the difference between the two being on the insurance side.  Insurance benefits cost about £27.75 million and the Exchequer only pays £5.45 million.  That accounts for the difference between the gross and net figures.  Therefore, between insurance, assistance and health allowances, the total was £55 million&mdash; the figure I mentioned&mdash;and the cost to the Exchequer is only £33.2 million because the Exchequer only makes a 20 per cent contribution to the cost of insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, Deputy Boland in particular, raised the question of the State contribution to the cost of social insurance.  We are doing better this year than last year.  The Exchequer contribution last year amounted to 19 per cent of the total cost; this year it will work out at 22 per cent.  This means that the Exchequer will do much better in 1978 than it did in 1977.  There is no political point Deputy Boland can make on that score. These are just a few points in principle with which I wanted to deal by way of reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that I have taken note of all the matters mentioned by Deputies.  Deputy Callanan and others mentioned the prescribed relative allowance.  Other Deputies mentioned the unsatisfactory situation in regard to married women who are frequently found to be not available for employment. I have taken careful note of the various matters of that sort which have been raised.  As a result I will be going into them very carefully to see what improvements can be effected in the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> The Bill was reasonably favourably received.  In the circumstances 10 per cent is a fair across-the-board increase. I recognise what Deputy Boland says about the disadvantages in an across-the-board system of increases.  We could probably do more good selectively if we varied the different rates by different amounts.  On the other hand, the schedule of rates is so complicated that it is difficult to make sure that you are really improving matters by varying the individual rates rather than adopting an across-the-board system.  In the coming year, I will be looking at the basic structural rates relative to each other to see if on the next occasion we should be making relative changes inside the structure as distinct from an across-the-board system of increases.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances of this year when the Government were directing the main thrust of their budget towards economic activity and the creation of jobs, a 10 per cent increase was reasonable.  I would like to thank Deputies who have commended the changes we are making, apart from those changes which are related to rates of benefits and allowances.  As Deputies noted, there are a number of significant changes being made in this legislation which will improve matters considerably for different sections of the people.</P>
    <P>Of course the major change is the elimination of discrimination against single women and widows.  As has been pointed out, this is a considerable step forward, long overdue, and I know everybody in the House welcomes it. The other changes which we have made are designed to eliminate minor inequities and anomalies which have come to my notice during my period in the Department.  In the main, these things have been brought to my attention by Deputies.  When one sees something cropping up continuously in correspondence from Deputies, one feels it should be looked into, and some of the changes which have been made and some others which I will be making later have come about in this way, and I should like to make it clear to the public that their Deputies <Col N="1068" /> are alert to deficiencies in the social welfare system.  I am not talking about the level of benefits but of specific anomalies and deficiencies in the system to which Deputies do not hesitate to draw attention.  As a result some of these changes have been made and I hope we will be able to make others.</P>

      <P>I should like some clarification on the effects of subsection (2) (a) (ii).  I do not know how we can reconcile this with our talk about equality between the sexes.  Part (A) refers to a situation where the pensioner is a man.  It states:</P>
      <P>if the pensioner is a man, in respect of his wife if he is living with or wholly or mainly maintaining her and she is not in receipt of pension under the Acts or any benefit or pension under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1978,</P>

That paragraph provides that for blind people of pensionable age and old age pensioners living alone there is a special allowance of £1 per week.  Because of the device of having a simple 10 per cent increase on all payments, this means that the extra £1 in these cases is being increased by 10p.  Because of the necessity to change pension books and so forth that ridiculous increase of 10p per week will cost a lot more.</P>

      <P>This is one of the sections Members from all sides of the House welcomed.  It deals with the existing provision that people looking for old age pensions must have been living in the State for at least five years after they had reached 50 years of age. We all went out of our way to welcome this and we thanked the Minister for its introduction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the famous or infamous section whereby single women will be allowed, if they qualify, to apply for unemployment assistance. I want to register our objection to this provision being deferred until October.  The Minister said earlier that the reason was staff difficulties and that there were some difficulties in relation to accommodation for staff&mdash; that they were the only reasons why these people are not being brought in until the autumn.  That is very difficult to accept.  All parties during the election promised they would remove this anomaly but the promise is being implemented belatedly purely, I am afraid, as a cost-saving device.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat the factual explanation I have given.  We are short of premises in Dublin city. If any Deputy can suggest, anywhere in Dublin, a suitable site for an employment exchange I should be glad to hear of it.  We are short of sites for exchanges.  The Board of Works are doing the best they can for us but it is a serious restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the removal of the inequality of single women and widows in relation to unemployment assistance I do not think that the major groups who have been fighting for this reform will be unduly perturbed that it will not be coming in until October.  We would all like it to come in as quickly as possible but there are administrative difficulties.  There will be 56,000 applicants and we calculate that only about 14,000 of those applicants will succeed, but they all have to be processed.  What we are doing is to prove to the House that there is substance in what I am saying about administrative difficulties. I want to explain that from the moment this Bill becomes law we will start work processing these 56,000 applicants.  Any one of these women will be entitled to apply for a qualification certificate straight away so that by the time benefit comes to be payable in October there will be no delay at that point.  The postponement until October is due to the administrative difficulties involved in taking these extra 56,000 applications into our machine and processing them.  The <Col N="1071" /> fact that the reform is being made, even though it will not come in until October, will satisfy those people who are concerned about the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given his explanation clearly now and I will of course accept it.  However, arising from his explanation, I am rather taken aback to discover that of his estimate of the 56,000 unemployed women and young girls who will apply for unemployment benefit only 14,000, that is exactly one in four of those who apply, will qualify for payment. I would have thought the number would be much higher.  Should we take it from that explanation that the very stringent regulations which apply to young boys, school leavers who have not been in employment, will also apply to the girls?  In other words, will there be a notional assessment of the value of their board and lodgings, which are of course provided for them by their parents in the majority of cases?  Are we to take it that that same notional estimate of board and lodgings will be used to disbar effectively a vast proportion of these young unemployed people from unemployment assistance as well?  How otherwise does the Minister estimate that three out of four of the new unemployed female applicants will be ruled to be ineligible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly the same rules and regulations will have to apply for male and female applicants.  That is what the whole thing is all about. Any element of discrimination against either sex has to be removed, so precisely the same conditions will apply. There is a statutory requirement that any benefits of which a person is in receipt have to be taken into account in the calculation of means, and we are not proposing to change that statutory requirement at present at any rate.  The incoming female applicants will be dealt with on exactly the same basis as male applicants are dealt with at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little disappointed that the Minister in his reply did not give more attention to the comments about section 12.  I accept <Col N="1073" /> that there were a lot of points raised on Second Stage but section 12 refers to a very big scheme about which a lot of us have expressed unhappiness. That is the new supplementary welfare allowance scheme designed to replace the old poor law system.  It has been suggested both here in the House and outside that the new scheme is not working properly and that its intention is not being implemented on the ground.  I quoted from a document which I think a number of us have received and which asked a number of questions.</P>
      <P>The Minister had a lot of questions hurled at him during Second Stage but I was sorry that he did not deal with this question of how the replacement for the Victorian poor law home assistance is operating.  People working in this field seem to feel that the officers who had over the years been implementing the home assistance schemes have been inclined to continue to approach the new supplementary welfare allowance scheme as if they were still operating the home assistance scheme.  The suggestion which yesterday I said I found incomprehensible was that in certain cases the new community welfare officers, as they are now called, were paying people less than the minimum amount of money which is provided for under the Supplementary Welfare Allowances Act.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to say categorically that that is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also find distressing the number of complaints regarding information not being supplied to people about their entitlement to the social welfare allowance, and also about the appeals procedure which has been set up. There were also complaints about the appeals procedure.  There was a complaint about the budgeting procedures which a number of the health boards had adopted in relation to the social welfare scheme and a suggestion that they had not provided adequate moneys for its implementation.  There was the suggestion that providing an increase in this section for the allowance would have the effect only of compounding that inadequate budgeting <Col N="1074" /> on the part of the health boards. The very stark example of the hundreds of destitute men and women has been given and should be dealt with by the Minister.  Who would suggest that after these people pay £7 per week for a bed in the Iveagh Hostel there is enough left out of their £10, or, as it will be now, £11.35 to feed them, clothe them and allow them basic hygiene?  These are the people who have no organised voice to speak on their behalf.  It was pointed out that if this supplementary allowances scheme was working properly it would not be necessary for the people concerned to have recourse to the various charitable institutions seeking basic help in the provision of food and clothing.  There is something wrong with a situation whereby from 2 p.m. on Friday until noon on Monday these people are unable in the majority of cases to partake of even one full hot meal.  With the exception of the Mendicity Institute the other charitable organisations are closed at weekends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people are entitled to supplementary welfare allowances but the point is that after paying for their hostel accommodation they are left with £3 or £4 per week to feed and clothe themselves.  But at weekends those charitable institutions that provide these people with cheap meals and who are doing wonderful work are closed and the people concerned cannot be expected to be able to afford full-priced meals at weekends.  Therefore some attention must be given to the entire supplementary welfare allowances legislation to see if it is operating properly, if some of the basic levels are correct and to ascertain whether the entire approach is correct. There is a need, too, to examine the suggestion that instead of having <Col N="1075" /> a basic figure which an officer will work towards giving or, apparently as is alleged in some instances, will work towards not giving, there should be an assessment of how much a person needs to maintain him at the minimum level of food, clothing, accommodation and hygiene.  The figure decided on should be the amount that the officer is allowed to pay rather than having enshrined in legislation a statutory figure of £11.35.</P>
      <P>Supplementary allowances are paid only to people who have nothing else. In most cases they are unemployable and do not qualify for unemployment allowance by reason of their not being described as being available for work. There are some who will complain about those people being on the streets of the city in such a condition and interfering with the respectable populace. That attitude is a sad reflection on us.  I trust that when the Minister during the next 12 months is conducting the review he has promised, attention will be given to the whole question of the levels of the rates of benefit paid under this scheme.  Having regard to the allegations made to some of us that in some cases these people are paid less than the minimum provided for in the Statute&mdash;I find this incomprehensible&mdash;the Minister should deal with this question.</P>

      <P>This scheme has had a lot of teething trouble.  There have been many complaints about it.  There seems to have been difficulty in getting details of it across to the public and to the various people concerned.  But we are doing everything possible to let people know of the scheme and how it operates.  We have had a conference of the superintendent officers concerned.  In addition we have advertised the scheme in the papers and have distributed leaflets to 2,000 health centres throughout the country. We are endeavouring continuously to ensure that the scheme is administered fully and properly.  We monitor it and take whatever action we can to ensure that it is administered on an even basis throughout the different regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of anything <Col N="1076" /> less than the basic rate being paid.  It must be paid in full to a person without means but if Deputy Boland or any other Deputy has a specific complaint in this regard or knows of a specific case in which it is thought that the scheme is not operating satisfactorily, I should be grateful to have details. We are anxious to monitor the scheme in as comprehensive a manner as possible and to eradicate any anomaly, discrepancy or difficulty that may arise.</P>

These questions do not seem to be dealt with.  The Minister has dealt with the suggestion that people are not paid the statutory amount.  I am glad to hear that this is not so.  I found the suggestion very difficult to accept.</P>
      <P>However, other questions were raised in that document.  For instance, there was the suggestion that non-contributory old age pensioners will be paid so little that they will not be able to maintain themselves properly and consequently should be eligible for payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme but that they are not advised of their rights.</P>
      <P>I accept entirely that the Minister has circulated details of the scheme to the health centres and that an extensive campaign has been carried out in the Press during the past month with a view to making people aware of the scheme.  I trust that to some extent that effort has improved the operation of the Act.  But the suggestion is made also that officers at the employment exchanges should be given full briefing as to the details of the scheme and should be requested and encouraged to give information about it to the people with whom they are dealing and that whenever they see an applicant who they think might be entitled to this extra allowance, they should so inform him and help him in his application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have received complaints from other bodies including the largest single trade union in the <Col N="1077" /> country, the ITGWU.  A statement issued by the union was as follows:</P>
    <P>Information at the union's disposal indicates that the community welfare officers are not taking any decisions on applications under the scheme and are instead referring them for approval to superintendents above them.  In addition to the fact that no payments may generally be made before a community welfare officer has visited homes of applicants, this means that there is a substantial delay in dealing with their applications.</P>
    <P>The statement continued:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it would appear that not all community welfare officers have received guidelines for administering the scheme.  Indeed the claim form published by the Department was drawn up without consultation with the Health Boards.  As a result the Boards are refusing to handle the forms.</P>
    <P>That was some time ago, and I understand there has been some clarification of that.  The general complaint is that the scheme has not got off the ground. While it is essentially different from the poor law concept, it is being implemented by the people who previously implemented the old home assistance scheme, and those who were formerly called relieving officers are now being called community welfare officers. These officers have not been sufficiently briefed about the range and scope of the new Act and they approach their new role in society in the manner they traditionally adopted in dealing with home assistance.  Consequently many people it was intended would be brought into the supplementary welfare allowance net are not being brought in because the people on the ground do not know that the Oireachtas intended that additional people should be given these benefits as a right and that the old concept of grudging charity should be wiped away.  That has not been happening because the same people are being asked to implement a newer and better Act.  The Minister should deal with that point.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has dealt with the matter of informing the public <Col N="1078" /> through the health centres, he has not referred to the dissemination of information through the employment exchanges. He has not dealt with the matter of giving a full briefing to the officers implementing the complete scheme under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Act, 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of this section appears to be quite discriminatory.  The explanatory memorandum says that section 13 extends to single women, widows and recipients of deserted wife's benefit or allowance the &ldquo;housekeeper&rdquo; allowance at present payable by way of an increase of supplementary welfare allowance to single men and widowers in respect of a woman who is looking after their child dependants. It is specified in the section that in order to qualify for this housekeeper allowance the person minding the children must be female.  We have heard much talk about discrimination written into legislation and the explanation given is that the legislation is relatively old and was written at a time when old, traditional values applied and that as soon as opportunities arise these anomalies will be removed.  It has been accepted for the most part that the legislation complained about is discriminatory.  This is the second time in the course of a few minutes I have had to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that he appears to be writing into this legislation a basic discrimination.  The housekeeper allowance will be paid only if the housekeeper is female.  I think that stipulation would not stand up in any court.</P>

      <P>It is exactly the opposite.  The only reason this has to be brought in now is that when the <Col N="1079" /> Social Welfare Act, 1977, was brought in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was not in existence.  This section is simply extending what was done in the Social Welfare Act, 1977, to the supplementary welfare allowances. This section extends to single women, widows and deserted wives the housekeeper allowance which is at present payable by way of an increase of supplementary welfare allowance to single men and widowers.</P>

      <P>There is provision that men and women, widows and widowers, may be eligible for payment of this allowance but only if the person whom they employ to mind the children is female.  I do not see how this can be described as anything but discriminatory. The Oireachtas is being asked to write in a clause which deliberately discriminates.  The allowance will not be paid if a male person is employed to mind the children.  The Minister agreed some minutes ago that part of section 2 (3) has an element of discrimination which will have to be removed in good time.  In the same way this will also have to be removed.</P>

      <P>This provides for increasing the special rates of unemployment benefit payable in certain circumstances where unemployment benefit continues beyond 156 days.  When the maximum duration of unemployment benefit was first extended beyond 156 days in 1967 provision was made that in order to qualify for the standard rate of benefit for the period after the first 156 days a person had to have an average of 40 paid stamps over the previous seven years.  Those who have less than this average qualify for special rates of benefit.  These rates are linked with the urban rates of unemployment assistance which are increased under section 4 of the Bill and the increases proposed in this section &mdash;£1.05 in the basic rate, 80p in the rate for an adult dependent, 35p for each of the first two qualified children and 25p for the third and each of the other children&mdash;are designed to retain this parity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the welcome sections in the Bill.  My interpretation is that it provides that if a deserted wife who was minding her children dies and if the father still <Col N="1081" /> refuses to assume any responsibility for the children, a special orphans' pension or allowance can be paid depending, I assume, on whether the deserted wife was being paid a deserted wife's benefit or an allowance.</P>
      <P>I understand the intention is to allow relatives of the father, or more likely relatives of the deceased mother, to take on the very Christian job of rearing the children.  I assume the relatives would be paid an allowance by the State to help them to rear the children if the father still refuses to assume that responsibility.  It is a worth-while provision from many points, not least from the point of view of the State.  The young people concerned have seen the break-up of their parents' marriage and the efforts of the mother to rear them on her own and then they have experienced the trauma of their mother's death. Up to now they have usually ended up in an orphanage or in the State's care in one way or another.</P>
      <P>The section is very welcome.  It will help the relatives to look after the children and there will be the welcome spin-off effect that the children will have the opportunity of being brought up in family surroundings rather than being placed in orphanages.  I do not suppose any real estimate can be put on the cost&mdash;probably it is not a considerable cost&mdash;but irrespective of the cost it is a worth-while provision.  It is the kind of thing that has been done in several sections of this Bill and it is to be welcomed.  The Minister is to be congratulated for introducing the section.</P>

If it is restricted to relatives it is going only half-way towards solving the problem.  I would be quite satisfied if the Minister could assure us that it will apply to all who care for the children.  If it is restricted to relatives I would ask him to have another look at the situation.</P>

      <P>I am afraid this is where we all fall out.  This section proposes to increase the amount of the social welfare contribution to be paid by the employee and the employer by an increase in each case that is double the amount of last year's increase. I noticed in all the Press reports this morning&mdash;as it was in all the reports the fault must have been mine rather than of those reporting the matter&mdash;that it was suggested I had said the increase to employers would be in the order of 18 per cent and, consequently, would not be an incentive to them to take on additional employees.  Of course what I had intended to say was that the increase to employees would be an increase of 18 per cent.  I am afraid the increase to employers is an even higher percentage. From that point of view it is very regrettable that at a time when employers are in the middle of negotiations regarding a wage agreement they should discover they are being asked to pay a total of 95p extra per week for each employee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if any decisions on improved staffing have been taken in regard to St. Laurence's national school, Kilmacud, County Dublin, since officials of his Department met representatives of the parents on 1 February 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The request for improved staffing made at the meeting in question related to the school year 1978-79.  This request is being considered in conjunction with the general question of improved pupil-teacher ratio for national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for taking care that I knew about the meeting which I take to be a courtesy.  I appreciate it.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he expects to have his mind made up about this school shortly having regard to the fact that several of its classes have more pupils in them&mdash;some substantially more&mdash;than his own guidelines?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the pupil-teacher ratio in that school is very good, taking the national situation into consideration.  In fact, the ratio is 33.6 to 1 in that school. That school is in an area which is not educationally or economically deprived. It has a remedial teacher. There are some schools, one of which was mentioned by Deputy Browne yesterday, which should have priority in regard to remedial teachers.  I admit that there is one class in the school which is much too large, the class which is leaving this year.  Needless to say decisions will be made in good time for the academic year 1978-79. I should add that the enrolment is going down and has been since 1969. It started at 767.7 average in 1969 and in 1977 it was down to 624.  This in itself presents problems, but as I have told the Deputy, it is not really as serious a case as some other schools in the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said and I will not take issue with him in regard to what he said about the area and other details in regard to the school, but I urge the Minister to make sure that by the time the new school year starts all the classes will be within his guidelines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will alter the regulations for the award of higher education grants to enable students whose parents' income is too high in their initial year at college to enable them to qualify for the grant, to qualify for a grant in subsequent years if their parents' income is sharply reduced through death, illness or retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As explained in reply to question No. 4 of 28 February 1978, the existing regulations provide that, where a student is following a course of studies which could be approved of under the scheme, and where such student had not qualified for the award of a grant solely on the ground of means, a grant may be awarded with effect from the beginning of the first academic year following the production of evidence that the means requirements of the scheme would now be fulfilled in his case.  In the circumstances, I do not understand why it appears to be suggested that an alteration in the regualtions is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that numbers of students claim that they are being debarred from grants in subsequent years when their parential income has fallen because of the fact that their parential income was too high to enable them to qualify for a grant in the initial year?  Would the Minister agree that that is an accurate statement of the regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Deputy listened carefully to my reply he would be aware that that is so.  Certain students have been debarred from grants in the year in which they took their leaving certificate because their parents' income was too high.  I went on to add that should the parents' income fall below the limit later on they are entitled to reapply and would be given grants if the parents' income is within the eligibility limits obtaining <Col N="1092" /> from the beginning of the next academic year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that there has to be at least one year during which the parents' fall in income remains low while the students will still remain unqualified?  Is it true that effectively the student must wait about 18 months before he gets back into the scheme on the grounds of reduced parental income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Deputy listened carefully to my reply he would have seen that a grant may be awarded with effect from the beginning of the first academic year following the production of evidence that the means requirement of the scheme would now be fulfilled in his case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that it would depend on the interpretation, &ldquo;with effect from the beginning of the first academic year following the production of evidence that the means requirement of the scheme would now be fulfilled in his case&rdquo;.  As the Deputy is aware the academic year in the universities usually begins the first week in October or mid-October.  If the evidence is produced before 7 October, 15 October, then the grant should be available in accordance with that regualtion in that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>Such an application is required in accordance with the &ldquo;Rules for the Payment of Incremental Salary to Secondary Teachers&rdquo; and is necessary to ensure that incremental salary is correctly and properly paid in conformity with the rules and in accordance with good accounting procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not really got the point of the question. Would he explain why the rules are as they are?  I appreciate that the signing is necessary to accord with the rules. Why are the rules such as to have a position where a staff of, for instance, 40 people, are obliged to state semipublicly&mdash;we could call a meeting of 40 people a semi-public one&mdash;not alone if they have been in attendance but the nature of their illnesses, if they are married, what their registration numbers are every month?  I submit that it is administratively very expensive and unnecessary.  Would the Minister not reconsider it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Asking for his salary used to be one of the most pleasant <Col N="1095" /> tasks a teacher had to perform.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that the nature of a person's illness is not stated on the form.  There is no necessity to state the nature of the teacher's illness.  It is a complicated form but the Deputy may remember that it was an even more complicated form and has been simplified in the not-too-distant past.</P>

      <P>The degrees of dissatisfaction are not important.  Does the Minister not think in this day and age that this type of out-of-date procedure is no longer necessary?  Why is it that the secondary teacher staff are singled out for this particular treatment when no other area of the public service have to fulfil a similar type of function?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Reviewing and evaluating the primary school curriculum is an on-going process.  It is recommended in the introductory chapters of <Col N="1096" />&ldquo;Curaclam na Bunscoile&rdquo; that &ldquo;research and regular evaluation will be necessary if the curriculum is to keep pace with changing conditions&rdquo;.  A curriculum unit, one of whose functions is to review and evaluate all apsects of the curriculum, was set up in the Department in 1976.  While the matter will receive my continuing attention, I have no immediate proposals for a major review of the primary school curriculum.</P>
      <P>As regards the post-primary schools a major review of the curriculum was carried out in conjuction with the school authorities, the teachers' associations and the universities.  As a result a major restructuring of the curriculum was introduced with effect from 1969.  Arrangements were also made at that time to keep the syllabuses in the various subjects under review by syllabuses comittees and standardising committees representative of the same interests.  This scheme is operating to the general satisfaction of the schools, the teachers and the universities.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to Question No. 10 on 2 March 1978, a committee is at present in process of being established to examine the problems arising in the transitional year from primary to secondary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appreciated that there seems to be a substantial amount of revaluation and review going on. Could the Minister tell us what his own view is with regard to the kernel of this question, that is the need for a curriculum which reflects changes in education and changes in society? Would he comment as to whether or not it is the case that review in such curricula is very slow and is almost negligible in most cases despite what he says?</P>

The rules provide, however, that where it is impossible for a teacher to obtain a qualified substitute, a person, who though not qualified, is otherwise deemed suitable may be accepted as substitute.  The employment of such a substitute is subject to the conditions (a) that he/ she holds at least a pass in the leaving certificate including a pass in Irish, (b)  that the board of management agree to his/her employment, and (c) that the teacher agrees to pay the substitute the appropriate rates laid down by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education has had, both before and after his appointment, responsibility for the Institutions of Science and Art, for Youth and Sport, for Special Schools, and for School Transport and the Free Books Scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That may very well be.  The Minister of State, with heavy burdens like school transport, is working harder than any other person I know of, and since he became Minister of State he has added to the <Col N="1105" /> duties that were already there in assisting me in dealing with deputations and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a supplementary question.  However, before doing so, I would assure Deputy Tunney that it is in no way directed at him but is a general question.  Will the Minister accept that the Tánaiste, and Minister for the Public Service in his Dáil speech on 2 November last, by way of justifying the change of title of the seven Parliamentary Secretaries and the title that would be given to three further appointees, definitely assured the House that this heavier sounding title would be accompanied by the allocation of wider and heavier responsibilities to these office holders? Deputy Horgan has asked what the wider responsibilities are and the House has not been told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully answered the Deputy in my formal reply and in reply to supplementaries.  If the Deputies concerned took the trouble to study the advances made by the Minister of State since he took office, they would be under no illusion about the extra duties he has undertaken, duties in connection with developments that were promised by the previous administration and which were never delivered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that, would the Minister appreciate that there is a difference between simply telling us that he is working harder than ever before, on the one hand, and enumerating the precise additional functions which have been allotted to him in consequence of the Tánaiste's promise last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question and, if the Deputy were not living in another world, he would know that Deputy Tunney, Minister of State, has done trojan work with regard to the sports council, work that <Col N="1106" /> had been lying in abeyance for over four-and-a-quarter years before Deputy Tunney took over.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the second part of the question, a sum of £100,000 has been included in the 1978 Estimates for distribution among vocational education committees with approved proposals for youth and sport.

      <P>The Minister of State is directly charged with responsibility for this area, an area encompassing <Col N="1109" /> almost half our population, and it is high time a youth policy was produced and these measures being taken at the moment are merely adding to the actual delay in the implementation of the policy.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Deputy.  Contrary to the Deputy's implication that no policy has been produced, the policy is actually being implemented, which is the important thing, and in every day of every week since I took office I have had consultations and interviews with representatives of youth organisations and I have convinced them of the sincerity of my interest in youth generally.

      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development the research or experiments that are being carried out by his Department or by any other body for which his Department are responsible, in sources of energy other than those traditional in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue) Martin O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Science Council have carried out an extensive evaluation of the potential contribution of new energy sources to national energy requirements. A technique of systems analysis has been developed as an aid in this evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> The sources examined and their potential contributions are as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  Biomass Conversion including particularly short-rotation forestry. This is seen as having a high potential contribution of up to 15 per cent of energy requirements by the year 2000.  National research and development activities in this area are complemented by EEC and International Energy Agency projects.  Organisations involved in the current studies are the Forestry Division of the Department of Fisheries, An Foras Talúntais, The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, ESB and the National Science Council.</P>
    <P>2.  Solar Energy: Due to relatively low direct sunlight and projected high costs for components, solar energy is expected to provide only a small but yet significant contribution to energy requirements.  National centres of expertise are being encouraged and assisted to participate in the international activities in this area.  The institutions involved are the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards: University College, Cork and Dublin University.</P>
    <P>3.  Wind Energy: Due to high average wind speeds over easily accessible areas, the potential energy supply from this source is high.  At present no research and development is being undertaken here in wind machine design as there are no institutions with suitable expertise.  Our research and development activity is centred on assessing the viability of the resources as the technology progresses, and the aesthetic and infrastructural problems associated with its widespread adoption. Organisations involved in this area are the National Science Council and University College, Cork.</P>
    <P>4.  Wave Energy: The seaboard of Ireland offers a large potential for energy extraction from ocean waves. Again resources constraints are likely to preclude hardware development in this country at this stage.  However, close contact is being maintained with developments in other countries through the International Energy Agency working party on ocean power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> Current research and developments within the National Science Council are being concentrated on analysis of wave measurements provided by the Commissioners for Irish Lights, and initiating new measurement programmes and investigations on how best to incorporate this resource into the existing energy system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a very full reply.  I am glad to see he did not write off these alternative sources in the way his colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy did ten days ago.  Could the Minister tell me how it is that resources are not being made available for the exploration of the potential of winds and waves considering that we are expected to take in our stride a commitment of at least £350 million at present-day prices to a nuclear station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that no resources were being made available.  I said that we were not in a position to develop the hardware in these areas at the present time.  I should also like to point out that even with the fastest possible rate of development in these areas it is highly improbable that they could supply any substantial proportion of our energy needs within the next two decades.  So, irrespective of what potential emerges from these areas of research we are still faced with the question of meeting our actual energy needs over the next 15 to 20 years and to do that we must take decisions whether on conventional methods or nuclear methods within the next 18 months or two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 17 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much point in delaying the House unnecessarily. Our main objection to this section was outlined in detail by me yesterday during my Second Stage speech. We object to the concept that the increases being levied both on employees and employers are double last <Col N="1124" /> year's increases and this is happening at a time when employees and their unions are being asked to accept moderation in the proposed wage agreement and employers are being urged to take on extra staff.  The point was made that a firm employing 100 extra people would find that their bill for social welfare contributions would amount to an extra £5,000 a year.</P>
      <P>Objection was also raised to the concept of reducing by £1 per week the social welfare contributions for employees earning less than £50 a week from January and taking back 28p of that reduction from the beginning of April.  I felt that was deceitful and represented a sleight of hand and was not a proper approach.  I do not accept the Minister's earlier explanation that part of the reason for the increase in the stamp was to finance social welfare increases which came into effect last autumn.  Every Government do their housekeeping and make up their accounts at the end of the financial year, assess how much they will need for the following year and introduce their budget accordingly. When the budget is introduced the methods of paying for the moneys to be spent in one form or another should be outlined.</P>
      <P>On the Health Contributions Bill last week I said that when one asks people what they think of a budget which appears to have distributed largesse without looking for additional taxation their reaction usually is, &ldquo;I do not know how they are going to do it but they are going to take it from you some way&rdquo;.  I said that that Bill was one of the ways they were going to take this money but I did not think that less than one week later I would be standing up and saying that this was another and major way in which the Government intend financing their budget.  If increases like this are being announced it should be done in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Boland does not appear to understand the section. Rates generally were increased last October by 5 per cent.  Nothing was provided in the 1977 budget for <Col N="1125" /> those increases nor in the stamp which was also increased in 1977 to cope with those increases.  I am now proposing an increase of £1.50 in the normal rate.  Of that amount 52p, a straightforward clear-cut definite 52p, is mainly attributable to the increases made in rates last October&mdash;35p for the employer and 17p for the employee.  The Deputy can check that with the Comptroller and Auditor General if he likes, but that is the position.</P>
      <P>The only other factor of interest in regard to these increases is that this year the Exchequer is contributing 22 per cent of the overall cost of our social insurance services as against 17 per cent last year, or you could say as against 19 per cent last year.  There is a very considerable increase in the contribution which the Exchequer is making to the overall cost of the social welfare services this year.  That is not the end of the story.  So far as the lower paid worker is concerned we are making a further concession.  The stamp should be increased by £1.50 but we are not permitting it to go up the full amount.  We are lopping off 50p and increasing the stamp by only £1. Of that 50p saving, 34p goes to the employer and 16p goes to the employee in accordance with normal practice.  In addition to the £1 reduction in the stamp of the lower paid worker there is now a further 16p reduction.  This means he is now enjoying 116p mitigation of the rate of stamp payable. These are facts I would like the House to bear in mind.  They are not arguments; they are simply a straightforward statement of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland should realise that what we are doing here has been done for decades.  The statutory system is that benefits are increased.  The rate of stamp necessary to pay for those benefits is calculated having regard to the amount the Exchequer is contributing and that new rate is then brought into being each year by legislation.  That is what we are doing here.  Frankly I think Deputy Boland is just being silly in opposing this increase in the stamp. He is saying to the people that the increases made last October should not have been made, or if they were made they should not be paid for.  He <Col N="1126" /> is also saying that the increases granted in this year's budget should not have been granted, or if they were granted they should not be paid for.  There is nothing magic about what we are doing here.  It is a simple, straightforward calculation based on the statutory requirements of the social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is using contorted logic.  First, we are not doing the same thing that was done every other year.  In 1976 the Minister and his colleagues complained bitterly because the social welfare and health increases were not announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget speech.  As a result, the increases for 1977 were outlined during the budget speech, and I am saying that should have been done this year.  If the criticism was good in 1976 it is equally valid now.  I do not accept that part of the cost of the increases should be thrown back to last autumn.  The increases last autumn came about as an adjustment to keep social welfare beneficiaries in line with the increased cost of living and the Minister, in using that as an excuse, appears to be inclined to suggest that the autumn increases should not have been honoured by his Government.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that in a year when inflation is falling, when it is hoped to bring it to single figures, when employers are being encouraged to employ more workers and workers are being urged to use moderation in pay claims, this is the year when the Government should take on a larger share of the cost so as not to upset employers or employees who are being asked to bear double the increase they bore last year when inflation and wage increases were higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fundamental disagreement between us on this.  This is the wrong way to do it.  If there are to be increases they should be announced at the time of the budget and they should bear some relation to the expected rise in the cost of living.  These do not, and for that reason I am opposed to them and to the manner in which they are being announced. There is not much point in continuing <Col N="1127" /> this discussion.  The Minister has been very patient.  He was not well last week and the House ought to thank him for his presence today to ensure that the <Col N="1128" /> Bill will be discussed and implemented. However, we must register our fundamental disagreement on this matter.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Deputy's remark about the Bill going through quickly so far as this House is concerned and I trust it will have a speedy passage in the other House also.  However, even the Deputy will accept that there is only another week or so left this session and that we will be well into the next session before any real progress is made on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I expect it will be very late in the next session before the Bill goes through the Seanad.  That is the practicality of the operation of the Oireachtas. I understand that the date has to be fixed for the purpose of allowing time for the preparation and promulgation of the necessary fees order in compliance with section 23, subsection (2), and the prescribing of the necessary forms for the operation of Part III. This was the reason for giving ourselves time before the coming into operation of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points on this section that I should like the Minister to clarify.  The first relates to the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; which does not include a separate and self-contained flat.  I merely wish to inquire into the Minister's thinking as to why self-contained flats should not come within the provisions of this Bill.  As he must know, the tendency nowadays is for more people to purchase flats as opposed to living in flats on a tenancy basis.  It would appear right and proper that owners of self-contained flats have the same protection as the owners of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is defined so as to exclude self-contained flats in premises divided into two or more such flats.  However, such dwellings are not being excluded from the right to acquire fee simple.  They are excluded only from the application of the special scheme in Part III which is designed specifically for dwelling-houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a parallel provision in the Bill to prevent the creation of future ground rents and future leases of self-contained <Col N="1131" /> flats are not being prohibited in the Bill.  In recent years such flats have on occasion been bought and sold by way of leases which in everyday language would be called ground leases or leases where the fine for the grant represents effectively the purchase price of the leases granted for a long term at rents less than the rateable valuation of the flats.  It is a moot point whether any such leases could carry with them the right to purchase fee simple under the 1967 Ground Rents Act, that is to say, whether such leases can be properly called ground leases.  There is a widely-held view that there can be no such situation as four flats built over one another and all being held in fee simple in relation to one area of ground.  Since this Bill is being confined to ordinary dwelling-houses it is not intended to interfere with transactions involving such flats whatever may be the position regarding the right to purchase fee simple. Accordingly, they are being excluded specifically.  I accept that the flat phenomenon is becoming more common but there are fairly big difficulties in regard to fee simple in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of sympathy for flat dwellers.  Perhaps the question is much broader than that of their entitlement under this legislation.  Would the Minister be prepared to accept that the whole question of flats in relation to the specific point of the owners entitlement to buy out and also the whole broad question of flat dwellers needs to be looked at?  Would the Minister be prepared to look into the question of safeguards for flat dwellers?  If he is prepared to give these assurances the point need not necessarily be covered in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that there appears to be general agreement on this important point because the position is that with the growth of cities there is a growing situation of there being a substantial number of flats as distinct from dwelling-houses.  This may be very marked in this city having regard to the hoped-for building up of the inner city area.  What Deputy O'Keeffe is asking for will be necessary to make it possible for flat dwellers to obtain fee simple.</P>
      <P>The average working-class person is finding the cost of housing in Dublin prohibitive and is unable to acquire the deposit and the necessary loans from local authorities or building societies to enable him to purchase a house.  Because of this it is important that there be a situation in which people are encouraged to purchase the fee simple of their flats. This is of the utmost importance.  We have an idea of weekly tenancy in regard to flats, but with the growth of cities in the future we will have a situation where flats will be owned outright.  It should be possible to buy the fee simple for flats and this would encourage people to live in inner city areas.  I am glad that the Minister recognises that this aspect must be examined.  It has a lot of merit in the long term.</P>

      <P>I want to query the definition of &ldquo;immediate lessor&rdquo; from a legalistic viewpoint.  It is stated that &ldquo;immediate lessor&rdquo; means the person for the time being entitled to the next superior interest in the premises.  It is the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; that I am anxious to have investigated from the point of view of making sure that the Bill is correctly phrased.  I notice that in the rest of the Bill the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; is used.  This arises in section 8 and in other parts of the Bill.  Why is the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; not used in relation to this definition as opposed to the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;notice&rdquo;, in relation to the acquisition of the fee simple, means, where notices are required to be served under section 4 of the Act of 1967 on more than one person, the first served of those notices;</P>
      <P>What is the purpose of that definition? I fail to comprehend fully what the Minister has in mind by that definition and the words &ldquo;the first served of those notices&rdquo;.  It possibly relates to the fact that under the 1967 Act one served on one's immediate lessor and there was an obligation to serve on superior interests and on mortgages.  Is the explanation that it relates solely to the first notice on the immediate lessor to the exclusion of other parties?  It is not very clear.</P>

Section 4 provides that a person who intends to purchase the fee simple under that Act must serve a notice in the prescribed form of his intention to purchase on all persons holding a superior interest in the land or owning an incumbrance thereon.  This is a drafting device to get over the difficulty for the purposes of sections 10, 15 and 17 of determining the date of that notice when more than one notice is served.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section because I believe that the Bill should bind any Minister of State or any Government Department affected.  I believe it is wrong that this Bill binds private individuals and companies but prevents any Government Department or Minister from being included.  It is stated in the explanatory memorandum that section 4 provides that the proposed Act will not bind the State and I should like to outline why I feel this is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board of Works own many houses throughout the country and many people who work for them live in these houses and pay weekly, <Col N="1135" /> monthly or yearly rents.  Because these people are employees of the State they are specifically excluded from the provisions of this Bill.  A garda could move into a Board of Works house and live there all his life and after his death his widow could find herself unable to buy out the fee simple and in the long term she may not be able to remain in the house.  The Land Commission are similarly excluded.  The Land Commission are a body who lease or grant land to farmers.  Why can they do this with land and why is a farm dwelling house excluded?  Perhaps I am reading something into the Bill that is not in it and I should like the Minister to clarify the matter. When a farmer obtains an allotment of land from the Land Commission, he pays it off over a number of years and eventually he buys it out rent free and he has his own fee simple in the land. However, it is curious that the house is excluded in such a case and this is not logical.  The same situation applies with regard to the Department of Health.  In many instances doctors live in houses provided by the State, they pay rent and rates but suddenly they discover they cannot buy out the ground rent and the fee simple.  The Minister should give serious consideration to this matter.</P>
    <P>The reaction of one of my constituents who may own a few houses from which he obtains a small yearly income will be that the Dáil has gone after the person who has a few private houses whilst specifically excluding every Minister and Government Department.  The Minister should delete the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Deputy Enright there are some additional points I should like to make.  It appears that this section could operate as a hardship in certain circumstances. Let us take a situation where a State body acquires property subject to the lessee's right of the householder. We would have the situation that the lessee prior to the acquisition by the State would have had a right under the Bill but as a result of the purchase by the State he would have <Col N="1136" /> lost his right to buy out the freehold. It appears wrong that somebody who enjoyed the protection of the legislation could have lost it as a result of the acquisition of the freehold by the State.  It also appears unjust in a situation where the State itself granted a building lease either before or after the passing of this measure but because of this section the householder is not entitled to buy out the freehold.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that if, as a matter of public policy, the Minister considers that the State should be exempt from the provisions of this Bill the exceptions should be specified and equitable and just reasons given.  I put it to the Minister that there seems to be a change of heart on his part in relation to the section because on 23 February 1977 the Minister had a few comments to make about a similar provision in an earlier Bill.  At column 165 of the Official Report of that date he stated:</P>
      <P>The Minister is protecting the State as a tenant.  Whereas on the one hand the State is being protected as a tenant, on the other hand the State is not giving the the same protection to its own tenants.  It protects itself as a tenant, but its tenants are not being protected.  If I am wrong perhaps the Minister will correct me, but if I am right perhaps he will say why the State's tenants should be excluded from the protection of the Bill.  From my reading of the Bill there is no compensation from the State to its tenants if the lease is not being renewed.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the Minister had the same view a year ago which we are now putting forward.  Deputy Enright has made cogent points in favour of tenants of the State which I have been anxious to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, I would urge the Minister to give serious consideration to amending this section.  He may consider there are specific cases where this should not operate&mdash;if somebody was a tenant in a military barracks, I could envisage some reason on the grounds of security&mdash;but as a broad <Col N="1137" /> exclusion it does not seem to be justified.  If we are to give protection to the tenants of private landlords, is there any reason on a broad basis for not extending similar protection to the tenants of the State?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Heretofore it was generally accepted that the State was not bound by statutes whether passed before or after the Constitution of 1937 unless so provided by the statute in question expressly or by necessary implication.  On this basis no express provision was made in the Ground Rents Act, 1967.  As the House knows, recently this view has been called into question and, accordingly, it has been decided that an express provision should be included in the Bill that the State, the Commissioners of public Works or the Irish Land Commission will not be bound by its provisions.</P>
      <P>As is the present position under the Acts relating to landlord and tenant matters and under this Bill, the State will continue to be entitled as tenant to the benefits of the legislation.  The effect of the provision is that a ground rent tenant whose landlord is the State, the Commissioners of Public Works or the Irish Land Commission will not be enabled as of right to acquire the fee simple.  Tenants of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and of harbour authorities are put in the same position under section 16 (2) of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason for exempting the State from the obligation to transfer the fee simple is that the State is not involved in the business of leasing land and is a lessor only as an incidental aspect of holding land for public purposes.  To enable the tenant to acquire the fee simple in such land would give him freedom to engage in developments that would be basically undesirable in relation to the public purpose for which the land is held. Whenever the State can divest itself of land it does so and this is particularly true where the land is to be used for dwellings.  The trouble is that in pursuance of this policy the State has allowed some lands to be developed that are associated with other activities of the State and the public interest requires that some control be exercised <Col N="1138" /> over the use of these lands.  These include Defence lands and airport lands. Sometimes the parties have entered into such arrangements on the clear undertaking that the State may repossess the lands if required for national purposes.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that I accept that the State should not be given any privilege in this regard which cannot be fully justified in the public interest.  Accordingly, I am having a detailed study made of all leases given by the State as lessor to see whether in the case of dwellings the State should be bound.  I hoped it would be completed in time to put down an amendment on Committee Stage if warranted. This examination is taking longer to complete in some Departments than was envisaged.  If it discloses that the exemption of the State can be dispensed with, suitable amendments will be moved in the Seanad.  I am sure Deputy Enright will be glad to hear that, and Deputy O'Keeffe will not be unduly worried that I am having a change of heart.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that what the Deputy attributed to me as saying as reported at column 165 of the Official Report of 23 February was in relation to a similar clause in the Bill which my predecessor representing his party in Government had hoped to introduce.  If it can be done without.  I will introduce an amendment to meet the point.  I understand some of those who have been consulted about this detailed survey I am having carried out are favourably disposed to what I have in mind.  As soon as the study is completed, when we get to the Seanad some time next session I will be quite prepared to table an amendment.</P>

      <P>I know people living in property owned by the Office of Public Works.  The Bill refers to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland.  The Minister is a countryman involved in rural politics and he knows the situation.  The number of dwelling houses owned by the Office of Public Works is quite enormous.  The Minister dealt with land.  I am not referring to land but ordinary dwelling-houses The Office of Public Works grant leases to people for different periods. When people have been living in these dwelling-houses for a continuous period and paying rent to whatever Government Department they are attached to, they are entitled to the same rights, privileges and legal benefits as are attached to other property.  They are as much entitled to buy out their fee simple as a person living in a house built by the builder to whom he is paying ground rent.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there may be some constitutional difficulty.  I do not care what constitutional difficulties are preventing the Minister from doing this.

      <P>The Minister said we may face constitutional difficulties.  I accept that, but if people have lived in a house for two generations and a Bill goes through this House which entitles everybody else to obtain the fee simple to their property they would have a lot of merit in bringing a constitutional case as well.  I appreciate the difficulty involved, but it would be very wrong if a family who lived in a house for a generation were unable to obtain the fee simple to their houses. In the event of the death of the breadwinner, the widow may be excluded from obtaining the fee simple or, if she wishes to sell her dwelling-house, she may be prevented from doing so.  This is wrong and it should be changed.  If people are living in a house and have an interest and a right in the house, they have the right to buy out a fee simple if an ordinary builder owns it, but if a Minister acting on behalf of the State buys a dwelling-house the tenant is prevented from purchasing his fee simple.  There is something seriously wrong with the Bill if that can occur.</P>
      <P>As the Bill is framed, it would appear to me to exclude this person. For a Bill to be fair, it must be fair to everybody irrespective of who he is.  It must be seen to be fair to the person to whom we want to grant the benefit, and it must also be seen that we in this House are not acting to safeguard the State while we are seen to be against private individuals.  This could come across to many people who might try to read something which is not there into the Bill for their own reasons.  There is something wrong in a Bill which appears to be compelling a private individual to sell his fee simple and, at the same time, excluding a Department of State.  It will have to be amended and I am glad the Minister said he will look into the matter on Report Stage or in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to investigate this point carefully. This question is covered in the 1967 Act in section 3 (5).  There is a reference to the fact that the inclusion of a certificate signed for and on behalf of the Commissioner of Valuation is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the valuation and a further provision that every such fee shall be determined, accounted for and applied in the same manner as fees charged by the commissioner pursuant to section 9 of that Act.  Under section 9 the liability would be on the tenant.  If the same provision applies and the Minister accepts that the tenant should not be paying this fee, I do not believe the position is clear.  The chances are that as things stand the tenant would have to pay.  I feel it should be made clearer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following sub-section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  In subsection 1 (a) and section 14 &lsquo;subsidiary and ancillary&rsquo; means land which is or has been wholly in the occupation of the lessee thereof and is used by the lessee substantially for amenity purposes in conjunction with permanent buildings which are situate thereon and in respect of which the rateable valuation of the land does not exceed one-half of the buildings.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the expression &ldquo;subsidiary and ancillary&rdquo;.  The Bill does not apply unless there are permanent buildings on the land, and the portion of the land not covered by those buildings is subsidiary and ancillary to those buildings.  I have seen considerable difficulties arise in relation to the definition of the term &ldquo;subsidiary and ancillary&rdquo;.  I have had an amount of correspondence indicating that there is a widespread problem.  I understand that, at the very least, it affects a number of people in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, in Dun-drum and also a number of people in Tullamore.  There may be others of which I am not aware.</P>
      <P>The problem arises because in the old days land was not as valuable as it is now.  Anyone buying a house now is restricted to about a quarter of an acre for a garden.  In the old days on the outskirts of towns and cities it was common enough to have a considerably larger amount of land&mdash;perhaps three, four, five, six or eight acres. Many people who hold land under leases granted in the old days now find themselves in a very difficult situation. I appreciate that there is a provision in the Bill covering what are referred to as partly built leases and allowing for a division, but this does not entirely solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary and ancillary&rdquo; where a man has an old lease which gives him, say, five acres, it will be very difficult to consider <Col N="1147" /> more than perhaps half an acre or an acre as being subsidiary and ancillary to the dwelling.  A person in this situation will have the balance of a holding in which he has been living for many years unprotected by this Bill.  If it were a large area, it would probably be protected under the Land Acts as an agricultural tenancy; and if it were a very small area, it would be totally protected by this Bill.  The difficulty is the case where it falls between two stools.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the people in this situation. For these reasons I put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's views are the same as the former Minister's view in dealing with the question of ground rents: that all known types of ground rent leases should be covered by the Bill. We can specifically identify here a section of people who have leases on which they have put up buildings but who are not clearly entitled to buy out the freehold of the entire of such leases.  My understanding is that these leases can vary in the term granted and in the rents.  There are leases ranging from 90 to 150 years of which I have been given particulars and there are rents varying from £50 to £100. I have also been told of people in this category who have made offers of up to 50 years' purchase and have been turned down flat.</P>
    <P>The definition of subsidiary and ancillary that I have suggested would meet some of the problem.  I suggest that the Minister might even go further to meet what may be a more widespread problem than we all think. Perhaps the problem could be dealt with in other ways, but I have tried to tackle it in this way.  After I put down this amendment I found that there was a number of other cases which would not even be covered under the amendment.  On Second Stage the Minister reiterated that he was anxious to cover all known classes of ground rent leases.  There-fore, I would ask him, now that he knows of the existence of this kind of problem, to put his mind to finding a solution to it.</P>
    <P>One of the other difficulties that has <Col N="1148" /> arisen in relation to such leases is that some landlords have attempted to impose very restrictive covenants which were on the original leases.  Those lands, having originally been granted at a time when amenity lands would have a broader definition by way of gardens, paddocks and so forth and land was a lot cheaper, are perhaps now being used for other purposes. The leaseholders are in a very exposed situation.  Details have been communicated to me of a situation where an absentee landlord who is living on the Continent is taking proceedings to forfeit the entire lease because of breaches of the covenant.  This is not a political point but one where I feel the Minister might consider trying to find a solution to meet a very difinite problem.  I do not suggest that my amendment by the extension of &ldquo;ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo; fully meets the problem.  I do not push it to the extent of saying to the Minister: &ldquo;Accept this amendment and no other.&rdquo;  I really push that he would, in the light of what I have said, see this problem and try to find a way around this to meet this difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy O'Keeffe has said on that point.  I believe what he is getting across is that a good substantial dwelling-house exists on land and there may be quite a sizeable garden or field attached to the property.  The land in this case would not be deemed to be ancillary to the house because of the size of the land portion in conjunction with the dwelling-house.  This would appear to exclude the person from buying out the fee simple in that dwelling-house because of the land attached to the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that throughout Ireland there are very substantial gardens attached to many premises.  The problem Deputy O'Keeffe spoke about arises because of the extent of those gardens.  I know of quite a few cases where there is a garden of one acre or one-and-a-half acres at the rear of a dwelling-house.  There might be no other way in to that land except by the side entrance to the house.  There are many situations where a house <Col N="1149" /> is built along the roadside and at one side of the house there is an entrance to a very large garden.  If there is no alternative entrance to that land the only person it is of any benefit to is the owner of the land.  Subsection (1) of the section states: &ldquo;if the following conditions are not complied with.&rdquo;  Paragraph (a) of that subsection states:</P>
    <P>that there are permanent buildings on the land and that the portion of the land not covered by those buildings is subsidiary and ancillary to them;</P>
    <P>The way it appears to me is that unless the land is subsidiary and ancillary to the house referred to in the section we are preventing the person buying out his fee simple.  This would be a hardship on the people involved.  The Minister should try and meet the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo; is used in sections 9 and 14 in relation to land on which there are permanent buildings and which, when certain other conditions are fulfilled, attracts the right to acquire the fee simple.  The expression is also used in the existing law and its effect is to deny lessees whose unbuilt-on land is not &ldquo;ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo; to the buildings the right to acquire the fee simple. These leases are called partly-built leases.  The only remedy available to the lessee is to await the termination of the lease and then get an apportionment of the land into the buildings plus the ancillary and subsidiary land, and the unbuilt-on land.  The lessee is then entitled to get a renewed lease of the first portion, that is the buildings plus the ancillary and subsidiary land, and consequently can also get the fee simple of that portion.  I refer the Deputies to section 6 of the 1958 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill introduces an important change in the law relating to partly-built leases.  Instead of having to await the termination of the lease, the lessee will have the right to get his fee simple at once in that portion of land which is ancillary and subsidiary.  Of course, he can hold on to the remainder of the land for the duration of the lease.  The determination of what is &ldquo;ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo;<Col N="1150" /> is being left to arbitration rather than having a sort of &ldquo;rule of thumb&rdquo; approach such as, I think in fairness to the amendment, is what is proposed in it.  This is because no two cases are alike and each case must be examined individually to see if in fact the land in question is or is not &ldquo;ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo;.  This, of course, can only be done by way of an <i>ad hoc</i> approach either by a court or by arbitration.</P>
    <P>The real problem here is that any rule of thumb definition of &ldquo;ancillary and subsidiary&rdquo; can mean in effect a transfer from one party to another of what can be extremely valuable propery rights.  There is, for example, at present something of a campaign being mounted by tenants whose lands consist of a large number of acres in County Dublin.  The application of the rule of thumb proposed, that the valuation of the land would not exceed half the valuation of the buildings, would certainly mean a windfall of potential development of the lands in question to the tenants.</P>
    <P>The existing situation has at least the merit of being obviously fair to all the parties.  The change proposed in the Bill will ensure that redevelopment cannot be held up.  It must be emphasised and clearly understood that what is really involved is the redevelopment of those lands.  The Rents and Leaseholds Commission recommended in 1954 that a lease should qualify as a building lease, as a ground lease, if the rateable valuation of the land not covered by buildings did not exceed one-fourth of the rateable valuation of the site or sites including the buildings.  That recommendation was not carried either into the 1958 or into the 1967 Landlord and Tenant Acts and was not repeated by the Landlord and Tenant Commission, when they reviewed the 1967 Act.</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant Commission have this matter under consideration again, but it is not possible to say right now if they have any recommendations that would be available in time to take into consideration before the proceedings on this Bill are completed.  Again, if they have not <Col N="1151" /> completed their deliberations, then the matter could be considered at a later stage and I would be quite prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>On a technical level, the formula proposed in the amendment is open to serious objection.  First of all, it is not proposed that the valuation list for individual dwelling-houses will be kept after this year because of the abolition of rates.  Secondly, the formula could not be used at all in cases where a separate valuation for land has not been entered on the list.  There is no general rule as to whether land over a certain area will be separately valued.  Thirdly, since the valuation of land is related only to its agricultural uses one rarely finds land valued at over £2 an acre, which is of course meaningless as a guide to the development potential of the land.  Finally, from the point of view of syntax, the words &ldquo;subsidiary and ancillary&rdquo; as related to sections 9 (1) (a) and 14 may refer to land but it cannot mean land. It is a very complex matter.  It is a very serious and grave matter.  As I say, the commission have it but, if their deliberations are completed, I am quite prepared to have another look at it to see if I can do what is asked. It is something we cannot go into because there could be enormous development potential with very large sums involved and so one has to be very careful.</P>

      <P>There is great difficulty, admittedly.  I know one case where a person has a fairly big house with two to two-and-a-half acres at the back.  He derives his living mainly from market gardening.  There is only one entrance to the rear and that is <Col N="1152" /> at the right hand side of the dwelling-house. The only other entrance would be at the back of the garden where there is a field which goes down into a vast area of land.  If the course suggested by the Minister is adopted the Registrar of Titles will decide to cut off the dwelling-house with a small portion of land and give that to the tenant who is buying out the fee simple and give the remainder of the land to the original landlord.  In that case serious damage could be done to the value of the tenant's property.</P>
      <P>I would like to be fair to both the landlord and the tenant but there could be a serious conflict of interests.  I could understand the case of the ten acres of prime development land worth £1 million.  One could not hand over vast sums like that to someone. One has to consider the rights of the person who owns the land.  One must also consider the rights of a person with a garden or perhaps a field with stabling for ponies.  It would not do to give a tenant with a big garden his dwelling-house plus one rood and deprive him of two acres of garden and give that back to the landlord.  If that happened there might be interference with the tenant's privacy.  There is difficulty here and I am glad the matter will be reconsidered before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that when these lands were originally leased they were regarded as amenity lands.  At the time they were leased 30 or 40 years ago they were virtually in the country but, because of certain developments, they might now be regarded as part of the city.  There is considerable development potential in such lands.  Those who leased them use them for market gardening.  In one case they are used as a caravan park.  These people will be in considerable difficulty even if they exercise their rights under section 14.  They will have no difficulty in acquiring the freeholds of the dwelling-houses and a small area of land but then there will be a balance of two to five acres perhaps without any permanent buildings and therefore without any entitlement to the purchase of the freehold.  There must be something <Col N="1153" /> we can do to help in these cases while at the same time ensuring that the rights of the landlord are not taken away.  Numbers have written to me with this kind of problem.  That is why I tabled this amendment designed to broaden the definition of subsidiary and ancillary.  First of all, I would ask the Minister's sympathy for these people and, secondly, I would ask for a commitment to have the problems looked at sympathetically so that these people will not find themselves with a threat of forfeiture.  That is the type of problem that is posed under this heading, I strongly urge the Minister, if he does not see his way to accept my amendment, to have this type of problem examined with a view to finding a solution.</P>

      <P>I support the case Deputy O'Keeffe makes for this amendment. Unfortunately, I was unable to be here for all of the debate.  It appears that the Minister has put forward some cogent reasons why the amendment cannot be accepted.  If so, well and good; the reasons are there.  But we have all had representations from people who certainly would not appear to come into the category to which the Minister's observations apply. Obviously, the spirit of the Bill is to ensure that every known case of ground rent should be capable of being redeemed and it is the Minister's intention that this should obtain as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister has given what I take to be an undertaking that he will have a close look at this section of the Bill, this definition of &ldquo;subsidiary and ancillary&rdquo;, to see if it is possible to include the type of person of whose circumstances we are all aware.  I am sure that the Minister had representations such as we have had on this side of the House and that he knows the cases to which we are referring and that there are people who are victims of landlords who have no interest in co-operating with them in this regard.  I therefore look forward on Report Stage to the Minister coming in with an amendment which, perhaps, would be acceptable to all.</P>

      <P>In case there might <Col N="1154" /> be confusion in anybody's mind including my own, I would be reasonably sure that, say, a house and anything under one acre of ground would be deemed ancillary and subsidiary.  What we are basically talking about here is bigger tracts of land.  Deputy O'Keeffe will appreciate from what I said a short time ago that I cannot accept the amendment.  With regard to his choice, an amendment or a commitment, I should like to repeat for the purpose of clarification and in an effort to help Deputy Desmond, the Landlord and Tenant Commission have this extremely important matter under consideration at present.  I cannot say what their recommendations, if any, may be or if they will be available in time to be considered before this Bill is completed but if I have them, I am certainly quite prepared to consider the matter at that stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright spoke of particular cases such as somebody doing market gardening.  To the best of my knowledge and belief on the advice available to me nobody is going to take that bit of land from these people or interfere with it.  They may perhaps want to buy the fee simple solely for the purpose of redevelopment of that land.  Because of the fact that they have the land and are using it for whatever purpose, a caravan park or a market garden, they will hold it as long as they hold the lease.  If I were to accept Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment I believe it would result in a very unfair situation. I am strongly advised this would be so because, as the Bill stands if it were used by the tenant I am satisfied that he would get a fair share of the value of the property to be developed.  If the amendment were incorporated in legislation the tenant, as it were, would get his hand on the honey jar but the landlord would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was admitted by Deputy Enright, we are talking about properties worth well over £1 million or more.  It is an extremely serious matter.  Perhaps I have repeated myself for the purpose of showing the difficulty I am in and to which I am sure my predecessor was in.  I want to be fair&mdash; as I know the Deputies opposite want to be fair and Deputy Enright said <Col N="1155" /> so&mdash;to the landlord and to the tenant. I believe that the Bill as it is gives a very fair deal to both parties.  I am convinced that if we change from what we have we would not be giving fair play all round.  If the Landlord and Tenant Commission have any recommendation on this I am prepared to consider it in the interests of fair play for everybody.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of matters I want to raise on the section. I shall run through them for the Minister.  Section 9 (1) provides that the lease is to apply to a person who holds land under a lease provided he complies with a number of conditions. The first condition is that there must be permanent buildings on the land. In recent times there has been considerable development in providing homes for people by way of mobile homes.  We may see much more of this in the future.  I wonder if a mobile home on a property would be considered to be a permanent building. That is the first matter I should like to have looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second provision under section 9 is that the permanent buildings in question must not be an improvement within the meaning of subsection (2) which defines an improvement.  I realise these words have been used in other landlord and tenant statutes in the past but in looking carefully at this Bill it occurred to me to ask: What is the real need for such restriction? What difference does it make whether the permanent buildings are an improvement or not?  Even if this restriction is left in, it occurred to me that you might have a situation where a householder might fall between two stools.  If somebody builds an extra room to his house that is clearly an improvement.  If somebody demolishes <Col N="1156" /> his house and builds an entirely new one that is obviously not an improvement. What would be the situation where somebody had a relatively small house, three or four rooms, and built on a considerable extension of, say, seven or eight rooms?  Would that be an improvement?  How would he stand under the definition of &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;? It would be hard to see how putting eight rooms on to three could be considered to be ancillary or subsidiary to the original building.  At the same time there is reference here to the building losing its original identity. It is still a house but it will lose its identity.  There is an intermediate stage which should be covered, because obviously if a man puts on one room or ten rooms that should not affect the situation one iota.  That is a point in relation to the improvement.  I ask the Minister to look at this and to consider why there is a need for this restriction.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to raise is in relation to subsection (3) (a), and this arises where permanent buildings were erected in pursuance of an agreement for the grant of a lease but there is no expressed evidence of the agreement available.  In that event, the subsection says:</P>
    <P>(a)  if it is proved that the buildings were erected by the person to whom the lease was subsequently made, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the agreement was in fact made and that the buildings were erected in accordance with it;</P>
    <P>Would that subsection be improved by the addition of the words &ldquo;or his successor in title&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;was subsequently made&rdquo;?  In other words should the provision of that subsection be extended through the person who originally got the lease to his successor in title.  There could be a loophole here.  I imagine that this relief, as it were, would not be available to somebody who acquired the house, for instance a son of the original lessee.  It is a rather legalistic point, but I ask the Minister to check whether this provision should be extended to the successors in title of the person to whom the lease was originally made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> The fourth and the last point I want to question is in relation to subsection (5).  Is the arbitrator the county registrar or the Land Registry?  However, that is not the point I am making here.  The subsection says:</P>
    <P>(5)  The arbitrator may declare a person to be a person to whom this Part applies notwithstanding that the buildings were, in whole or in part, erected in contravention of a covenant, if he is of opinion that it would be unreasonable to order otherwise.</P>
    <P>That is very general.  On what basis does the arbitrator decide whether it is unreasonable or not?  There seems to be no statutory guidance of any description. This seems to be a recipe for litigation.  I imagine that any such point arising before an arbitrator would be fought bitterly before him and afterwards on appeal to the courts. If we are all of the outlook that this legislation should be made very simple and as inexpensive as possible for householders, would the Minister consider being more specific as to what is reasonable or unreasonable in the context of this subsection?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 9, on the question of the right of the lessee in subsection (1), the Bill sets out the conditions which have to be satisfied by lessees.  These conditions are spelled out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of the subsection and they correspond to section 4 (2) (b), (c) and (d) of the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958.  The lease must be a lease of land which is built on&mdash;that means built on in the sense of original building work and not merely by way of additional alteration to other buildings&mdash;while any land under the lease that is not built on must be subsidiary and ancillary to the buildings.  Finally the buildings should not have been erected in contravention of the lease.  There is a distinction in the 1958 Act between rural and urban land which is being dropped.  The changes that are being made are proposed in paragraph (d) of the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) represents the re-enactment of the 1958 Act, with drafting changes only and the definition <Col N="1158" /> of &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; in section 2 of the Act.  The effect is to preserve unchanged the provision of the 1958 Act in accordance with which the permanent buildings must not be simply an improvement.  With regard to sub-section (3), this proposes a provision under the lines of section 4 of the 1958 Act with drafting changes only.  Its effect is to ensure that the types of building lease recognised by section 4 of the 1958 Act will attract the right to purchase the fee simple under Part II of the Bill.  Subsection (4) makes a provision similar to that in section 4 (5) of the 1958 Act and its effect is to apply the same conditions in regard to the right to purchase the fee simple. Again this provision with regard to the right to obtain the reversionary lease applies under the 1958 Act.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) makes provision on the lines of section 4 (6) again of the 1958 Act with drafting changes only. In the 1958 Act it is the Circuit Court which has the discretion to declare a person to be entitled to a reversionary lease, despite the fact that the buildings were erected in contravention of a covenant.  Here it is the arbitrator, whether it be the country registrar or the Registrar of Titles, who has the discretion in the context of the purchase of the fee simple.  I am satisfied, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution for the jurisdiction of the courts, that it is appropriate for the arbitrator to exercise this jurisdiction in the case of the acquisition of the fee simple.</P>
    <P>With regard to the definition of a permanent building, this is quite a serious one and I cannot say whether or not a mobile home would qualify for that.  The definition of permanent buildings is an appropriate matter for the courts, because what might be a permanent building now might not necessarily be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's running down through the various sections, but I would like to come back to the question of permanent buildings.  I suggest that in preparing legislation we should not really be preparing for court cases.  We should as far as possible be clarifying the situation to the extent that we are not providing a recipe for litigation. That appeared to be what the Minister was saying when he said that it could be left to the courts.  He will accept that we are not really trying to prepare a lot of extra work for the courts by getting this Bill through.  I would like the Minister to look at the broad question of people living in mobile homes and similar accommodation, because I have seen considerable and growing evidence of this in recent times and I feel that this trend is going to continue.</P>
      <P>Very often people living in mobile homes are from the weaker and more underprivileged sections of the community and could not afford to be litigating their case before the courts. If the Minister feels there is a good case to extend the benefits of this legislation to people living in such accommodation I would very strongly suggest it should be spelled out clearly that this is the intention.  On the other hand, if it is his intention that such householders should not benefit from this legislation he should say so and make it clear in the Bill.  We have the worst of all worlds by leaving the matter up in the air, encouraging litigation by people who can least afford it.  Ultimately they will find they will lose such litigation and are not covered.  I strongly suggest that these people should be allowed to buy out. In other words, mobile homes should be classified as permanent buildings for the purposes of this section and this point should be clarified.  A person in a mobile home is entitled to have it classified as a permanent building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which needs to be clarified is the definition of the word <Col N="1160" />&ldquo;improvement&rdquo;.  The Minister went through the section but there is this problem, whether we call it a loophole or a lacuna, of somebody who built on to a small house a very large extension which could not be regarded as subsidiary and ancillary and at the same time the completed structure could not be regarded as losing its original identity.  Where exactly does that fall?  Is such a building an improvement under this legislation?</P>
    <P>My second point is rather legalistic and perhaps the Minister might care to have it looked into.  In my view people living in mobile homes should know where they stand.  Apart from any constitutional implications of sub-section (5), the arbitrator has the power to say what is reasonable or unreasonable without giving the slightest guideline. That is another recipe for litigation. I would like the Minister to come back on the question of the permanent buildings and say whether they include mobile homes and if it would be wise and desirable to specify what would be reasonable or unreasonable in deciding under subsection (5).</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the definition of permanent building to the courts.  I understand this has been so since early thirties and has worked very well.  There has not been any difficulty with regard to it in that form. Its record of operation has been very successful and we have every hope it will be as successful in the future.  I do not want to give any opinion that might mislead owners of mobile homes. I propose to leave this as it is.  I would not like to anticipate what the courts might decide with regard to the position of a mobile home.  I am prepared to leave it to them.  There is no doubt that is quite a good debating point and we could put it backwards and forwards for many hours.  As I said, I am satisfied to leave this as it is because it has been working well for many years.  I assure the Deputy that there have been no complaints about it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider specifying the situation in regard to subsection (5), because the <Col N="1161" /> owners of mobile homes seem to be left up in the air?  I strongly feel that point should be clarified one way or the other.  But if the Minister feels like that, there is nothing more I can do. I urge him to look into it further before the Bill is finalised, either on Report Stage or in the Seanad.  Would it not be better and reduce the prospect of litigation by specifying more clearly what would be reasonable or unreasonable in making a decision under sub-section (5)?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the problem here is that there are different types of mobile homes.  Particularly in seaside counties we have mobile homes permanently parked.  In other cases they are parked only for certain periods perhaps the summer months. That is why I say definitely that it is wiser to leave it to the courts to decide the position.  Between now and Report Stage I am prepared to discuss the matter further with my advisers, but there are difficulties.  If the Deputy can convince me&mdash;and this matter will probably be raised again&mdash;that there is room for change, I am prepared to accept that.</P>

      <P>What does the Minister think about subsection (5) and the very broad powers given to the arbitrator without any statutory direction as to how these powers are being exercised?  There is no indication as to how the householder would stand.  It appears that this will involve further court proceedings. As a politician, or somebody involved in legislation, this is something I think we should not be encouraging.</P>

It is only right that I should be very slow&mdash; indeed, I should resist the temptation <Col N="1162" />&mdash;of telling an arbitrator what to do. He has discretion and we should leave him that discretion.  I am satisfied the arbitrator will do what is expected of him.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 46, to delete &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section sets out various conditions, one of which must be complied with in addition to the permanent conditions set out in section 9.  There are six other conditions any one of which will qualify when coupled with the provisions in section 9.  Subsection (7) provides for a situation where a lease is for a period of not less than 50 years:</P>
      <P>(a)  partly in consideration of the payment of a sum of money (other than rent) by the lessee to the lessor at or immediately before the grant of the lease and, for this purpose, any money paid in redemption of any part of the rent reserved by the lease (whether the money was paid in pursuance of a covenant in the lease or in pursuance of an agreement made between the lessee and the lessor during the currency of the lease) shall be deemed to be part of the consideration, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> (b)  partly in consideration of the expenditure (otherwise than on decoration) of a sum of money by the lessee on the premises demised by the lease, or</P>
    <P>(c)  partly in consideration of both that payment and that expenditure, where the sum so paid or expended or the total of those sums was not less than fifteen times the yearly amount of the rent or the greatest rent reserved by the lease, whichever is the less.</P>
    <P>Fifteen times is mentioned in the Bill and Deputy Desmond and I propose that that multiplier be reduced to five. This amendment is along the lines of a suggestion by ACRA.  Having regard to the overall spirit and intention of the Bill, this provision should be modified to make it easier for householders to qualify.  The multiplier of 15 seems to be arbitrary.  A strong case can be made for the lower figure which would bring many more people within the terms of the Bill.  We therefore ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has indicated that this is along the lines of a submission by ACRA and having listened to the Minister's Second Reading speech and knowing his attitude to this problem I cannot see how he can fail to agree with the amendment. The purpose is to make it as simple as possible to apply the terms of the Bill. Reducing the multiplier to five would facilitate many more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure here refers to the amount of money a tenant must spend on the property or give to the landlord as capital sum so as to qualify for the lease.  If this amount is at least 15 times the amount of the rent, one of the conditions is fulfilled and the lessee may qualify for the right to acquire the fee simple. The other conditions are set out in section 9.  The whole point of the multiplier is to establish that the tenant has spent so much on the house as will give him the right to claim owner-ship of the bricks and mortar, and clearly five times would not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The multiplier of 15 was first provided for in section 46 of the 1931 <Col N="1164" /> Act.  It is repeated in the 1958 Act and has not been questioned seriously. Inflation may be considered, but it can be claimed that inflation has affected building costs more than ground rents and indeed that inflation would justify increasing the multiplier. The Landlord and Tenant Commission considered the multiplier in their Second Report and recommended that new classes of lessees and tenants should be recognised as ground tenants, but instead of recommending any change the House should be aware that they endorsed the multiplier of 15.  As well as that there is no record of any case of hardship being brought to notice as a result of the existence of this multiplier during 40 years or more. It is fair to say that expenditure of 15 times the ground rent as a lump sum payment is very low.  I am sure both Deputy Desmond and Deputy O'Keeffe will acknowledge that again this is something that has worked in the past.  It was reviewed a very short time ago by the Landlord and Tenant Commission and instead of recommending any change they were prepared to endorse it as it was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A point was raised regarding an additional category of persons who should be entitled possibly to buy out provided they complied with the other sections.  The question relates to lessees who hold under a long lease with an unexpired residue of perhaps 50 or 100 years.  The point is that if somebody has a long lease with a long time to run it may be possible that he does not comply with the provision regarding permanent buildings or improvements.  Many people might not comply with the covenant provision.  But, allowing for the necessity to be arbitrary regarding the length of the lease and the residue, surely it would be sensible to extend the provisions of this Bill to such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can take it to the utmost extent and say that a person might have a lease for 999 years of which, say, <Col N="1165" /> 700 years have still to run.  It is possible that for one reason or another the lessee under such a lease would not be entitled to the benefit of this legislation.  In such circumstances it seems to me that nobody would suffer if such a category were given entitlement to buy out.  In effect this would be good for everybody.  I shall not go so far as to bring in a landlord who wished to sell, but at any rate it would be good for the lessee that in such circumstances he would be able to acquire freehold, the old definition of which was to own property from the centre of the earth to the top of the sky.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider such an addition?  I do not expect him to give an off-the-cuff answer to that, but I would ask him to view the situation sympathetically and to incorporate it on Report Stage should he consider it worthy of commendation.</P>

      <P>In the normal case of a man buying a plot of land on which he intended to erect a substantial dwelling-house I can understand that the rent would be less than the rateable valuation. However, the section sets out alternative conditions, one of which must also be complied with.  The yearly rent on a property would need to be very low to be less than a rateable valuation of, say, £10.</P>

      <P>There is another situation on which I should like clarification. Let us take the case of someone who is living in a very old house and is paying his rent.  Because of the very bad condition of the house the county medical officer condemns it and the man decides to knock it down.

      <P>In the event of a very old lease, going back perhaps 200 years, there would be no problem so far as the requirement of 50 years is concerned.  But in circumstances such as I have outlined, in which the rent would be very low and the landlord would have no intention of supplying the lessee with a new house, could the lessee buy out the fee simple of a house he decided to build from his own resources?

      <P>I can visualise a situation where someone has a valuable premises of, say, one rood in a prominent position in the centre of Dublin but the building is very old.  The landlord could be avaricious and decide that the best way to get rid of the lessee was to freeze him out.  The steps he takes to that end include neglecting to repair the doors of the house; the windows are damp and falling down and if there are slates loose he helps to get rid of them instead of replacing them.  He generally makes the place uninhabitable.  The person living in the house is poor and paying a small rent and his house is uninhabitable.  He goes to the bank and they recognise that he has a valuable premises which would be worth quite an amount but because of the bad condition he knocks it down and builds a new house.  Is such a person protected by this Bill? He is in a weak position and the landlord is in a strong position.  Is the person living in a tenement who knocks it down and rebuilds protected under the terms of this Bill?</P>

There are valuable old houses in this city which can only be classed as tenements and I have known landlords who have gone out of their way to make conditions uninhabitable for people living in such houses and I have great sympathy for those who are forced to live in such conditions.  If from their own resources they are able to build a house we should ensure that they are protected under this Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 25, to delete &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;five years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this section we are dealing with the rights of a lessee under an expired lease.  Where the lessee has a lease which expired within eight years before the commencement of the Act he can, in certain circumstances, have the right to acquire the fee simple, but this right is restricted to a period of 12 months.  It seems to me that the spirit behind the section is excellent but why confine such right to 12 months?  I can envisage householders taking quite a while to familiarise themselves with the sections of this Bill.  In the past when time limits were put on certain rights many people have been disappointed because they have not been able to exercise their rights within such time limit.  I am suggesting, and would strongly urge the Minister to accept, that the time limit in question, the period during which the lessee can apply and take advantage of this section, should be extended to five years.  This would permit the lessee an adequate time.  Despite all the brouhaha about ground rents I am quite certain there are many people who hardly know what is going on.  I should not like to see such people penalised because of a restriction of 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 4, I want to say that the section is very welcome and has met many of the cases with which we have all been familiar.  We appreciate that the intention behind the section is excellent and it is because we want to make it more effective that we believe the time given to those whose leases have expired within eight years should be longer than 12 months.  This is a very short period.  A number of people to whom the Act will apply when it becomes law are not aware of the provisions it will contain.  It is extremely complicated, even for those of us without legal expertise who are trying to address ourselves to it now.  The case was made during the Second Reading that it was such a complicated measure that it would be desirable to have some form of documentation or leaflet giving advice to people who would be in a position to buy out their ground rents and that this should be done when this becomes law.  This would explain to people what their rights are.  I hope that the Minister sees the virtue of something like that.  If this were to happen additional time would be needed to make the documentation or leaflet available to people and several months could elapse.  In view of the good intention behind the section, I feel it would be perfected if a period such as five years were allowed <Col N="1170" /> and I would appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would encourage the Minister to substitute a period of five years instead of 12 months.  If the lease had expired the person would be entitled to a yearly lease and the tenant would be in a weak position with regard to the price at which the rent would be fixed.  The rent could be increased on a yearly basis or they might reach agreement to have a rent review every three years.  Where the original rent might have been £100 or £200, the tenant could find the rent increased by £300 in the first year, then by £500 and so on.  The situation could be most unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I am convinced if one made an inquiry in any building estate containing 100 houses probably 90 people would not know when their lease was due to expire.  Many people do not know their lease has expired until they receive formal notice.  The vast majority of people will not be aware of the provisions of this section.  The amendment is fair and reasonable and it should have the approval of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables persons whose leases have expired during a period of eight years before the commencement to acquire the fee simple within 12 months after the commencement. I am strongly of the view that a case cannot be made for giving the tenants concerned a longer period within which to exercise their right.  I should like the House to understand that all these people have to do is to serve notice under sections 20 or 21.  It would be wrong in principle to give such tenants too long a period within which to avail of this important right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly it is intended as a means of clearing up as speedily as possible a no-man's land situation which I am afraid has been allowed to develop. The right given in the section repeats a somewhat similar right given in the 1958, 1967 and the 1971 Acts.  While in the 1958 and 1967 Acts provisions were more limited in their application principally in that they dealt with leases that expired within five years and not eight years, they too provided that the right must be exercised within 12 <Col N="1171" /> months.  The 1971 Act provided for leases that had expired up to eight years previously.  Under that Act the right had to be exercised within 12 months. I am assured that no complaints have been received or recorded in the Department of Justice that the period is inadequate.</P>
    <P>I should think that anybody who had a problem with regard to a lease for the past eight years would be much alive to the present situation.  In an effort to protect their interests I should imagine such people would be very much on the ball and would take the steps now open to them.  For the reasons I have given and as we want to clear up as speedily as possible the no-man's land situation that exists with regard to the question of title, I am satisfied this is the best way to do it. We do not envisage any complaints. We have not had any up to now and we consider the measure is quite workable as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we might do a bit of horse-trading?  Would the Minister go some way to meet the situation?  As a result of the publicity that may arise because of this discussion, there is a good chance that more people will become aware of their rights.  However, I am convinced many people will lose out because they are unaware of the situation.  I see the point the Minister has in mind, to put a time limit for the purpose of encouraging people to get in quickly, but he will also have to bear in mind that as a result of putting a time limit people will lose out.  Would he meet the situation half-way by putting in a period of three years?  At least it would be an improvement on the present situation.</P>

      <P>I always like to meet a reasonable request.  Before I say to the House what I am going to do with regard to what has been described as a reasonable request, I should like to point out that I find it extremely difficult to understand or accept that a person whose lease is running out would not be aware of that situation. If I were satisfied with what Deputy O'Keeffe has said with regard to people <Col N="1172" /> not knowing about the situation I would certainly worry.  I would have to do something about the situation and ensure that they were given more time.  However, the Deputy will appreciate it is difficult to accept that people with problems with regard to their leases would not know it.  I should have thought they would be well aware of that fact.  I see Deputy Enright shaking his head in disagreement.  I am prepared to have another look at this and, if necessary, we will come forward with something on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>There are quite a number of people who know that their leases have run out but what is worrying me is that they may not be aware of their entitlements under this section. If one investigates landlord and tenant matters one finds the most amazing situations, where rents have not been collected, where landlords have gone away, where leases have run out and where people have not been able to do anything about it.  You will find old people possibly who do not understand what is involved but who are in this difficult situation.  A good benefit is conveyed under the section and I want to ensure that people will have the option of taking advantage of it.  It is not so much a problem that people will not know their leases have run out.  The major problem will be that they will not know they have an entitlement under this section.</P>

      <P>I did not put down an amendment to section 14 but I am a bit concerned about the position of the householder who is left with two leases, one a partly-built lease and the other the lease on the residue.  We discussed this earlier in relation to the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary and ancillary&rdquo;. While everything will be in order in relation to the household and the area of land which will be considered subsidiary and ancillary, and he will be able to buy out, he is left high and dry in relation to the balance of the property.  There would not be any permanent buildings on the residue and he would appear not to be entitled to any relief.  He would not be entitled to relief even by way of a reversionary lease under the 1958 Act.  I am not quite certain about that.</P>
      <P>It is an aspect of the matter we discussed earlier.  I should like the Minister to consider the situation of such a person who might find himself able to buy out his house and the bit of ground around it under the Bill but, having done so, he would be left high and dry at the expiry of his lease in relation to the balance of the land.</P>

      <P>It has been pointed out to me that this section, which deals with the rights of yearly tenants, has an anomaly arising as a result of the combination of it and the section which deals with leases.  It has been suggested to me that section 15 should be extended to cover lessees where the lease is for a term of less than 50 years. The position under section 15 is that. <Col N="1177" /> subject to other conditions, the entitlement is extended where the land has been continuously held for a period of not less than 25 years, provided the other conditions are complied with.  It has been suggested to me that there is a serious anomaly that a person holding under a lease granted for a term of between 25 and 50 years and meeting all the other conditions in the section would not be entitled to purchase whereas a yearly tenant is entitled to purchase provided he has held it for 25 years.  It has been suggested that the yearly tenant benefits under the Bill but there is discrimination against a lessee for a term of between 25 and 50 years.  I would be obliged if the Minister would look into this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where a lessor of land which is held subject to a lease tenancy or interest to which this Part of the Act applies intends to dispose of his interest in said land for valuable consideration such disposal shall be void unless such lessor can show&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that he has given at least one month's notice in writing of the intention to dispose of his interest to the person entitled under this Part of the Act to purchase same, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  such latter person has within said period of one month failed <Col N="1178" /> to serve notice of intention to purchase under this Act or the Act of 1967.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I consider this to be one of the major amendments to the Bill.  It comes in rather inappropriately under section 16. I cannot vouch for the phraseology but I am anxious to put strongly to the Minister the principle I am seeking to incorporate.  I am trying to ensure that a freehold owner of ground rent, a landlord, cannot sell out over the head of the householder.  It appears to me that one of the major complaints about the ground rent problem is the feeling of frustration on the part of householders who find that the freehold has been sold out without them having been given an opportunity to buy it out.  It occurs to me that if we put in this provision making it necessary to give notice to householders and the option to purchase at the time of sale it would be a distinct encouragement to landlords to sell their interests direct to householders rather than to somebody else.</P>
    <P>It is quite a common practice for landlords to sell their interests to persons other than the householders.  I have seen evidence of this and representations have been made to me about this matter.  If the Minister accepts my amendment we must consider some system to take advantage of it to the benefit of the householder. I do not say we should stop it because to stop it would probably be unconstitutional. I am not asking the Minister to accept my amendment word for word but I suggest that where a landlord intends to dispose of his interest for valuable consideration such disposal be void unless he can show that he has given one month's notice in writing of his intention to dispose to the person entitled to purchase under the Bill.  It may be put to me that this is a restriction on the right of a landlord and, therefore, it is unconstitutional but I suggest it is not.  In the public interest restrictions can be imposed provided the person involved does not suffer in a monetary sense.  There are restrictions in various matters in public interest, in the Land Commission, compulsory <Col N="1179" /> acquisitions and under the Family Home Protection Act.</P>
    <P>Such a restriction on the sale by a landlord would stand up constitutionally in my opinion.  If we get over that hurdle and get to the more positive side I feel the effect of such a provision would be to encourage quite a number of purchases under the Bill because landlords would not have anyhere to turn to except to the house-holders. Obviously, householders will have to purchase under the terms of the Bill but at least they would be given notice.  Any intention to sell would be brought to the notice of the householder and he would probably be inspired to investigate his rights.  A lot of ground rents are now owned by major institutional investors and it would probably be easy for them if they wished to dispose of them to get rid of them to an individual purchaser but it is in the public interest that there should be an obligation on such people to sell direct to the householders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Deputy O'Keeffe that this amendment was given very serious consideration because of the implications contained in it and not because of any particular way it might be drafted.  I fully accept what Deputy O'Keeffe said that the draftsman is the professional for drafting matters such as this in the most correct fashion.  The principle involved has been looked at in its own right.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to prohibit landlords from selling their interest in ground rent type leases except to the tenants or with the consent of the tenants.  I am satisfied that this is objectionable because it would bring no advantage to the tenant and at the same time it would be an unwarranted interference with the fundamental freedom to dispose of property.  The fact that a ground landlord transfers his interest in land to another landlord does not harm the tenant in any way, because the tenant can exercise his rights against a new landlord as easily as he could against the old landlord. Perhaps such a transfer could very well be to the tenant's advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> It would almost certainly need an up-to-date investigation of the landlord's title and make it easier for a subsequent acquisition by the tenants under the Act.  The price paid nowadays on such a sale would almost certainly be well below the maximum price provided for in the Bill.  The tenant who exercise his right of acquisition afterwards could get advantage from such a low price, because this is one of the factors to be taken into account on arbitration under section 17 (2) (e) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the only possible way in which a sale might be to the disadvantage of the tenant would be if landlords were to engage in artificial transfers at above market prices.  This would clearly be shown up afterwards at arbitration.  I feel that perhaps Deputy Enright, having heard my case against the amendment, might like to comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very fluid situation. I can see the difficulties involved on all sides.  Basically, this does not deal with businesses.  I would like to explain the difficulties of somebody in business.  This is an example of a person I met this afternoon.  A landlord owns a property.  He grants a business lease to somebody and that person takes possession of the property.  That person does not use the property and grants a further lease to somebody else.  In the original case the person obtained the property from the landlord and paid a substantial sum as consideration.  The subtenant was in possession and was granted a further lease.  The present tenant of the property has bought out the landlord.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could explain it another way.  A owns the property and sells it to B, reserving a rent.  B sublets the property to C who in fact takes possession of a shop.  C buys out the original landlord, A, so that C has acquired A's interest.  A, who is in fact the owner of the property and paid a very substantial sum for it and also paid a substantial sum to repair the property, now finds himself in a very weak position because the original fee simple has now passed to this tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of somebody <Col N="1181" /> who obtains a lease of property from a builder who is a landlord.  That person pays perhaps £10,000 to have a house built on the property.  He then sublets that property and somebody is in possession of it for a great number of years.  A situation could arise where the present occupant of the house might buy out the fee simple.  I do not know if Deputy O'Keeffe is in agreement with me on this.  I want to try to protect the person who has built the house and paid the expenses of doing this.  I would like to see him properly protected.</P>
    <P>I believe that Deputy O'Keeffe's amendent is reasonable.  He is not trying to inpinge in any way on the rights of the landlord.  He is trying to ensure that when a landlord is selling his interest in property the sitting tenant should have the first right to obtain the fee simple in the property. We want to ensure that the sitting tenant should have the first right of purchasing the fee simple.  I presume the Minister will state the position is that the second tenant will now be entitled one way or another to buy out his interest.  I am not very happy with the situation and I should like some further explanation on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to come back to the Minister's comments on this amendment.  I accept that they are made in good faith.  However, it appears to me that the Minister may not be grasping what we want to ensure in the amendment.  I do not believe this amendment can be questioned on the basis of its constitutionality. It is not a prohibition on the sale by a landlord.  I accept that if such a prohibition were there it would be entirely unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that if a landlord is selling his property for valuable consideration he must give notice to the tenant.  That is the only restriction on him.  There is not even an obligation on him to sell to the tenant for the same money he is receiving. There is not any restriction on the landlord other than the fact that he must give notice.</P>

    <Title>Private Member's Business. - Motor Insurance: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Bermingham on Tuesday, 7 March 1978:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, notes with grave concern the major increases from 35 per cent to 50 per cent from 1 March 1978 in the motor insurance premium rates of the PMPA sanctioned by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy; is convinced that a radical reorganisation of the whole system of motor insurance in the State is long overdue and accordingly calls on the Government to set up, without delay, a State system of motor insurance together with a more rational and equitable State system to deal with the processing and settlement of claims arising from such a scheme of insurance.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;notes that the increases in motor insurance rates of the PMPA Insurance Company recently approved by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy after examination by the National Prices Commission were necessary due to the increasing rise in claims costs and to strengthen reserves consistent with growth; and also notes that the Government intends to have examined the effect of the present jury system on the level of awards and the legal framework generally within which motor insurance operates in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy R. Burke.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In this motion we have advocated the setting up of a State-sponsored scheme of statutory minimum protection for motorists.  In support of this proposition we cite the current situation whereby the State obliges all employees to hold a State insurance card. If one might draw the analogy further, that State insurance card provides a basic fundamental protection, for example, against personal illness in relation to employment <Col N="1183" /> and also in relation to occupational injury.</P>
      <P>I would like to see an extension of that type of scheme into the most difficult and complex area of motor insurance.  The State, quite correctly, requires all motorists to take out minimum insurance cover.  We feel that a logical follow-through from this basic legal requirement would be a statutory provision by the State, at a fair and reasonable annual premium, for minimum cover for a motorist against personal injury to either himself or his family in a car accident or to other motorists or innocent victims who might be injured in an accident.  Having been obliged to take out minimum cover provided by the State, the motorist could take out additional policies for property damage in relation to his car, insurance against repairs and so on, just as in the health contributory insurance system there is no prohibition against joining the VHI or against obtaining additional private health insurance</P>
      <P>We do not see any great complexity in the introduction of a system of that nature.  The system is not particularly novel to this country.  It would provide a real basic protection.  It would be State funded and State guaranteed. It would be compulsory.  It would do away with those many litigations we have in the courts against people who resort to evasion and who have disputed insurance cover claims.  It would, as in the case of social insurance, prove to be much cheaper and to be entirely more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We already have the motor vehicle registration scheme in operation, and I understand it is being increasingly computerised at central level.  The logical expansion of that system into minimum insurance cover as a basic requirement for every motorist should not prove too complex for the public service to operate; and, as the basic system is there, it should not prove too costly to introduce.  Many Government Departments and semi-State bodies, such as CIE, provide their own self-funded motor vehicle insurance systems.  If we have the kind of system <Col N="1184" /> advocated it would be subjected to the ups and downs and to the arbitrary submissions by private companies of alleged underwriting losses.  We have had this in relation to the PMPA, which, as we all know, have a monopoly in motor insurance cover.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that our proposal is unduly simplistic and that it is ideological.  We are being ideological in this proposition.  One single car accident can have catastrophic consequences for an individual or a family, or indeed part of a community. Determination in this case should not rest with a private individual; the State has a responsibility also.  It should not be the exclusive role of the legal profession, or the exclusive assessment of an <i>ad hoc</i> jury system. Our demand is not only related to the State insurance system we are advocating.  It would necessarily encompass also a root and branch reform of the legal system relative to claims and of the jury system of determination.</P>
    <P>We submit that our proposal is radical.  Without a radical change, we would be back here year after year dealing with the arbitrary and subjective submissions of private motor insurance companies.  Therefore, I urge this motion as a serious proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened patiently to Labour Deputies speaking to their motion.  I sympathised with Deputy Berminghan when he voiced his concern for working people who use private motor vehicles coming and going to work.  In the main they are the people who will bear the brunt of this insurance increase.  However, I do not share the Deputy's view that the impact is as severe as outlined and that policyholders covered by third party insurance are mainly affected. But I accept the sincerity of the Deputy and share his concern.  I cannot say the same for Deputy Desmond's contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond gave no justification for the line of action proposed to be taken.  For the establishment of a national motor insurance corporation the sole justification should be that the cost of insurance would be less to the <Col N="1185" /> policyholder, that the services would be improved and that the claims would be better handled.  Deputy Desmond gave no such justification.  Instead the Deputy concentrated most of his speech on criticism of the PMPA, of its accounts, its investment policy and, secondly, a criticism of the Minister as the supervisory authority.  There was also very severe criticism of the Department and its officials and the level of expertise which, in his view, they are able to bring to bear on a premium increase or a price increase application.  There was also criticism levelled at the National Prices Commission. The National Prices Commission have had the best of consultants and experts in processing claims and the position in this case was no different.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, Deputy Desmond was laying a smokescreen.  I suppose in his particular situation that is his job.  If you do not have the facts or a reasoned case and, if you advance a proposition which is not sustainable, then there is no other course open to you but to lay a smokescreen and introduce a great many inadequacies and a great many irrelevancies.  There is no great difference between the accounts of an insurance company and those of any other trading company. An insurance company takes in its income in premiums and it pays every year, actually pays, a proportion of the claims it has received.  It does not matter if these claims have arisen in the actual year or in previous years. It still has a number&mdash;an even greater number probably&mdash;of claims still outstanding and it has to make an estimate of these.  Contrary to Deputy Desmond's thesis, therefore, there is a very simple equation.  On the one hand, there is a premium income and, on the other, there is the payment of claims and provision for claims which remain outstanding at the end of the financial year.  It is in this latter figure that there is any difference, and not all that much difference, between the accounts of an insurance company and those of any other trading company. Because these outstanding claims have to be gone into, though perhaps not settled for several years because of litigation, that an estimate has to be <Col N="1186" /> made each year for annual accounts so that, like the closing stocks of a shop or trading company, a figure must be put on claims outstanding.  If the estimate for these claims is too low the company will show itself as having made more profit.  If the estimate is too high it will show itself as having made less profit and will, indeed, conceal the real profit made or will make in the future and it will increase on paper its outgoings.</P>
    <P>Now if the PMPA were being accused of concealing profits by over-estimation of claims, then Deputy Desmond might have some cause for complaint.  But the reverse is the case as all public commentators in the welter of criticism directed at this particular company in the Press, and from many other sources over the past three or four years, have said.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and his predecessors have always had to analyse the claims provisions for this company and ensure it is not making too low an estimate for outstanding claims.  There was nothing deliberate or misleading in any instance or too low an estimation by the company.  It was simply that in a rising trend of inflation the claims estimator in any insurance company has had enormous difficulty in putting a figure on a death or personal injury case which may be settled as far away as five years from today. Insurance accounting at its best requires that the full cost of settling claims be put down in the books in the year in which the provision has to be made.  In practice there is often a degree of upwards revision each year thereafter but the purist's theory is that the full figure must be provided for and the accounts must be shown in that given year.</P>
    <P>The normal flexibility in this particular area is accepted at 1 to 2 per cent of excess provision for outstanding claims and, with a static portfolio, a low level of claims and a policy of quick or early settlement, as far as that is possible, the problem of long-tailed claims is reduced.  With a massively growing portfolio such as the PMPA have had and with inflation running at the rate it was over the last five years and particularly with personal injury <Col N="1187" /> or death claims calculated relevant to the earnings of the injured party which, with inflation sometimes accounted for up to 20 years forward particularly in the case of juries making awards, the problem of estimating claims outstanding to within 1 or 2 per cent accuracy, and we are talking here of a company the size of the PMPA, could quite easily mean a loss of £1 million profit or or a profit of £1 million in trying to underwrite outstanding claims.  The claims estimator has, therefore, a very onerous task in coming to a positive conclusion as to the outgoing of the company.</P>
    <P>As to the Minister's ability to know the real situation in an insurance company's accounts.  Deputy Desmond's comments are honestly quite astounding.  In the first place he should be reminded that the company have their own professional accountants. They have to lodge audited accounts in accordance with proceedings, as have any other registered company, and as an insurance company they have to lodge these accounts with a detailed list of schedules including a run-off statement for the payment of claims with the Department each year.  The PMPA seem to be singled out but they are not the only company.  Every company has to do this.  It is normal practice and has been over the years.  The Department have at their disposal independent professional accountants which they can put to work on any insurance company's accounts lodged with them, and they do, and the figure for the provision of claims outstanding is a matter of normally special professional analysing whereas a statistical selection of claims is examined in detail to see whether these independent experts agree with the figures in the books of the insurance company. Companies accounts are compared and the average cost of claims is compared company by company.  The Deputy opposite can be fully satisfied that, unlike the cloud cuckoo land in which Deputy Desmond seems to think, the Minister carries out his responsibility in very different fashion from the vague, inadequate and amateurish <Col N="1188" /> manner Deputy Desmond described yesterday evening.  The examination has obviously to be through.  Deputy Desmond should be reminded that in the welter of analysing the PMPA over the past years an intensive study was carried out and reported on in <i>The Irish Times</i> in May 1976.  That independent look at the facts available reached the conclusion that, when dealing with the latest published accounts of the company for the financial year 1974, the company were indeed solvent and a UK organisation writing about the same time seemed to reach the grudging conclusion that the company were solvent by existing standards but then hurried on to point out that, in its opinion, it might not come up to the EEC pending change in regulations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond seems to join in the chorus of comment suggesting that the company must have been insolvent to seek an increase of 35 per cent. To say the least this is mischievous and misleading.  There has been no question, and the Minister under his responsibilities has to ensure that there is no question of any insurance company ever operating under his authorisation being in or even tending towards a situation where they might not have assets to cover their liabilities. That is a built-in responsibility of the Minister and his officials in that section and therefore they go to great pains to ensure that no such situation develops.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is worth while to ask Deputies opposite to show the level of responsibility that one would expect of them particularly when speaking of an Irish company of this size which have been most progressive in motor insurance and to leave behind all the talk of an insolvent situation and to face the fact that in 1978 claims will have to be paid by this and every other insurance company for which a premium may have been paid in 1975 or 1976 and that inflation will have increased the cost of the claim.  Deputy Desmond did not point out that during his party's term in Government they probably went no small way towards creating that inflation which has affected the PMPA and many other organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> For premiums paid in 1978 provision must be made for payment of claims arising in 1979, 1980 and as experience has shown, due to legal complications, these can go into the mid-eighties. There is a vast difference&mdash;and it is with this the Minister has to deal&mdash; between providing for increased costs of claims on one hand and dealing with inadequacy of funds which, I repeat on what information is available to me, does not arise, on the other. There is also the point that free reserves over and above assets equal to liabilities must be strengthened in any growing company.  Statutory Instrument 115 of 1976 enacted the first non-life directive of EEC that this margin must be at least 16 per cent of premium income as a top-up on assets over liabilities.  Prudent insurers see to it that this statutory solvency margin is not only held but held in some cases two or three times over.  Fluctuations in market values of assets when insurance funds are invested could sometimes result in losses which might be temporary but losses nonetheless at the close of any accounting year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond must know that a company cannot go below the level of assets plus the statutory solvency margin over liabilities even in the technical accounting sense and if they did steps would have to be taken. Therefore, it is not prudent to sail very close to the wind.  The PMPA have not done so and are not now doing so.  The increase granted to them is to cover costs of claims and to ensure that solvency is not weakened by an excessive loss on the underwriting account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also adverted to the fact that on the underwriting side the company would still make a loss of close on £1 million.  This is the best estimate experts can give the Minister. The company will have considerable investment income and it will be naturally expected that it or any other insurance company would dip into the profits from its investments to meet a shortfall on whatever claims may arise from motor insurance.  This is only right and proper and provided solvency is not impaired, and it should not be. For this reason, on the criterion of the <Col N="1190" /> cost of the product&mdash;the well hallowed maxim that premium income should meet the cost of claims&mdash;the remainder should go to strengthen reserves, possibly towards dividends for share-holders, hopefully towards payment of taxation and towards the operating costs of the company.  Would Deputy Desmond care to tell me what he finds wrong with this and why he talked about the Minister making the company carry on with less than the full cost of the claims in the premium increase?</P>
    <P>On the investment side the company were again criticised severely. The House should be made aware that the spread of investment of the PMPA is broadly a mirror reflection of that of all other insurance companies.  They lay out their policyholders' funds in gilt-edged investments, normally in fixed interest securities, loans and mortgages of a short-term nature, property investments.  All prudent investors do likewise.  Deputy Desmond seemed to think that the PMPA were doing something incorrect in doing what would be commercially desirable and required.</P>
    <P>The Minister has regulations in force in his Department which regulate the maximum in each of a list of categories of investment which may be held by insurers.  The PMPA and all other insurers will have to honour the conditions laid down for their investments. On the fundamental question of the company making these investments I find the criticisms very hard to understand.  All insurers invest the policyholders' funds and, hopefully, by their expertise and prudence make gains on them, gains in the income derived from them and on the capital increase in the values.  Both sources of gain to the company, while admittedly going partly to the company's free reserves and perhaps ultimately to shareholders, do, without question, strengthen the situation of an insurance company, enable it to be more competitive and grow and to quote premium rates lower than what they would otherwise be if these gains were not there.</P>
    <P>Is it seriously suggested that the PMPA or anybody else should leave <Col N="1191" /> their policyholders' funds lying in short-term interest bearing investments or deposits and nothing more?  The Minister as supervisory authority, must regulate the spread and nature of these investments and I assume can call for and possibly has called for an annual valuation on current market value basis of the investment of insurance companies when he thinks fit, particularly over the past three or four years when what should have been very sound investment probably have undergone devaluation.  I believe the Minister in the case of the PMPA and other companies has requested such information. This should be a regular feature of insurance control.  I am sure the Minister will note particularly that the details of investments by the PMPA have been questioned here and ensure that a watchful eye is kept on the diversification of insurance company funds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond and Deputies opposite do not have to be reminded that while gains from these investments are possible, losses can also easily result, sometimes short-term losses such as the drop in the values of gilt-edged investments which must return at maturity to par values if insurance companies can hold on long enough and do not have to liquify. That may be acceptable.  I think the House should recall briefly the share price index which for January 1973 was 6.95 and in January 1977, 4.21. On gilt-edged in January 1973 it was 78.5 and had dropped by January 1977, when Deputy Desmond and his colleagues were in Government, to 55.</P>
    <P>There has been a welcome recovery on both.  In the interim, however, investment income has to be deployed to shore up this drop in values.  The alternative is to call on shareholders to subscribe additional capital.  The PMPA and many other insurers have done this, the PMPA twice in the past three years.  That is to be expected particularly with a company which is growing as rapidly as that organisation. What I do not expect of any company, nor can any reasonable Deputy expect from any company, is that shareholders should be expected <Col N="1192" /> to chip in to make short continued losses without the prospect of making a profit.  I will leave that type of an expectation and that type of an approach to business and economics to those with doctrinaire ideas who, no matter how often the results of insufficiency and non-economic investment share them in the face, still return to these tired formulae and proposals.</P>
    <P>What, however, made me angry when listening to Deputy Desmond's contribution last night was his extra-ordinary <i>volte face</i> towards the end of his contribution in the House, where he said, contrary to all the elements and basis of his thesis up to that point in his speech, that &ldquo;of course we all know that the PMPA are in this to make money, that they do in fact and have made money and that all these losses quoted by the Minister of State are so much wool over the Minister's eyes&rdquo;.  He did not use those few final words but what he said was to the same effect.</P>
    <P>It was not a question after all that the company was doing badly or was nearer to the insolvency level than was happy or safe.  The accounts, prepared by their professional staff, submitted by them to their auditors who approved them, or to the Department's officials, in Deputy Desmond's eyes, were totally irrelevant, could not be depended on and could be dismissed. Deputy Desmond was able to assure the House they made lots of profits and that all he had said up to then had been incorrect.  He argued that they had made profits but realising his own inconsistency, then said with an insight apparently known only to himself, that there was a difference between the PMPA making profits and &ldquo;they&rdquo; or &ldquo;them&rdquo; making profits.  What the implication of this is I do not know. He knows the levels of dividends paid to shareholders by the PMPA.  They have been available in every published annual account of the company.</P>
    <P>The motion put down by Deputy Bermingham and Deputy Desmond has not been supported or substantiated by one shared of reasoned argument. As I said at the outset, the Minister and the Minister of State are concerned at the size of this increase and expect <Col N="1193" /> that it, or anything like it, should not have to be repeated for this or any other company.  It is part of a catching up process and of a strengthening process for a company with a growth rate such as this which has played an honourable role in taking all types of insurance virtually without restrictions, contrary to the closed shop policy of most other motor insurers for the past five years.</P>
    <P>Happily, competition is now entering the market and a better, more healthy situation should develop.  From this policyholders will gain more competitive terms and better service.  The Government have an open mind on whether a national motor insurance corporation should be established. There is no doctrinaire opposition to this whatsoever.  The cardinal question is whether the private enterprise, can deal with this situation efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned yesterday that it is the intention of the Government to examine carefully the effect of the jury system on awards. The previous Minister had a report suggesting such a change in the legal procedure but he did not appear to deal with it very efficiently.  The case has not been made for the radical course of action which the proposers of this motion have in mind.  The absolute certainty is that the cost of claims would remain as it is, if not worse, and that motor insurance, isolated and carried on as a single class of insurance, divorced from all other classes which the expertise of the private sector has now and brings to bear on it, would become even far more costly.  As the Minister of State said yesterday, if the proposal had been that the State should carry on not only motor insurance but other profitable lines of insurance as well, there would be some semblance of justification and grounds for serious consideration of the proposal.  As it stands there are none.  It would simply be getting the worst of all worlds.  It is not always pleasant or easy to face facts and I would urge the Deputies opposite to deal solely in facts.  I ask the House to reject this motion.</P>

      <P>I will begin my speech <Col N="1194" /> with something Deputy Lawlor said because I agree with it.  We in this party equally have no ideological or doctrinaire objection to the suggestion made in the Labour Party's motion. If we were convinced that a State insurance system would be more economical for the motorists, while at the same time not representing a burden ultimately on the taxpayer, we would be very favourably disposed to go along with the motion.  I listened to Deputy Lawlor's speech with a great deal of interest and learned a good deal.  I noticed he did not address himself to the substance of the amendment in the Minister's name.  It is the amendment more than the motion I would like to deal with this evening.</P>
      <P>The amendment envisages a change in the jury system.  It speaks about the examination of the effect of the present jury system but it does that in a context that makes it plain that a change is envisaged.  Otherwise why should it have been mentioned?  It does not make it plain how far such a change should go.  It is a simple thing to say &ldquo;scrap juries&rdquo; when you see how juries have made handsome awards in favour of an injured plaintiff.  The question is, is that the just and proper thing to do?  Are you taking liberties with justice and equity in order to achieve the short-range effect of holding back the rise in insurance premiums, which I agree is the result of the accumulation of mounting awards?</P>
      <P>A politician, or a Minister, has no business tampering, for a purely political or economic end, with a system which dispenses justice.  Unless we can be convinced that our jury system actually worked, injustice, in the sense that it was unjust to the defendant, who is nominally the person against whom negligence is alleged in a motor accident but who in substance, as we all know, is the insurer, and they have rights too&mdash;we should be very slow to do away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and time again I have complained in the Oireachtas about the ineradicably Irish habit of running after the English in everything we do. No sooner do we run our own flag up the pole than we look back over <Col N="1195" /> our shoulders anxiously, terrified that we will not be able to make out on our own, that if we try to stand on our own feet we will fall over.  We watch the English amending their legislation, their administrative structures, and we copy them anxiously, usually because of our incompetence, 25 or 30 years afterwards.  I could produce example after example in the field we are now talking about, that of the civil law, the law of torts, the law of negligence.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  In 1945 the British changed their common law which had provided that if a plaintiff was to even a minor degree to blame for an accident, although the defendant might have been largely responsible, the plaintiff completely failed.  We did not change that until 1961.  We changed it in the very same direction and for the same considerations, though Irish brains were capable of making up the equity or otherwise of the old law in advance of the British.  All parties are to blame in this but the party opposite are the most appalling sinners in this respect.  Patriotism is only skin deep. They have not the guts of a flea when it comes to striking out for themselves in an Irish way to find Irish solutions to Irish problems.</P>
    <P>The British abolished juries in this type of case and we are thinking of doing it now&mdash;that is the long and short of it.  If the British had not abolished the jury system in negligence cases I am damned if we would be thinking of it.  I am certain no such suggestion would have come from the far side of the House.  This is not the first time this type of thing has come from a Fianna Fáil Government.  In the early sixties the Department of Justice, in the exercise of some kiteflying activity, made this suggestion and canvassed the opinions of the two legal professions and the law schools.  The response which they got uniformly was a negative one.</P>
    <P>It has been and is being said that the legal profession have a vested interest in the continuance of the system as it is, but the point is not all that simple and I will return to it later. However, that kite was flown ten or 12 years ago but we did not hear any <Col N="1196" /> more about it because professional opinion, which is not all dishonest or interested only in the number of pound notes it can stuff into its pocket, was against it.  Academic opinion which had no axe good or bad to grind was against it.</P>
    <P>The question of a jury operating in this field falls into two sections.  There is the deciding of liability&mdash;the question of deciding whether a defendant should or should not pay up for a plaintiff's loss, pay 100 per cent or, as the law has been since 1961, pay up in part. Then there is the question of measuring the plaintiff's loss.  It is a question of deciding, supposing the defendant is to blame for the accident, how much the defendant should pay.  It has not been made clear whether the Department's intention is to confine those two issues to a judge sitting on his own.  If the intention is that both these issues should be decided by a judge sitting alone, I believe the Government will do very serious injustice.  A case can be made against the scale of jury awards, plausibly and perhaps quite rightly, but it should be argued separately from the issue of whether a jury or a judge is the better, more just form for deciding the issue of liability.</P>
    <P>No matter which party appointed them, judges in this State maintain a very high standard of integrity and without exception do their best to administer justice according to their lights.  Having said that, it is recognised, not only here but in all countries, that there is such a thing as a plaintiff-minded judge or a defendant-minded judge.  It has got something to do with his inner nature, his temperament.  It may have something to do with the way he was brought up or the sort of practice he did when he was at the Bar which has predisposed him in spite of his best efforts to be more responsive, more susceptible. to the plaintiff's side of the case or to the defendant's side.</P>
    <P>In the few years in which I was in practice I encountered judges with whom it was far easier to win a case in which liability in a road accident was an issue&mdash;judges without juries try these cases in the Circuit Court.  There were other judges who were defendant-minded and it was almost impossible <Col N="1197" /> to extract from them a judgment that the plaintiff was entitled to recover against the defendant.</P>
    <P>My opinion, which I believe to be shared by a large section of the practising profession, is that if this issue of liability is left to judges alone there will be a public uproar.  Apparently there has not been such an uproar in Britain, but the British are more sheepish people than we are in a lot of ways: for example, they put up with anomalies in their electoral system which we would not stand for.  I believe there will be an uproar if issues of liability are left to judges sitting alone.</P>
    <P>A judge could be 100 per cent honest and a man of integrity but he may by nature be not inclined to see the case from a plaintiff's point of view, and that will lead to dissatisfaction&mdash;perhaps I should not have used the word &ldquo;uproar&rdquo; earlier and I should like to withdraw it if it is not too late.  It will lead to dissatisfaction. It may have the effect of sparing insurance companies but it will not be just.  A Government should not propose a reform like this merely in order to save money for defendants who should be paying out the money if justice were being enforced.</P>
    <P>The question of assessment is a much more difficult one.  I concede that one is surprised occasionally at the size of jury awards.  However, is not this a mistake in the right direction? We can look at the kind of awards British judges sitting without juries have handed down in negligence cases. There is a big difference between the kind of award an English judge may find appropriate for a young man who may have lost half his arm or the use of a leg and what an Irish jury would award.  Who is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to decide that damages which an English judge would award are more appropriate than what an Irish jury would award? English awards made by judges are to the Irish sense of fairness and fitness extremely mean.  They are ungenerous and too small.  As between the too small awards that English courts tend to make and the occasionally perhaps over-generous awards that Irish juries <Col N="1198" /> tend to make, the balance of preference for me anyway would fall on the jury's side.  In addition, there is a court of appeal in the form of the Supreme Court.  I agree that all of this would involve extra cost but at least there is a forum consisting of three or more judges who will interfere with a jury award that is outrageously high but who are not likely to interfere with any other award made by a jury since the jury are supposed to be the best judges of the facts put before them and argued.  However, it is a safeguard that there can be interference by the Supreme Court in the case of an exorbitant award.</P>
    <P>Regarding the judicial mentality on the question of estimating the value of money, I can give the House only a second-hand view but it is the view of legal sociologists and so on in America and elsewhere.  Judges tend to be appointed when they are in their forties, fifties or even sixties and their ideas about money are by then somewhat out of date.  Anybody in his forties and still more so in his fifties or sixties will have formed for good 20 years earlier his idea about a pound note.  I do not wish to overdrive a point like this but reference should be made to the question of a generation gap. The stronger the influence of inflation the more pronounced will be that gap. The people who make studies of judges and of how they behave are of the view that they are the worst possible people to measure awards, particularly in personal accident cases.  But a jury drawn from the different age levels and which will include people younger than a judge as well as people his own age are far more in touch with what money means and with what may be an appropriate award in a case of personal injury.</P>
    <P>When I hear this talk about the reform of the jury system I should like the Minister or whoever is advising him to let the public know in detail what kinds of awards are thought to be too high.  Perhaps the Minister would point to an award or to a set of awards which he thinks were too high and which the Supreme Court have refused to interfere with. It is on that level that I would wish <Col N="1199" /> the matter to be debated.  In the event of a jury awarding, say, £120,000 to a man who as a result of an accident is paralysed from the neck down, who is the Minister or anybody else to say that the award is too high? I agree that the award must be borne by the premium payers, perhaps the people who have been careful drivers. That is an important factor, but to attack jury awards merely on the basis of their being too high is a wrong approach.  Any examination of the jury system in this regard should be undertaken in the light of day and not in the Department.  Let us not forget the experiences we have had with the Department of Justice in the sixties in relation to the Succession Act and the Criminal Justice Act.  Unbelievable results could emerge from that Department because the matters concerned were not sufficiently threshed out in public beforehand.  I trust there will be no repetition of that in this instance. I am not talking necessarily of a full public inquiry but of some form of public debate that will satisfy the people that any interference with jury awards will not have an effect in regard to the determination of liability and will not have a mean or an anglicising effect in the direction of the assessment of amounts of compensation. I should like to be sure also that the English professions and academics who study these matters in that country do not wish that they had the jury system back again.</P>
    <P>What has happened here is that the Government have been caught in the short wind by a very heavy increase in what is a staple of life for many people.  This is the Government of whom it was said that the sun would pop up over the horizon on their return to office.</P>

      <P>Within eight months there is this very large increase in insurance.  I am not blaming the Government for the increase but they have worked the people into the frame of mind whereby they tend to blame governments for everything that goes <Col N="1200" /> wrong, while the Government expect to be thanked for everything that goes right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with these increases in premiums it must be said that the Irish motorist is paying less than his Italian, German, Belgian or French counterpart.  I was surprised that Deputy Lalor did not mention that. Motoring here is relatively not as expensive as it is in most continental countries but it is a good deal dearer than it is in most parts of Britain. Those British insurance companies who still deal in motor insurance here divide these islands into regions for insurance purposes and they calculate their premiums on the basis of areas of risk.  Some of the areas in Britain for reasons that I know nothing about and have no wish to explore are categorised as low-risk areas and accordingly the premiums are low but Ireland is in the highest risk bracket.  The reason for this is that in Ireland there is an enormous number of very bad drivers.  In addition Irish roads are inadequate as are regulations both in relation to the roads and to the condition of cars, while the regulations we have are insufficiently enforced.  If the situation were different, if Irish drivers were better, if there were regulations in regard to seat belts, age and condition of cars and so on, there would not be the spectacle we see every day of speed limits both inside and outside the city being disregarded.  Every possible liberty is taken with the law by motorists and the overstretched police force are not in a position to do anything about the situation.  It is very rarely that people are pulled for offences or that any serious check is made of cars in regard to the condition of brakes, tyres and so on.  In relation to road signs we cannot even take the trouble to put a notice at yellow crosshatch junction boxes to say that the box must not be entered by one driver while there is another already there. Even the British managed to put up such notices but our attitude is slovenly and slipshod.  The traffic facilities are extremely inadequate.  We have neither <Col N="1201" /> a fast-road nor a slow-road system.  We would be much safer if we had nothing but a network of boreens.  However, we have deceptively fast-looking roads that are death traps.  They are crossed by tractors, cattle and old bangers at right angles.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder, then, that Ireland is a high risk area?  Of course, it would not be popular for the soldiers of destiny who are now in charge of the ship to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In these circumstances it is obvious that people have to pay higher premiums to meet the carnage, desolation and wrecking of cars.  We are left with masses of broken tin. Unless the State takes over the responsibility, the premium holder will have to pay for all this.  Instead of blaming the jury system it would be more seemly for the Government to look at the standard of driving, at the traffic laws and at the level of enforcement of the regulations that are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a minor aspect of this question that I must emphasise.  I refer to the role played by the legal profession in this whole area.  I note that the Minister has put in a little phrase about the legal framework generally. Although he has not favoured the House with an explanation of that phrase, I think what he means is something to which he referred recently in a speech, namely, the habit of employing on both sides of a negligence case a set of counsel which, he said, add up to eight.  He would be wrong about that in most cases; they would add up to six in the average case. I am certain that there are practices within the Irish Bar, as there are within every profession, which could do with examination. Barristers are not angels any more than anybody else and their self-interest plays a certain role, but there is something to be said for a system of multiple counsel.  It may not seem a very appealing argument and it is a hard one to put across in three or four <Col N="1202" /> minutes, but there is something to be said for it.  Work arrives in a barrister's letter box in an uncontrolled stream. He does not know when the case in which he is settling the originating summons or the civil bill will come to hearing.  It may come to hearing within six or 18 months on a day on which he has three other cases.  Is he to write back to the solicitor saying that he cannot accept the case because he may have to let him down because he may be involved in some other case?  That is the reason for the acceptance of all work and the employment of multiple counsel, so that at least one man in a light case and two men in a heavy case will be there.  In order to secure that it is necessary to employ three.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that the public would laugh loudly at that explanation being put forward by any other profession.  I am quite aware of the vulnerability of this line of argument, but before the Government decide that this is a legitimate target for them I should like them to make an inquiry about the level of fees in Britain where commonly such cases are done by one senior counsel and one junior, or perhaps a junior counsel by himself. I think they will find, though I do not assert this with certainty, that it costs as much or nearly as much to employ one man in Britain as to employ two or three men here.  Before being too high and mighty about the funny old restrictive practice which the Bar impose, let us compare it in terms of what it costs the State, the insurance companies and the clients and what it costs in England and then carry out an inquiry into the level of legal costs on the Continent.  I know what an aunt sally the Irish legal profession is, what a soft target it is and how it seems, oddly enough, to be incapable of making a defence for itself, but I will not be surprised if the conclusion is that the Irish legal profession provide a service of a sort cheaper than any other legal profession in Europe.</P>
    <P>I believe that the question of traffic is central and the question of the state of our roads and the way they are used, and I would be sorry if that question were fudged by the Government <Col N="1203" /> in making a wild assault on the jury system, without having seriously considered what the effect of abolishing it would be by comparison with what has been done in our neighbouring country with a similar legal system, or in regard to the question of the multiple employment of counsel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that they appear to be doing that and I am glad.  Let them save the people money by employing <Col N="1204" /> only one barrister.  Test this theory out in the Central Criminal Court or the Special Criminal Court, test it out on the State side in <i>habeas corpus</i> applications and in <i>certiorari</i> applications and in cases in which the Attorney General is the defendant.  Let them see how far that will get them. See what that one barrister will charge and the level at which he will refuse to work unless he is paid.  If he is told that he must be there come hell or high water no matter what other case drops on his desk, the level of his fees will rise very steeply.  I do not want to make too much of this.  I freely concede that the question of the employment of counsel is only a tiny aspect of the matter and I would not have thought it worth mentioning to the House had it not been dragged in by the scruff of the neck by the Minister when speaking at a meeting a couple of weeks ago in which he joined in his attack on the jury system this question of the multiple employment of counsel.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the amendment and he hung a lecture on the changing of the legal system on an insertion in the amendment which asked the House to take note that the Government intend to have examined the effect of the present jury system on the level of awards.  He talked about this being a Fianna Fáil hare rising again and quoted precedents for such a chase some ten years ago.  There has been a suggestion that there should be a radical reorganisation of the whole motor insurance system. My incursion arises from the fact that when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I instituted an inquiry and asked for recommendations and almost the first thing that arrived on the desk of my successor, Senator Keating, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, was this recommendation.  I did not come prepared to speak but my recollection of one of the recommendations made by the commission over five years ago was that some radical reorganisation of the whole system of motor insurance should take place and this should include taking a look at the awards system.  It is rather remarkable that two Deputies who had the benefit of having a colleague who was Minister for Industry and Commerce for four-and-a-half years should all of a sudden wake up at this stage and discover that the House should consider seriously the radical reorganisation of the whole system of motor insurance on the basis that it is long overdue.

      <P>It is appropriate that the Labour Party should send in Deputy Horgan because the two Deputies whose names are to the motion&mdash; Deputy Desmond and Deputy Bermingham&mdash;had the ear of the Minister for <Col N="1206" /> four-and-a-half years and they should have told him that the review was overdue.  However, it was only when the recent announcement was made in connection with insurance that those two Deputies and the Labour Party generally discovered that there was need to change radically the whole system of motor insurance.</P>
      <P>I listened today to Deputy Bermingham being interviewed on radio. He admitted he was a shareholder in PMPA.  He indicated they have a different title now and I think he said he would like the actual words to have a different meaning.  As Deputy Kelly conceded, motor insurance here is cheaper than motor insurance in any other country.  The PMPA have done a wonderful job for motorists during the years.  I listened to Deputy Bermingham slating this capitalistic group which is one of the biggest co-operative movements in the country. Everyone who takes out insurance with PMPA becomes a shareholder, in a sense becomes a capitalist.  Share-holders fall down on their responsibility if they do not attend the annual meetings and take an interest in the affairs of the association.  Although we all subscribe initially to the co-operative movement, eventually we pull out&mdash;this happens among farmers and others&mdash;and we criticise the movement.</P>
      <P>I was glad to have an opportunity to say a few words in this debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I take particular exception to his idea that, because I was not a member of the Labour Party until 1975, somehow I had been put in here because I am not associated with the sins or omissions of the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, now Senator Keating.  I can assure the Minister of State who is sitting on the opposite benches today that if the then <Col N="1207" /> Minister did not get around to doing this, and perhaps many other things that still need to be done and will not be done by the Fianna Fáil administration, it was because he was involved, among other things, in operating at least a 180º reversal of the policy on natural resources that he inherited from Fianna Fáil, a policy Fianna Fáil have not the courage to reverse back to their original position.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the motion and this weak and pusillanimous amendment tabled by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It is true that the price rise applied for by the PMPA has been the germ of this motion which allows us to discuss the insurance industry in general.  It is an extraordinary fact that the insurance industry, especially in connection with motor cars, is inefficient and time-consuming.  Deputy Bermingham gave an example yesterday <Col N="1208" /> of his own experience and mine is no better or worse than his.  I can remember an occasion in the not too distant past when my car, which was parked lawfully by the roadside, was totally demolished by another car and it took me&mdash;and I could hardly be described as being at fault in that situ-ation&mdash;two-and-a-half years to get the money from the company that was insuring the vehicle that crashed into my car.  If it takes two-and-a-half years for a totally innocent person to get his money out of the system, it is obvious that the system relies on long delays in order to save money to make money. That is a system that militates against people who cannot afford lawyers and who cannot get their case to court rapidly enough.</P>
      <P>When I was preparing to discuss this motion I did some basic research. Really the only basic research that exists in this area is the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry, with specific reference to motor insurance, which was published in 1972.  This was a very high-powered committee.  It was headed by Mr. John O'Connor who was referred to by Deputy B. Desmond last night and the committee also had that ubiquitous rent-an-academic, the person now in charge of planning, targets and similar things, Professor Martin O'Donoghue.  He is now Minister for Economic Planning and Development and he became chairman of the committee when Mr. O'Connor left.</P>
      <P>The interesting thing about the committee was that even though it did not come up with any radical solution to the problem it certainly hinted at them.  It also contained a minority report signed by, among others, the present Minister for Economic Planning and Development, which suggested the introduction of a no-fault system.  It also pointed to anomalies and inadequacies in the present system that continue to this day.</P>
      <P>Some of the anomalies to which it drew attention were in relation to trying to find out whether motor insurance was profitable.  On page 65 of the report there is the following comment:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> Motor insurance business is not scientifically based.  In particular, industry-wide statistics are not available for calculating the premiums appropriate to particular risks.  The loading of premiums is, therefore, conducted on a relatively arbitrary basis, and more recently appears to have also become a device for circumventing price control on the basic level of premium.</P>
    <P>On the following page there is the comment:</P>
    <P>The profit and loss figures arrived at from the Annual Summary of Statements deposited with the Minister for Industry and Commerce (the Blue Book) must be viewed with caution (since dividend income arising from premiums is not taken into account).</P>
    <P>That was the situation when the report was published in 1972, and I argue it is still the situation.  On page 73 of the report it is stated that:</P>
    <P>The accounting conventions used by the motor insurance industry and accepted generally by supervisory authorities, do not permit an adequate assessment to be made of the industry's profitability and performance.</P>
    <P>That is why we put down this motion, because the situation is still fundamentally unchanged and because something needs to be done about it. We do not see any evidence from the amendment that anything will be done about it.</P>
    <P>This afternoon the PMPA, naturally enough, have come to their own defence.  In a statement quoted in this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> a Mr. Dore, the joint managing director of the PMPA, is quoted as saying about the references to the company's solvency in the Dáil last night that:</P>
    <P>...what was being talked about there was not solvency in any accounting sense.  It was solvency standards required under EEC rules which broadly meant that there should be 16 per cent of premium income in free assets.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are way above the average there&mdash;in fact about £2m.-£3m. over,&rdquo; Mr. Dore said.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> I may be unenlightened about the higher reaches of accounting practice but, if the PMPA are £2 million to £3 million above the average, they must be considerably more above the minimum.  What we want to know is why funds, assets and reserves, which are not only above the minimum but substantially above the average, cannot be used in a cyclical situation in which underwriting losses occur to reduce premiums or at least to maintain them at present levels.</P>
    <P>One of the final inexorable laws of capitalism is that capital is what you spend when you have nothing else left to spend.  On the evidence of that statement, the liquidity situation of the PMPA is very healthy indeed.  It seems extraordinary to us that we have this enormous contrast between the allegedly very strong&mdash;and I would prefer to accept that it is strong&mdash; liquidity position of the PMPA and this very large increase in premiums.</P>
    <P>I seem to remember also the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Geoghegan Quinn, making a statement about the profitability of the PMPA within the very recent past on which a gloss had to be put later by the Government Information Services.  So, there are at least two sides to that story.  It is also true&mdash;and Deputy Kelly and other speakers referred to it&mdash;that part of the expense of motor insurance is in relation to legal costs.</P>
    <P>On page 66 of this report&mdash;and again I doubt that the situation has changed very much in the intervening five years&mdash;we see that the average amount of legal fees as a percentage of the claim cost was 16 per cent.  In 2 per cent of the claims, those dealing with claims between £1,000 and just over £2,000, the percentage claimed by legal fees was a horrifying 33.  In fact, in virtually one-quarter of all claims the percentage claimed by the lawyers amounted to more than the average 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister of State talked about the possibility of minimising expense without affecting legal rights.  With all due respect to the Minister, this is milk and water stuff compared to what his boss said.  I was listening to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis on the radio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the swingeing attack made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy on the legal profession at that Ard-Fheis. It was not the first time I heard that Minister attack the legal profession. When I was in the other House, and not a member of this party, I remember him saying almost the same things in almost identical words.  More, there-fore, is the tragedy that he has never yet found a Government with the guts to back him and take on the legal profession in this matter.  Another great Irishman, George Bernard Shaw, in reference to another profession once said, I think in the Preface to <i>The Doctor's Dilemma</i>, that all professions are a conspiracy against the laity. Some of my learned colleagues on the Fine Gael benches might not agree with that, but I am prepared to disagree with them on it.</P>
      <P>Among the many other defects of the present system, defects which need a radical approach, is the defect caused by the fact that most injury damages are allocated in a lump sum. The obvious conventional wisdom is contained in this report on page 69:</P>
      <P>In cases involving death or personal injury where the damages suffered are of an ongoing nature...this can be a serious defect.  Compensation for loss of income should be payable weekly or monthly, as appropriate, rather than in the form of a lump sum.  Where compensation is based on an injured person's life expectancy, once the payment has been made the case is closed and from the insurer's viewpoint the actual duration of life is then irrelevant.  If, however, the injured person lives longer than expected, he loses out financially and conversely, if he dies prematurely, a benefit passes to persons not involved in the accident.  Such problems would not arise in the case of regular payments tied to actual rather than expected duration of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a major defect which the ministerial amendment does not attempt to cope with.  I would argue very strongly <Col N="1212" /> in favour of a radical revision of the system which would emphasise the need to pay people on a continuing basis over a long period of time and perhaps also on an agreed scale relating to particular injuries.  We already have an occupational injuries scheme.  There is no reason why a State-sponsored insurance scheme could not adopt the same kind of criteria.  Something similar to that was referred to in that part of the report, a minority report, which was signed among others by Deputy O'Donoghue, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, who is now in a position to do something about it.  I quote from page 92:</P>
    <P>We favour a system for the payment of scheduled benefits in cases of death or personal injury to victims of road accidents.  These benefits would apply up to stated limits and, save for some possible exceptions...would be paid regardless of fault.</P>
    <P>This is plain speaking.  This is not the milk and water stuff we got from the Minister of State the other night.  I must reject the implication put about by the Minister of State that the tax-payer will pay the losses motor insurance throws up.  First, we are not at all certain about the losses.  Secondly, this motion does not say, and this party do not say, that the losses caused and incurred by the motoring public should be borne by the nonmotoring public.  In fact, that is what the Fianna Fáil Party have done in their motor tax proposal and decision which was totally regressive.  They are accusing us of wanting to do the same kind of regressive, anti-social thing. We do not believe in that.  We believe the cost of motoring, including the cost of insurance, should continue to be borne by the motoring public.  We believe a simple system such as a fuel surcharge could very well meet this difficulty.  If any motorist feels he has a life which is more valuable to insure, let him add extra insurance to the cost.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the Minister of State's allegation that we are interested in this only and we are not interested in nationalising the more <Col N="1213" /> allegedly profitable sectors of the insurance system.  We are interested in a State system of insurance for one major reason, and for one basic fundamental reason, that is, in relation to third party insurance.  Third party insurance is compulsory in this country and that is the greatest single reason why it should be organised by the State on a basis which would reduce the present high level of costs and inefficiency and spread the cost of such a scheme over all road users ideally, by a petrol surcharge which would have the effect of making those who do a higher mileage pay more proportionately towards the cost of administering an insurance system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> Instead of this, instead of all the radical ideas contained in this report, even though they are only advanced as options and were not finally decided on by the people who wrote them, we have a muddling through amendment by Fianna Fáil which basically says: &ldquo;No change.  We will fiddle around a bit.  We will cut a little off here and there, and try to make it better.&rdquo;  If it is to be two years to a settlement instead of two-and a-half years, I can assure the House and the Government that the people will not be satisfied until they get a decent system, and a decent system is what we propose in this resolution.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 471, 472 and 473 together.</P>
      <P>This scheme was introduced in 1964 with the object of encouraging the practice of silage-making on a wide-spread scale.  The very considerable expansion in the quantity of silage produced in the meantime indicates that the scheme has achieved its objective. Its continued operation is not, therefore, considered justified, particularly in the light of the introduction in 1977 of the EEC scheme of grants for farm groups in disadvantaged areas purchasing machinery for fodder production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forage harvester scheme has been operated on a year-to-year basis through the committees of agriculture, the terms being notified to them in the <Col N="1122" /> month of March or April each year. Committees were given prior notice on 10 February 1978 that the scheme would not be operated this year.</P>
    <P>Particulars of the amounts paid in grants under the scheme in 1977 are shown in the table following.  Grants to groups of farmers under the scheme were discontinued from 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education (a) if the City of Dublin VEC has nominated any persons for sanction by him for the positions of either head or assistant head of the Department of Electrical Installation Work in the College of Technology, Kevin Street; and, if so, if he intends to sanction the proposed nominees; (b) if he is satisfied with the qualifications specified for the posts at (a) above; (c) if he considers that the specified qualifications are set out in a manner which would ensure equal opportunity for all applicants, particularly existing teachers of electrical installation work under VEC schemes: <Col N="1123" /> (d) if he is aware that the conditions for the above posts were changed between two advertisements for applicants and if the changes were necessary; and (e) if he will specify the qualifications in the Irish language necessary for above positions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a)  The City of Dublin VEC has made proposals for appointments to both of the posts in question; these proposals are at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>(b)  Yes.  My Department had formally indicated to the VEC the qualifications for both posts of which it was prepared to approve.</P>
      <P>(c)  Yes.  Existing teachers of electrical installation work under VEC schemes were eligible to apply for the posts provided they were appropriately qualified.</P>
      <P>(d)  I understand that one of the posts was advertised in November 1975 without consultation with my Department.  The advertisement of December 1977 was published after the Department had formally notified the VEC of the qualifications appropriate for both posts.</P>
      <P>(e)  The VEC was informed that for both posts the qualifications in Irish would be in accordance with the Department's Memorandum V.7.  For purposes of the memorandum, the recognised qualification in Irish is the Department's Ceard Teastas Gaeilge or its equivalent.</P>
