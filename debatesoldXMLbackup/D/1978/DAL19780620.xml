    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the estimated current average weekly pay of male and female workers; and the percentage that the latter is of the former.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>: Particulars of average weekly pay are not available.  The available data are in respect of average weekly earnings of industrial workers as derived from the results of the Quarterly Industrial Inquiry for transportable goods industries.  Separate particulars are not available for individual occupations and the weekly earnings data cover all relevant industrial occupations including supervisors, foremen, operatives, maintenance staff, and so on, on adult rates of pay and include overtime, shift allowances, service pay, and so on, as well as basic pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> In mid-September 1977, the latest period for which the information is available at present, average weekly earnings for all male industrial workers on adult rates of pay amounted to £76.85 and the corresponding average hours worked were 45.0.  For all female industrial workers on adult rates of pay average weekly earnings were £40.85 and the corresponding average hours worked were 38.2.  The ratio of the average weekly figures so defined is 53.2 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Have the Minister and the Government any plans to rectify the imbalance whereby women get half the pay men get, or 53.2 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have just indicated in the elaborate reply I have given that it has to do with earnings rather than pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Earnings then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>: This has been looked at.  It does not quite arise out of the statistical reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister not accept that for women 53.2 per cent of the male average is disgraceful? What plans have the Government to correct this imbalance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Government have quite elaborate plans in connection with equal pay at public service level.  The overall plan in that regard has been dealt with pretty well by the Minister for Labour in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if any talks have been held <Col N="1393" /> on the proposal of the EEC Commissioner for the social fund that overtime or &ldquo;work stealing&rdquo; should be stopped and that the EEC should pay the workers affected for a period of time the wages lost through this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) (For the Minister for Labour) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) (For the Minister for Labour)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I assume the Deputy is referring to reports in the press that Commissioner Vredeling, on his recent visit to Ireland, indicated that the EEC Commission were investigating methods of eliminating the regular working of overtime and that the social fund might be used to compensate the workers concerned for their loss of overtime pay.</P>
      <P>The Commission's current views in relation to overtime are contained in a document on work sharing which was discussed at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Employment on 21 March 1978 and in other Community bodies.  In the document the Commission promised to examine the feasibility of action designed to limit or discourage recourse to overtime, for example, by introducing paid compensatory time off.  I understand the Commission will present the results of this work at the next tripartite conference which it is expected will be held later this year.  I am not aware of any formal proposals by the Commission to utilise the social fund to pay compensation for the loss of overtime earnings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the steps taken by his Department to implement ILO Convention No. 119 in connection with the guarding of machinery, including agricultural machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: The International Labour Organisation Convention No. 119 of 1963 which covers the guarding of machinery in general, has not been ratified by this country.  The Government have decided that the convention is acceptable in principle but, as legislation would be necessary, consideration should be given in due course to <Col N="1394" /> the steps which would be necessary to implement the provisions of the instrument.</P>
      <P>Safety of agricultural machinery and protection of agricultural workers do not come within my Department's functions at present.  However, as I indicated in replying to the debate on the Second Stage of the Safety in Industry Bill on 23 May, I intend, following enactment of this legislation, to set up a working party to consider and make recommendations about safety in a wider context than is covered by the Department's existing legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 11 together. As I indicated in my reply to the debate on the Estimates for my Department, I consider that the Employment <Col N="1395" /> Action Team have done an excellent job.  To date, the team have identified areas with potential for more than 4,900 opportunities for young people. In fact, the operation of the team has convinced me that there is need for such a permanent advisory body for youth employment and I am at present examining the team in this context.  In the meantime, the team are examining a number of new proposals which, I understand, they hope to finalise and submit to me in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: How many of the 4,900 jobs to which the Minister referred have been filled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I think that is a separate question.  I will see if I have some information for the Deputy.  I do not think I have any information about the actual filling of the jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that, in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Labour, 300 was the figure given by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: During the course of the debate on the 1978 Estimate the Minister indicated it was considered that the team had done an excellent job and, if they have identified 4,900 opportunities, I presume the filling of these 4,900 jobs is in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister satisfied that due urgency is being given to filling the 4,900 opportunities suggested by the team?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate the Deputy's concern but the question asked was about the Employment Action Team and my reply indicates that the Minister is satisfied with the work the team have done and that he is thinking of reconstituting the team on a permanent basis to advise him because of their success in their original chore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister not agree that the 300 odd jobs, all short term, which the Minister for Labour indicated in his Estimate speech, are a very small return for <Col N="1396" /> all the hullabaloo there has been about the team, and that therefore the team are nothing but a charade, that they ought to be disbanded because they have given false hopes to a lot of young people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not intend to engage in a controversy with the Deputy on this matter.  I consider that the normal reaction to the work of any team that would identify as many as 4,900 jobs is that that team were successful and that they had done a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Where are the jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can the Minister give us a breakdown of what he means by 4,900 job opportunities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Or would he identify them?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: This question should not lead Deputies on to a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sure the Deputy is aware of the various areas the team covered.  They covered the Work Experience Programme, the Environmental Improvement Scheme, apprentice recruitment by local authorities and employment of young people on survey work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that of the 4,900 identified job opportunities, so carefully phrased in the question, only about 450 jobs have been actually created and filled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: The figure is 370.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: A separate question could elicit that information from the Department of Labour.  Deputy Mitchell's figure differs from that of Deputy Desmond, and my reply has no figures at all because I was not asked to supply them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Bruton</b> asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to a statement by the Director General of the Confederation of Irish Industry <Col N="1397" /> (details supplied) that localised shortages of labour exist for toolmakers, electronic technicians, skilled clothing machinists and production engineers; and if he will state, in respect of each of these occupations, (a) the approximate number of vacancies, (b) the geographical area in which they exist, (c) the training required, where it may be obtained and the qualifications required prior to entry to training, (d) when he expects the skill shortage in question to be fully met, and (e) if AnCO or the National Manpower Service have taken any initiatives in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am aware of the statement referred to by the Deputies. A number of similar statements have been made in the recent past but it has been extremely difficult to get anything more than general statements which normally do not attempt to specify the areas of the country in which the shortages exist and the extent of such shortages.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the National Manpower Service, have been in communication with the Confederation of Irish Industry on the subject and AnCo have also been in communication recently with the Confederation, the FUE, ICTU, CIF and the IDA in the matter with the object of identifying the shortages that may exist and taking any remedial action possible.</P>
      <P>This question of skill shortages is a very important one and one which I propose to put on the agenda for an early meeting of the Manpower Consultative Committee for which I have already invited nominations from employer and worker organisations and on which AnCO, the NMS and the Department of Education will also be represented.</P>

      <P>: The grant from the Department of Labour Vote to congress in respect of its education, training and advisory services this year is £193,000. This represents an increase of 7.2 per cent on the 1977 figure and an increase of 329 per cent over the financial year 1973/74, when my Department first assumed responsibility for the grant.  I am conscious of the valuable role being played by the education, training and advisory services in the field of trade union education and I am anxious to ensure that the arrangements governing the grant to congress for the services will be the most favourable that can be obtained, having regard to the resources available to the Exchequer.</P>

    <P>The legal right to equal pay and to equality of treatment in employment <Col N="1402" /> as between men and women has been established under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, respectively.  Both Acts provide ready means of redress for breaches of the entitlements provided.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Act provided for the setting up of the Employment Equality Agency one of whose functions is to monitor the operation of the two Acts and to suggest amendments, if necessary. I should, of course, give careful consideration to any such proposals for amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I take it that the Deputy is referring to the number of unemployed persons who are not included on the live register.</P>
      <P>The main group involved is young people who are seeking their first regular employment.  The latest information on these is from the 1975 EEC Labour Force Survey.  That survey estimated that there were 19,900 young persons in that category.</P>
      <P>The results of the subsequent labour force survey conducted in 1977 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>While the live register is not exhaustive in its coverage of the unemployed it also includes groups of persons who are not, strictly speaking, available for full time employment. Despite these limitations it is the best regular indicator of unemployment available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the result of the special inquiries initiated by him into large classes in primary schools, in response to Question No. 561 of 15 November 1977; and if he will make a further statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>:  Following the identification of the schools with oversized classes, inspectors from the Department had consultations with the principal teachers of the schools in question with a view to achieving a better organisation of classes in those schools.  The position is being kept under observation to ensure that oversized classes are eliminated as soon as practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Has the Minister any information about the geographic distribution of the schools with over-large classes?  Are they concentrated in the cities, in rural areas, in provincial towns, or any particular area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: For the most part they would be in urban areas but not central urban areas.  There are cases also in rural areas, but for the most part, suburban areas are affected worst.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister is not saying that at all.  In fact, he took steps in the opposite direction.  For example, as from July of this year, whereas it would take 590 to have 15 assistants in a school I have reduced the number to 550; for a sixteenth assistant in a large school whereas hitherto it would have taken 630 I have sanctioned 585.  I think the Deputy is aware that we are reducing large classes on 1 July in some instances and on 1 January 1979 in other instances in accordance with that type of scale.</P>

Would the Minister's definition of &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; be that talks would continue until he comes round to their point of view?  Has the Minister got set views on the nature of the consultations? Will he be putting these views to the bodies involved, or will it be merely a general chat which would put off any decision?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will make a statement on his decision not to recognise the City of Dublin VEC/TCD intermediate certificate course as and from 1979; and if he is aware of the popularity of that course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 <Col N="1412" /> together.  The unit referred to was established in 1972 by the City of Dublin VEC in co-operation with the School of Education of the University of Dublin and with the approval of the Department of Education for the purpose of undertaking a particular project during the period 1972-76.  This project related to the feasibility of (a) developing curricula suited to the needs of students in the 12-15 age group; (b) developing new forms of assessment consonant with the aims of the curricula; (c) providing a direct link with the new primary school curriculum.</P>
      <P>The activities of the unit have been concentrated in the following areas: (a) An Integrated Science Curriculum Innovation Project (ISCIP) which would integrate the teaching of biology, physics and chemistry in a practically-based pupil-centred science programme; (b) A Humanities Curriculum, which would integrate the teaching of English, history, geography and civics and enable the pupil to cope with his environment; (c) An Outdoor Education Project which would develop an out-of-class dimension to the curriculum by helping schools to plan and carry out field studies.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the work of the unit the Department of Education agreed to implement and alternative examination structure on a temporary provisional basis in the science and humanities groups of subjects for both the group and intermediate certificate examinations.</P>
      <P>The period of time for the completion of the projects was extended beyond 1976 and it is at present proposed to continue the special arrangements for the alternative examination structures until 1979 in order to enable the 1976 in-take of pupils involved in the experiment to complete their integrated studies course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been decided that at this stage an objective evaluation of the pilot programmes which were undertaken for the purpose of the project is required with a view to ascertaining the extent to which the curricula developed by the unit could be integrated into the general educational <Col N="1413" /> system.  I am arranging for this evaluation to be undertaken by the curriculum unit of my Department.</P>
    <P>I have agreed that the City of Dublin VEC Unit should be continued until August, 1981, for the purpose of undertaking an agreed development of programmes in the area of preparation for working life in connection with a project which may be accepted by the EEC Commission. The Commission will be prepared to subsidise programmes to the extent of 50 per cent of approved expenditure. A programme in this context to identify potential drop-outs and to devise and implement a curriculum suitable to their needs which was submitted to my Department by the City of Dublin VEC has been accepted for financial assistance by the EEC Commission for completion over a three-year period&mdash;1978-81.</P>
    <P>I may also add that it would be my intention that the VEC curriculum unit might furnish such supportive services as would be appropriate to the pupils' transfers committee which I have already established, and that it might also be involved in relation to measures affecting the introduction of the careers' foundation course.</P>
    <P>If further discussions with the Department of Education in regard to the matter are desired by representatives of the City of Dublin VEC arrangements will be made accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Despite the fact that there appears to be agreement to extend until 1981, would the Minister clarify whether or not the curriculum development unit will remain as a central educational element in the work of the VEC involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister agree that any interference with or termination of the work on the alternative examination modes would make the work of the unit fairly pointless and that if there was to be this proposed cutting-off point then inevitably the unit would be wound up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1414" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not accept for one moment that the work would be pointless if not related to an examination. I stated in the course of my reply that there was a possibility of the curricula developed by the unit being integrated into the general education system and that possibility is so flattering of the work of the unit that I have no need to speak about it any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have consulted the people on the ground and I have great faith in the person who is involved in the actual scheme.  I am convinced by them that the curricular developments of this unit are well worth while.  I am very flexible with regard to years.  I want to have a look at the work which has been done with a view to putting in on a larger stage.  Surely the Deputy will not complain about that.</P>

      <P>: Would the Minister not agree that there is a fundamental in consistency between, on the one hand, his holding out the possibility of integrating this particular type of curriculum development into the system as a whole and, on the other hand, terminating its evaluation procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not said that I am terminating its evaluation procedures. I was quite specific in stating the year up to which the examination will be made available.  I was quite specific in saying that my Department are now having a look as what has happened and that the possibility of the work being incorporated in the general scheme of things was high.</P>

While allowing for the pro-ability that most of these appointments <Col N="1418" /> are very fine appointments, I would ask the Minister whether as a matter of principle, in the knowledge that the total salaries of these vice-principals and all school staff are paid by the State, he feels he has a statutory and a moral obligation to interest himself in the conditions under which these people work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education (a) the number of students originally intended for admission to the Comprehensive School, Dooradoyle, from Saint Paul's National School, Dooradoyle, County Limerick; and (b) why the original decision has now been changed to a two-mile radius; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: The selection of pupils for acceptance to Dooradoyle Comprehensive School is made annually by the board of management of the school.  St. Paul's National School was opened for the first time only in 1970 and accordingly, there would not have been pupils in the senior classes of the school at the time of establishment of the comprehensive school in 1971.</P>
      <P>The arrangement relating to the acceptance of a percentage of the annual intake of the comprehensive school being from pupils from a two-mile radius of the school was made on the basis of consideration of representations which had been received from the parents of the pupils of St. Paul's National School.  These representations concerned the opportunities available to these pupils for admission to the comprehensive school.</P>
      <P>Following representations from the parents of the pupils of St. Paul's National School and discussions between an official of my Department and the authorities of the comprehensive school, it was arranged that 39 places would be offered to the pupils of St. Paul's National School in 1978.  I understand that some pupils from St. Paul's National School whose residences were within the two-mile radius did not accept the places offered to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>: Why did the Minister change from the original decision? <Col N="1421" /> Was it because at a meeting somebody twisted his arm?  I can tell him that the parents in the area are quite disturbed at the moment because a number of boys have no places as a result of the Minister's original promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: The school concerned did not exist when the original arrangements for intake were being made for that school in Limerick.  Special arrangements were agreed between the Minister for Education at that time, the late Deputy O'Malley, and the authorities of the school.  The school was founded in the meantime and these pupils were available for places in the school and in the near vicinity of the present school.  I met a deputation from the parents, and the Deputy may have been there also.  I succeeded in having 39 places made available.  The best thing the Deputy could do would be to persuade people who are applying for places to be serious about the position.  A number of people applied for and were allotted places and did not take them up.</P>

All vocational education committees were asked to submit their proposals before 30 April 1978.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>: They point to the risks that might be associated with the slower rate of growth in the international economy and so forth. Although the OECD estimates for growth this year are somewhat below those in the Government's own projection, there is no substantial difference between the two estimates. It is far too soon at this juncture to contemplate any significant falling off in the expected growth for 1979.  At present we will simply note the views put forward by the OECD.</P>

Despite the specific points mentioned in the OECD report the basic tenor of that document does confirm our view that the Irish economy is developing rapidly at present, that there are a number of substantial plus points in our performance and that there is no reason why we should not continue to outperform our EEC partners in the coming years.</P>

I attended a meeting of OECD Economic Ministers last week which discussed this very topic for two days and I can assure the Deputy that there was general agreement on the need for positive action in the coming months. I agree that there has been no specific action programme agreed upon as yet but there is certainly a very widespread acceptance and recognition of the need for such action.  What remains to be settled is the precise detail.

      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in the case of the Finance Bill, 1978 and notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  the proceedings on the Committee Stage (resumed) of the Bill (including the Order naming the day for the Fourth Stage), if not previously concluded shall be <Col N="1449" /> brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. on Tuesday, 20th June, 1978 by putting from the Chair the Question necessary to bring them to a conclusion, and the Question to be put from the Chair shall be `That</P>
    <P>(a)  (any amendments set down by the Minister for Finance and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill) the Bill as amended is hereby agreed to and as amended is reported to the House.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Fourth Stage be taken on Wednesday, 21st June, 1978'; and</P>
    <P>(2)  the proceedings on the Fourth and Fifth Stages, if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. on Wednesday, 21st June, 1978, by putting from the Chair the Question necessary to bring them to a conclusion; and the question to be put from the Chair shall be `That (any amendments set down by the Minister for Finance, including any requiring Recommittal, and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill and Recommittal and Fourth Stages are hereby completed and) the Bill is hereby passed.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is the completion of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill this evening at 6.45 p.m. and the Report and Final Stages by the same time tomorrow evening.  I regret the necessity to come here with this time motion because I had understood that I had reached agreement with my opposite numbers, the Whips of both Opposition Parties, some two weeks ago in regard to finalising this business. Hearing Deputy Cluskey a moment ago made me fully and finally appreciate that trying to reach agreement in this regard is impossible in view of his anxiety to try to make headlines out of anything at present.</P>
    <P>When I say I regret the necessity for this motion I say it fully conscious of the fact that I understood up to now that a sufficiency of time in the House had been given to discuss this Finance Bill fully, a Bill which comprises a great <Col N="1450" /> deal of tax concessions.  It is one of the measures which have been exhaustively dealt with.  One of the provisions that is possibly responsible for this time motion is a section of the Bill which the House has already spent 1½ days discussing.  Apart from that, I want to convey initially the basic reason why the passage of this Bill at this stage as we see it on the Government's side is extremely urgent.  Normally, the Finance Bill is cleared and could be expected to be cleared before the end of this month.  Because of that and because of the early date of circulation of the Finance Bill this year, 13 April, it was confidently expected that it would be cleared and certain arrangements were made involving the Revenue Commissioners in regard to getting out printed notices.  All this was arranged on the assumption that the Bill would have become law by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Up to now a record number of hours have been and will have been spent on the Finance Bill.  I have been looking through the discussions on time motions previously in relation to Finance Bills and I find that the Government Whip of the day this time last year spoke about the record amount of time that had been given to the 1977 Finance Bill and pointed out that the amount of hours spent on it was a record from, I think, 1956. Peculiarly, the situation to date in regard to the present Bill is that 42 hours 40 minutes have already been spent on the Bill.  By 6.45 tomorrow evening the time spent on this Bill will have reached over 52 hours. Never before in the history of the State were 52 hours spent on the Finance Bill.  In view of that the suggestion that the Government are rushing this particular Bill through does not stand up to examination.  I do not think any justifiable criticism can be made of the Government's present action in introducing this time motion.</P>
    <P>Some two weeks ago arrangements had been arrived at between the Whips in an amiable manner to finish the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill on last Wednesday night, giving Tuesday and Wednesday to it.  We had proposed giving today and tomorrow to the Report and <Col N="1451" /> Final Stages.  That was agreed.  The information that became available to me last week was that the Labour Whip was unable to sell that to his own party.  That was quite in order. As far as relationships in doing business with the Opposition Whips are concerned, these are extremely pleasant and so I do not want to rock the boat.  But I do not think I am letting the Labour Whip down when I say he reported back to me that he could not sell this to his colleagues.  Fair enough.  His colleagues wanted to make as much of a meal as possible out of the Finance Bill.  With the amount of time given to the Bill today and the amount of time given to the Bill tomorrow the actual time spent on the Bill will be far in excess of the time spent on Finance Bills in previous years.  We had a motion last year and another in 1975 having spent eight hours on the Finance Bill.  We had another time motion in 1974.  Peculiarly enough, the time motion last year dealt not only with the Finance Bill but also guillotined the Committee Stage of the Friendly Societies Bill, the Second Stage of a Prisons Bill and a Supplementary Estimate on Labour.  In 1975 there was a similar motion, not alone was the Finance Bill covered by the guillotine, but so were nine other Bills.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear we want to get this Bill through simply and solely so that the benefits that will accrue under it can be implemented and so that the Revenue Commissioners can go ahead with the issuing of documents they have already prepared and printed on the basis of the passage of the Bill before the end of June.  This time motion is not being introduced in order, according to press reports, to enable the House to recess or go on holiday from next week.  I want to put that on the record here and now.  Apart altogether from the Finance Bill, there are Estimates to be cleared and a number of Bills to be passed between now and the recess. In addition, we expect to have a debate on the Adjournment and the fixing of the time for that still has to be negotiated between the Opposition <Col N="1452" /> Whips and myself.  There will be no guillotining of the time for that.  It is a matter for arrangement between the Opposition Whips and myself.</P>
    <P>I recommend the motion to the House.  I do not want to spend time on it because the more time spent on it the less time there will be for discussing the Finance Bill.  From what I read in the papers I understand there are Members who, having spent a day-and-a-half on section 36, still feel there is more to be said on it. There is more to this Bill than section 36.  There is nothing unjustified in this motion at this stage.  It is a very reasonable motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: &ldquo;It is very upsetting for anybody who cares about this House, its status and its prestige, and wishes to see it function properly and fully in those difficult, modern times, to be confronted with the procedure which the Government are resorting to here.&rdquo;  That is a quotation from column 1381 of volume 299 of the Official Report of 24 May 1977 and the speaker was Deputy Haughey, now a Minister in this Government.  I hope that the Deputies who were so eloquent last year in their condemnation of the then Government for bringing in a closure motion on the Finance Bill will now stand up and repeat what they said last year, including the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State was very careful not to break down the number of hours spent on the Finance Bill last year.  All the speakers on the Opposition benches then, led by Deputy Colley, made the point that the Finance Bill was the most important Bill to come before the Dáil and the most important stage of the Bill was the Committee Stage which needed to be teased out in great detail.  After 24 hours discussion last year on Second Stage they resented a closure motion. That is exactly the amount of time we have spent so far on Committee Stage this year which, according to Members now in Government but then in Opposition, is the most important Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real reason, of course, why they want to close the debate is <Col N="1453" /> that the Green Paper was launched last week, the Green Paper they expected to get an enthusiastic reception from the critics, the backbenchers of their own party and the general public, the Green Paper which has sunk like a deadweight.  Instead of getting an enthusiastic reception, particularly from the backbenchers of their own party, it has got an extremely poor reception and the Government are afraid that if the Committee Stage of this Bill is dragged out the Green Paper&mdash;there are a number of amendments under which it could relevantly be discussed&mdash;will be brought into the discussion and they will have adverse reactions from their own backbenchers to many of the proposals in that Green Paper.  They want, therefore, to get the House closed down as quickly as possible, with the exception of the Adjournment Debate which they cannot avoid.</P>
    <P>We are three-quarters of the way through the amendments on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  With the exception of section 36, every amendment and every section has been gone through as expeditiously as possible bearing in mind the interests of the public and our duty as an Opposition to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are fully explained to the people.  We are three-quarters of the way through the amendments and there is absolutely no necessity for bringing in this closure motion today. In all probability the Committee Stage would end tomorrow, or the day after at the latest.  The fact is the Government do not want to risk any reference to the Green Paper.  Secondly, despite the 84 seats they won last June, the strength is now under pressure from some of their own backbenchers, and that pressure is going to be shown here, and so they want to force the Finance Bill through with the minimum of discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the Finance Bill had come before the House very quickly after the introduction of the budget.  It came exactly the same number of days, 104 days after in 1978 as in 1977.  In fact, in 1977 the Bill was later than usual because of two provisions in it which, as the <Col N="1454" /> Minister explained at the time, involved a considerable amount of discussion between the Department of Finance and those people who would be affected by the provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Deputy talking about when the Bill came before the House or when it was circulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: It came before the House on 10 May this year and 9 May last year.  It was circulated in April in both cases and it was later this year but I am not sure how much later.  The provisions to which I referred were, first, the relief of taxation, bringing it down from 58 per cent, which it had been under the previous Fianna Fáil Government, to 25 per cent for businesses which increased their employment and their output.  Obviously that had to be discussed with those interested.</P>
      <P>The second was the new proposal for farmer taxation which involved discussions with interested parties.  There were no such constraints this year in introducing the Finance Bill, yet it was 10 May before it came before the House.  Three-quarters through the Committee Stage the Government find it necessary to introduce a motion to guillotine this measure this evening at 6.45 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is a reflection on a Government with such strength when they find it necessary to do this.  It is a sign of their lack of confidence in themselves to debate the measure in any fair way. It is a reflection on this House if we allow democracy to be trampled on in this manner by a Government who are showing their strength in such a barefaced way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not surprised that the Taoiseach, by refusing to answer the question put to him on the Order of Business, tried to dissociate himself in the public mind from what can only be described as an abuse of the majority which the Irish people have given him.  There is no doubt about the outcome of this motion.  The Taoiseach enjoys an unprecedented majority of 20, and to introduce this motion at this time is clearly an abuse of that majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have endeavoured, successfully <Col N="1455" /> I believe, to criticise constructively the measures embodied in this Bill.  We have heard from the Minister of State, Deputy P. Lalor, who was put in the very unenviable position of trying to defend the indefensible.  He tried to imply that there had been agreement two weeks ago to some kind of curtailment of discussion of this Bill.  Approximately three or four minutes after making that implication, he acknowledged that the Labour Party Whips after consulting, as all Whips must and should do, with the parliamentary party, told him quite clearly that we were not prepared to enter into an agreement regarding the time limit on this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of features of this Bill which we find objectionable. On Second Stage and Committee Stage my colleagues gave good reasons why we objected to many of these provisions.  The one to which we have most objection is contained in section 36.  In a society which has an acknowledged 20 per cent of the population living in poverty, when we have had speeches over the last few months from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and other members of the Cabinet, when we have had a White Paper and a Green Paper clearly indicating that there would be cutbacks in expenditure which would affect mainly, if not solely, those members of our community who are in the least favourable economic position and least able to bear cutbacks, and those cutbacks will affect social welfare, housing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will speak on the motion curtailing the time allowed for discussion of the Bill containing section 36, which deals with the abolition of the wealth tax.  Abolition of the wealth tax cannot be justified in a society such as ours with all its economic and social problems.  For some time we on these benches have been demonstrating successfully to the public that many of the Bill's provisions are not the type of provisions that would be of benefit to our society as a whole but that they were obviously <Col N="1458" /> slanted towards the economically better off.  A number of the provisions of the Bill, particularly those in section 36, are designed to ensure greater disparity between the less well off and the better well off members of our society.  It is our obligation to point to these factors.</P>
      <P>We consider totally inadequate the time that has been allocated for discussion of the Bill having regard especially to its controversial nature. Only 22 hours have been allowed for discussion of the Committee Stage, for instance, in respect of which there were 88 amendments.  Excluding the Ceann Comhairle, if the remaining 147 Deputies wished to contribute to the Committee Stage they would have had less than 10 minutes each in which to discuss the 88 amendments. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach has told us that the justification for the introduction of the guillotine now is the number of important matters that must be dealt with before the recess.  I have read the Order Paper and I cannot find there mention of any legislation that would need to be taken immediately. I am not aware of any intention on the part of the Government to introduce, process and conclude any matter of major importance during the next couple of weeks.  Indeed, so far as their record of legislation is concerned we may anticipate the remaining weeks of this session being as poor as have been all those other weeks during the past 12 months.  Clearly, therefore, the only reason for this guillotine is the awareness on the part of the Government that this party in particular and the public in general realise now what is contained in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government have other important legislation to bring before the House before we adjourn for the recess there are a number of measures they could avail of.  When the Minister of State was speaking about an agreement that was reached a couple of weeks ago regarding this Bill he stated incorrectly that we had agreed to a time curtailment.  We did not agree to any such curtailment but we were prepared to agree to extend the sittings of the House in order to provide <Col N="1459" /> adequate time for full discussion of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not unprecedented for a Government to seek extended sittings if they wish to bring forward legislation and have it concluded within a certain time.  To have acted in this way on this occasion would not only have given the Opposition the opportunity of expressing their disagreement with the Bill but would have ensured that they were not denied the right to live up to their responsibilities as an Opposition.  The Government, for instance, could have suggested sitting on additional days.  Instead, all we have before us is a guillotine that is being used solely for political motives.  It is not in any way intended to expedite the business of the House.  The Government are acting in this way because they have been embarrassed by the Opposition's criticism of the Bill.  We have been constructive in our opposition. We have justified every amendment we tabled but the Government have become over-sensitive to the reaction that our constructive approach has evoked among the public who, through us, are aware now of what the Bill really contains.</P>
    <P>Most of the Bill's provisions are payoffs. They represent political patronage rather than measures to help further the interest of our society.  It is incredible that in an economy such as ours and with all the problems we must face, the Government would wish to abolish wealth tax thereby handing back about £10 million to people who at a time described by Fianna Fáil as being a time of economic crisis, abandoned this country.  There is no evidence either here or elsewhere that people of that type provide even one job not to mention thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in my continuing to speak on the motion.  We know that there is lobby fodder on the Government side who will vote for the motion.  Such action can be described only as a shameful abuse of democracy. The Government's action today will be seen by the people for what it is&mdash;a denial of the Opposition's right to speak adequately on the Finance Bill. However, this abuse of democracy will <Col N="1460" /> come home to roost ultimately on the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>: I wish to comment briefly on the motion.  I agree with what the Minister of State has said regarding an agreement on Wednesday night last. The Minister of State must bear in mind that it was over two weeks since that agreement was entered into by the Whips and any agreement on any debate which comes before the House is not alone dependent on the co-operation of the Whips but is dependent on the co-operation of the members of each party taking part in the discussions, in this particular instance, the Finance Bill.  I also want to say that I have got nothing but co-operation from the Goveernment Chief Whip, the Minister of State, and I want that to continue but my reaction to the closure motion was shock.  I felt it was something which was introduced with indecent taste.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister of State will agree with me that there is great co-operation between the Whips for the efficient running of the business of the House.  It would not be unreasonable to expect the Minister of State or his assistant last week to have had a discussion with Deputy Desmond and myself on the progress the Finance Bill was making.  I also find it very hard to understand why there was not a discussion last week between the Whips as to whether or not an agreement could be reached on the time at which the discussion on the Committee Stage of the Bill would close.  It was only fair to expect that, particularly if the Government had in mind the idea of introducing the guillotine on this particular discussion.  I also find it very hard to reconcile the statement attributed to the Minister of State in last week's <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  It was reported and the Minister did not deny it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Labour Whip has difficulty in meeting the deadline set, it is quite possible without the guillotine that, if we extended the time to 10 o'clock tonight, we could <Col N="1461" /> have an agreement and the discussion could end.  In my opinion it was totally unnecessary to introduce the guillotine. I was not informed by the Whip's office&mdash;it is possible they were trying to get through to me on the telephone but our appalling telephone service may not have allowed them&mdash;and the first I heard of it was when I read it in the paper this morning.  I was shocked.  A measure of this kind does not help co-operation between the Whips.  There should have been a discussion last week and we should have been informed then by the Chief Whip or his assistant that if the discussion on the Bill did not end they had no option but to introduce the guillotine. We could have had discussions and it is quite possible that we could have agreed on a time.</P>

      <P>: The conclusion is inescapable from the lack of explanations on this point offered so far in defence of the Government's motion, that this motion represents an unscrupulous use of the massive majority enjoyed by the Government in this Parliament.  We have been having a discussion on the Committee Stage of discussing section 36.  There are a number of speakers from the Labour Party and perhaps from other parties who wish to speak on that rather controversial section.  Apart from that section there are other amendments which have been put down in the name of this party&mdash;many Deputies wish to speak on them&mdash;which have yet to be reached in the Committee Stage discussion.  We had the undertaking from the Minister for Finance in regard to certain amendments put down by us that he would give full consideration to them between Committee Stage and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a great deal of benefit for Opposition Deputies in speaking at length on this decision of the Government to put down this motion.  They have the majority and they can push it through whether or not good reasons are put forward.  Obviously the Government are not very concerned about defending their action.  They have put the motion down and in due time they can ensure that it is carried through <Col N="1462" /> by the majority they have here.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand the reasons behind this motion.  Deputy Barry made the point that we have been having an interesting discussion on the Committee Stage and we had certain amendments which the Minister for Finance was to consider on Report Stage.  It is difficult now to see him giving sufficient time for consideration of those amendments.  It is making a mockery of representative democracy and of this Parliament that in an important measure like the Finance Bill discussion on it should be telescoped in this fashion when there is no need for it.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State introduced the motion he said that a year ago the previous Administration had done something similar.  They had a very good reason because there was an election in the offing.  Presumably we cannot expect such a happy release in the present situation and presumably no such intention is in the minds of the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>: It is hard to understand what the reasons are for the haste to get this measure through because they cannot have the legitimate excuse often offered by Administrations, when forced to use the rather crude procedure of the guillotine, of a volume of legislation waiting to be put through the House.  That excuse cannot be offered now because there is no legislation.  It is as legitimate an explanation as any that the Government are anxious to avoid discussion on matters relating to the economy at the moment.  If that is the reason for this guillotine it is understandable.  I am not talking about the performance of the economy this year because it is satisfactory.  There may be many explanations for its being satisfactory.  It has been noted over the last few days that very little assistance has been given to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in his defence of his Green Paper.</P>

      <P>: It would be less than human if an Opposition Deputy did not wonder what was the reason for this inexplicable haste on the part of the Government.  Is it because they do not wish to engage in an economic discussion in this Parliament?  That is a legitimate speculation on the reason for putting forward this particular motion.  Presumably, in discussing this motion, we will have to discuss the reasons for putting it forward. The discussion on the Bill was proceeding at a normal pace.  There were some other speakers on section 36.  We would <Col N="1464" /> they have moved on to the close of the Committee Stage.  Presumably in the next week we would have gone to the Report Stage.  I recall one illustration of the Minister for Finance's desire to meet us on a couple of amendments. He indicated his willingness to consider the question of a commission with regard to examining the implemenation of taxation proposals for married couples.  There were other matters on which he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: It is difficult to know the reason why the Government thought it necessary to abridge the <Col N="1466" /> normal debating period for this important measure.  It may be that its near association with certain economic difficulties accounts for their decision. It is true that the employment targets set out in their manifesto were not met last year and will not be met this year or next year.  These are facts and cannot be denied.  Although the Minister for Economic Planning and Development may say that there may be full employment in 1983, at the moment the unemployment figure is close on 100,000 and it will zoom up in the winter to 120,000.</P>
      <P>This may explain the reason it is necessary to curtail the time of Parliament to debate this important measure, to stop all debate in order to save the Government from the criticism of Members of this House. The Government have not the excuse that they have urgent legislation to deal with.  There is a total absence of new Bills, although I read a reference in the newspapers today to a Bill that the Minister for Justice is anxious to put on the Statute Book.  There is no major measure to be put forward by the Government that would explain their case to get the Finance Bill through in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an unhappy expedient on the part of the Government.  I have described it already as an unscrupulous use of their majority.  This is their first year in office and almost two-thirds of the Deputies in the House are members of Fianna Fáil.  To use this kind of procedure at such an early stage bodes ill for the future of this Parliament.  What kind of procedure will they adopt in the years up to 1981? It may become the rule rather than the exception that the Government with their large majority will use the guillotine measure more frequently in the future.  Commentators looking at the action of the Government should not treat it lightly or casually.  It is a rather ominous sign on the part of the Government. Since they returned to office they have been anxious to show that they did not share the arrogance of previous Fianna Fáil administrations. They have been keen to suggest that they are different men and women from the people who left office in <Col N="1467" /> 1973.  This first guillotine measure shows that the leopard does not change his spots.  The self-same arrogance is there and it is showing itself in this unnecessary procedure today.</P>
    <P>We should be quite clear on what the Government are doing.  By using their majority they are terminating discussion on the Finance Bill, the most important financial measure to come before the House this year.  Up to this point no explanation has been given for their action.  We cannot see any reason for taking this extraordinary action to close discussion on the Bill.  That is why we may be forgiven for speculating on perhaps the more serious political reasons for their action, on whether the Cabinet are divided on other matters and are anxious to adjourn Parliament.  They have not given any good reason why we should support their action.  Of course, they have a majority in this House and they do not have to explain anything.  Certainly it suggests that in what may be a very long Dáil, because of their majority, that the kind of arrogance that was common to them in the past may be theirs again in the years ahead.</P>

The Government are obviously embarrassed and conscious of the fact that they are abusing the power given to them last June.  It is obvious that they have given their backbenchers strict instructions to keep out of this debate, to behave like gentlemen, not to interrupt. Even Deputy Mark Killilea had to withdraw from the House because he would get into trouble if he interrupted. There is nothing coming from the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, who have dwindled from about 30 to two, but embarrassed sneers.  The Government will not succeed in pretending that they are not arrogant because the very same backbenchers who are not allowed participate in this debate, either by contribution or interruption, are abusing their power on various councils throughout the country.</P>

    <P>Let us look at the necessity for introducing this motion.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach protests that it is not in order to adjourn the Dáil for the Summer Recess.  If it is not in order to adjourn the Dáil for the Summer Recess, what is the objection against sitting on for a reasonable time to complete the business of the House?  The Bill contains 52 sections and a number of Schedules.  The Committee Stage of the Bill was going on in a business-like manner until 35 sections had been disposed <Col N="1469" /> of.  We then reached section 36, which is obviously a controversial one. I have made my contribution on that section.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As the Chair objects to the word &ldquo;treachery&rdquo;, I withdraw it. When speaking on the section I complained that the Minister had behaved in a way that was contrary to the national welfare.  It was reasonable to expect a controversial debate on section 36.  The position of the Government became intolerable in justifying the removal of the wealth tax when the Green Paper was published.  They could not justify their proposal having regard to their thinking on children's allowances, farming taxation, social welfare and a variety of other things in which they are going to screw this one and that one with the exception of the people they want to relieve.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the justification for this motion, particularly the manner in which it has been introduced.  If the Government were convinced that section 36 was sufficiently debated, what was to prevent them putting the question on that section and letting the rest of the Bill be debated in Committee in the ordinary way.  Instead of doing that, they see fit to guillotine the entire Bill.  If they had put the question on section 36 it would have left the remaining sections of the Bill to be debated in Committee in the ordinary way.  For example, I would have an opportunity of debating section 39, which proposes to reintroduce death duties in the family.  I object to that proposal and I wanted to speak on it.</P>

For example, I want to discuss section 45, which is an innovation in that it proposes to give the Revenue Commissioners authority to disclose confidential information, an unprecedented procedure.  Instead of putting the question in regard to section 36, the Government want to get rid of the Bill, lock, stock and barrel.</P>
      <P>Does the House realise that not alone is the Committee Stage of the Bill being brought to an end today but the resolution proposes to bring the Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Bill to an end tomorrow?  I object to that. Usually a week or a fortnight is given between Committee Stage and Report Stage of Bills.  What was to prevent the Government from bringing Committee Stage to an end tomorrow, if they wanted to do that, and giving a week before Report Stage so that other amendments could be put down? This is certainly a breach of the powers of the Government.  It is treating the House in a way in which it should not be treated.</P>
      <P>As has already been pointed out, there are no urgent measures to be put through the House.  After 12 months we have got little or no legislation from the Government.

      <P>: I listened with considerable interest to the speech by the Minister of State when he introduced this motion.  He is an admirable person to send in on such a motion.  I declare that even unsubsidised butter would melt in the man's mouth.  As we have come to expect of him, he did a splendid job in attempting to defend the indefensible.  That is what this motion is.  His blandness should not fool Members of the House or the public into assuming that what is involved here is only a minor piece of parliamentary surgery.  What is involved here is very much more substantial than that, and it is not warranted in the circumstances in which it is introduced.  I listened with considerable <Col N="1472" /> interest to what he said, because I was waiting to hear what reasons he would give.  With all due respect to what he said, his speech was very scant of reasons.  Effectively the only reason of any substance I heard was something about the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will wear congratulations from the Minister for Finance any day of the week.  The reference by the Minister of State to the Revenue Commissioners came out almost in a mumble.  There was absolutely no detail involved and no hint of what was involved.  All we got was a generalised impression that the Revenue Commissioners were about to do something because they had been told by the Government to do it on the basis of certain understandings about the time business would be concluded.</P>
      <P>It is our contention that the Government had no business to give any such understandings or undertakings to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Government are now putting the blame for their own mismanagement of the matter on the broad and no doubt capable shoulders of the Revenue Commissioners. I only wish the Revenue Commissioners would have more work to do after the passage of this Bill, but the sad likelihood is that they will have less.</P>
      <P>The second point to which I should like to refer is the lack of formal notification to this side of the House. I accept that we were notified in a general way through the Whips before the weekend that such a motion might be necessary but, to the best of my knowledge, there was no formal notification. In fact, I heard about it myself by gossip yesterday at 6 p.m.  If I had left the House five minutes earlier, I would not have heard it until the news this morning.  Whatever about the merits of the motion, the method of its transmission leaves a considerable amount to be desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> As has been pointed out already by Deputy Fitzpatrick, the related fact is that we are not just talking here about a guillotine on Committee Stage of the Bill.  We are talking about a guillotine on all subsequent stages, and a forced timetable for other stages.  We are being asked to vote on a motion which interposes no more than 15 hours between the conclusion of Committee Stage and the inauguration of Report Stage. It is one thing to look for a week, but we are not even being given a day.  We are not even being given 24 hours to consider the situation which arises at the end of the debate on Committee Stage and to make whatever political, or fiscal, or legislative response we want to make before the next stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made considerable play of the number of hours which have been devoted to a discussion on this Bill so far.  He knows better than I do, I am sure, that fundamentally a Finance Bill is a Committee and Report Stage Bill, and that the division of hours as between the various stages is of fundamental importance.  It might have been of more significance had the Government moved earlier to look for agreement on the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The facts show that when the Government looked for agreement on the conclusion of Second Stage they got it.  So far as I recall, they got it virtually the same day.  There was no great problem affecting the conduct of the Bill at that stage.  If the Government were seriously concerned about the timetabling of the Bill, they should have moved on Second Stage rather than now at a point when some of the most serious issues may have to be left undiscussed.</P>
    <P>On the evidence we have before us in the printed record of the House, it seems this has been the intention of the Government all along.  If I recall correctly, before the end of the debate on Second Stage the word &ldquo;guillotine&rdquo; was used by the Minister for Finance in a singularly provocative way which was not justified by any of the facts at that time available to Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Having said that much, would the Deputy please elaborate on <Col N="1474" /> what I did say and in what circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not got the Official Report with me but, as far as I recollect, the Minister was the first and for some considerable time afterward the only person to use the word &ldquo;guillotine&rdquo; in the House.  So far as I recall, he used it towards the end of the debate on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Was that not in response to Deputies over there who invited us to follow the good example of the Coalition and I said they should not tempt me to use a guillotine?  Was it not in that kind of context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: When the Minister used this word he was closing the debate on Second Stage, a debate which was being closed by agreement, without acrimony, between all parties.  He chose a singularly inappropriate opportunity to use the word, and it was a somewhat provocative use of it.  Not long after that the word &ldquo;filibuster&rdquo; also appeared from the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: On more occasions than one the Minister for Finance and his Taoiseach have told us in this House they are not responsible for what we read in the newspapers.  I am sure he would extend the same privilege to this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is where it started, in the newspapers.  There was a little snippet about the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister pays a great deal of attention to rumours which I would have thought inappropriate in view of the attention he has lavished here on the Finance Bill to date.  If one looks at the progress on this Bill to date there is no evidence for that charge.  Indeed, one could argue that the different sections of the <Col N="1475" /> Bill so far have been dealt with fairly and adequately in relation to their relative importance.  For example, it could be argued that some of the most contentious sections of the Bill were the first five.  Section 1 would have gone through virtually unopposed, certainly without a major debate, if the Minister had not brought into the debate, in order to rap Deputies on this side over the knuckles, an allegation or an assertion about a certain agreement which apparently had been reached between various persons and representatives of the previous Government and then he refused to give to the House details of the alleged agreement. It was therefore inescapable he should have been asked to give that information and it was his refusal to do so that prolonged the debate on that section.</P>
      <P>In many respects the Minister has not been the least contributor to the debate on the Bill, and some of his contributions have been extremely interesting but, particularly in relation to section 1, the whole problem was virtually entirely of his making.  We debated section 2 for about three hours.  It deals with separate assessments and I believe the debate on it was a valuable contribution and addition to the whole theory and practice of taxation and will be welcomed as such by anybody who reads it.  It represents a matter of major importance and I do not believe we debated it for a minute too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4, which will cost the State £2 million, was dealt with comparatively briefly, and section 5, the personal relief provision, is the core of the Bill and the section and its related amendments were the subject of a major and extended debate.  It could not have been otherwise.  We were talking on that section about the disposition of total reliefs worth £70 million in the current year, or £100 million in a full year.  It was essential that every option should have been teased out, that anything in any way relevant to the economical and social consequences of this scheme of reliefs should have been argued.  It was argued and the Minister did his own <Col N="1476" /> side proud in many of his contributions. He did not lose any occasion to make his points forcefully and clearly.  That debate was characterised by good humour, good feeling and a willingness to accept if not correction at least the other person's point of view.</P>
    <P>They were the main sections in the first part of the Bill.  If we look at the remainder of the sections of the Bill with which we dealt, there was a discussion on income tax and corporation tax of modest length; there was a fairly substantial discussion in relation to the taxation of farmers about which there is nothing unusual &mdash;this has been the major political issue in Ireland since 1973, and therefore the debate was appropriately extended.  Then, if I recall correctly, we went from section 27&mdash;tax credit in respect of distributions&mdash;to section 36, nine sections, in as many minutes.</P>
    <P>This is an example of the attitude on this side of the House, which is to debate all the main issues adequately and fully and not to waste time on irrelevancies and on sections which could not have anything said about them because they were self-evident. We have been discussing section 36 for some considerable time, and in relation to that and to the Bill as a whole attempts were made to get agreement from this party&mdash;and I have no doubt from Fine Gael&mdash;in relation to a voluntary time limit.  As an assistant Whip I can recall informing the Government Whips' office that we would not give any undertaking about the length of time to be devoted to that section or indeed to the Committee Stage of the Bill.  We were simply determined to say whatever we felt we should say on the different sections and then shut up.  The reason we could not give an undertaking is that there is considerable feeling about this section of the Bill, not just in this party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not think the Deputy is correct if he intends to suggest that agreement was sought from this side of the House on that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister is <Col N="1477" /> correct&mdash;the fundamental agreement was sought on the Committee Stage, not on that section.  The reason we could not give an undertaking on the Committee Stage as a whole is because of the strength of feeling on this side in relation to that section.  The strength of feeling in the Parliamentary Labour Party and in the party as a whole is such that it would have been improper for any of us to attempt to restrain that feeling while at the same time assuming it would be expressed within the general terms of the rules of order of the House.</P>
      <P>The other main problem is that the majority of the amendments remaining, apart from one or two ministerial amendments, need more explanation. We are being asked to vote on a guillotine motion, but the guillotine we are deciding on now is nothing compared to the guillotine on social spending which is being introduced in the guise of the Green Paper.</P>

      <P>: My main reason for intervening at this stage is because of my general dislike of closure motions.  There is an important principle involved and I want to ensure that our rights will be preserved. Particularly in a matter as vital as the Finance Bill, Deputies should be entitled to greater latitude in their contributions.  What is the need for this motion?  The Bill has not been under discussion for very long.  I have not intervened in it because I had not the time to do so and I would not have risen now if I were not so totally against stifling the views of Members.  I do not like it particularly since the motion has come when we were discussing section 36 which relates to the abolition of the wealth tax.  We all know this is an important provision.  I understand the moneys obtained last year by the Exchequer from this tax were between £9 million and £10 million and that it was hoped it would have yielded an increased amount this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is related to the measure we are discussing.  I was referring to the fact that the closure motion coincided with the discussion on the wealth tax.  This is an important section of the Bill because it deprives the Exchequer of funds which were available to it in 1977.  If we abolish this tax it is evident that we must try to get the money elsewhere. Money does not fall like manna from the skies.  If we allow this money to be kept by the people who under previous legislation were obliged to pay it, then, as Deputy Horgan pointed out, we must curtail services or obtain the money from some other source.  With all due respect to the Chair and to the Fianna Fáil Party, this is a ticklish question.  Everybody knows that it was these people who financed the helicopter tour of the Taoiseach in the last general election campaign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>: This motion should not be before the House and I am endeavouring to illustrate and give reasons why it should not be.  I do not want to repeat myself, but I indicated that it is the right of ordinary Members of this House, elected by the people of this country, to address themselves to questions coming before the House.  A closure motion prevents them from so doing.  I protest against that.  Whichever party the ordinary Members or back-benchers belong to, be it Government party or Opposition party, this principle is a big one which should be safeguarded.  Last July 15 Members were appointed to this Government and they are now dictating terms.  They have come to certain conclusions and it does not matter what this House thinks about such conclusions.</P>
      <P>The Government have the voting power behind them and they are going to bulldoze this measure through the House.  This is not democracy and I object to it as forcibly and vehemently as I can.  Down through the years we had very few closure motions.  I was never for filibustering in any debate.  I would never stand by Members making speeches for the sake of using up time. I have always believed in trying to be as constructive as possible.  I would certainly support a motion for closure if I believed that the debate on this question was unduly long or that it was a type of filibuster.  Many of my colleagues in the Labour Party feel very strongly on this question and possibly Members of other parties do also. They are entitled during the passage of this measure to offer these views and to reply to the observations of the Minister and of other Members and to discuss this in the greatest detail possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> I do not want to be accused of taking up the time of the House unduly, but the finance measure is very important. When the Finance Bill is passed it will be going to the Revenue Commissioners. There is no use in telling them what the Minister said or what was said in the Dáil.  The Act will be interpreted as it is set down.  Some Deputies want to make changes and this is the place to make them.  Deputies want to offer suggestions and to make a concrete case which will move the Government from their stone-walling position of saying what they think we are going to get irrespective of what views and suggestions are offered from the opposite side of the House.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister where this £10 million is to come from.  That is a fair question because the closure motion is mainly centered around section 36 of this Bill.  Is it going to come from the profits of the less well-off sections of the community?  Is it to come from the curtailment of social welfare?  The budget proposals and the financial statement before the House as well as offsetting the increase in social welfare this year will reduce the overall costs by £2.5 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

Everybody in this State is obliged, and rightly so, to pay his or her contribution to the Exchequer in accordance with his or her wealth and income.</P>

We are discussing a time motion for the Finance Bill and the Deputy is entitled to deal with the time that any section takes. He is not going to be allowed to discuss at length all the matters he is discussing.  I ask him to get back to the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The motion is a closure motion, the objective of which is to preclude Deputies from making contributions in this House. The Minister of State who introduced the motion could not make the case that anything was out of place with the contributions that were being made in this House in discussing the proposals of the different sections of this measure.  The Minister of State could not make a case that they were being unduly delayed and he did not give any justifiable reason as to why debate should be stifled here.  I strongly object to this type of motion.  Deputies should have the right to speak in accordance with the rules and regulations of the House without the fear of a guillotine motion.  Unless I was satisfied that there were very good reasons for it I would not agree with a guillotine motion even if it were brought in by my party.  As far as I know we had only one guillotine motion.  We should speak strongly against such motions to make sure that although the Government will pass this motion with their large majority they will not be too inclined to bring in similar motions in future.  Our voices must be heard loudly, firmly and vehemently against unjustifiable closure motions.  This motion does not merit support.  I firmly oppose the proposal put forward by the Minister.</P>

      <P>: It is very interesting listening to the discussion on this motion.  As I pointed out, in what was probably a disorderly interjection, Deputy Horgan was the only Member from either Fine Gael or Labour speaking on this motion who even adverted to the reason for the motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy at least is entitled to the credit for having adverted to the reason unlike all the others who totally ignored it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Having given Deputy Horgan the credit for that, I must point out that he missed the real point because he said that the Revenue Commissioners have no right to anticipate what this or the other House will do or what format the Finance Bill will take.  That is a good, sound, theoretical point but in practice does the Deputy know what it means?  It means that if the Revenue Commissioners did not do that all the people, for instance, on PAYE would today be paying tax at the Coalition rate of income tax, not the Fianna Fáil rate introduced in the last budget.  Is that what Deputy Horgan thinks should happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does it mean the wealth tax would also be collected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does Deputy Horgan think that the people on PAYE should now be paying income tax at the Coalition rate?  If they were paying it does not Deputy Horgan know that they would be crowding around the House asking that the guillotine motion be put through as fast as possible so that they could get the benefit of the income tax rates prescribed in this Bill and announced in the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: What is the difference between this week and next to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Again, I must pay tribute to the Deputy for at least adverting <Col N="1483" /> to what this is all about.  The Minister of State explained the problem. The Bill was circulated a long time ago and the Revenue Commissioners, with my authority, anticipated the contents of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: My point was that the Minister should not have put them in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Then the Deputy is saying that people should now be paying the Coalition rate of income tax.  The Deputy knows very well that if, for instance, married couples found that their tax allowance was £600 less than it is at the moment, they would be in demanding that this closure motion be passed and that this Bill be passed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach to this was reasonable having regard to the length of time that has elapsed since the circulation of the Bill, and allowing for the fact that it had to go through this House and would of necessity take a shorter time in the other House as is normal.  The Revenue Commissioners made their preparations on the basis that the Bill would be enacted by the end of this month.  We tried, on a number of occasions, through the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, to get agreement with the Opposition on a timetable for passing the Bill which would enable us to have it passed through both houses by the end of this month.  No matter how hard we tried we could not get such an agreement.  Reference was made to sitting extra hours during the course of the debate and it is true that there were discussions on the possibility of sitting extra hours.  The difficulty was that while we were quite prepared to consider this we could not get an undertaking that in return the proceedings on each Stage of the Bill would terminate at any time that would enable us to be sure that it would be passed by the end of the month.  No agreement was forthcoming on finishing the debate no matter how long we were willing to sit.  We tried to be as reasonable as we could, having regard to the constraints I have mentioned, <Col N="1484" /> but we could not get any co-operation from the other side.  It is the Opposition's right not to co-operate if they do not wish to but they should not, when the inevitable consequence arises and we have to have a closure motion, pretend that we did not try, or pretend that we are bringing in this closure motion for reasons other than those put forward by the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy Barry must face reality.  The situation is as I have described. If Deputy Barry has a better solution for it than this, he did not tell us about it, and he had his chance But he did tell us about some things that are simply not true.  In fact it was incredible to listen to Deputies on the other side of the House speaking in this manner, Deputies who were in the last Government.  There are a number of new Deputies in the House.  I am sure that if they did not know what had been going on they would not have believed that they were listening to members of the last Government, for instance, Deputy M. P. Murphy, who was a Parliamentary Secretary in the last Government pleading for the rights of Deputies; he went into the lobby on three different Finance Bills when his Government were in office, pushed them through with the built-in majority they are talking about today, and at shorter intervals than are proposed here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Finance Bill in 1974, and the No. 2 Bills in 1975 and in 1977 were put through by closure motions from the previous Government. In each case the number of days on which debate had taken place prior to the closure was much less than now, in 1978.  Deputy P. Barry referred to the date on which the Second Stage of the Bill was taken, The important point is: when was the Bill circulated?  Is it not true that the date on which the Second Stage commenced was, to a great extent, determined by the Opposition and not by the Government because there had to be agreement to suit Opposition spokesmen? This year, as far as the interval between Budget day and the circulation of the Bill was concerned, it was 70 days; in 1974 it was 89 days and in 1977 it was 90 days.  Therefore it is quite clear that the time allowed on this occasion is considerably in excess of what was allowed in previous years. The time allowed for Report and Final Stages is similar to that allowed in previous years.  Indeed in every single year in which the Coalition were in power the Report and Final Stages were taken either on the same day as the conclusion of the Committee Stage or the next day, one or the other. Therefore it does not really make sense to have the kind of arguments we have been hearing.</P>
      <P>I would invite Deputies who really want to pay any attention to what is going on on this motion to advert to the problem outlined by the Minister of State, to which I have adverted, the problem that arises if the Revenue Commissioners cannot anticipate what is in the Bill for PAYE people being taxed at the Coalition rates, or if they do anticipate them, then the consequences that arise about getting the Bill through.  On any basis of that kind one can say only that what we are doing is being done as reasonably as we can, having made every effort to reach a reasonable agreement and failing to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, on the question generally of guillotines&mdash;which I do not like any more than anybody else&mdash;Deputies might at least remember that all we are proposing to apply a closure motion to <Col N="1488" /> is the Finance Bill, no other business before the House.  We are not doing what our predecessors did&mdash;applying a guillotine to Bills which had not even been circulated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am very disappointed that a Government with the number of Deputies they have to support them should come in with a guillotine motion this evening.  It reflects very badly on democracy.  What is the haste? Why?  Their record of legislation in their first year in office has not been good.  They have not introduced very much so they have not been under pressure in that respect.  Therefore one must ask the question why this closure motion has been brought in this evening. Obviously it is to stifle comment on a document brought in on Friday last called the Green Paper.  They say they are under pressure of time.  Why did they not extend the time? Why did they not have late sittings last week and this week?  They say they were not getting guarantees.  That is not sufficient reason for not having late sittings and at least making an honest effort to get this Bill through the House.  They have not done so. They have shied away from extended sittings.  They blame the Whips for not being able to reach agreement.  That will not wash.  It is blatantly clear that the Government now want to steamroll&mdash;and &ldquo;steamroll&rdquo; is the operative word&mdash;this Finance Bill through the House, given their strength in numbers in voting in the lobbies.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1978: Committee Stage (Resumed) .</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 36 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: The debate on this section is, in our view, the most important debate so far on this Bill. The debate ranged over last week and today and would, I believe, range for quite some time yet but for the introduction <Col N="1495" /> of the guillotine motion.  This section provides for the removal of a tax imposed in the 1975 Finance Act on the very rich in our society.  Only two short years have passed since its introduction.  Rarely, if ever, has the Labour Party opposition been greater or more sincerely held than on this issue.</P>
      <P>The wealth tax was introduced in 1975 against the background of the abolition of death duties.  A long campaign was waged against these death duties and the case was made that death duties, because of the way in which they operated, were a penal tax, coming as they did at a time of bereavement and deep distress.  There was a great deal of what I would describe as hit and miss about these death duties, the misses being all too often on the side of the better equipped and the better advised sections of our community.  For example, if wealth passed to the heirs five years before the death of the holder of that wealth, the heirs were free of tax.  If not, then they were liable for death duties.  Those whose enterprises were of a magnitude which involved frequent legal dealings were generally those most likely to make provision for their successors. Others not so happily placed had to face crippling death duties, often resulting in the sale of a home or a farm.</P>
      <P>The wealth tax was introduced as a substitute for death duties.  Its introduction was consistent with the programme of reform implemented by the then Government.  Since there had to be a substitute&mdash;this is something the present Government are now discovering in regard to their election promises and the fulfilling of them&mdash;the wealth tax was the obvious course to follow. The Labour Party held firm views then&mdash;we still hold them&mdash;on the principle of wealth taxes and we offer no apology for holding the House up, if we can be accused of doing so, on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our opposition to its abolition now is sincerely and keenly held.  The wealth tax was indeed a relatively ineffective form of tax.  It yielded only a <Col N="1496" /> marginal sum, but it was a definite step in the right direction and we are incensed that this tax should now be abolished by this Fianna Fáil Government. The capitalist shears of the Fianna Fáil Government is here in action.  It is being wielded to cut out the liabilities of the rich and, not alone that, but to cut some of the services for the poor and the disadvantaged, if we are to judge by the proposals and options presented in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>This is not the time to discuss the Green Paper but, so far as the proposals in it are concerned, it is sinister taken in conjunction with the decision of the Government to abolish the wealth tax.  A correspondent in <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, Liam O'Neill, who cannot be described as one given to lambasting the Government, had this to say in this morning's issue in regard to the proposals in the Green Paper, and his comments are applicable to the wealth tax as well:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A BLUEPRINT to &ldquo;hammer&rdquo; the small man is one description I heard applied to the Government's Green Paper over the weekend.  Not bad either, since it seems to be the small man&mdash;financially, that is&mdash; who is being asked to make all the sacrifices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is he who is being asked to accept less in children's allowances, to pay more for his housing, for his children's education, for his health services.</P>
    <P>Not nearly so much is being asked of the better-off people in this document, and the rich are to be let off almost entirely.</P>
    <P>A Government which only a few months ago decided to abolish the Wealth Tax&mdash;a tax sought only from those with a lot of property or money, or both&mdash;now comes along and proposes to tax children's allowances.</P>
    <P>It is incredible, and it is to be hoped that their supporters will quickly let them know what Dr. Martin O'Donoghue must be told to do with that one.</P>
    <P>That correspondent is not given to <Col N="1497" /> undue criticism of this Government.</P>
    <P>The wealth tax introduced in 1975 was only a diluted form of what was proposed in the White Paper the previous year.  The thresholds were doubled.  The percentage was reduced and generous exemptions were provided. The then Minister very correctly said when introducing the measure that a means of tax evasion was about to be denied the better off sections and they were being required to make a modest instalment tax on the top slice of their fortunes.  That expresses very well what the wealth tax is all about. There was a single rate of 1 per cent and the exemption thresholds of £100,000 in the case of married couples, £70,000 for single people and £90,000 for widowed persons.  That was wealth beyond the wildest dreams and sometimes the imagination of many of the people who contribute 87 per cent of the income tax of this State under the effective PAYE system, an amount out of all proportion to their share of the gross national income, and beyond the comprehension of those unfortunate enough to have to rely on social welfare.</P>
    <P>A lot more could be done for those people if this Government had collected and distributed the £10 million and more which would have accrued under the wealth tax.  What is wrong with us as a people when we can tolerate such enormous differences in wealth, much less buttress the wealthy as this Government are doing under this measure?  This is a tax on personal wealth of very great magnitude by my terms, if not by the Minister's.  That is precisely the point I am complaining about&mdash;that there should be two standards of what constitutes the needs of a human being.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 9 June, carried a report by Colm Rapple which said that two bosses of a well-known company in this country took</P>
    <P>&ldquo;£14,000 a week from the company last year for services rendered.  That is apart altogether from the dividends they got from substantial shareholdings in the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say they were entitled to £393,000 apiece.  In the case of one of these bosses,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> even assuming that he puts in a 60-hour week&mdash;which is possible&mdash;that works out at £136 an hour or over £8,000 a week.</P>
    <P>In less than four-and-a-half hours that man could make what a person on unemployment assistance gets in a year or what a single woman's allowance would be in a full year.  How can there be such mind-boggling disparities between the values society places on human beings when one person has 650 times more to live on than the other, and that is unearned wealth.  We could talk about earned wealth.  The lucky few who earn £80 a week for a 40-hour week still get only one sixty-eighth of the amount earned by the man I mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is no question of cherishing all the children of the nation equally. How can it be reasonable that the boss I have mentioned should be given tax relief while no reliefs are given to taxpayers in respect of dependent children or to mothers in the form of increased children's allowances?  It is scandalous to suggest that the wealth tax be abolished.  According to a survey carried out by Brian Nolan of the Central Bank one quarter of the total income of the country is taken by the top 10 per cent and only 1.5 per cent is retained by the bottom 10 per cent.  It is the top 10 per cent who were defended by this Government when in opposition and to whose aid they have leapt the moment they were returned to power.</P>
    <P>In the apportionment of the £70 million tax reliefs in this Bill only £70 a year could be afforded for a widow, no matter how many children she had. The individual worker still pays tax as soon as he earns more than £16 a week.  Retired workers are still taxed on their pensions.  The just call of the people who must use their cars to commute for tax reliefs has once again been ignored.  The abolition of car tax was no substitute.  The bigger your car the more you gained.  The worker who must use his car going to work has a very good case for tax relief.  There have been suggestions of savings in social welfare, cuts in expenditure on health and education while our friend getting £136 an hour is given more into <Col N="1499" /> his bulging pockets.  This is incomprehensible.</P>
    <P>Workers are constantly reminded of their duty to the unemployed.  There have been calls for income restraint by workers but apparently the contribution of the very wealthy is only available at a price, their price, at whatever price they command, regardless of the consequences that might have on the weaker sections of the community. That is a terrible indictment of capitalism. It appears to us to be the law of the jungle.</P>
    <P>The Minister argues that this is the time to create jobs, that the people with a disproportionate share of the wealth of the State will not give of their talents, of their ability, of their brains, unless they are allowed to make unlimited profits.  They have been given exemption on what must be assumed to be substantial houses.  They have been given exemption, too, in respect of their livestock, their bloodstock, their pensions and so on, but yet they are unhappy.  At least those who have the ear of the Minister for Finance have not expressed themselves as being happy with the situation.  As a result of an amendment in last year's Finance Bill private non-trading companies that have control of trading companies were exempted so that genuine commercial arrangements would be exempted from wealth tax.  The outright opposition of the privileged people in our society to the principle of a wealth tax has prevailed.</P>
    <P>In defending his action, action that is diametrically opposed to everything we on these benches stand for, the Minister makes the case that a wealth tax is disastrous economically.  He argues as if wealth taxes did not apply in any other country whereas approximately half the countries in the EEC have a wealth tax of some kind.  How do these countries survive?  There is opposition to the whole principle of wealth tax at any stage of economic development but in Denmark, for instance, there is a wealth tax and the threshold is only one-fifth of what it has been here.  Various arguments have been put forward in seeking to justify the abolition of wealth tax but what <Col N="1500" /> has emerged is a total reliance on people who are the holders of wealth of the magnitude necessary in order to be liable for wealth tax.  These are people, who, even according to what was said by Fianna Fáil in opposition, have not done their duty so far as the country is concerned, especially during the time of the recession.  Despite this there is a frightening reliance by the Government on private enterprise to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>As we have said so often before, the purpose of private enterprise is not the creation of jobs but the creation of profit.  Jobs will be created in the private sector only in so far as they are needed to create profit.  Private enterprise is answerable in the first instance to shareholders.  There is evidence that the leaders of the private sector are not totally happy with the over-reliance being put on them by the Government to create jobs.  A CII survey published in February last showed that 22 per cent of private firms did not envisage providing additional jobs even if they should increase output by as much as 30 per cent during the next two years.  In other words, their aim will be to increase output as cheaply as possible with employment being a feature only in so far as it cannot be avoided. Therefore, there would not appear to be any case to be made for the abolition of wealth tax.  Neither is there a guarantee that the abolition of this marginal tax will help in any way to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal constitutes an injury and an insult to the poor and the deprived, that 10 per cent who enjoy only 1.5 per cent of the wealth of the State.  This proposal is an affront to those parents of the 100,000 children who are dependent on social welfare.  It is a gross insult, too, to the widow with two children who is being asked to survive on £24.40 per week, a far cry from the £136 per hour I mentioned a few moments ago. These are the people who should be considered in relation to any attempt to redistribute wealth.  The Government's proposal is an affront also to those paying tax under the PAYE system, tax which is out of proportion to their share of the wealth of the <Col N="1501" /> State.  It is a proposal which portrays an extraordinary sense of priority for any party, even for Fianna Fáil.  It is astounding that the Government intend going ahead with this measure. After only a year in office there is a frightening shift to the right on the part of the Government.  That is a trend that we denounce and will continue to denounce as strongly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I spoke on this section already but the Minister failed to answer one of the points I raised. Although he interjected in the debate on several occasions he did not see fit to answer my question.  He was sharp in his criticism of Labour Party Deputies and of myself for the attitude we were taking on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that the Minister failed to answer related to the level of investment here.  He continuously challenged the Labour Deputies, particularly Deputy Horgan, by asking whether they were for or against employment. The substance of the Minister's case seems to be that a wealth tax discourages or interferes in some way with employment.  In other words, he would argue that the abolition of the wealth tax would encourage employment. During the Second Stage debate I said that there was no evidence to indicate that the wealth tax had been responsible for money being taken from the country.  At the time the Minister said he had found a file that had been submitted to his predecessor by the Central Bank and which suggested that there was some evidence that money had left the country.  The Minister said he had found a file which ference that this happened because of the wealth tax.  During the weekend I checked with Deputy Ryan on this point.  He was the person to whom I referred in the House at the time as having been the one I questioned more than 12 months ago on this matter.  Again, Deputy Ryan assured me that he had the position watched carefully from the date of the announcement of a wealth tax until he left office and that there was no evidence to suggest that the wealth tax was responsible for money leaving the country.  We know that money is <Col N="1502" /> going from and coming into the country all the time but there is no evidence to suggest that money was taken from the country because of the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Jobs result from investment.  As reported at column 1189, Volume 307, of the Official Report of 14 June 1978 I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the charges against the wealth tax is that it was responsible for money leaving the country.  In the three years before we came into office, the proportion of GNP which was devoted to fixed investment was 21.6 per cent in 1970, 22.7 per cent in 1971 and had been declining to 21.5 per cent in 1972.  In 1973 and 1974 the amount of investment increased and in 1975, at the height of the depression, it decreased again; but it decreased to 23.7 per cent and this when the wealth tax, according to its opponents, was supposed to be biting hardest.  The level of 23.7 per cent of GNP devoted to fixed investment was 2½ points higher than when we came into office in 1973.  Last year, when the wealth tax was still in operation, 25.2 per cent of GNP was devoted to fixed investment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister would reply to those points on the many occasions he spoke, but he did not.  If the wealth tax was interfering with the creation of jobs how is it that money was invested in the country during the three years when it was in operation and when we all know that we can relate investment directly to jobs?  During those three years the level of investment as a proportion of GNP rose. That is the answer to the Minister's attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: In discussing this section of the Finance Bill the question arises about who should carry the burden of the State.  This is a section in the Finance Bill which results from the Budget Statement.  There is a proposal, on the one hand, that wealth tax should be abolished and, on the other, we have a situation where children's allowances were not increased.  This is in breach of an undertaking to ensure that such payments would be increased in line with inflation.  There is a further <Col N="1503" /> suggestion emanating from the Green Paper that children's allowances should be taxed.  I am not an economist but when I am faced with a situation like this&mdash;a suggestion, on the one hand, that wealth tax should be abolished and, on the other hand, that children's allowances should not be increased but in fact should be taxed&mdash;I can only come to one conclusion.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil must now accept the tag of the party of the wealthy.  As a result of this measure they are taking a step which will be of substantial benefit to the wealthiest 5,000 people in the country.  Those people have got a present of approximately £2,000 each per annum.  Do they need it?  They would not have to pay wealth tax if they needed it.  On the other side of the coin we have many thousand children in the country who are solely dependent on children's allowances being paid to their mothers to provide food and clothing for them.  Many mothers of those children may not be at this level, but I am aware that there are many children in this country for whom children's allowance is an absolute necessity.  They are the people of this State who are supposed to have a guarantee under the Constitution of being cherished equally.  Fianna Fáil have turned their backs on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not merely a question of asking whether one is for or against wealth tax.  We have to accept that some people have to pay a certain amount to carry the burdens of the State and that there are others who are in need of help from the State.  It is when this choice is before us, as it was put before us in the budget and in this Finance Bill, that there can be no doubt about what attitude one must take.  I have not seen in any of the statements from the Fianna Fáil benches any justification of the barefaced neglect of some of the weaker sections of the community.  Fianna Fáil must accept that there are people to speak for those children.  We will continue to remind the Government of their responsibility to those children. If the Government feel that they can go through this measure, help 5,000 people and neglect those <Col N="1504" /> others, I can appreciate their embarrassment and their decision today to cut off discussion on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am out of order in referring back to the closure motion, but there is a question of the damage to democracy which is done by a Government who are taking this step and, being embarrassed, are prepared to ram the Bill down the throats of the legislators of this House so that the matter will be forgotten once and for all.  This is a measure of their embarrassment on a controversial section of this Bill, which cannot be taken in isolation but has to be considered in the context of the whole approach of this administration to the financial and social affairs of the State.</P>
    <P>While one is in the situation that one has to levy taxes to pay for the services of the State, while one has to consider who is or who is not deserving in the State, surely one has to accept that it is indefensible to isolate the 5,000 wealthiest people in the country to be beneficiaries of Fianna Fáil largesse?  It is not their largesse since they are only&mdash;temporarily, we hope&mdash; looking after the largesse of the State. We have to look at this in the context of the full Finance Bill and in the context of the past, the capital tax package which was introduced by the previous Government.  It was made clear at that time that this was introduced in substitution for a totally iniquitous penal tax, estate duty, which was permitted to continue in the country for most of the time under the Fianna Fáil administration and caused great hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>:  I move:  &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to enable the Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers, which was established under the Industrial Relations Act, 1976, together with other Joint Labour Committees to submit proposals to the Labour Court for the purposes of enabling the Labour Court to implement national pay agreements in an expeditious manner.  The Bill, if enacted, would have the effect of suspending subsection (3) of section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 while a national agreement is in operation.</P>
      <P>According to the operation of national agreements since 1970, the date on which the 1978 national agreement would apply to agricultural workers, forestry workers, drainage workers and county council workers generally, is 1 March 1978.  The Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers is prohibited by the 1946 Act from submitting a proposal to the Labour Court to apply the floor increase of £3.50 until the end of July next.  Employers and workers in agriculture must be given at least three weeks in which to make representations without making any provision for the time required to organise statutory meetings.  It follows that the earliest date on which the £3.50 could be applied to agricultural workers would be very late September or early October. If the proposal is referred back to the joint labour committee by the court, arising from representations received by the court, further delays could occur and the 2nd phase would almost be due to be paid before the 1st phase would be implemented.</P>
      <P>It has been the object of recent national agreements to close the time gap between the early and late starters. National agreements have tended to bring forward the late starters with a view to harmonising the operative date for the various grades of workers under the national agreements.  Unfortunately, there is a restrictive rule in subsection (3) of section 42 in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 which prevents the joint labour committee from making proposals to vary an Employment Regulation Order until the order has been made for at least six months.  Related to conditions in agriculture, this rule prevents the joint labour committee, and the Labour Court, from implementing the agreement on the due date, and it contravenes the operative dates in the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> The Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers have, since their establishment, made considerable progress towards the implementation of national agreements not only in relation to pay but also in regard to hours of work and conditions of employment. However, the restrictive six months rule renders it very difficult to frame an appropriate Employment Regulation Order so that it applies in a sensible way in agricultural conditions. If the existing rule is not suspended the joint labour committee, at their next meeting, would have to agree to a package of proposals effecting the 1st and 2nd phases of the 1978 agreement together with proposals for a further reduction in hours of work to take effect early in 1979, otherwise the six month's rule would inhibit the committee from making an amending order on hours of work later this year.  Agricultural employers are conservative by nature and while their representatives are now dealing with pay and conditions of employment in a much more realistic manner than formerly, nevertheless, the fact that the rules require them to agree to a massive package at one meeting makes orderly progress impossible.  Common sense suggests that the inflexible six months' rule should be suspended where it inhibits the operation of national agreements.</P>
    <P>National agreements provide not only for the payment of certain minimum weekly pay increases but also for changes in conditions of employment and hours of work, and for the implementation of the pay adjustments on the dates on which they become due.  The existing Employment Regulation Order which was proposed towards the end of last year gives late effect to the basic pay adjustments of the 1977 agreement but does not give effect to the proper operative date. The next Employment Regulation Order will not give full effect to the 1978 agreement either because of the delay in implementation and the position in relation to operative dates can worsen unless a flexible procedure is authorised by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The anomaly which the Bill proposes <Col N="1516" /> to remove was identified when the Bill for the 1976 Act was in passage through the Oireachtas.  The Department of Labour were adamant that the new legislation would work smoothly.  Unfortunately for agricultural workers, the administrative processes within the Department of Labour did not work smoothly or expeditiously when the Bill was enacted. There was so much unreasonable delay within the Department of Labour in transferring the functions of the Agricultural Wages Board to the joint labour committee that the new board were facilitated in the making of a wages order in late 1976 which was known to be illegal, in part, when it was made and laid before Dáil Éireann. But for the administrative delays within the Department of Labour it is reasonable to assume that the seven months delay in applying the £3.50 1st phase of the national agreement, 1978, could have been reduced to three months.  The loss to agricultural workers under the 1978 agreement will be of the order of £108, at least, and there was an earlier loss of similar magnitude under the 1977 agreement.</P>
    <P>It would be possible for the Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers in early August to make a proposal to the Labour Court providing for the inclusion of the 1st and 2nd phases of clause 3 pay increases of the 1978 agreement in an Employment Regulation Order, but with effect from a date in late September or October, 1978.  The passage of this Bill would enable the joint labour committee to make proposals immediately to give effect to the floor increase of £3.50, and this would substantially reduce the delay in implementing the national agreement.  The Bill does not propose to impose any additional burden on employers than that for which provision is made in the national agreement.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is urged to give an unopposed Second Reading to this Bill so that it may be enacted with the least possible delay in order that agricultural workers may benefit from the national agreement at the earliest possible date. Workers who accept the provisions of <Col N="1517" /> the national agreement should not be deprived of its benefits merely because of an obsolete rule in an Act of Parliament which was enacted over 32 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is surprising that in June 1978 we should be debating in this House a Bill sponsored by Deputies opposite which aims to overcome, in relation to joint labour committees, a problem which first came to light in 1975.  One is entitled to ask why this belated interest by the Opposition in the problems of workers covered by these committees, especially workers in agriculture? Taking the Bill at its face value, it appears to stem from a concern to remove an anomaly in the situation that would place workers at a disadvantage in benefiting from the provisions of the national pay agreements. However, anyone familiar with the facts will accept this view of the Bill as at present before us.  This problem and other problems of the law relating to joint labour committees first surfaced in 1975.  One has to ask why the Government of the day, and in particular the former Minister for Labour, did not translate their apparent concern into legislative action.</P>
      <P>Section 42 (3) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, provides that joint labour committees cannot consider proposals for amending or revoking employment regulation orders until these orders have been in force for a period of at least six months.  This clause, it is fair to say, did not give rise to any problems in the early national wage agreements in 1970 and 1972, which were the ones associated with the previous term of the Government, because in those agreements typically the interval between phased pay increases was at least six months and frequently as long as a year.  It was not until the 1975 national pay agreement&mdash;which provided for increases in pay at three-monthly intervals&mdash;that the significant anomaly arose in fixing minimum wage rates by employment regulation orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is surprising, then, that the former Government did not make any effort <Col N="1518" /> to deal with the problem when it did arise in 1975.  They have now chosen to raise it three years later when they are no longer in Government.  I remind the House that in 1974 a subcommittee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions prepared a report on minimum wages which recommended that a statutory national minimum wage should not be introduced and that a review of the joint labour committee machinery should be undertaken to ensure that committees were made more effective instruments for protecting the interest of low-paid and weakly organised sectors of the labour force.</P>
    <P>On 11 March 1975 the former Minister for Labour stated in reply to a parliamentary question put down for answer by the late Deputy Noel Lemass, and I quote from the Official Report, volume 279, column 153:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to see a situation wherein agricultural workers would receive increases in wages in line with those of industrial workers....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and he indicated that it should be possible to have a joint labour committee established for agricultural workers in the near future.  In the Dáil a year later, on 26 May 1976, speaking on the Department of Labour Estimate the former Minister said, and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 291, column 170:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have previously indicated my intention to introduce further legislation to improve the overall climate of industrial relations....</P>
    <P>I have given considerable attention to the problems of lower paid workers and I have, in consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Labour Court, under consideration proposals for improving the existing legislation dealing with the statutory regulation of wages....  The legislation affecting these committees could I feel, in the light of experience gained since 1946, be improved upon so as to improve the efficiency of operation of existing committees and make it easier to establish new committees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the light of these statements it is surprising that we have to have a <Col N="1519" /> motion to introduce a Bill of this nature at this stage from the opposite side of the House.  The records in the Department show that in 1975 a memorandum was submitted to the then Minister containing detailed proposals for the improvement of the operation of these joint labour committees. Included among them was a proposal recommending that the six months waiting period that must elapse before new proposals may be made by a joint labour committee should be abolished on the grounds that the existing committees created difficulties in relation to the implementation of the national wage agreements. That memorandum also contained a number of other proposals aimed at eliminating other delays associated with the operation of these committees.  In the event the then Minister for Labour did not act on the proposals put to him; instead he promoted legislation which confined itself to the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers and which avoided rectifying the apparent deficiencies of the joint labour committee system as a whole.</P>
    <P>On 30 May of this year my colleague, the Minister for Labour, answered a parliamentary question put down by Deputy Tully proposing the suspension of section 42 (3) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  In the course of supplementary questions Deputy Tully agreed that the proper time to have introduced amending legislation was when his then colleague in office was steering the 1976 Industrial Relations Act through the House. However, after admitting this mistake, Deputy Tully went on to blame the officials of the Department of Labour for the omission.  He said, and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 307, column 15:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the advice we got from the Department then was that this legislation was not necessary.  We considered it to be necessary and we were proved right and therefore the recommendation of the Department was incorrect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to set on record that in making that statement Deputy Tully was not reporting the facts as I have <Col N="1520" /> established them.  As I have pointed out, the Department did advise the then Minister about the six months waiting period and its problems and did recommend its abolition.  Therefore, if any criticism is to be made that criticism should not be directed at the Department or the officials but at Deputy Tully's colleague, the former Minister for Labour.  It was his decision which determined the contents of the Industrial Relations Act, 1976 and perpetuated the anomaly which is the subject of this Bill before the House.  Deputies opposite may very well say.  &ldquo;All right, given that that Act appeared to be necessary three years ago, it was not until&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>:  I can advance three reasons.  We are happily moving into a situation where the anomaly created by long intervals between the making of orders will not be as acute because happily we have got away from periods of severe inflation when three-monthly pay rises are necessary.  We are now back into a more stable climate in which we can have the first phase of the current agreement running for 12 months, to be followed by a second phase.  The relevance of that is that, even without any amending legislation going through this House, it would be possible for the joint labour committee to take action, by making its next order sometime within the next two months, which would cover both phases of the 1978 National Wage Agreement so that there would be no time lag from here on in.  Action of that nature by the committee would be just as quick and effective as any action which could follow from amending legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with Deputies opposite that there was an anomaly and that it was regrettable that workers, particularly low paid workers, should have had to wait fairly long periods before receiving increases which were awarded to workers in general, the effect of that anomaly is now diminishing.  It could be eliminated in the future by the joint labour committee taking action when making its next order.  There is <Col N="1521" /> nothing in the rules of the committee, as I understand it, to prevent them from deciding to agree to implement both phases of the national wage agreement in one employment regulation order.  As the House knows, the Commission on Industrial Relations has been established by the Minister for Labour and is now working.  He has asked that commission to furnish him with an interim report on the operation of the Labour Court and its various services. That report could relate to matters such as that which is the subject matter of this Bill.  Indeed, we could draw their attention to it to ensure that they would take it into consideration. I share the feeling of the Minister for Labour that it would be appropriate, having established that commission, to allow it to review the entire workings of the Labour Court and its various services and to make comprehensive proposals for legislative amendments.</P>
    <P>For those reasons we, on this side of the House, feel that there is no need to proceed with this Bill at this time and I suggest that we formally oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>:  In listening to the Minister's statement I was struck by the fact that he did not advance a single argument against the Bill.  About two-thirds of the Minister's speech was devoted to a laborious attempt to make a rather minor and unnecessary political point to the disadvantage of the former Minister for Labour.  This sort of thing adds nothing to Private Members' Time which is for the discussion of legislative proposals such as this. I am surprised at the Minister for wasting so much of the time of the House in this lengthy statement as to whether or not this should have been done in 1974, 1975 or 1978.  The Minister said that this Bill was not as necessary now because increases in wages did not come as frequently now as they did heretofore.  That is not an argument against the Bill because we are making statute laws not for the situation of the moment but so that they will be applicable in the years ahead.  There is no reason to assume that the circumstances which arose in the past in relation to the frequency of wage increases <Col N="1522" /> will not recur.  If this Bill is not on the Statute Book what the Minister admitted was an anomaly will become a problem again.  Yet the Minister sees fit to oppose the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that the matter could be dealt with by the joint labour committee.  It need not necessarily be dealt with by them.  Action by a body outside the direct control of the House is no excuse for this House not enacting legislation properly. If the Minister admits that there is an anomaly in the legislation which we are responsible for the fact that it can be remedied by somebody else is not a valid argument against making the necessary amendment now. The Minister said that a committee on industrial relations has been set up but it seems that the likelihood of it reporting fairly quickly or of speedy action being taken as a result of its report is not so great as to make it a waste of time for the House to pass legislation such as this.  It is not as if the report of the committee in question is likely to arrive on the Minister's table next week, so that the Minister would be in here with amending legislation to deal with this problem on foot of the report, and that if we were to pass this Bill today it would be superseded during its passage by legislation arising from the report of the committee on industrial relations, which is the only logical reason one can deduce in support of the Minister's argument.  This is not a valid argument.  It is the old excuse always used, that one never does anything about one problem because there are four or five other problems which can all be considered together.  That sort of an approach does not solve anything. If the Minister admits that a problem exists he should take action to solve it.  The argument that four or five other problems can be solved as well at a later date will not be appreciated or accepted.  As the Minister has used that argument I am interested to know when he expects this committee to report.  Does the Minister expect it to report this year, next year or the year after?  It seems to be relevant in this debate and if it is, perhaps the Minister would give us this information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>:  I thought I had made a point that since the joint labour committee can make the simple order implementing the terms of this year's agreement that provides a period up to the end of approximately 1979 during which there would be no continuing anomaly that therefore gives an adequate time period for this committee of inquiry to bring in their interim report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>:  I have got the information I wanted in so far as this is information at all.  I take it from that that the Minister is saying that this committee on industrial relations will have reported by the end of 1979 and that the legislation necessary to implement it will be on the Statute Book before the end of 1979.  Unless that is the case the Minister's argument against this Bill does not hold at all because this Bill will be necessary after that date. If this argument about the committee on industrial relations is a valid one, presumably the substitute legislation arising from it will have to be in effect before the end of 1979.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to know if the Minister for Economic Planning and Development consulted his colleague, the Minister for Labour&mdash;whom I presume is in closer contact with this committee, although one does not know nowadays which Minister is responsible for what&mdash;as to whether this committee will have reported and its findings be on the Statute Book before the end of 1979.  Frankly, I doubt it. Indeed, I wonder if the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is all that sanguine about the matter either.</P>
      <P>If I may sum up my attitude to this Bill, it is that Deputy J. Ryan presented a reasonable case with reasonable arguments in a non-partisan fashion. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has presented no case in a partisan fashion.  The House will and can have no doubt about which way it will make its decision when it comes to vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>:  When I saw the Minister for Economic Planning and Development coming into the House this evening on this Bill I could not understand <Col N="1524" /> why he should be here.  Of course, any Minister can come in on any Bill but, since he has spoken, I have discovered the reason&mdash;probably he is one of the few Minister in the Cabinet who knows absolutely nothing about agriculture and he was the ideal person to put up a smokescreen and that is what he tried to do.</P>
      <P>First of all, let me make something very clear.  When the question I put down to the Minister for Labour was being debated in this House there was no intention on my part to cast any slur on officials of the Department of Labour.  I have never done it and I do not propose to do it now.  I would hate anybody to get the impression from the suggestions made by the Minister present that that was my intention. The details as given by him do not coincide with the facts.  I hold the then Minister and the present Minister responsible for actions in their Department. I am aware that letters were sent to the Department from the trade union of which I had the honour to be general secretary for 30 years, who deal with agricultural workers, pointing out the necessity for this action.  I am aware of the replies received to those letters from the Department, I am aware of what the Minister for Labour said was the advice he got.  That is as far as I can go on that point.  The Minister present is quite correct when he talks about recommendations to have this dealt with&mdash;&ldquo;Proposals for Employer-Trade Union National Agreement, 1976&rdquo;&mdash;which were defeated by a mere nine votes but which, if they had been agreed then, would have contained, and I quote paragraph 5 subparagraph (iv):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Employer-Labour Conference agrees to make immediate representations to the Minister for Labour on the prompt enactment of amending legislation to the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 which would give the Minister for Labour power to reduce or eliminate the six months limit referred to in Section 42 (3) of the Act for the period covered by National Agreements.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was not done; the recommendation was not accepted and was not included <Col N="1525" /> in subsequent agreements.  The result is that we now have this mess. It would be rather amusing were it not so tragic to hear the Minister ask why, if we did not think it important in 1975 do we want to do something about it now.  The reason that we did not do anything about it in 1975 and 1976 was that we were assured then by the Minister&mdash;and Ministers usually take the advice of their officials&mdash;that this was not necessary.  We know now that it is necessary.  Therefore, two wrongs do not make a right.  If the Minister was wrong then&mdash;and I am not prepared to agree that he knew he was wrong &mdash;there is absolutely no reason why the present Minister or Government should attempt to perpetuate that wrong and to say that because it was not done then it will not be done now.</P>
    <P>We are great people in this country for talking about our wonderful agricultural industry.  Since I came into this House in 1954 time and again I have heard people refer to agriculture, the primary industry, and how important it was.  Yet in every type of legislation going through here&mdash;from legislation on wages, on conditions of employment, even on the Poisons Act, and on accidents, holidays, everything &mdash;there were two types of worker referred to, agricultural and others. The agricultural worker was always the second-class citizen.  They were the people who did not get that to which other workers were entitled.  Throughout the years the State did this.  Long after the five-and-a-half day week was granted by law to everybody else, the agricultural worker had a six-day week.  I had the honour, on the trade union front, to negotiate the first five-and-a-half day week for agricultural workers.  We found that even then the State was not terribly anxious to fall into line.  As a matter of fact, on State farms the six-day week was nearly made mandatory while the five-and-a-half day week was in operation on private farms outside.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of the payment of agricultural workers. The Agricultural Wages Board, when first set up in 1936, served a useful purpose.  They put a floor under agricultural workers' wages.  The wages <Col N="1526" /> first were 24 shillings a week and then 36 shillings, which was considered to be a reasonable amount at the time and bore quite a decent relation to that being paid to industrial workers.  Throughout the years something happened which should not have been allowed happen, that was, that the Agricultural Wages Board were set up in such a way that they dealt with wages and hours of working in a way in which no other wage fixing machinery of the State would be allowed operate.  First of all, the chairman of the board constituted a quorum for any meeting.  I was a member of one of the sub-boards for a while and on every occasion of which I am aware the chairman voted with the employers' representative, chairman after chairman.  I wonder was that a coincidence.  The mere fact that he was appointed by the Minister for Agriculture seemed to show that there was that bias against the workers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, instead of it being four against four it was five against four. For perhaps 20 to 25 years I campaigned against the continuance of the Agricultural Wages Board as a means of fixing wages and hours of working.  I am glad that I was a member of the Government which eventually abolished the Agricultural Wages Board and replaced them by other wage fixing machinery.  The last thing the Agricultural Wages Board did before they went out was to take an action&mdash;which turned out to be illegal and had to be rectified at the first meeting of the new board, a dying kick&mdash;in regard to equal pay. The extraordinary thing is that not alone did they want to, and did, prevent agricultural workers from getting the benefit of the national wage agreement as long as they existed, but they also took the necessary action to try to prevent female agricultural workers from getting equal pay.</P>
    <P>The new board were set up.  I do not want anybody to get the impression that I am saying that they have not done good work.  They had a slow start.  Their first meeting did not take place for a very much longer space of time than should have elapsed.  The <Col N="1527" /> reason for that was that the employers did not appoint a representative to the board.  I would imagine that that was a deliberate ploy in an attempt to hold back agricultural workers' wages.  Even yet&mdash;and the Minister had to admit it&mdash;they are low paid workers, at the very bottom of the scale.  When the board met and the decision was taken we thought it was plain sailing.  Then we found that because of this specific regulation which we suggest should be amended, that is, section 42 (3) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, we have the situation that agricultural workers who are due an increase of £3.50 per week with effect from 1 March cannot be paid that increase until late September at the very earliest and, with a bit of fiddling around by the employers, may not be paid until October next.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that it does not matter and will not happen again. He talked about setting up a committee in a couple of years' time which would eventually make a report on industrial relations and this would make matters all right.  He talked about a 12-month agreement which would not arise until 1979.  An old man whom I knew in the country used to say.  &ldquo;God help his foolish with&rdquo; and this can be applied to the Minister.  If the Minister thinks that we are now in a situation where we are guaranteed a wage agreement of 12 months' duration every year he had better go back and have a look at his Green Paper and at the price increases announced during the past few weeks and those that will be announced during the coming months and see whether the existing wage agreement can stand up to the strain which will be put upon it.</P>
    <P>There is no point whatever in attempting to give the impression, as this Government have been doing, that workers' wages must be kept to the minimum if the country is to prosper. Because of the low wages being paid to many workers, particularly those in agriculture, we have a situation in which those people will not be prepared to carry on in their jobs unless something is done for them.  We hear so much talk about whether or not agriculture is doing well.  If you are <Col N="1528" /> not a farmer, you think that farmers have become millionaires since we joined the EEC.  If you are a farmer, you feel that farmers are only now beginning to catch up.  I am not farmer-bashing. I was reared in the country and I know that over the years farmers had a very tough time, particularly the smaller type.  I know that in recent years they have done very well and it saddens me to think that they are not prepared to share their wealth with those who are creating that wealth for them.  It is too bad when we find that people who are working very hard on the land are being asked to continue at these ridiculously low wage rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have looked at his brief; possibly it was handed to him before he came in here.  In case he has not had the opportunity to look at it, I would point out that the current employment regulation order was made on 23 January 1978 and published as Statutory Instrument 17 1978.  This order provides for a minimum wage of £42.50 in zone &ldquo;B&rdquo; or £1 per hour.  If the people who are entitled to an increase of £3.50 per week with effect from 1 March do not get that increase until next October, does the Minister consider that these people are likely to agree with him when he says that it is all right and will not happen again?  This should not have happened and we are asking that this Bill be accepted by the Government and at least put on the record to show that they are not entirely anti-worker.  Very many of their activities since they came into office would give the impression that they are very much anti-worker.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the current wages order relates to the 1977 agreement. This is something which obviously has been completely missed by the Minister for Labour and the other Ministers. It follows that the 1977 agreement has not been implemented in full by the Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers.  It is quite clear that no provision was made in the current wages order or in the previous order to respect the operative date of the phases in national agreements. The 1978 agreement was due <Col N="1529" /> to apply to agricultural workers on 1 March 1978.  This is also the date on which the agreement was applied to forestry workers, county council road workers, agricultural workers employed by the Department of Agriculture, drainage workers and so on. It is clear beyond all doubt that there are two factors which prevented agricultural workers from obtaining their pay adjustment with effect from the due date.  These factors include, first, the six months limit which the Bill would abolish and, secondly, the fact that the employers' representatives on the Joint Labour Committee, who are also represented on the Employer-Labour Conference, must have adopted a policy of refusing to implement fully the agreement and must be using the six months statutory rule as an excuse, otherwise there would have been provision in the existing order and in the previous order for a monetary compensatory amount in favour of agricultural workers.  No such amount can be identified in either order.</P>
    <P>As far as I can find from the last meeting of this new body, there is no intention on the part of the employers' representatives on that body to make any effort to try and hurry up the making of an order which would prevent this from happening again.  They seem to be perfectly satisfied to sit back and delay things in order to prevent agricultural workers from getting a miserly increase as a result of the last national wage agreement. If this is the object of the agricultural representatives, I feel that the agricultural workers will have no option but to tell the agricultural employers through their trade union that they are no longer interested and are simply not accepting the terms.  If the agricultural employers refuse to accept the terms of the national wage agreement and implement them, the workers will have no option but to do the same. There cannot be one law for one and another law for the other.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister is familiar with the EEC regulations. They issue enough of them on various matters.  In Supplement 2/75.  Stocktaking of the Common Agricultural <Col N="1530" /> Policy, they refer to the incomes of people in agriculture and to the provision of a fair standard of living. Paragraph 41 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Article 39 (1) (b) of the EEC Treaty is worded as follows: `thus (i.e. by increasing agricultural productivity) to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture'.</P>
    <P>The Treaty does not define `a fair standard of living' but in Article 4 of Directive 72/159/EEC on modernising farms the Council has defined a comparable income in agriculture as `the average gross wage for a non-agricultural workers' in the region in question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the EEC are interested in ensuring that farmers are paid at least the rate comparable to that being paid to industrial workers, can the Minister give any good reason why the other group engaged in agricultural production, the farm workers, should not be entitled to the same amount?</P>
    <P>The farmer has his farm and even though over the years he did not get a very good living he always has the farm to fall back on and to pass on to his family when he is leaving this world.  What has the farm worker to pass on?  He has the blisters on his hands for his work down through the years and whatever few shillings his wife may have been able to save as a result of trying to housekeep on an inadequate income.  Very often there is barely enough to pay funeral expenses. Yet we find a group of clever people attempting to prevent those workers from getting a fair share of a booming industry.  If the farmers representatives do not want to pay the increase, and do not want the workers to get the increase which is due to them, it follows that there is no option open to the workers but to say that the agreement has been broken and to take whatever action is necessary through the trade union movement to try to recover it.  If that means going back to the EEC and telling them that the farmers who have been getting the increases and who are employing workers are not prepared to give those <Col N="1531" /> workers the share which is their just right, there is no option but to say that and ask the EEC to ensure that they will not be as flaithiúlach about fixing prices in the future.</P>
    <P>The irony of the thing is that, while the agricultural worker has to pay the increase in the cost of food which has resulted from the increases given to the agricultural community, he cannot get the compensation normally sought and secured by other types of workers.  So, we are quite serious about this Bill.  It should have been accepted, even though the Minister for Labour told me a week or so ago that he was thinking of other amendments &mdash;he did not think of the commission which the Minister present has mentioned&mdash;which he would find it necessary to put into this Industrial Relations Act and that the whole lot would be put in together.  That is all right for a Minister or a Deputy or anybody not engaged in agriculture depending on a week's wages, but it is not all right for the farm worker who has only what he gets at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>I was born and reared in the country. I negotiated with farmers for many years.  The one reason why the Agricultural Wages Board did not effect very much was because many farmers did not and still do not pay reasonable wages and take no account of what the wage is set at.  But there are thousands of workers employed in agriculture who are paid what the farmer likes to call the standard wage.  He does not refer to it as a minimum wage, but as the standard wage, that being the lowest amount which the law will allow him to pay the worst worker he employs. He expects the worker to be happy with that.  Perhaps I am wrong and misrepresenting the employing farmers. Perhaps they will be anxious to have the necessary arrangements made to give the increase.  If so, they should bring the matter to the notice of their representatives on this board, because as it stands at present their representatives are speaking with two tongues: while on the Employer-Labour Conference they make one case and they <Col N="1532" /> make an entirely different case before the joint labour committee which fixes agricultural workers wages.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident that this increase must be granted and that can only be done by having this Bill become law.  The farmers are guaranteed prices under the price fixing procedure of the common agricultural policy of the EEC under Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome.  This is a mandatory transfer of income to farmers from other sections of the Community.  This massive transfer of income was of the order of 48 per cent in 1975; 13 per cent in 1976 and 39 per cent in 1977, according to information furnished to the House by the Taoiseach on 31 May 1978 as reported in the Official Report at column 241.  If the farmers were unable to pay the increase there might be some argument in favour of the Government refusing to accept the Bill but under no circumstances can farmers now say that they are unable to pay the increases which are the floor increases I mentioned.  In fact, farm prices are fixed under the common agricultural policy at a level which would enable persons employed in agriculture to receive the industrial wage in the area concerned.  Therefore, a function of the Agricultural Joint Labour Committee would be to fix wages at a level which would have the the effect of transferring to agricultural workers from farmers' incomes a sum of money equivalent to the yearly, weekly, or hourly industrial wage.  The farmers are in no position to refuse to pay it while their prices are fixed so that an efficient farmer is deemed to be given an income through prices sufficient to enable his income to be of the same order as industrial wages after payment of expenses.</P>
    <P>If farmers' representatives refuse to transfer to agricultural workers the money that has been awarded to them in the price fixing structure so that they could afford the industrial level of wages to employees, some other action will have to be taken.  I should hate to see that happen, but the situation is very serious.  It may not be known but there has been a sharp decline in the number of paid agricultural workers in recent years.  Machinery <Col N="1533" /> is replacing men and women.  When I hear people talk of full employment I wonder if they do not have their tongues in their cheeks because the more modern machinery is introduced the more people are left on the labour exchange.  This is as true of agriculture as of anything else.  In 1975 there were 21,100 permanent agricultural workers in the country; in 1976 the figure was 17,400.  This information was furnished to the House by the Taoiseach on 13 June 1978.</P>
    <P>In proposing this Bill we are not farmer-bashing.  The object of the common agricultural policy is to enable persons engaged in agriculture to obtain an income comparable to the local industrial wage.  In sponsoring this Bill we do not object to a farmer who works an efficient holding for 280 days or 2,380 hours in a year from receiving the industrial wage after payment of expenses.  But an agricultural worker should also be paid the average industrial wage, and, if farmers through their representative organisations decide to confiscate the employee's share of the transferred farm income, steps will have to be taken to question the level of farm prices fixed for our farmers under the common agricultural policy.  Agricultural employers must realise that they cannot be allowed to confiscate their employees' share of the massive increases in income transferred to agriculture under the mandatory price-fixing system.  Incidentally, the word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; does not appear in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The facts are as stated.  A mistake was made when the Bill was going through the House.  There is a difference of opinion as to whether the mistake was the responsibility of the people then in office or of the advice they got. That is a matter for which the Minister must take responsibility and I am sure he is prepared to do that.  No matter who was at fault, whether a miscalculation occurred and people thought that certain things which did occur could not occur, I do not know; but the situation now is that, unless this Bill is passed, the second increase of the national wage agreement will be almost due and may in fact be <Col N="1534" /> due before the first increase is paid. That is a ridiculous situation.  It would be terribly unfair if we allowed such a situation to continue.</P>
    <P>Because of my long time in this House I know that Government dislike having to introduce short amendments to Acts that have been passed as recently as a few years back.  In spite of that, this is a very important matter and therefore, to be fair to the agricultural workers, we should now agree to accept this Bill.  But if the Minister is prepared to agree that a similar Bill will be introduced by the Government&mdash;I do not care who introduces it&mdash;I am prepared to accept that.  You cannot get arrears of wages over a period; you cannot make an order fixing wages back six months for farm workers.  It is not possible to operate in that way and because of that I ask that something be done now.  If something concrete is offered by tomorrow evening, we on this side of the House would be perfectly satisfied to accept that.  If that is not being done we shall insist that the Bill be put to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>:  I would like to lend my voice to asking the Government and the Minister to ensure that the lowest paid workers in our society get their just rights.  I am very interested in this Labour Party Bill because I come from an area where there are many very large farmers and where agricultural workers have been working for these large farmers down through the years.  Indeed, I myself worked as an agricultural worker and so I am very familiar with the problems of these workers.  They have always been discriminated against.  They have always been the lowest paid workers in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago when the local authority implemented the Health Act the county manager told me he always picked the agricultural wage as the base for the issue of medical cards. Now I agree legislation has made some improvement in the lot of the agricultural worker; but, when anyone raises the question of the lot of the agricultural worker, the Minister <Col N="1535" /> asks: what should have been done? When the Minister was setting up the Joint Labour Committee for Agricultural Workers he spent all the time asking what should have been done. What is important now is what the Minister and his Government are going to do.  Asking what would someone else do is no solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Most agricultural workers have large families and £40 a week is no just wage for a man with a large family.  The previous Act was passed 32 years ago.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the two orders can be made next September and the worker will get the benefit of both of them in October.  To my way of thinking these men were due this increase in March last.  They are literally working on starvation wages. How would Members feel if they were asked to work for £40 a week or wait until next October for an increase?</P>
    <P>In the general election the Minister's party campaigned specifically on the ground that they were going to look after the lowest paid workers.  Here is an opportunity now for the Minister and his Government to implement that promise by giving these workers an immediate increase to enable them to maintain their wives and families. It is argued that the wage is a minimum one and no farmer is paying it now.  That may be so in some areas. In my area there is a fairly substantial employment of agricultural workers and they are all paid the standard wage.  They get overtime in dairying. Industrial and other workers also get overtime.  The Minister agrees agricultural workers are the lowest paid workers.  He also agrees there is something wrong.  What the last Minister did or did not do is not important. What is important is what the present Minister will do.  Will he give the agricultural worker the increase to which he is entitled immediately?  Next October will not do.  The waiting time can be prolonged.  Time has to be allowed for objections and variations. Arguments arise about different categories of workers.  Officials in the Department <Col N="1536" /> of Labour and the Joint Labour Committee are well aware how long the process can be.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister cannot see his way to accept this Bill designed to remove an anomaly that persists.  There is every ground for swift action.  If he would prefer to introduce his own Bill, well and good, provided it achieves what we want it to achieve.</P>
    <P>Agricultural workers are dedicated men.  They are skilled workers.  They operate very intricate machinery.  They are worth a great deal more than they receive.  It is said they have perquisites. I doubt if that is the case.  I know in my area I see these workers buying bottled milk.  I do not believe they have perquisities.  I am not out to attack farmers or anybody else.  I want to repeat what Deputy Tully said about the enormous increases we hear in regard to the green £ and so on. The effect of the green £on the agricultural worker is that he has to pay an extra 6½p on a pound of butter and an increase in the price of milk. That is the only benefit I see to farm workers from the EEC.  It is about time we as a Legislature had a look at this.</P>
    <P>I have always advocated a fair distribution among the agricultural community. I believe the farm worker is as necessary to agricultural structure as the farmer.  He is doing a very good job but is precluded from any of the benefits which accrue to the farming community.  The Minister may justify his case by saying this person did not do this or that, but that is not important.  What is important to these people is what the Minister and the Government are prepared to do now. If they are not prepared to accept this Bill they should substitute one for it. I assume that this House will soon adjourn for the summer recess.  If the Government do not accept this Bill a grave social injustice will be done to a minority, depressed section&mdash;the lowest paid workers in our community.  That is something we should not be proud of.  There are only a few days left to pass this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that this anomaly exists and that it can be got <Col N="1537" /> over by legislation.  He mentioned a commission.  Many years ago I heard of a British Prime Minister who, when he wanted to get a thing out of the way indefinitely, said he would set up a commission.  That was the surest way of doing nothing for a number of years. I am more afraid of a commission &mdash;the word the Minister used&mdash;than a committee.  This commission will investigate and try to bring together all the legislation in the Department of Labour.  In my view that commission is the Minister's way of putting away a distasteful article, that is a way of saying something is being done when nothing is being done.</P>
    <P>This case is urgent.  If we do not do something we will be condemning the lowest paid workers in our society to wait until October, November or possibly December to get what they were due last March.  If we do not pass this legislation we should let these workers know that we in this House have no interest in their welfare.</P>
    <P>This is not a very big political issue. The number of farm workers is diminishing. We hear a lot about progress in agriculture.  We talk about land structures and the many millions that have been spent over the years improving land.  The small farmers, for whom I have great sympathy, do not employ labourers.  The people who employ agricultural workers are substantial farmers who are making a good living and who are well off.  I live in a grain growing area and that is my experience because the farmers there are fairly big.  We have small farmers too but they do not employ labourers.  They work the farms themselves with their families.  There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the people who employ agricultural workers are considered substantial earners and providers of capital.  They can go to the bank managers to get plenty of money to buy more land.  Some of these people pay their tax under a notional system but there is no notional system for the unfortunate low paid worker.  He pays on the nail through PAYE.</P>
    <P>If the Government do not accept this Bill we will be depriving these workers of the balance due since 1 March.  I would have no more to say <Col N="1538" /> about this Bill if the Minister accepted it or if he agreed to introduce and pass all Stages of a similar Bill before the summer recess.  That Bill would resolve all the problems that exist in this area.  As I said, to stand here talking about an injustice to a small section of the community is not a political ploy.  The Minister admitted that there are low paid workers and that there is an anomaly.  I say to him, in the name of God put that right.  Either accept this Bill or introduce a similar one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>:  I am not satisfied with the reply given by the Minister in response to my opening remarks. He has not put forward any hope of this problem being resolved although he admits that there is a problem.  I am not trying to lay the blame for the situation on any administration.  It is poor consolation to the workers concerned to be told merely that this legislation has been in existence for the past 33 years.  Deputy Tully spoke for all of us on this side when he said that the question of who would introduce the Bill to eradicate this anomaly was a matter of indifference, that all that mattered was that the situation should be put right.  There is not a big job involved for the Minister in solving the problem.  It is merely a matter of repealing a subsection of the Act concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to a recommendation from the EEC to the effect that in view of the changing circumstances in the agricultural industry, the role of the agricultural worker should be updated and given proper recognition.  Agriculture is our prime industry.  We accept fully the tremendous effect that membership of the EEC has had on our economy <i>vis-á-vis</i> that industry.  We are very pleased that this has happened.  In my constituency there are many small farmers who for years struggled to make a living and who at last are now enjoying the fruits of their work.  It is accepted by the farming organisations that the agricultural worker has contributed in no small way to today's viable agricultural industry.  But the day has gone when the farm worker <Col N="1539" /> had to milk large numbers of cows by hand and fodder cattle in the fields, working very long hours in the process.  Today's farm worker is expected to know a fair deal about such items as the different types of fertiliser and so on.  He must have some knowledge, too, of machinery.  It is our duty as legislators to take every step possible to ensure that he is appreciated and that his worth is acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister admits that there exists the anomaly we are seeking to have removed.  I cannot see any problem in his accepting the Bill or, alternatively, of bringing in a Bill himself to deal with the situation.  He has not given a reason for not accepting the Bill.  However, should he decide to bring in an appropriate Bill tomorrow evening we would welcome it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of a commission sitting on industrial relations.  In this context &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; is the operative word.  In my many years in public life, whether at local authority level or otherwise I have known how long such commissions can take to report.  We are <Col N="1540" /> not doing justice to the farm worker by suggesting that the anomaly we are talking of should be a matter for referral to a commission, a commission which the Minister said might not report until 1979.  I admire him for his honesty but early 1981 might be nearer the mark.  Perhaps it could even be a subject for the Minister's next manifesto.  We would hope not but it is adding insult to injury to suggest that this matter which should be dealt with without delay be referred to a commission.</P>
    <P>Early this year the Government told us consistently of the need for a national pay agreement.  At that time the Minister for Economic Planning and Development was given a good deal of time on television and in the press to advocate the need for such an agreement which, he told us, would be for the benefit of our economy and of our people as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The figure of 272 farmers relates only to situations where land vacated by farmers under the farmers retirement scheme is available for re-distribution.  I am satisfied that a far greater number of small farmers could benefit, by way of improved incomes, from receiving additional land.  While potential development farmers with land requirements have priority access to lands surrendered under the retirement scheme, they are also considered for lands available for distribution by the Land Commission in the normal way.  As I indicated in my statement in the Dáil on the introduction of the Land Bond Bill, 1978, I am currently examining all aspects of land policy with a view to presenting new legislative proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the 40 price increase recommendations made by the National Prices Commission in the period 1 May 1978 to 31 May 1978 and approved by me is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The price increase recommendation referred to in the second part of the Deputy's question was in respect of an application by the Irish Bakery and Confectionery Trades Association for an increase in the price of bread.  I have approved of the commission's recommendation of price increases of ½p per 400 gram loaf and <i>pro rata</i> for other sizes and I have given effect to the increases at the retail level in a new Maximum Prices (Bread) Order operative from 16 June 1978.</P>
