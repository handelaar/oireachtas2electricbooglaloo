      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That it is expedient that a Joint Committee (which shall be called the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies) consisting of 7 members of the Dáil and 4 members of the Seanad (none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Minister of State) be appointed to examine the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities referred to in Schedule A hereto and the trading and/or commercial aspects of the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of the State-sponsored body referred to in Schedule B hereto and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas and make recommendations where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  That, after consultation with the Joint Committee, the Minister for the Public Service with the agreement of the Minister for Finance may include from time to time the names of further State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities in the Schedules <Col N="1142" /> and, with the consent of the Joint Committee and the Minister for Finance, may delete from the Schedules the names of any bodies which he considers no longer to be State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities.</P>
    <P>(3)  That, if so requested by a State-sponsored body, the Joint Committee shall refrain from publishing confidential information regarding the body's activities and plans.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Joint Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular enquiries.</P>
    <P>(5)  That the Joint Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
    <P>(6)  That all questions in the Joint Committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>
    <P>(7)  That the Joint Committee shall have power to print and publish from time to time minutes of evidence taken before it together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(8)  That every report which the Joint Committee proposes to make under this Order shall on adoption by the Joint Committee be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(9)  That 4 members of the Committee shall form a Quorum of whom at least I shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and at least 1 shall be a member of Seanad Éireann.</P>

    <P>I do not intend to spend too much of the House's time going over matters which have already been discussed at length a fairly short time ago.  The motion before the House provides for the reconstitution of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored bodies which lapsed on the dissolution of the previous Dáil.</P>
    <P>I should say at the outset that the present motion is substantially the same as the one which was passed by both Houses late in 1976.  A number of minor, mainly technical, amendments have been incorporated in the present <Col N="1144" /> motion to take account of developments which have occured since the original committee was established.  I shall be giving details of the amendments, and the reasons why they are being made, later.</P>
    <P>The essential reason why the Government have decided not to make any major changes in the joint committee's terms of reference at this stage is that the previous committee had little or no opportunity of getting off the ground; it had not got beyond considering procedural matters.  There was, in the event, little opportunity to see how the committee would perform its task within its existing terms of reference. The Government have, therefore, decided that the best way of determining whether any substantial alterations should be made to the committee's terms of reference would be to observe how it works in practice under its original terms of reference with slight modifications.</P>
    <P>While it may not be necessary to do so, I would like to emphasise that the Government's decision to re-establish the committee should not be interpreted as a criticism of State-sponsored bodies.  On the contrary, we are very conscious of the important work done by State-sponsored bodies and their contribution to national, economic, and social progress.  Because of this widely held view, the State-sponsored bodies, I am sure, recognise that they have nothing to fear from a closer relationship with Parliament.  Indeed, I think it would be worth mentioning in this connection that a number of chief executives of State-sponsored bodies have expressed the view that they would welcome parliamentary review of their organisations' activities in the interest of better understanding of their role and functions and of stemming possible inaccurate and uninformed criticism of them.</P>
    <P>The whole State-sponsored body area of Government is now very large. In the period since 1927, when the first State-sponsored bodies were established, there has been an enormous growth in their number and scale of operation; by reason of the numbers of people and the capital they employ and the size of their output of goods <Col N="1145" /> and services, they now play a major role in the national economy.  Yet these bodies have not been established as part of any grand design; instead, they have been established as solutions to particular problems as they arose. It might be worth while, therefore, if the committee began its work by considering whether any general principles should govern its examination of the State-sponsored bodies.  This might be a more satisfactory and ultimately more productive approach than to become involved too quickly in the examination of specific bodies.  However, its procedures will be a matter for the committee itself and I am sure that all worth-while approaches to its task will be considered.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out on several occasions in the past that the demands on the time and energies of Deputies and Senators are already very great. To help them make the best use of the time which they will have available to devote to the work of the committee, it is essential that the committee should have available to it a good secretariat to sift through and analyse relevant data.  My predecessor undertook to make available resources of his Departments to help the committee in every way possible.  I can do no better than to pledge the same.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the motion before the House differs in several minor respects from that passed late in 1976.  The first is that an alteration has been made which will formalise the practice which has developed of calling the committee &ldquo;the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies&rdquo; by incorporating this title in the motion.</P>
    <P>The second is the omission of the reference to &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; and the substitution of the term &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo;.  This change is obviously necessary because of the passing of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No.2) Act, 1977, which established the office of Minister of State and abolished that of Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>The changes in paragraphs 5 and 6 relate to the election of a chairman of the committee and deal with the <Col N="1146" /> resolution of questions in the committee by vote.  These changes are in line with those adopted for all other joint committees pending the revision of the Standing Orders of the House.</P>
    <P>Some misgivings have been expressed about the previous committee's inability to publish information or documentation on receipt, or disseminate documents other than those given to it.  To rectify this, the committee's powers are being suitably extended in paragraphs 7 and 8 to permit it to publish what it deems fit, subject to the qualification that the committee may not publish material if a State-sponsored body so requests on the grounds that publication of confidential information would be injurious to its business or commercial interests. In addition, the committee will now not have to wait until a report is presented to the Oireachtas to publish information but may do so at any time.</P>
    <P>The final change is that the Diary Disposal Company Limited has been removed from Schedule A of the bodies to be examined as it is in the process of winding up its affairs and its commercial involvement is now practically negligible.</P>
    <P>The Government are firmly convinced of the merit of parliamentary review of State-sponsored bodies.  The commercial bodies which this committee will examine are creations of Parliament and, though they need a great measure of independence from rigid control to innovate and expand, they must ultimately be subject to a degree of public accountability through the machinery of Parliament.  The desire that State-sponsored bodies be accountable to Parliament has often been expressed over the years both in this House and elsewhere.  At last the potential for an effective response to the question is at hand.  The committee, if it functions well&mdash;and I have no doubt that it will&mdash;can help Parliament to steer State-sponsored bodies more closely in the direction it wishes them to proceed.  It can also enable the bodies to enlist parliamentary understanding and support for the activities which they pursue and the problems which they face and more <Col N="1147" /> sympathetic public appreciation of their role and their difficulties.  Better harmonisation and closer communication between the aims and aspirations of the citizen, Parliament and State-sponsored bodies cannot but be in the interests of national progress, of democracy and the democratic process itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am glad to see this committee being set up again.  It might appear extraordinary to people outside this House and outside this country that it has taken various Governments over 50 years to have some overseeing role by Parliament on a very significant sector of the economy.  That we had to wait 50 years is, I suppose, a reflection on the people in this House, but it is a very desirable measure.</P>
      <P>Schedule A of the motion is a most formidable list of extensive commercial undertakings who have served the country well during the past 50 years. They were all set up at different times.</P>
      <P>Since I became a Member of this House, and particularly since I was Minister for Transport and Power&mdash; many of the companies we are discussing now come under the aegis of that Department&mdash;I have been disappointed at the level of debate here on State-sponsored bodies when the Estimate for the Department was being discussed. I thought that Deputies from all sides did not address themselves to the role, the contribution or the effect on the economy of the board in question but instead were grasping at small points of irritation.  When in Government I was very keen that this committee should be set up because I thought it would be a tremendous help and benefit to Members of the Oireachtas to have a closer understanding of the difficulties encountered by the semi-State bodies in their daily operations and in their long-term aims.  At that time I welcomed the establishment of the committee and I welcome now the reintroduction of the motion to re-establish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am somewhat puzzled that we have a debate on the motion. My understanding is that this committee is similar to the Public Accounts <Col N="1148" /> Committee and to other committees that are re-established at each new Dáil.  All that happens there is that the members appointed are named in this House and the setting up of the committee does not involve a debate. I do not know why the situation should be different in this case.  As the Minister for the Public Service has said, some technical changes have been made.  There is the addition of Gaeltarra Éireann in Schedule B that was not in the original motion but when the Minister was on this side of the House he urged that that company be included.  It is reasonable enough that he should make the change now. Deputies may have differing views on whether a State-sponsored body should be included.  However, a start has been made as I understand the committee have met on two occasions.  A secretariat has been established and the committee have been given permission to employ an accountant to help them in their work.</P>
    <P>When the debate on this committee took place a few years ago there was strong pressure that the policy of the company should be subject to examination by the committee.  Quite rightly this was resisted because it was felt that the policy was that of the Minister of the day and that the application of that policy to the affairs of the company would be examined retrospectively by the committee.  I presume the Minister for the Public Service will agree now that a member of the Opposition should chair the committee because that was the major point in his contribution on the previous occasion.  At that time it was pointed out that this committee was similar to the Public Accounts Committee and, by tradition, that has always been chaired by a member of the Opposition. I presume he will now agree on this point.</P>
    <P>Possibly because they have been so successful I do not think that the public or Members of this House have appreciated the contribution made to the economy by State-sponsored bodies.  The companies set out in Schedule A are the largest undertakings in the country and I am sure that their assets must be £1,000 million. <Col N="1149" /> That is an enormous investment.  They do not infringe on the private sector and are not in competition with companies in that area in most cases, except perhaps the Irish Life Assurance Company.  That was not on the original list but it is now included and it is right that it should be.</P>
    <P>From time to time many of our State-sponsored bodies have appeared to adopt attitudes that did not seem to people near to them but not of them to be conducive to the good of the company or the economy.  Many of the boards of these companies would argue that they should be allowed absolute freedom in the conduct of the affairs of their organisation.  That is a false idea of the role of the board.  They are not an absolutely free commercial enterprise but are there as nominees of the Minister to do what he desires. However, a too close security or a Minister who drives a board on too tight a rein may not get the best from the board or the company.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that the Minister for the Public Service did not refer to the present position of salaries of the chief executives of these companies.  I should have thought he would have something to say about the present controversy and the statements made by former chief executive officers with regard to salaries.  There is always a conflict here.  These are not private companies and the boards are not free to the same extent as boards elected by shareholders of a private company to decide internal matters in the company. The object of making the companies semi-State bodies or whatever term may be used, was to allow them a freedom they would not have if they were directly under the Minister or his Department.  How much freedom should the Minister allow his nominees on that board to run their affairs?  It is obvious, if they want to live up to the responsibilities placed on them by the Minister of operating as near commercially as possible, taking into account their different circumstances, that they will have to pay salaries to their chief executives at a level parallel to that in the private sector.  They will have to pay those salaries if they want to attract people from the private <Col N="1150" /> sector.  I believe it would be very valuable for people in the private sector to spend some time in the State-sponsored bodies and then go back to private industry.  If they want to prevent private industry robbing from them some of the very great talent there is in State-sponsored bodies and if they do not want private industry to attract those people away with higher salaries the salaries paid to their chief executive officers must match those in the private sector.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are men working for the State-sponsored bodies who are not motivated by money alone and who enjoy the challenge of a State-sponsored body, who feel that it is a patriotic thing to help build up one of those bodies to compete around the world.  Aer Lingus and Bord Failte are particularly relevant in this regard but they are not on the list.  How do you strike the balance?  The Devlin Report in the early 1970s tried to strike the balance.  It appears obvious from the comments of some people in the last few months that the level of salary laid down by Devlin is not in the eyes of a few chief executives in semi-State bodies high enough.  It is a pity that in one case the Minister found it necessary, if newspaper reports are correct, to cut the salary of the chief executive in question.  A salary of £12,000 a year would appear to be very high to some people.  That company are essentially a banking company and that chief executive officer has responsibility for putting through the company every year vast sums of money.  Would the salary of some person in a similar position in a private bank be higher than £12,000? Would this man's obvious ability be worth more than that sum to private interests?  Is there a danger that he and the quality of the firm he had built up over the last few years might now be lost to this company because of the level of salary?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a difficult job in deciding the level people should be paid at in semi-State bodies.  If he fixes the salary of the chief executive officer and does not fix the salaries of those under him there is a possibility that the second rank officer or the third <Col N="1151" /> rank officer may earn more than the chief executive officer who, in the final analysis, has to carry responsibility as far as the board are concerned.  I do not know how a system can be devised which is fair to the chief executive officer so that it gives him a salary sufficient to retain his services and still recognises that he is not working in the private sector and that the board who pay him that salary are not as free to make decisions in this regard as the boards of private companies.  I am not sure if everybody accepts the salary levels in the Devlin Report relating to 1972 and that at that stage they were correct.  I believe those salaries need updating more regularly than has been done.  The understanding was that they would get the basic salary of the 1972 level and that various wage rounds would be added on.  This may seem fair but the value and importance of companies in the semi-State sector may have changed over that period and the salaries of the chief executive officers may need revision at more frequent intervals.</P>
    <P>The board of a semi-State company are in a dilemma in this regard.  They recognise the value of the man they have because they have very close relations with him, much closer than the Minister who may or may not know him.  They have the affairs of that company at their fingertips and they may, apart from the fear of him being enticed away from them, know what is being offered to him.  What are they to do in a situation like that? They should go to their Minister and discuss the matter with him.  I do not know how many companies have gone to their Ministers and if ways have been found around paying those officers who were quite exceptional and whom the boards felt they could not operate without retaining their services: I believe the wrong thing to do is what happened last Sunday when the Minister threatened the members of those boards on the radio.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the Minister and the board of a company under his control and through them the staff of that company, is delicate.  It can be frequently difficult because the particular <Col N="1152" /> company may unintentionally embarrass the Minister.  The board may feel as they were entrusted with the responsibility by the Minister, they are entitled to pursue a course which the Minister may not fully agree with.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be continuous tension between the Minister and the chairman of a board under his control as he may get the best results that way. But that should be a private tension of a nature that can be thrashed out between the Minister and that chairman at regular intervals in the privacy of the Minister's office.  To threaten members of boards, as the Minister did last Sunday, does no service&mdash;indeed I would go so far as to say is no credit to the Minister&mdash;to a group of people who are devoting far more time to the boards of companies of which they are directors than their remuneration would warrant.  I think £800 a year is about the level of directors' fees paid on most of the State boards here.  This involves people coming from all parts of the country, neglecting their own businesses, 12, maybe more, times a year for full days.  Of course a lot of these people feel very honoured to be appointed to these boards.  But, having got over the euphoria of their appointment, many of them settle down and make extremely valuable contributions to the operations of those companies, bringing their experience in the private sector, giving it virtually free of charge except for the £800 directors' fees they receive.  Many of the companies on this list would not be as successful were it not for this outside expertise which has been made available to the State for a pittance.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to threaten them as he did on Sunday last&mdash;I think the words he used were that he would have to take further action; I am not sure if he went so far as to say that he would have to fire them if they did not obey his guidelines&mdash;may be understandable and perhaps is something a Minister would have to do if a board continued deliberately to flout his intentions and directions; but it is not something which these people, who for very small amounts of money give a lot of their time to the country, should <Col N="1153" /> hear on the radio on a Sunday afternoon for the first time.  Perhaps I am wronging the Minister in this and, if so, he will correct me.  Perhaps he has seen the boards of all of these companies and told them that this is his attitude.  I do not know, but I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong in that.  The Minister has a real problem here which he should approach in a sympathetic and I hope, from the boards' point of view, understanding way.  The boards themselves have a real problem : how do they hold on to their chief executives at salary levels many people would consider were much lower than those of a person doing a comparable job in the private sector?</P>
    <P>This new joint committee will be extremely time-consuming for the Deputies and Senators on it.  They will need a reasonably large number of professional assistants to help them in their work.  But I would hope that the Deputies and Senators who find themselves lucky enough to be on it&mdash;and I would say lucky enough to be appointed to this committee because it will give them a great chance of learning a tremendous amount about very important companies here&mdash;will not allow these professional assistants do more than provide them with professional assistance and will not allow those professionals to take over what should be the work of the committee of ordinary people elected to this House, with ordinary common sense:</P>
    <P>...to examine the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities referred to in Schedule A...</P>
    <P>Many people would hold that as well as the reports and accounts their actual policies&mdash;although as I said I do not agree with that point of view&mdash; should be examined.  The Minister is correct when he says we must first see how this committee operates before we make any further change that may become necessary.  I totally accept that point of view, that we are dealing with something new and there may be problems we may be able to see more clearly in two or three years' time.  I <Col N="1154" /> would guess that there is two or three years' work in that list.  When they have gone through that list for the first time we may be able to see more clearly what are the problems involved and what changes may be necessary in the motion to give Members of the Dáil and Seanad a better chance (a) to learn more themselves and (b) to be of help to the executives of the boards of these State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>There is one point on which I should like clarification from the Minister and which I do not understand. Paragraph (7) of the motion says:</P>
    <P>That the Joint Committee shall have power to print and publish from time to time minutes of evidence taken before it together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>In his introductory remarks the Minister says they can do this prior to the reports being laid before the Oireachtas.  I do not understand the necessity for that or what situation is envisaged in which the committee might feel they need to put evidence taken before them before it comes officially to this House as a report to the Oireachtas.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me what is the thinking behind this or why this paragraph was included in the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: On behalf of my party I welcome this motion.  I regret the very long delay in having this joint committee established.  That has been the responsibility of successive Governments. We have been talking in this House now for nearly five years about the setting up of this committee.  We had intensive discussions among the Party Whips early in 1975; finally in 1976 we brought forward terms of reference which were debated extensively in the House and I do not propose to go back over that debate.  After 11 months of consideration by the present Government finally we have this committee being established.  I hope it will get down to work rapidly because there is a serious need for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of the State-sponsored bodies concerned have in varying ways made a unique contribution to the economic and social development of the nation. There are 26 bodies involved, large <Col N="1155" /> employers, now employing between them some 40,000 workers.  I would hope that the members of the committee would envisage for themselves a totally different role from that of the Dáil Committee on Public Accounts. If the committee, the seven Dáil Deputies and the four Senators, regard their role as a purely routine one of routine examination and routine bromide observations back to the Dáil on the accounts and operations of these bodies there really would not be much point in setting up the committee. Parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary report can very easily slip into a comfortable groove of routine meetings, routine examination and routine reports in which case it will not produce much of any value in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I would hope a more positive role would be adopted.  I would hope that the committee would confront the senior executives of the State-sponsored bodies concerned and inquire from them as to their plans for expansion.  It is quite obvious the committee will not be able to meet all the bodies every year.  I would hope it would select some of the keen and interested State-sponsored bodies initially and get down to work with them and I would hope, as a result of the experience of Deputies and Senators and the expert staff we hope to see working with the committee, that the committee could look forward to expanding the role of the State-sponsored bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>There is need now for development in the context of the mixed economy about which I spoke yesterday on the Finance Bill.  It is important to examine the way in which public and private enterprise can sustain each other and can expand together over the next decade in order to provide jobs.  The task will be to tease out new forms of co-operation between these bodies and private enterprise and the Administration itself so that new structures will contribute to the thrust forward of industrial and natural resources development. Many countries have found excellent ways of involving their parliamentarians in this type of work. <Col N="1156" /> The French have done it successfully. There is in France a tremendous liaison between the public and private sector. The Italians, despite all the strictures on them, have done it successfully.  The Austrians have been outstandingly successful.  So have the Swedes.  All have found mechanisms designed for mutual aid and co-operation between the public and the private sectors.  I would make that a key role of the committee.</P>
    <P>There is the kind of attitude that one needs business people in the private sector.  Some rant and rave about the public sector and say the Dáil should examine the work of CIE, Aer Lingus and the tourist board.  The argument seems to be that the restrictive hand of parliamentary scrutiny should be imposed on State-sponsored bodies.  I do not share that view.  Our job is not only to scrutinise but also to give great encouragement to a leap forward in general development.  I see no contradiction in setting up this committee and working with it.  I see no contradiction in the Government fostering enterprise at all levels.  Our job is to ensure that State-sponsored enterprises will make a decisive contribution to job creation.</P>
    <P>We should be acutely aware that there is not much scope in State-sponsored manufacturing industry.  Only about 5,000 or 6,000 workers are actually engaged in the manufacturing sector which is constituted of public utilities in one form or another.  They, of course, perform a crucial and valuable role but in the years ahead, certainly in relation to the development of natural resources, such as oil, gas and minerals, I would hope to see the State-sponsored manufacturing sector expand and develop and I would hope to see this committee showing an interest in that area.  There is no reason why State enterprises should be confined to what might be called unprofitable areas in which social needs have to be satisfied and in which non-commercial considerations will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>I do not regard the setting up of this committee as a constraining influence on the public sector enterprises because <Col N="1157" /> I hope to see this committee encourage these enterprises into making a fuller contribution to economic life.  Many of our State companies have shown great imagination and have been quite efficient in discharging their statutory role but there is a regrettable tendency in public debate on State enterprises to publicise those which have operated at a loss or are in a deficit situation.  One hears little about the tremendous work done by Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, the ESB, Irish Shipping, the B &amp; I and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  All these have made great strides.  Unfortunately there are always those who are anti-State enterprises.  I suppose it stems from the days when people were suspicious of State involvement.  There is a tendency to harp on CIE, a State enterprise which must of necessity operate in a social context.</P>
    <P>I would hope to see many of these enterprises being given a great push forward by this committee.  I would hope the committee would not become bogged down in an examination of accounts and general accountability to the State as a whole.  There should be no selective preoccupation.  The companies I have mentioned all have outstanding records.  They have satisfied their minimum statutory requirements and at the same time, they have expanded into wider fields.  Unfortunately, in the manufacturing sector, there are about six public enterprises employing about 6,000 people or 3 per cent of all manufacturing employment. Therefore, there is great scope for this committee to go into the commercial activities of these State bodies and to encourage them to develop along those lines.  The committee can do a great deal of work from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Outside bodies such as consumer organisations and trade unions who organise employment substantially in semi-State bodies will have an opportunity of putting their views before Parliament, through this committee, in relation to the activities of these bodies.  They have never had that opportunity.  In the past their only opportunity was to go directly to the Minister.  On many occasions we get residents' associations and other <Col N="1158" /> national organisations who have strong views about the role of semi-State bodies, and they can now come to the Joint Committee in relation to the 26 bodies specified and make their views known.  This will be a form of extension of democracy.  In that way we can have regular consultations with, say the trade unions who work in that sector.</P>
    <P>There will be a need for criticism in relation to certain of those bodies.  For example, if the committee had been set up 11 months ago and if I had been in a position to serve on the committee, as a member of Dublin County Council and Dáil Éireann I would have had an opportunity to ask the NBA about the collapse of a major firm in the construction industry.  I would have asked that they be brought in and we could have inquired what the agency had done about that.  That is a legitimate area of scrutiny.</P>
    <P>RTE are another body included.  It would be interesting to hear from the senior executives of that organisation what the current situation is regarding the second channel.  This is an area of overall policy which in terms of operational results comes within the terms of reference of the new committee.  In my ten years of work in the House I have never had an opportunity to talk to senior executives of the VHI, for instance.  I should like to hear their views on the development of the health services.  Now we can have them before the committee.  The Government are about to announce by way of a Green Paper, without any public inquiry, the go ahead to a nuclear power plant.  If the committee had been in operation during the past couple of years we would have had an opportunity to discuss with the ESB the role they envisage for nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the assurance by the Minister that sufficient staff will be provided for the committee.  In regard to the original proposal to set up the committee there was a serious problem in this respect.  As the House is aware, a secretary was appointed but further staff will be required.  For instance, the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities have an administrative staff composed of a secretary and two <Col N="1159" /> assistants at senior clerk level.  For this committee we will be asking the Minister, in consultation with the Civil Service Executive Union, to sanction additional staff.</P>
    <P>The committee will be imposing on the day-to-day work of Deputies and Senators, but I am increasingly depressed at the large number of Opposition and Government Deputies who do not make any contribution virtually to the day-to-day running of the Dáil and the work of Dáil Committees.  It seems to be a fact of life that about half of the Members of the House spend 90 per cent of their time exclusively involved in constituency work.  The extent to which they come in here and offer to sit on committees and do the work for which they were appointed by the electorate is a matter of profound regret.  I have always felt strongly about this.  A Deputy has to take a conscious decision to ration his time between his constituency and his domestic life.  In relation to a large number of Deputies, constituency work predominates.  I hope this committee will give the 11 members of the Oireachtas an opportunity to make a contribution.  We have Deputies with wide experience and talent who can make a distinct contribution to the work of this committee.  I therefore look forward to the committee being set up rapidly and getting down to work before the summer recess.  We have a secretary already appointed and there should not be much difficulty in convening the committee in a matter of a couple of weeks and the laying out of future strategy.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the chairmanship of the committee. Although I share the views of Deputy Barry, I recall a flaming row I had in my own party during the last Dáil when I suggested that we should allow Fianna Fáil to have the chair of a committee.  I was eaten alive.  The outcome was that the chairmanship went to the Government of the day.</P>

Whether it is the chairmanship of the Nationalised Industries Committee of the House of Commons or the equivalent committees in France or Sweden, the Opposition chair such bodies.

      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;that he should agree the Opposition would chair this committee?  I recall the work of Deputy de Valera as Opposition Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, and the work of distinguished Members of the House, particularly Fine Gael, on that committee. I always felt it was a useful exercise to have a Member of the Opposition as chairman.  We have continued that practice in the EEC Joint Committee.  I suggest we should do the same here.  I held that view when I belonged to a Government Party and I hold it still as a member of the Opposition, and I have no doubt that this time I will be overruled by Fianna Fáil who have 20 or 30 hungry backbenchers who want some status, and who am I to prevent them from having it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the motion to reactivate the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored bodies. In the past a great deal of time went into sorting out procedural matters and I trust this will all have been settled by now so that the committee, once established, will be enabled to get down to work urgently.  This is important at this time.  We have a tremendous task.  At the moment 50 per cent of our population are less than 25 years of age and among our EEC partners we have the highest level of youth unemployment with a percentage of 43.6, the average for the EEC as a whole being 36 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have debated frequently in recent times the problems we will be facing not only in the next few years. as is the case in the EEC, but for many years beyond that.  For the next 15 or 20 years we will have a large population <Col N="1161" /> of young people.  We have a very special problem here.</P>
    <P>I would like to give due credit and recognition to the Members of both sides of this House who in the past contributed to the establishment, running and working of the semi-State bodies as we know them today.  If we look back to those early years when the semi-State bodies were established, often after considerably heated debate, we see that these bodies have made a tremendous contribution to our economy and the life of the country. In many respects we may disagree with them in their present shape and form, we may have points to raise about them, we may criticise them in one way or another, but in my view it is unquestionable that they have made a very considerable contribution to the development of our economy at a stage when this development was of great importance to us.</P>
    <P>When we look back we see that semi-State bodies have made a considerable contribution to this country. This raises the question of the future objectives of these bodies and what general principles should underline the areas of activity for these bodies. If we look at the areas of the involvement, we realise it is quite timely to review them.  Obviously, where a semi-State body has been functioning for ten, 15 or 20 years, there must come a time when the overall objectives and principles and consequently the broad strategies for these bodies must be reassessed.  In this respect the bodies themselves might frequently welcome such discussion and review.  The original brief given to any State body was given in the context of an existing economic and social situation.  Obviously our tasks, problems and targets of today differ considerably because of the development which has occurred in the interim period.  Consequently there must be areas in which semi-State bodies can make a contribution which, by virtue of their own rules and regulations, they might not feel that they are empowered to undertake.</P>
    <P>Two things come to mind immediately in the practical manufacturing and distribution spheres, and the <Col N="1162" /> sphere in which we can diversify the products and extend the operations of such bodies.  One obvious example is the whole question of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and their involvement in the manufacture of machinery, particularly machinery dealing with agriculture.  Over the years they have had some outstanding successes in their design and development of machinery largely initially for their own purposes but subsequently finding that such equipment and machinery was very much in demand elsewhere. They have developed considerable expertise in this area.  The question arises as to how far should such a company go in developing this expertise and in helping to create the jobs which could result from that.  Should they be involved in joint ventures in the private sector?  Should they be hiving off such activities to the private sector or should they go wholeheartedly into the development of these opportunities? These are the types of problems that can arise when a semi-State body has been in operation for a number of years under a particular brief or under the expected interpretation of that brief as may often be the case.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna were given the brief of raw material manufactures.  The provision of energy and fuel was one of their major tasks and they have done this in an outstanding way and have been copied by many other countries who are developing their peat resources.  Around the late fifties and early sixties they began to diversify some of their products particularly in the horticultural area, and to develop peat products of various kinds.  The question arose then as to what their brief was&mdash;it was principally raw material manufactures.  This is a problem I personally had because I was involved in the research area.  There was considerable heart-searching on their part as to whether they would use the new formulations which had been developed in the Agricultural Research Institute or if they would pass their raw material to the private sectors here, in England and elsewhere. These people would then develop the diversified consumer-type products which we all know well because in the <Col N="1163" /> interim period many companies have gone into that business and have used the basic information developed in this country.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of problem that arises for a semi-State body which has been in operation for some years.  The Oireachtas have a responsibility to give these bodies a clear-cut direction in this respect and to revise their briefs, if necessary.  If it is found by this committee that a revision of the brief is necessary to allow a semi-State body to pursue certain lines of action, it is very important that we do not hesitate to revise such brief.  I say this bearing in mind the enormous task the Minister is tackling.  I believe he can use this committee to give him further insights into the very complex activities which are now undertaken by the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>It is important that we speak to the people who are guiding and directing our semi-State bodies and ask them what obstacles there are to their development, what impediments there are particularly in relation to their briefs and what impediments there are in relation to risk-taking.  This is another area which will become very much a part of our lives and of our economy.  Unless we are prepared to take risks there is little prospect of us developing the number of jobs we desire.  In his budget the Minister gave the green light to risk-taking.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has done likewise, in relation to the enterprise development.  Nevertheless, when you consider semi-State bodies as a whole, the question of how far they should go in their risk-taking role is something they cannot determine so readily.  They must be given some backing.  Somebody must be prepared to take the responsibility ultimately because when we take risks we must have failures.  Unless we are prepared to have failures and to stand behind them, we will not achieve the goals we aim for.  In relation to risk-taking, the standards which have to apply to semi-State bodies could be examined critically.</P>
    <P>There are various other factors, such <Col N="1164" /> as the encouragement of mobility among some of the many well-skilled and trained staff in semi-State bodies into other sectors of the economy, because they have developed a tremendous pool of expertise.  There is the question of their marketing operations and functions which are crucial to the economy and the expansion of that role where feasible.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset there is the question of hiving off the functions of semi-State bodies where this is desirable. This is something we need to look at.  There will be a very great problem in starting people in young and new enterprises, especially young people. This is an area where semi-State bodies may have a particular contribution to make in assisting young people to become established, perhaps even to become established on their own, in the private sector.  The question of cooperating with the private sector is something which might well be reviewed. Fundamentally, we should not be looking at the role of semi-State bodies in the past but at how semi-State bodies might be altered to meet the challenges and targets of the 1980s.  This means that we must all face changing situations.  In this respect I welcome the motion to reactivate the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and I hope it will have a major impact on the development of our economy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the latitude given.  This motion has been fully debated so far.  I go along with what Deputy Peter Barry said in relation to the salaries of the chief executives of semi-State bodies.  There was considerable controversy in the last few weeks in relation to one person who had to take a serious cut in salary.  We must take into account that throughout the semi-State bodies there has been no productivity agreements or special pay awards for senior personnel.  These productivity agreements and special pay awards have been given to other people right across the board in semi-State bodies.  There has been blatant discrimination against senior officials and executives.  It must be put right and if the Devlin Report, as has been suggested by the former chief of Telefís Éireann has been put in the waste paper basket, that is the place for it.  If we are to retain our top management people in the semi-State bodies it is essential that a balance is restored and this is the responsibility of the Minister.  The Minister should be aware that a lot of senior officials are paying the top rate of income tax and that there has been a drop in their <Col N="1166" /> standard of living as compared with everybody else.  This is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Deputy Peter Barry referred to directors of semi-State bodies and I also spoke about that matter on the Agricultural Credit Bill when I dealt with directors' salaries in the semi-State bodies.  A person would have to be in a serious financial situation to accept a directorship in some of these bodies because the salary is only a mere pittance.  These salaries have never been kept in line with inflation. We have top-class people in the ACC, the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna, the ESB and so on and it is important to continue to get top-class people.  We must seriously try to ensure that the calibre of the directors is kept up and to this end the salaries situation must be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look into the role of our semi-State organisations.  We are all aware that in these organisations we have excellent management expertise that can hold their own with any management in Europe.  We have experts in technology, expert engineers, chemists, scientists and so on in all our semi-State bodies.  We have very high levels of investment in plant and equipment and we have excellent distribution networks in regard to sales from semi-State bodies.  We must realise that the semi-State bodies were set up a long time ago.  Looking at the advances they have made we are all agreed that they are capable of taking additional responsibility.  They are capable of taking on additional lines of production but the semi-State bodies have not the power to digress into different lines.  It is a great pity that the semi-State bodies are limited as to how far they can diversify.  Semi-State bodies have proved themselves commercially successful and have proved that they can orientate themselves towards different projects.  We in this House and in this committee must enable the semi-State bodies to diversify as much as possible.  It is important to look at some of the work of the semi-State bodies and to point out how successful they have been.  I admit that most of them have a monopoly situation which gives them a wide open <Col N="1167" /> field, but irrespective of that we must compliment some of our more successful bodies such as B &amp; I, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna which has continuously shown a profit over the years, the Sugar Company which has also shown a profit and the ESB which did not show a profit but which was successful in reducing the charges by 2½ per cent in January and there will be a 5 per cent reduction in charges in the next issue of accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The ESB did better than most in that they buried some of their profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: They have reduced their charges, which is important.  Over the years Bord na Móna have continuously shown a profit and so have many more of them.  When they are able to show profit in all this it indicates the talent that is available and this is most important.  We must try to achieve a situation of diversification. This is essential.  If, as an ordinary Deputy, I could make but one suggestion on this Bill it would be that the CEOs of each semi-State body should consider their own semi-State body and see where they can expand lines of production in conjunction with private enterprise.  I put this to the Minister and to each semi-State body. I do not know if this is a novel idea or whether the Minister or the semi-State bodies will agree with me but at this time when we are all talking about job creation there are two things that should be done&mdash;one, expand the terms of reference of semi-State bodies to enable them to diversify and two, every semi-State body should be charged with the responsibility of trying to expand their activities and co-operate with private enterprise to see if they can diversify and help private enterprise while private enterprise helps semi-State bodies.  This can be done because the expertise is there, the structure for distribution, plant and equipment and investment are already there. The technological manpower is there and the management expertise.  Now is the time to move ahead.  If the opportunity is lost now it may be lost forever. Therefore, it is incumbent on all <Col N="1168" /> of us to aim at achieving a situation of co-operation between private enterprise and semi-State bodies.  This is essential and it can be done : there can be a good mix of the two.</P>
      <P>May I give an example to the Minister and those in the semi-State bodies of what I have in mind?  There has been massive investment for years past, particularly in the past five or six years, in Bord na Móna in regard to engineering facilities which have been expanded considerably in the mechanical field.  They are still capable of further expansion.  Each year, as the Minister is aware, we are importing, according to statistics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: I shall certainly accept the Chair's ruling and I am not going into detail.  The figures are set out on page 33 of the <i>Trade Statistics of Ireland</i>.  They show we are importing each year a total of £82,294,000 of agricultural machinery comprising machines for preparing and cultivating the soil, harvesting, threshing, sorting, cream separation and so on.  On the other side, we are exporting a considerable amount also but overall we import more than we export.  Bord na Móna are capable of manufacturing machines.  They have manufactured draining and levelling machines for levelling bog surfaces, ditch-making machines and large discs for opening drains and so on.  In its own way this machinery is just as sophisticated and as difficult to make as any agricultural machinery.  Deputy Dr. Woods also dealt with this situation in regard to the Sugar Company in Carlow.  Some years ago they made beet harvesters on which they are to be complimented and, as the Chair who is personally involved in agriculture will be aware, they have succeeded in obtaining a ready market for the export of many machinery items.  This is brilliant enterprise on the part of our State bodies to be able to involve themselves in this <Col N="1169" /> kind of work.  It is exactly what I have in mind.</P>
      <P>I would hope the committee would be able to project ideas and encourage the expansion of the scope and expertise of different semi-State bodies to develop a process such as this by branching out into different lines.  With a proper mix of semi-State bodies and private enterprise this situation can be achieved.  Even if private enterprise is not agreeable about coming into this, I believe that Bord na Móna and the Sugar Company in their respective fields should be given power to diversify sufficiently to go into these projects on their own.  Manufacturing agricultural machinery may be a far cry from the purpose for which they were set up&mdash;and I am not specifying agricultural machinery; any type of machinery, electrical or mechanical but the potential is available; it is now only in the infant stage.  Derrinlough, Birr, is an example of what I have in mind where some of this machinery is being produced.  In all our semi-State bodies the scope, the ability and intelligence are present and where private enterprise for any reason fails to do the job, the committee investigating semi-State bodies should try to promote a situation of maximum employment and maximum involvement of people and maximum exports.  The potential is there if properly developed.  It will mean that the functions and aims of the semi-State bodies will have to be expanded but I think everybody would agree to that.</P>
      <P>On this subject there is one topic in the midlands at present that is very relevant.  I think it will be relevant in Deputy Callanan's constituency in a few years time, cut-away bog.</P>

As a committee we shall have to look at the structure of Bord na Móna to see if they have personnel qualified to examine the matter of cut-away bogs. It should be realised that we are talking about an area which is the equivalent in size of County Louth.</P>

      <P>: We are not permitted to discuss Bord na Móna or other semi-State bodies on the Estimates. Basically, we cannot ask questions about them.  In fact, we are very restricted in relation to such bodies. We are dealing with a unique situation which will never arise again.  I cannot see how I am transgressing the rules of the House by expressing a view in relation to Bord na Móna policy.  I cannot see how I am doing anything wrong in asking if Bord na Móna have the personnel to deal with certain problems.  There must be some investigation carried out by the committee as to what will take place in regard to our cut-away bogs as they become available.  This is an important matter.  We must ask if Bord na Móna have sufficient skilled personnel to look after this work.  We <Col N="1171" /> must be made aware of Bord na Móna's policy in relation to vegetable production and if it is the intention of that body to go into the export market. Is it the intention of Bord na Móna to go into sheep rearing?  Such matters must be closely investigated by the new committee.</P>
      <P>The committee will also have to look into the question of allocating the land to local smallholders or restoring it to the former owners.  This is an important issue at present.  The situation is developing where we will have a 33rd county consisting of old bogs.  That land will be on the market shortly and we must be prepared for this situation. If the land is to be handed over the semi-State body involved must see to it that it is given to those who will look after it.  Bord na Móna must respect the rights of those people who have looked after the land.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what the purpose of the committee is.  Basically, we all agree that it will be a type of watchdog committee to ensure that the vast sums of money that semi-State bodies have the power to borrow and spend are controlled.  I accept what the Minister said, that the directors are satisfied with the setting-up of the committee and it is my view that a lot of the bodies will welcome it.  Therefore, we must try to strengthen the power of that committee.  In this regard I disagree with the Minister and Deputy Peter Barry.  The committee should have more power in regard to policy decisions of semi-State bodies.  I do not know if I am in a minority of one on this issue but the committee with investigative rights but without power to suggest policy will not be very strong.  I accept that the decisions of the committee will be placed before the Minister for Finance but the committee will not have the right to formulate policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that the committee be in a position to formulate policy because taxpayers' money is involved.  A problem does not arise where a semi-State body has proved successful but the committee should be able to suggest policy to the semi-State body that <Col N="1172" /> is not successful.  I should like to know what the position will be in relation to recommendations which the committee will make.  Is the Minister obliged to act on those recommendations?  I do not think he is.  There was nothing in the last motion on this or in this motion.  The committee should be in a position to insist on the recommendations being acted on or if they are not carried out to ask the Minister why he has not done so.  It appears to me that the committee can only investigate the accounts of such bodies.  I hope they will have a controlling influence on some of the semi-State bodies.  They could help to formulate policy in different ways and give an input of their ideas about State bodies.  As elected representatives dealing with the taxpayers' money, we should be given that right.</P>
    <P>I notice Bord Fáilte are omitted from the list of State bodies.  This is somewhat of a surprise to me.  As spokesman on tourism for Fine Gael, it strikes me as being strange that the body in charge of tourism are not included. Is there a specific reason for this?  If so, would the Minister let us know what it is?  There must be some reason.  Is he satisfied they are 100 per cent efficient, or is he so worried about them that he thinks it would not be wise to investigate them?  I believe they are working well, but Members of this House should know why they are not included in this motion.</P>
    <P>Tourism is one of our biggest industries and we should have the power to investigate the workings of Bord Fáilte.  This is essential in regard to Bord na Móna as well as Bord Fáilte.  Many people say Bord Fáilte are very much Dublin-orientated, that many of the staff are from Dublin and have not got the common touch of the people down the country.  As the Minister is aware, there will be Deputies and Senators on this committee from all parts of the country. They will provide an input of ideas into Bord Fáilte which I am confident will help tourism.  Many Deputies and Senators are on the Council of Europe and other EEC bodies.  They travel a great deal and many of the ideas they bring back in relation to what is happening <Col N="1173" /> in other countries could be of great help.  All of this can be contrasted with what is happening at home.  It seems remarkable to me that Bord Fáilte are not included.  I suggest they should be included.  If not, many people in the tourist industry throughout the length and breadth of Ireland will wonder why.</P>
    <P>The previous committee were barely getting off the ground when the election took place.  We were working well.  There was a very harmonious relationship on all sides.  We were getting down to the appointment of staff. This was a slow process but the committee were working well.  I hope a sufficient number of staff will be appointed to this committee to enable them to do their work.  With proper personnel, which I have no doubt will be provided, with goodwill on all sides, and with the co-operation of the semi-State bodies, from the chief executive down to the humblest person employed, the committee can do a great deal of good.  Up to now we have not had the full benefit of democracy in the semi-State bodies. When this committee are established, people working in the semi-State bodies will see the Parliament of Ireland working at first hand, how it conducts itself and goes about its business.  Taking all these factors into account, I hope a great deal of good will be achieved by this committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome this committee very sincerely.  Since I came into this House, any time I spoke on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power, and on the question of CIE, I looked for such a committee. It is not that we distrust the directors of these companies, but a large amount of public money is spent on State companies and I agree with Deputy Desmond that the State should be more involved.  Fianna Fáil were the party who got the State involved down through the years in setting up some of those very fine companies mentioned by Deputy Enright.  We want to ensure that they are efficient, and that those running them and the committee see to it that they are run efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> It is very important that we should have a proper back-up group for this committee and a secretariat who will be able to do research into the question of running State bodies.  Deputies and Senators are very busy people and many of them have practical experience. Nothing annoys me more than to hear of such-and-such a genius being appointed to a committee, or a board, who reads it all out of a book and has not the remotest idea of the practical implications of his theory.  So far as I know, all Ministers have been very conscientious about the qualifications of people they appointed to boards.  There is a little too much emphasis on theoretical qualifications, and not enough on practical qualifications. I should not like to be appointed to the board of Aer Lingus.  What do I know about flying airplanes? Nothing whatsoever.  I have seen people with theories appointed to agricultural boards without the remotest idea of the practical implications of their theories.  While I respect theory very much, I also believe you should know the implications of putting it into practice.</P>
    <P>The constitution of this committee should vary widely to represent different sectors.  I mentioned Aer Lingus who are very important and doing very well.  Bord na Móna were also mentioned.  Deputy Enright was right up to a point in what he said.  It is very important that practical men should know how far Bord na Móna should go in diversification.  I mention this in passing.  People with practical experience of land know there are hundreds of acres which could become reasonably good land given the proper direction from people with practical experience, not theoretical experience.</P>
    <P>I am pointing out how this committee could be very useful.  At one time there was the question of the Sugar Company going into agricultural machinery.  I remember when they were congratulated on having the best beet harvester in the world.  This was the achievement of Irish brains.  This committee should be able to report back to the Dáil.  I do not know whether they could be given all the power sought.  Somebody must be the <Col N="1175" /> boss.  The buck must stop somewhere. The committee must recommend to the responsible Minister, and the buck stops there.  Any responsible Minister will have to give serious consideration to the findings of this committee about any State body.  I thoroughly agree with the points made by Deputy Enright when he spoke about diversification. I was astonished to find out that certain State companies, who were losing money and thought they should diversify in an effort to make money, were controlled by statute and could not diversify.  We must get away from this situation.  If State bodies are to make profits they should be allowed to change from uneconomic lines of production to economic ones.  I believe there are certain ties on semi-State companies.  I heard a member of a semi-State company saying that they did not have the authority to diversify. The committee should consider these matters in detail.</P>
    <P>CIE have closed some lines and many men at the bottom have been made redundant.  I often wonder whether some of our State companies are top heavy with higher officials. We never hear of any of the higher officials in these companies becoming redundant.  If some of these companies are top heavy that may be the main reason why they are losing money. There may be too many officers for the number of men under their control.  I cannot understand why CIE have closed so many lines.  I know they have expanded their road transport business.</P>
    <P>The ESB should be congratulated on being run so efficiently that they were able to reduce their charges.  The Minister should ensure that this committee has a broad base and that its membership includes people with great expertise to deal with the various State bodies.  In yesterday's debate it was suggested that the State should become more involved in the creation of employment and I agree with that. We are very proud of our semi-State companies but some of them could be run more efficiently.  The committee should have a back-up group to investigate and report to them.  I have been involved in the co-operative <Col N="1176" /> movement and I know that we had to have people to do secretarial and research work for us.</P>
    <P>I am expecting great things from the committee.  I am worried that Bord Fáilte have not been included.  They are a large organisation and spend a great amount of money.  I am not saying that they are doing a bad job but tourism is an important industry and it would not be any harm if the committee checked on how their money is being spent.  If the committee is to be successful it must have a proper back-up group and it must go into the details of the workings of these companies. I have no doubt that the reports of the committee will be seriously considered by the responsible Ministers. Many people say that the committee has no teeth, but if any member of the committee thinks that the Minister is not accepting good suggestions he can always raise a question on the matter in the House.  Once you establish a parliamentary sub-committee you are handing a heck of a responsibility to the Members of this House.  I have always objected to the setting-up of too many independent boards because they can do what they like without reporting to anybody else.  If the committee make a useful recommendation and the Minister does not insist that it is carried out, questions can always be put down and the Minister will have to answer them.</P>
    <P>I do not give two hoots what a man's political opinions are once he knows what he is talking about and is a capable member of a board, but it is disgusting to have someone on a board who does not know anything about the business of the company.  I have never known politics to be an issue on boards and co-operatives, as the previous Minister for Agriculture said about the general council: that politics only comes into it on the day of the election of the chairman.  As far as I am concerned, the main thing is that a person knows what he is talking about and not that he is a member of the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  The people who sit on the board should have a knowledge of the business in which they are involved.  The State bodies should benefit from the work of <Col N="1177" /> the committee.  I hope the committee are given sufficient staff for research work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I, too, welcome the establishment of this committee.  In common with the present Minister for the Public Service, I was a member of the previous committee when I was a Member of the other House.  I am sure the Minister would agree that there was a certain regret among the membership of that committee that we did not have time to meet as often as we would have liked; indeed, that we did not meet more often before the end of the last Dáil.  Nevertheless, a certain amount of preliminary work was done and I believe that the experience and the benefit of that preliminary work will mean that the new committee, when established, will be able to head off into their work with the minimum delay.</P>
      <P>I seem to recall that, at one of the meetings of the previous committee, the present Minister gave evidence of an attitude towards the staffing of that committee which was somewhat frugal. I hope that the experience of Government has mellowed him and that he will now heed the very urgent and valid pleas made by Deputy Callanan and other Deputies, including myself, for as full a degree of staffing as may be needed to enable the committee to carry out their work properly.</P>
      <P>There is need for expert staffing for this committee.  It is not like the Committee of Public Accounts who basically examine the appropriation accounts of Government Departments which have had a set form for a long time and whose general framework, outline and so on are widely appreciated and known by Members of this House.  This committee will be going into territory which is largely uncharted, complex and very difficult. Back-up service or no back-up service, any member of this committee who plays his full part in it is going to be very busy indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that I agree with suggestions made on both sides of the House about the advisability of including Bord Fáilte in the bodies to be examined by the Committee.  It is not <Col N="1178" /> that I do not believe that Bord Fáilte are important; far from it.  As far as I am aware, our tourist industry contributes a higher proportion of our gross national product than does that of any other European country except Austria.  I tend to the view that tourism would be more appropriately handled by a Minister with sole responsibility for such a major area of our national growth and development and that it would fit rather uncomfortably into the list of companies included in the motion before us today.</P>
    <P>The kind of investigation which this committee will be carrying out is long overdue.  This is not to say that we in this House believe that there are deep and hidden scandals to be rooted out, nepotism to be exposed or all sorts of dark and horrible deeds to be brought to the light of day.  We do not believe that.  It is overdue simply because the semi-State sector of our economy has now been in existence for a considerable time.  I have not been able in the time at my disposal to check the dates of the foundation of each of the semi-State bodies in the Schedule, but you can take it that many of them are in existence for a very substantial period of time.  Their growth in each case since their establishment has been perhaps haphazard.  It has not perhaps been co-ordinated enough.</P>
    <P>The reason why this debate on the re-establishment of this committee is overdue is not that we suspect any dark deeds on the part of any of the people who organise and run these semi-State bodies, but that they have been there for so long and, it is now generally accepted, without adequate parliamentary scrutiny, and perhaps without adequate overall co-ordination of their aims and activities.  I am not passing judgment on any semi-State body when I say that perhaps some of the initial impetus in some of these semi-State bodies has been diluted by time.  One aspect of the work of a committee like this would be to give back to all of these companies a renewed sense of the vision with which they were founded, of the job they were asked to do and of the efficiency and dispatch with which they were urged to do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> A number of points made during the debate are very relevant to the workings of this committee, and I will refer to them briefly.  The first is in relation to policy and to the question of whether the committee will be enabled to examine the policy of these semi-State bodies.  This is not so much of an issue as some speakers so far have made it out to be.  Paragraph (1) of the motion, which replicates the all-party motion which was passed under the previous Administration, calls on the committee:</P>
    <P>...to examine the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities referred to in Schedule A hereto....</P>
    <P>The key words here are &ldquo;overall operational results&rdquo;.  When a similar motion was being debated in the other House I made the point that you cannot examine results as if they had arrived on tablets of stone from the top of a mountain.  Results do not exist in a vacuum.  The results are the result of something.  They are results of plans made to achieve targets which are based on policies.  It is, therefore, impossible to discuss results without discussing plans, target and policies.  I made this point very strongly to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Ryan, and I am glad to say that he accepted the logic of this argument and that the work of the committee in a very substantial measure necessarily included some kind of oversight of targets, plans and policies of the semi-State companies concerned as an indispensable part of examining the results.</P>
    <P>One of the amendments I would like to mention is that referred to by the Minister in relation to publication.  He pointed out that the committee's powers are being suitably extended in paragraphs 7 and 8 to permit them to publish what they deem fit.  I welcome this extension of the committee's powers.  Some committees have more teeth than others, but the right of a committee to publish is one of the most important sets of teeth that any committee can have.  I endorse fully the <Col N="1180" /> action of the Minister in extending significantly, however slightly, the right to publish which is given to the committee by this motion.  The right to publish, of course, is not absolute.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that this right existed subject to the qualification that a committee may not publish material if a State-sponsored body so request on the ground that publication of confidential information would be injurious to the business or commercial interest of that body.  This point was also raised by me in the debate in the Seanad and there was a certain amount of concern, which I share and believe to be legitimate, that the person or body who decides whether or not the publication of any material would be injurious is the semi-State body themselves.  At that time I sought and got from the previous Minister for Finance an assurance that if the committee at any point came to the conclusion that the executives of any State-sponsored body were being unreasonable over a period of time in relation to the projected disclosure of items of information which the committee thought would be reasonable to disclose, the Government would have another look at the terms of reference of the committee with a view to determining whether the final authority for deciding on the right to publish should not rest solely with the semi-State company concerned as is the case in this motion and which was the case also in the motion put down by the last Government. The previous Minister for Finance gave that assurance and I am satisfied that it was given in a genuine spirit of willingness to see how the system worked.  We have no evidence that any semi-State company or that the executives of any semi-State company would be in any way unreasonable in their requests to a committee of this sort not to publish confidential information.  However, we should like an assurance from the Minister that there will be a mechanism whereby there will be continuing oversight by the Minister and the Government regarding the operations of the committee and that should the committee report to the Minister that this section <Col N="1181" /> of the motion is preventing the publication of information that they consider to be in the public and national interest, he will have another look at the situation.</P>
    <P>I have spoken already about the aspect of the terms of reference of the committee which enables them to examine the results of semi-State bodies but the preceding phrase is just as important, that is, &ldquo;be appointed to examine the reports and accounts&rdquo;.  I spoke earlier of the fact that this committee would need expert help because they will be sailing very much into uncharted territory and there is virtually no territory less charted than the accounts of some of our semi-State bodies.  It is extraordinary that we know less about many of the most fundamental aspects of the financial operations of some of our semi-State companies than we know about almost any public company. The reason for this is that the accounts of public companies are covered by the Companies Acts which are extremely strict in relation to the type and to the amount of information which public companies must provide and indeed with the frequency with which they must provide it.  Traditionally, our semi-State companies have been given a much freer hand with the result that we do not know as much about them as we would like to know. For instance, we need to know more about their capital structure and perhaps about their borrowing obligations. Last week's Central Bank Report indicated that the total accumulative borrowing of semi-State companies is now beyond £200 million.  We need to know more about the financial structure of our semi-State bodies since these bodies account for such a large sector of the economy.  Not only do we need to know more about them but we need to get the information in a form that will enable us to make meaningful comparisons.  By and large it has been the practice for semi-State companies to engage private firms of accountants to do the accounts.  It is extraordinary that these bodies which are effectively in the public sector should go to the private sector for a form of accounts.  One of the negative <Col N="1182" /> results of this has been that it is not easy to compare the accounts of any two semi-State bodies because the likelihood is that they will be working with two different sets of accountants and, consequently, will have two different formulate for presenting their accounts to the responsible Ministers. I am aware that there is a responsible Minister in all of this and that the accounts must be presented in a form that satisfies the Minister but perhaps the committee would consider this unnecessary variety in accounting practices and would ask whether the Comptroller and Auditor General might not have some kind of role to play or some kind of advice to give to the committee about the best way of approaching this knotty problem.</P>
    <P>I say this because it will not be possible to have a proper examination of the results of these companies unless the results are presented in a form that is easy to understand and which compares with similar results in other companies, whether in the public or in the private sector.  We must also, of course, have the accounts on time. There are several occasions on which accounts from semi-State companies have been unduly and perhaps even unnecessarily delayed.  If these companies were in the private sector they would be in breach of the Companies Acts by not submitting accounts on time.  Therefore, we should ensure that not only are the accounts available to us in clear form but that they should be on an up-to-date basis so that we do not spend the time of the committee in 1978 discussing the accounts of a semi-State company for 1975 or 1976.</P>
    <P>I see the role of this committee as pivotal in a sense because the committee exist at this point at which two sets of accounts for a semi-State company must be presented.  There are the ordinary accounts&mdash;the cash accounts, the profit and loss accounts, borrowings, the capital structure, wage policy and so on.  There are also the social accounts because we expect many of our semi-State bodies to perform two roles, first, the role of trading successfully and, secondly, the role of providing a social service.  In this context CIE are a classical example.  We do <Col N="1183" /> not take cognisance often enough of the fact that these two roles are in many cases very necessarily in conflict and that the trading activities of a semi-State body such as CIE, for instance, must be balanced against their role of providing a social service in the widest sense and against a particular aspect of that role which is the redistributional aspect.  Some semi-State companies do not exist merely to trade and to provide social services.  They have a role in relation to the redistribution of income and resources.  Any committee set up under this motion who are doing their job will have to pay attention not only to the financial but to the social balance sheet of many of the companies involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the activities of the committee I would recommend that they operate simultaneously on two levels.  Obviously, this is a matter for the committee to decide at an early date.  Those semi-State bodies listed in the motion should be grouped in relation to the type of activity in which they are engaged, and on a medium-term basis the committee should study these groups as groups.  The committee should ensure also that they retain capacity to examine individual accounts and individual situations, perhaps even on a very short-term basis.  I should like to think that the committee would set themselves the target of examining the accounts of every semi-State body mentioned in the motion at least once every two years.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the statement by the Minister that a number of chief executives of State-sponsored bodies have expressed the view that they would welcome parliamentary review of their organisations' activities in the interests of better understanding of their role and functions and of stemming inaccurate and uninformed criticism of them.  This is a very realistic statement.  The work of this committee need not be seen as an intrusion and I do not believe that it will be seen as an intrusion by the semi-State bodies.  It can be seen equally validly as a way of increasing public understanding of their role and function.  It can also be a protection against <Col N="1184" /> pressure for the executives of semi-State bodies, whether of the political or the commercial type.  Some of these semi-State companies are very big businesses and it would be strange if some of their executives were not subject from time to time to pressures, urging them to take decisions that may or may not be in the interests of the semi-State bodies concerned.  The public accountability system which we are setting up is the best possible protection and the only ultimate protection that such people will have against unwarranted intrusions and pressures aimed at making them take decisions which may be inimical to the public interest and to the particular interests of the companies which they control.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that this committee will have as their main role the positive support and active development of the entire semi-State sector.  If they do this properly they will not only be charting new fields for these companies but will be rekindling the vision with which they were originally established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>: As a member of the last committee, I welcome the reconstitution of this committee.  There is a clear indication of the need for it and many good contributions from both sides of the House have highlighted this.  It has been spelled out that we are not instituting a witch hunt or expecting to unearth hidden secrets. There was a degree of frustration because Deputies requiring information were not always able to elicit this information to their satisfaction, though moneys required for semi-State bodies were readily voted through the House without Deputies having the scope to question from time to time the operations of these bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee will give the House an opportunity to examine various aspects of semi-State bodies.  They have been set up at various times since 1927 in order to meet particular needs and they now have a very high employment content.  Many of them give a great social service.  It is now time to examine <i>in toto</i> the operations of semi-State bodies.  As well as examining individual companies, the global <Col N="1185" /> aspect should be considered in order to avoid the possibility of overlapping. Semi-State bodies operate independently of one another and the committee may be able to bring them together. Some enterprises may have a lot in common and may be able to complement one another in their activities where previously they may not have been inclined to co-operate.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine the terms of reference of semi-State bodies and to update them to ensure that there is nothing impending them from expanding into other fields.  If we are serious about State participation, there should not be any constraints whatsoever.  The State side should be able to compete with the private sector.  Having said that, they must compete on a par and should not be seen to have any advantages over the private sector.  This would eliminate fears among the private sector.</P>
    <P>I would hope that we would see in the not very distant future a semi-State body dealing with posts and telegraphs. This is long overdue and I would welcome it as something which would be of benefit to our society and to the development of our economy.  While such a body is not now being set up, I look forward to seeing it in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Semi-State bodies can play a major role in the development of employment. This is one of our major problems. Since semi-State bodies are such big employers, this committee should examine with them areas of further development.  I have no doubt that there are many such areas and the task of this committee will be to create some degree of unified State enterprise. One might call it a State enterprise committee to examine various developments.</P>
    <P>It is important that we develop the State-sponsored bodies.  The committee can do this by ensuring that there are no impediments in their terms of reference. For instance, in the peat generating stations there are vast cooling towers with large quantities of hot water that is run off.  We have large open spaces of cutaway bog and here there is a great potential for the glasshouse <Col N="1186" /> industry at a relatively low cost.  The committee could examine such areas and try to get that kind of co-operation. Many of the State-sponsored bodies consume vast amounts of imported energy and this adds enormously to our import bill.  Perhaps the committee could ensure co-operation between the semi-State bodies in order to develop some kind of policy in this area?  This is where the committee could come forward with reports on such matters, thus helping to achieve some savings in order to create a better economic climate.</P>
    <P>This committee will be a very busy and challenging one but they must have the necessary back-up services and expertise at their disposal.  If the committee require a certain kind of accountant or engineer they should be able to second such people when necessary.  Otherwise they will not have the right type of personnel.  I should like the Minister to take note of that. I know he is making available the back-up services as promised but it is no harm to give him a reminder on the subject.</P>
    <P>When this committee get off the ground they will have a tremendous and dramatic effect on the State enterprise sector.  The committee will investigate and encourage and will back up the State enterprises in any of their undertakings.  If the State sector moves into certain fields of activity the private sector may lobby against it.  That is all right because that is part of political life, but I am sure the committee will throw their weight behind any real development and will support it in this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of reports being printed, I should like some of these reports, if not all of them, to be debated here.  It is not enough for a committee merely to meet.  From time to time we should have a full debate in this House on a particular State enterprise if that is necessary and either side of the House should be able to put down a motion to have a report discussed fully.  That would be helpful and it would be good for the State enterprise concerned.  From what I <Col N="1187" /> know of them&mdash;I have been part of a State enterprise&mdash;I know they are anxious to work with the committee.</P>
    <P>Generally our involvement in State enterprise has been very successful.  Not only do the ESB operate in this country but they are selling their expertise abroad and are helping to develop other countries.  This is prestigious for this country in its relations with other nations.  It is another role in which the State-sponsored bodies are participating. Bord na Móna have been playing their part also, as have Aer Lingus. There is no reason why other semi-State bodies should not do likewise. For a young emerging nation this kind of development is very heartening.  It is gratifying that after a comparatively short time we have developed our skills to such an extent that we can help other countries.  That is due to the dedication of the staff in the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>We should not be too worried about the Devlin Report with regard to salaries.  If you want the best you have to pay and only the best is good enough for State enterprise.  We should be in the market for the best.  If we are seen to hold down salaries or to cut them, there will be a drift from the semi-State bodies to the private sector and we will lose valuable management and expertise.  While it may not be lost to the economy it will be lost to the State and that is unfair.  That constraint should not be on the semi-State bodies. They should be able to pay their executives the going rate; otherwise in time they will fall behind and become inefficient.</P>
    <P>I have always advocated and supported State enterprise.  I hope that sector will expand.  I look forward to its further development because it will prove valuable for the country.  Most of the bodies that have been established have been a shining example both inside and outside the country.  I am sure the committee will improve the situation. When something goes wrong semi-State bodies should not be the whipping boys.  They should be regarded as playing a major role in developing our economy and our employment. <Col N="1188" /> It is important that this committee receive the full support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I, like other Members of the House, welcome this motion.  I believe that semi-State bodies have got a bad name.  A lot of people associate them with strikes and industrial problems.  We all know there is a problem in that regard in the public sector.  That is not very fair because the companies in this motion who have problems are very few.  The principal one is CIE.</P>
      <P>CIE, probably the largest semi-State body, have an appalling image. They are constantly being attacked mainly because they return every year ever-increasing losses.  This year we are talking about losses of £40 million. They are only so-called losses because much of the work CIE do is a social service and not work for a commercial enterprise.  If this committee examine the role of CIE and other semi-State bodies and identify which part of their roles are social services and recommend that those roles be paid for as a social service and not reported as losses, we will immediately achieve much greater morale in the semi-State bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>How can management in CIE have any sort of morale with the constantly increasing losses they are bound to report, the constantly reducing services which those losses dictate and the bad industrial relations which the low morale produces?  I strongly urge this committee to look at this matter.  If it is established that much of the work of CIE is a social service and should be paid accordingly I believe we will be doing a good day's service not alone for CIE but for the country as a whole and for the semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clearly spelt out in the terms of reference for this committee but I hope that they will look at what gives rise to bad industrial relations in the public sector, where that arises.  I believe that has a bearing on what comes out in the accounts of those companies.  The committee should examine the causes of bad industrial relations where they exist.  Most of the companies listed in the Schedule have <Col N="1189" /> excellent industrial relations; they have excellent success stories, but there are some with problems.  Deputy O'Brien said he hoped to see before too long a semi-State body dealing with Posts and Telegraphs.  I would also like to see that happen.  The areas where there are continuing problems of bad industrial relations should be examined.  This has a lot to do with the accounting procedures and the operations of those companies.</P>
    <P>In regard to salaries it stands to reason that people with ability will follow rewards.  Semi-State bodies are working under a very distinct disadvantage. The heads of semi-State companies, with budgets of perhaps millions of pounds, are paid far less than their counterparts in private industry. As long as that is the case private industry will always attract the best people.  It is false economy to be penny pinching in relation to the salaries of the directors and the chief executives of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I believe the industrial relations problem is very relevant to the matter we are discussing.  We will have to become much more involved in the semi-State area.  We will have to create semi-State bodies to produce certain goods or services in order to produce employment.  Very often what is feasible for the State and makes economic social sense for the State does not make economic sense for private enterprise.  Private enterprise must be encouraged.  I believe, however, that the Government, in placing all their eggs in one basket, have made a mistake. I believe the semi-State sector can play a major role in creating the real jobs we so badly need.  In order to sell that point of view, to give that popular acceptability, we have to get across to people that semi-State bodies are, and have been, largely successful. The failures of two or three get a lot of notice for particular reasons to which I have referred already.</P>
    <P>In some semi-State bodies the question of profit does not arise.  In others, especially the ESB, they have been doing their damnedest to avoid producing a profit.  That is a very sad state of affairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> I hope this committee will review the role of semi-State bodies.  It should not be out of the question or be a dirty expression for semi-State bodies to be able to make a profit.  In Great Britain the semi-State body which runs the post office, I believe, declared a profit of £350 million last year.  Of course the beneficiary of that £350 million was the State.  Deputy F. O'Brien referred to the ESB and Aer Lingus earning money abroad, which they have been doing very successfully.  Is it right that we in this House should restrict the level of service they can provide abroad because they are statutorily forbidden from making a profit, or are we right in allowing that restriction to continue any longer?</P>

      <P>: No, Sir, I quite agree with you.  Perhaps I have wandered a little more than I should.  I raised these points because I believe these are areas the committee should be examining, not merely examining or anticipating the report and accounts and commenting thereon.  The committee have a role to play in examining the legislation governing semi-State bodies.  They have a role to play also in investigating problems which arise within semi-State bodies which produce losses, causing low morale or other problems.</P>
      <P>I hope the committee will have staff at their disposal to carry out the necessary research and vetting in the public interest.</P>

      <P>: It is notable that every Deputy who contributed to this debate agreed with and approved of the motion before the House.  Therefore, I <Col N="1191" /> do not have to deal with the principle involved but rather with some of the points raised, points of detail more than anything else.</P>
      <P>The first point raised by Deputy P. Barry suggests to me that he is under some misapprehension because he thought I had been responsible for the addition of Gaeltarra Éireann to the list.  That was on the list put in, to a limited extent, by my predecessor, as the Deputy said, as my urging when I was where he is now.  I did try to indicate that I was adopting the resolution, as passed by the previous Dáil, with some technical amendments, each of which I referred to in my introductory speech.</P>
      <P>As for Deputy Barry's and, indeed, I think Deputy B. Desmond's expectation that I would now insist on the chairman of this committee being provided by the Opposition, there are a number of views I expressed on this matter when it was before the House in the last Dáil and on which I have not changed my mind.  But, in an effort to avoid what I felt might be unnecessary argument, I have been prepared to accept what was passed by the last Dáil, to give it a trial, to let us see how it works, subject to the technical amendment I have indicated already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: It was the Minister's eloquence that persuaded me he was absolutely right about the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate that, but there are some other aspects of it which I was urging the last time and I noticed that the Deputy did not mention them.  I will refer to one or two of them as I go along.  I still believe that the committee could operate more effectively if certain other changes were made but the Government took the view that the House, in the previous Dáil, had agreed on certain things; the committee really had not had the opportunity to test them out.  Therefore the attitude was: let us try it; let us see how it works; we can change it if necessary.  On that basis some changes I would have preferred have not been made.  I would hope they will not have the effect of <Col N="1192" /> holding up, impeding or interfering in any way with the effectiveness of the committee but, if they do, the changes can be made.</P>
      <P>Deputy P. Barry and others raised the question of paragraph (7) which reads.</P>
      <P>That the Joint Committee shall have power to print and publish from time to time minutes of evidence taken before it together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
      <P>The position is that, under the previous resolution, the joint committee had power to publish evidence only in conjunction with a report.  Following discussion at the committee it appeared that that committee anyway felt it should be able, if it saw fit, to publish evidence as soon as possible after each meeting at which evidence was taken. The purposes of this amendment is to enable that be done.  That was the desire of the committee as it was constituted.  It may be that the new committee may not want to exercise that but that is a matter for it.</P>

      <P>: The question of the potential hazards to human health arising from saccharine consumption was referred to the EEC Scientific Committee for Food for their advice in 1977.  The committee thought that a ban on the use of saccharine was not warranted but that certain precautions should be taken to inform consumers and to protect vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> Following receipt of the committee's recommendations, the EEC Commission asked on 29 March last that, until such time as Community provisions on saccharine may be elaborated, member states should take the necessary measures to ensure that:&mdash; (i) the quantities of saccharine in food are such that the acceptable daily intake will not normally be exceeded; (ii) the use of saccharine in infant foods be prohibited; (iii) that foods containing saccharine are labelled to indicate its presence; and (iv) that saccharine sold in tablet form be so labelled to inform the purchaser of the possible dangers of excessive consumption of saccharine especially in the case of pregnant women and children.</P>

    <P>This is not a report specifically on the health services.  It is the first of three associated reports being produced by the National Economic and Social Council on the development of the board concept of social policy.  The second report will examine the basis on which social services are provided in Ireland while the third report will relate current Irish practice to the <Col N="1194" /> analysis contained in the first report and will set out the council's conclusions and recommendations.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The provision of transport for eligible persons travelling to hospitals and clinics is a matter for each health board.  Normally health boards use ambulances and minibuses when it is necessary to provide transport for patients.  They also utilise hackney cars and taxis to supplement their own transport service in cases where this is considered necessary.</P>
      <P>Persons who can do so are expected to use public transport to attend hospital clinics if this is available.  In this connection I might mention that persons over 66 years of age are entitled to free public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> In recent years health boards have rationalised arrangements for conveying patients to hospitals; these have entailed controls on the use of taxis and hackneys but they do not preclude the use of such transport where the circumstances warrant it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The practice differs in the different health board areas. For instance, in the Eastern Health Board area taxis are provided by the board only in certain cases, for urgent admission to hospital where the board cannot provide an ambulance or minibus and the patient can suitably be conveyed by taxi, haemophiliacs needing urgent hospital attention or some psychiatric or mentally handicapped patients attending clinics.  They are generally the categories for which taxis are provided in the Eastern Health Board area.  In the Southern Health Board the situation which the Deputy mentioned prevails.</P>

Specifically, under the 1947 Act the Minister may by order direct every health authority in the manner in which they exercise their powers.  He can direct them to provide a service for the education of mothers in respect of motherhood.  That power is in the 1947 Act and I should like to know what other power the Minister needs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>: I have seen reports of the proposal referred to in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> The position is that there is no legal prohibition on the availability or use of heroin for medical purposes.  The drug may lawfully be imported under licence, and supplied, by authorised persons as is the case with certain other narcotic drugs under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that firms or individuals wishing to import the drug have not been able to obtain supplies since 1968.  This position has arisen because, in response to repeated appeals from the United Nations Organisation, the manufacture and use of heroin has been banned in most countries.  Although a few countries, notably Great Britain, are continuing the limited use of the drug for domestic medical purposes they have prohibited its export to other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the steps he proposes to take to alleviate the considerable hardship imposed by the 20 per cent increase in hospital charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1201" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Hospital maintenance charges are payable only by persons who are not eligible for health services and by eligible persons who decide to arrange for treatment in private or semi-private accommodation.  The increases in the rates of charge are necessitated by increased costs incurred in the running of the hospitals.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the increases in hospital charges from 1 May 1978 are likely to cause hardship.  The majority of persons who are liable for charges are insured with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board or may have alternative cover.  Arising from the increase in the rates of charge the board will be recommending increased levels of insurance and are arranging to allow members to increase their cover as from 1 May and in advance of ordinary renewal dates.</P>
      <P>I understand that if a person has adequate cover at this point the additional cost involved will be relatively modest.  For example, in the case of a single person without statutory entitlement to health services the extra costs, based on the increased minimum cover recommended by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, will amount to £5.80 a year for private accommodation and £3.48 a year for semi-private accommodation. The corresponding increase in insurance costs for a married couple with two children will be £17 and £10.20, respectively.  The extra costs will be about 10 per cent less where members are in group schemes.</P>
      <P>Income tax relief, which applies to voluntary health insurance premiums, will, depending on the taxable status of the person involved, operate to reduce substantially the extra insurance costs.  If it should occur, in exceptional circumstance, that a person without statutory entitlement finds difficulty in meeting the cost of hospital services, he can apply for assistance to the health board.  The health board has authority to provide a service for an ineligible person who is considered by the chief executive officer of the board to be unable, without undue hardship, to provide the service from his own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: While this appears to be a small imposition on the individual <Col N="1202" /> it is part of many similar impositions which have been imposed by the Government. Effectively it can lead to considerable hardship on the individual. Did the Minister not come into office as a reforming Minister who was going to make the health services more easy of access rather than more difficult to obtain?  That is a complete reversal of his policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would not accept that.  The increase in the charges is relatively modest.  I am sure the Deputy understands that, even at the increased level, the charges are still far below the economic cost of accommodation in hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister not agree that, in reading out the eligibility escape clause where a person can claim more in one way or another, he is now adding to one of the big complaints of the NESC report on the multiplicity of criteria for eligibility?  This is the one thing they recommended should be dealt with at once.  Instead of eliminating the various categories for limited eligibility the Minister is adding to them at the expense of the services.  He is making it more difficult and more complicated instead of easing the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy is not correct.  First, I do not want to go back over the implications of the NESC report.  I have explained what my view of that report is, that at this stage it is very much an academic exercise, an examination of the position. Apart from that, I am not adding any new criteria.  The charge for hospital accommodation has always been there, and the provision with regard to access to the CEO in cases of hardship has always been there.  I am not adding any new criterion to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it not a fact that, whatever else we disagree on in the NESC report&mdash;and I am not dealing with that&mdash;there is a general trend throughout Europe towards the elimination of impediments to a free health service rather than increasing the impediments by increasing the cost of <Col N="1203" /> the charges which the Minister is now doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am afraid the Deputy is not up to date with the European situation in this regard.  In fact, the general trend throughout Europe, and particularly in the EEC countries recently, has been in the opposite direction, to cut down on the availability of free health services.  More and more countries in Europe, the richest of them are finding it increasingly impossible to bear the full burden of a free health service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I presume the Deputy is referring to press reports of the speech by the President of the Irish Medical Association at the recent annual general meeting of the association. The President in his speech referred to the effects of modern life styles on health and, in relation to eating habits, referred to the excessive use of refined carbohydrates.  In this context he criticised the use of refined carbohydrates in hospital diets and recommended that patients while in hospital should be educated to take high roughage diets.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that the food served in hospitals is of good quality but people generally prefer and are accustomed to diets containing refined carbohydrates.  The question of persuading people to use correct diets should, I think, be approached as a matter of general health education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not aware that confusion has arisen as to who is entitled to free telephone rental allowance.  The <Col N="1208" /> allowance is payable to pensioners or recipients of deserted wife's benefit aged 66 or over who are receiving a &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; allowance from the Department and who are registered telephone subscribers.  I think the position is set out clearly in the claim form and in the Department's information booklet on the social services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Of course.  I should like to take this opportunity of suggesting that this is an area in which community effort could be of great assistance.  It is an area to which I should like to direct the attention of community groups in arranging to provide installations for old people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The free telephone rental allowance scheme is confined to recipients of the living alone allowance under the Social Welfare Acts. British retirement pensioners are not eligible for the living alone allowance unless they are also in receipt of an old age contributory or non-contributory pension from my Department.  It is not proposed at present to extend the free telephone rental allowance scheme to other categories of pensioners.</P>

      <P>: The Deputy may call it what he likes, but it consists of people from my Department, that is the Department of Social Welfare, Dublin Corporation, charitable organisations and others.  I have asked them to go into this situation very carefully, because as Deputies know at the moment there are three different elements involved. There is the free turf scheme in certain areas, the ESB free electricity allowance, and the new provisions under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Act.  These three elements are operating separately in this area, and I have asked this group to have a look at the situation to see whether they should be brought together or what arrangements should be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: In relation to the free fuel scheme, in Dublin city alone last year it is estimated that the total expenditure was in the order of £900,000, approximately half of which did not go to the people who were designed to benefit from the scheme.  There is considerable urgency about it in order to ensure that the people who are to benefit will do so next winter if that is humanly possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

Therefore we have that time at our disposal.  As the Deputy knows, I received a deputation from Dublin Corporation about the operation of the free fuel scheme in Dublin.

There has also been definite mention of social welfare by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in an interview he gave to <i>Magill</i>.  Is the Minister also aware that the Taoiseach made a speech last week, which was reported on page 5 of the Government Information press release, in which he referred to cutbacks in expenditure in areas such as social welfare?  Is the Minister further aware that the Green Paper which, according to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, will be produced next month, will contain a further indication that social welfare expenditure is to be reduced by the Minister?</P>

To date over 120 submissions have been received from interested organisations and individuals.  A closing date of 31 March 1978 for receipt of submissions was announced by newspaper advertisement, but a few important organisations have indicated that they will not be in a position to submit their views before the end of this month.

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries if, in view of persistent allegations by Irish fishermen that large quantities of herrings are being caught in prohibited areas by foreign trawlers, he will ensure that all foreign boats fishing within the 200-mile fishing zone must report their presence and location on arrival; and if he will ensure that on completion of their fishing operation they will have their catch checked at an Irish port.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The reporting arrangements suggested by the Deputy <Col N="1229" /> are already in operation for Spanish vessels.  I have sought, and will continue to press for a similar provision covering Community vessels to be included in any fishing plans that may be agreed.</P>
      <P>A requirement that catches by foreign vessels in Irish waters be checked at Irish ports would be completely impracticable.  As however, the Deputy is no doubt aware, such vessels may be inspected at sea and if there are grounds for suspecting that our fishery laws have been infringed they may be taken to port with a view to possible prosecution.</P>

      <P>: Irish fishermen will say that the term &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo; is totally incorrect in this context.  The type of check referred to is absolutely necessary.  Consequently, I would ask the Minister to ensure that it is carried out.  It is well known that there is wholesale illegal fishing.  Is the Minister aware that Dutch boats are fishing for herring on a huge scale in the Celtic Sea although that area is supposed to be closed for herring fishing? Is he aware also that Irish boats cannot fish there despite this situation of large quantities of herring being caught by other fishermen?  It is important that this practice be brought to an end immediately.</P>

    <P>(2)  That, after consultation with the Joint Committee, the Minister for the Public Service with the agreement of the Minister for Finance may include from time to time the names of further State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities in the Schedules and, with the consent of the Joint Committee and the Minister for Finance, may delete from the Schedules the names of any bodies which he considers no longer to be State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities.</P>

    <P>(5)  That the Joint Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
    <P>(6)  That all questions in the Joint Committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> The reason for the further amendment which is involved in paragraph (8) is that under the previous resolution the committee could publish only documents received by them, but it was felt that it might be necessary on some occasions to publish other documents, for instance, a letter from the committee to a State-sponsored body.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is so, but if the new committee take a different view they do not have to operate this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry Desmond, among others, referred to the amount of time of Deputies and Senators which will be taken up by this committee and he was perfectly right in what he said.  The work of this committee will be very demanding for those involved. Almost by definition, a number of them, if not all will be Deputies and Senators who are already very busy.  This is so particularly in the case of the Opposition. I have some experience of this. Front bench Members who are already very busy in other directions will have to give time to this committee. Nobody should have any illusions about the demands on the time of Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond also used the occasion to say something which he has said before.  I wish he would not say these things.  He criticised some Members of the House for not making a sufficient contribution to the working of the House.  It is easy enough to say a thing like this but if one has to go into detail it is not easy to justify it.  Deputy Desmond should be one of the slowest people in the House to say this because his own record in regard to attendance and performance at committees is not the best in the House and I do not think he ought to denigrate other Members in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that when this and other committees really get under way the <Col N="1246" /> House may have to reconsider its whole attitude to the question of the committee system.  We frequently hear references to the value of the committee system and comparisons with what happens in other parliaments, particularly in continental Europe.  A fact that is frequently overlooked in this regard is that under the general system of operation in those countries the committees meet when the full House is not meeting and matters are prepared in a preliminary way and finalised in the main House.  In this House what happens in practice is that Members who are serving on committees must serve while the business of either or both Houses is going on and this presents considerable physical difficulty in being present in two places and concentrating on the business of the House and the business of the committee at the same time.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should glibly comment on the value of the committee system and the fact that this House is not using it because I do not think that the arrangements of the workings of this House are really geared to the committee system.  I say that as a general comment, but it is particularly true in relation to this committee, whose work will be very important and demanding.  I throw it out merely as a thought which all of us might have to consider and I should not be at all surprised if we were to have in due course suggestions, particularly from Members of the Opposition, in this regard.  It is especially hard on them.  Members on the Government side cannot, of course, be Ministers of the Government or Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the role of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in regard to the development of agricultural machinery and the possibilities arising out of this.  That is perfectly true and Bord na Móna, as was pointed out subsequently, have a particular expertise in this area.  Some time ago I asked that the possibility be examined of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and Bord na Móna joining together or joining together with private enterprise in this field.  I do not care who <Col N="1247" /> does it but it is clear that there is an important job to be done, having regard to the amount of imports of agricultural machinery.  When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce quite a few years ago I convened a meeting of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and various people in the private sector&mdash; most, if not all, of whom might be described as distributors rather than manufacturers of agricultural machinery&mdash;in an effort to make some impact on this problem.  Apparently it was not very successful, judging by current figures.  No doubt the committee will, in dealing with these State-sponsored bodies, have some regard to the possibilities involved in this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to cut-away bogs and I presume he is aware of the fact that An Foras Talúntais, in conjunction with Bord na Móna, have been carrying out detailed research during the past few years on the use to which bogs can be put and we now have a great deal of information on this matter.  It is certainly possible to envisage major developments in this regard through Bord na Móna in particular, but perhaps in conjunction with other State companies and possibly in conjunction with private enterprise. The important thing is not who does the work but that it should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: The debate will have to be broader than that because there is a very real problem on which decisions must be made.  What is to happen to the cut-away bogs?  Are they to be developed by Bord na Móna?  Is the turf to be cut down to a level where what is underneath is of no use?  If it is to be developed as agricultural land, is this to be done by Bord na Móna or is it to be passed back to the farmers? It is a very important question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree, but Bord na Móna have now sufficient information available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: As to the possibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, and to determine the depth beyond which they should not go.  The possibilities of development differ depending on the soil in different <Col N="1248" /> bogs.  Some are suitable for cattle, some for vegetables and some for bulbs. What is clear is that to develop it on an economic scale one has to talk of a huge farm and the question of how it should be operated.  It seems to me it cannot be done economically if it is simply handed back to the people who originally had the land.  One has to think in terms of co-ops or State companies in conjunction with them.  Doing it on a large scale is obviously a key to the development in most of the areas concerned. Of course this is not a matter for the committee to decide but I think they could play a considerable role in teasing out the issues involved with the representatives of the State bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>The question of the terms of reference of these State bodies was raised by a number of Deputies.  One Deputy went too far when he suggested that there should be no restrictions whatever on State bodies.  Obviously that would simply lead to uncontrolled developments of various kinds and to wasteful competition.  There must be some kind of order in the areas to be tackled by the State companies but that is not to say&mdash;and I should like to stress this&mdash; that where the terms of reference of a State company require to be changed they will not be changed.  On the contrary, I should like to stress that where there is a case for changing the terms of reference the Government would be more than anxious to change them. Indeed, we may take the initiative in that regard but in this context I am speaking simply about the role of the committee.  If it appears to the committee, as a result of their investigations, and if they so recommend in a report that the terms of reference of a State company should be changed in a particular way, the House can be quite sure that the Government will give serious consideration to any such recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright said it seemed a little strange we were setting up a committee to look into the accounts of companies that are reasonably up-to-date when our own accounts were not up-to-date; apparently he was referring to the Estimates.  All I can say to the Deputy in that regard is that <Col N="1249" /> there has been as much discussion of Estimates in this Dáil so far as there was in the whole of the previous Dáil. The position may not be satisfactory but it is improving.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright also referred to the level of fees paid to directors of State companies.  These are reviewed from time to time but there has never been, and I do not think there will be, a suggestion that the level of these fees should be comparable with fees that may be paid in a private enterprise company of somewhat similar standing as the State company.  I believe that most of the people who serve as directors on State boards do so out of a sense of public service.  There is prestige attached to it and that does them no great harm, but to think that we could or should set the level of fees at a comparable figure to that paid in the private sector is a mistake. There is no evidence that worth-while people are refusing to serve on State companies because of the level of fees. Having said that, I want to repeat that they are and will be reviewed from time to time but not with a view of arriving at what might be described as the going rate in relation to the private sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright and others referred to the question of State companies making a profit.  He said that some, if not all, were prohibited from making a profit and in response to a question from me he mentioned the ESB. It may be true that, taking one year with another and allowing for the remuneration of capital, the ESB are not allowed to make a profit over a long period.  However, in practice, having regard to the requirement to remunerate capital, of course they make profits.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the two other points in this regard.  I have never been entirely happy with the concept of an operating profit.  It is misleading and it has led to certain difficulties in some areas.  I am referring to a set of accounts that show a figure purporting to be a profit made by a State company but which takes no account whatever of remunerating capital.  If a State body does not remunerate capital, to speak of that company <Col N="1250" /> making a profit and to use that in the context in which one would use it in respect of the private sector is misleading. This matter will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the point was made by Deputy Enright that the accounts should show in a case such as CIE&mdash;there are many other cases but that is the most obvious&mdash;a distinction between the results of their commercial operations and the services they provide as a social service.  That is a concept with which I am in full agreement.  I think the argument was being made on the grounds that to represent what is a social service as a loss is very bad for the morale of those working in a State company and there is substance in that argument. However, there is another side to the argument, namely, that because of this arrangement some activities that are said to be commercial activities making a profit are, in fact, being run at a loss but the loss is covered up in the total figure, the bulk of it being a loss as reported but being due to the provision of a social service.  It can work both ways.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of all concerned, those engaged in the undertaking, the general public who may be in receipt of the services or paying for them and the taxpayer, that we should know what is involved.  In fact, the first speech I made in this House advocated that course, but we have not yet done it.  I know there are many difficulties involved in determining with any degree of accuracy what is correctly attributable to the social service and what is correctly attributable to the commercial operations.  Nevertheless it would be well worth while to make the effort to establish these criteria.  If the deliberations of the committee can help in arriving at generally acceptable criteria to make that distinction, even if they did nothing else they would have done a very good job by doing that.</P>
    <P>The question of examination of policy was raised.  I should like to make it clear that there is no change in this motion from the one passed by the previous Dáil so far as policy is concerned.  I do not want to do an <Col N="1251" /> injustice to my predecessor by paraphrasing his words.  I hope I am not paraphrasing them inaccurately, but I think it is fair to say that he argued that the portion of paragraph (1) of the resolution, which refers to the overall operational results, extended the terms of reference very substantially into the policy area.  My view is that it would be desirable that the committee should be able to ascertain what is the policy of a particular State company in relation to a particular activity they are engaged in, what is the policy direction that they deem themselves to be operating under, whether given by the current Minister or by some predecessor of his.  I am not quite sure, to be frank with the House, that the terms of reference here will allow that.  I believe it was argued on the last occasion that it would. As I have already indicated, my attitude and that of the Government to this is that those terms of reference have not had an opportunity of being tried out because of the course of events, that we should give them an opportunity to work and that we will be prepared to change them if experience shows that this is necessary.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me, from something Deputy Enright said, that he may be under a misapprehension in regard to the role of the committee.  I would like to make it clear that the committee cannot formulate policy for State-sponsored bodies.  That is the responsibility of the Government and of the particular Minister concerned. The committee should be able, in my view, to ascertain what is the existing policy of State-sponsored bodies and to recommend changes in policy if the committee are of the opinion that that should be done.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Callanan said: that, if the committee issue reports, for instance, recommending a change in policy and if nothing happens, that it is open of course to Deputies to ask parliamentary questions. There are other steps open to Deputies to highlight the failure, if that is the case, of the Government to make the changes in policy recommended.  If the Government decide that they should <Col N="1252" /> not accept the recommendations they will have to explain why.  It is not true to say that the committee can merely make recommendations and that is the end of the matter.  Deputy Callanan was quite right in saying that there are plenty of opportunities for the committee and the members of the committee individually to take action to ensure that those matters are brought out into the open and argued out where necessary.</P>
    <P>A few Deputies commented on the absence from the list of Bord Fáilte and wanted to know why they were omitted.  The reason is quite simple. As I said, this motion is, subject to the minor technical changes I mentioned at the outset, precisely the same as the one passed by the previous Dáil.  On that occasion, my predecessor argued that this committee should relate only to the commercial activities of State companies.  Bord Fáilte do not engage in commercial activities. Similarly, Córas Tráchtála, who do not engage in commercial activities, are not in this list either.  It may well be, as I said on the last occasion, that one could argue that there is an even stronger case for a committee such as this to deal with the non-commercial activities, but certainly this committee could not take on the job of dealing with the commercial and non-commercial bodies.  We would need another committee, and maybe even two more committees, to do that.  The door is not closed on that.  It is obvious that we have to get this committee working, see how it works and then consider, if necessary, an extension of this kind of activity, having regard all the time to what I said earlier about the physical difficulty of operating the committee system in this House in the way we operate at present at any rate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan wanted a commitment that, if any State body abused their power to ask that matters would not be published, we would do something about changing the relative part of this motion.  The Deputy rightly said that there is no evidence that any State body would abuse their position.  If there were evidence of this, as far as I am concerned, the question of changing the terms of <Col N="1253" /> reference would have to be considered. Deputy Barry will remember that I said there are a number of things in this motion with which I am not fully satisfied but I wanted to let it work and see how it goes.  I said I would mention some of these and this is one of them.  I am inclined to the view which I expressed on the last occasion that the decision on whether a matter should be published rests with the committee.  If we are prepared to give to the committee the very serious responsibilities we are giving here, we should be prepared to trust their discretion in a matter such as this.  I am inclined to the view that where a State company request that for reasons of preserving necessary confidentiality certain information should not be published the committee should decide yes or no in response to that request.</P>
    <P>That is not what is in the motion at the moment.  It is the same as it was before and where the request is made by a State company the committee must abide by it.  All we can do in that regard is to see how it works.  If there is any evidence of abuse I assure Deputy Horgan and the House generally that we will want to remedy that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan also referred to my attitude when I was a member of the committee to the question of the provision of staff being a frugal one.  I know what he means.  At least it cannot be said that my attitude was dictated by my being in the Minister's seat.  I was in Opposition at that time and I thought that a mistake was being made in regard to certain approaches in relation to the provision of the staff for this committee.  In case there is any misunderstanding I would like to make it clear what I have in mind. The administrative staff of this committee does not have to be very large. I also think, if it is to be effective, that what we might call the specialist staff may well have to be more substantial. Deputy O'Brien touched on this when he spoke about the necessity to adjust the staff to the requirements of the committee.  He did not spell out if this is what he had in mind, but I visualise that there <Col N="1254" /> would be specialist staff engaged on perhaps short-term contracts for particular jobs that have to be done.</P>
    <P>The committee should have the flexibility to do this.  It could be that, on certain occasions, the committee would have a number of specialist staff working for them on a short-term basis.  On other occasions they might have none, or one.  It would relate to whatever the particular work was that the committee were doing.  It is important the committee have this flexibility and that they should not rely on a permanent, administrative staff being built up because, if that happened, they would not be able to do the kind of job we want them to do.  It was basically that attitude I was expressing, as a member of the committee, which Deputy Horgan described as frugal.  There is a little more to it than frugality.  I would hope the members of the new committee would view their approach to the staffing problem in that light.</P>
    <P>There is one other issue to which I want to refer.  It was referred to by Deputy P. Barry and some others in the course of the discussion.  I think it was Deputy P. Barry who asked why, when introducing this resolution, I did not refer to the salaries of chief executives or the controversy which has arisen in that regard.  The reason I did not was that it seemed to me it would not be relevant having regard to the terms of the motion.  However, since it has been raised, there are a few things I want to say about it.  There may have been some misunderstanding judging by what was said in the House in regard to the fixing of the level of salary of the chief executives in particular the chief executive of the Agricultural Credit Corporation referred to.  I should like to make it clear that I do not fix the level of salary of chief executives.  What is involved here is having an orderly method by which this can be done.  That is something with which I am concerned.  Basically the method by which it is done at present is that the Devlin Group recommendation, which was made in 1972, acts as the basic salary and, from that date on, successive national agreements <Col N="1255" /> were applied to the basic salaries.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that the Devlin recommendation was made by people broadly representative of society.  It contained a representative of business, on the one hand, agriculture, on the other, and two members of the Labour Court.  If anybody can suggest a better method by which we can do this I shall be very interested to hear his suggestions.  I have said publicly, and I will say again, that I am fully aware that the Devlin Group recommended that there should be a review carried out of their recommendations every four years.  That meant there should have been a review in 1976.  Of course, such review would take account of substantial changes in the volume of work and responsibilities of chief executives in the intervening four years; in some cases they would have increased; in others they might have been reduced.  I understand that the review which should have taken place in 1976 did not take place because the Government at that time took the view that, having regard to the economic situation and the incomes scene&mdash;if I might put it that way&mdash;it would be inappropriate.  I am not commenting on that decision.  I am merely trying to establish factually what happened.  The result of that is that the review which should have taken place in 1976 did not, is now considerably overdue and anomalies, if I may call them that which may have arisen, have been exacerbated as a result of that delay.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that some Deputies suggested that we should not be trying to devise some method of assessing independently the salaries of chief executives, that the matter should be left to the boards of State-sponsored companies who are charged with the responsibility of directing their activities. It is true that one of the matters with which any board would be concerned would be the level of remuneration of their chief executive.  However, I suggest that that is to take too narrow a view of the situation.  It is inevitable that the board of a particular company will have what I might describe as <Col N="1256" /> tunnel vision in relation to their activities and the role of their chief executive. I do not fault them for this; it is inevitable and would happen to any one of us in that position.  But whatever argument there may be on that ground, which might be regarded as theoretical, what is not theoretical is that we have had experience of this situation in the sixties and we know what happened.  What happened was something that led directly to enormous difficulty on the incomes front, not merely affecting the chief executives but right across the board in the public sector and ultimately, in the private sector.  That is the reality of the situation.  It may not be very satisfactory that it should be so but it is so.  Faced with that situation we have to decide whether we will revert to the situation of the sixties or try to have an orderly and independent method of determining the appropriate level of remuneration of chief executives.</P>
    <P>The previous Fianna Fáil Government, the Coalition Government and the present Fianna Fáil Government all have taken the view that we simply cannot afford to revert to the situation that obtained in the sixties and that we must have some orderly method of determining the appropriate level of remuneration of chief executives of State companies.  If somebody can suggest a better method of determining the appropriate level of remuneration of chief executives of State bodies than the one we have used I will be very glad to hear of any such suggestion. But I cannot accept the proposition that we should not try to determine it and that we should simply, in effect, go for a free-for-all and revert to the situation of the sixties.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I want to mention in this regard because it is an argument which has been used by Deputies in this debate and outside and it is that it is said that these companies, particularly, when they are engaged in commercial activities, are in competition with private enterprise and that unless we pay their chief executives a comparable salary&mdash;that is, comparable to what they would obtain in the private sector&mdash;we will lose the undoubted expertise we have <Col N="1257" /> in a number of State companies.  In any individual case it is absolutely impossible for the State to compete on the level of salaries with the private sector.</P>
    <P>The reason for this is that, whether they like it or not, State companies are part of the public sector.  The level of remuneration paid in State companies affects the whole public sector and so any private sector company, particularly those in any big way of business, can always outbid the State from the point of view of what the State can pay without undue consequences through the whole public sector and, in consequence, it spreads into the private sector.  A classic example of what happens here is the situation with which the Revenue Commissioners have had to live for many years.  When inspectors of taxes are fully trained many of them are enticed into the private sector, to firms of accountants particularly, and are paid far more than they would earn with the Revenue Commissioners.  They are, of course, invaluable to many of these firms and the firms can afford to pay them the kind of money they do because they more than earn their keep.  That is unfortunate and it leads to all sorts of difficulties, but it is a fact we have to live with.  The same has always been true of CTT.  They recognise, that having trained people, it is inevitable that many of them will be taken on by the private sector and paid considerably more than they would earn in CTT.  Maybe it is a form of rationalising the situation.  I know CTT have always regarded this as a contribution it was making to Irish industry in that it was providing a training ground for people who could make a valuable contribution in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I would pose this question : what evidence is there that we have lost people from the public sector to the private sector&mdash;I am speaking now specifically of chief executives of State companies&mdash;and have been unable to replace them with people of the level of expertise and knowledge required for the job?  There may be an example of it but I am not aware of it and it is not enough to assert that this will happen, or has been happening, if one does not produce evidence of it.  Even if there were <Col N="1258" /> evidence, unless it were overwhelming. I do not think it would invalidate the general proposition I have put forward. I would suggest there is no such evidence and consequently the argument is based on a fallacy.</P>
    <P>One final point arising out of that Deputy Barry objected to my having given a warning to boards of State companies in this context.  I want to assure Deputy Barry that the attention of the boards of State companies was drawn to the Government attitude and guidelines in this matter and in the case of some boards&mdash; cannot be certain if it true of all&mdash; their attention was drawn also to statement I made in this House sometime ago with regard to the possibility of paying people at second or third level higher than the chiefexecutive with a view to pressurising the Minister concerned into breaking the guidelines.  There was no board of a State company unaware of the Government guidelines.  What I said was in the context of a question put to me: If there is a breach will the Minister take action?  I would suggest that Deputy Barry could not deny from his experience as a Minister that in such circumstances there is only one answer possible if we mean anything at all by the guidelines or if we mean to make any effort at some kind of overall control in relation to incomes, a control vitally important to our whole economy, and so I would suggest that, as far as I am concerned, I have no choice in this matter.  I repeat if anybody has a better suggestion I will be very glad to hear it, and I will be glad to hear it soon, because in the absence of a better suggestion we will be proceeding almost certainly in the near future with a further review by the Devlin group.  If there is a better suggestion, I would like to hear  soon but, in the absence of a better suggestion, we must proceed as we have done in the past, as our predecessors proceeded.</P>
    <P>This motion has been generally acceptable to all Members who spoke and I thank them for their contributions.</P>

      <P>Section 2 proposed that the Bill, when enacted, would come into operation on 1 June 1978.  This proposal was contained in the Bill as circulated on 10 January 1978 and was intended to be the date, a matter of weeks after the Bill had become law, to allow time for the preparation of the necessary fees order and for the prescribing of the necessary forms for the operation of Part III&mdash;for example, the form of investing certificate to be given under section 22 (1).  Clearly, the 1 June date is now inadequate for this purpose and, even if it could be assumed the Bill would be enacted before that date, this amendment proposes that the commencement date shall be 1 August 1978.  The reason a specific date is necessary is to enable persons whose leases have expired, and who may be depending on section 13 to acquire their rights, to know precisely when their leases had expired eight years before the commencement.  Because of the change now proposed in this amendment it is also proposed to extend this eight-year period in section 13.  This will be done under amendment No. 4.</P>

    <P>In the course of the debate on section 3 on 8 March at column 113 of Volume 304 of the Official Report, Deputy O'Keeffe queried the use of the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; where it occurs in the definition of immediate lessor and contrasted its use with the use of land elsewhere in the Bill.  &ldquo;Premises&rdquo; is not incorrect since the expression includes land together with the buildings thereon.  Nevertheless, the Deputy's point is taken, that the same expression should be used throughout the Bill to convey the same meaning.  The amendment should meet the point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage debate on 8 March, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 304 at columns 1168-9, I gave the House notice of intention to propose on Report Stage an amendment to section 10 to cater for a group of people I had seen only on the previous day.  The people are tenants of the Cappoquin Estate Company, Cappoquin, County Waterford.  From the facts put before me it appeared that these persons were not, as had been thought to have been the case, covered by Part II of the Bill.  I indicated that I was considering the possibility of amending section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, these tenants hold their houses under leases for <Col N="1261" /> terms of 60-99 years.  These leases, granted between 1910 and 1930, were granted at rents slightly in excess of the rateable valuations of the property and were in succession to earlier leases also for terms of 60-99 years whereunder the rents were less than the rateable valuation.  The tenants believe that the present leases were granted to the persons entitled to the lessees' interest under the previous leases. However, they lack evidence to establish this; although they presume the landlord's records, which are not available to them, would show that this is the case.  The amendment relates to the question whether the present lease was granted to the person entitled to the lessee's interest under the previous lease, that is the question whether the lease satisfies condition 5 (b) of section 10.  The amendment would simply shift the burden of proof in this respect from the lessee, the tenant, to the landlord, the lessor, I believe that this is defensible since the landlord is much more likely than his tenant to have kept the necessary records and to be in a position to establish the facts.  Accordingly, such a change is acceptable to cater for the situation of the tenants in question and indeed of any other persons who may be in the same situation.  This is what my amendment proposes.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 14, to delete &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill proposes that persons whose leases expire up to eight years before the commencement <Col N="1262" /> date of the Bill when enacted into law shall, for a 12 month period, be able to exercise the right to buy out the fee simple, assuming they come within the scope of legislation, notwithstanding the expiration of their leases provided they are still in possession of the property and have not entered into any new arrangement with the landlord.  A similar type of provision has been included in every Landlord and Tenant Act, including the 1931 Act.  In the case of the 1931, 1958 and 1967 Acts the period of retrospection provided for was five years.  In the 1971 Act it was eight years and in the Landlord and Tenant Bill of 1977, which lapsed with the dissolution of the last Dáil, the period proposed was also eight years. The lapsed Bill was circulated in January 1977.  The commencement of the present legislation is now, by virtue of the acceptance of my first amendment here today, being postponed from 1 June to 1 August.  This raises the possibility that, if a period of eight years retrospection was necessary in January 1977, a rather longer period may be necessary to ensure that the same lessees whose right to buy out is being recognised for the first time, do not lose that right by reason of the fact that the eight year period has gone by.  In fact, only one case has been brought to notice and even that is a somewhat doubtful one where the lessee under an expired lease would lose the right to buy out if the retrospective period of eight years is not extended as proposed.  However, there would probably be general agreement that even one case would justify the extension of time retrospectively and that is what is proposed in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am glad the Minister has accepted that some extension is necessary.  He proposes to extend the period from eight to ten years. My amendment suggests an extension to 15 years.  In putting down the amendment it occurred to me that more people would probably have the chance to take advantage of this Bill by extending the period to the time mentioned.  Only a handful of cases have been brought to my attention where the lessees may or may not be <Col N="1263" /> entitled, depending on the time factor involved.</P>
      <P>I do not press my amendment unduly other than to suggest to the Minister that if he accepts that there is even one case that will come within the ambit of the ten-year extension, almost certainly there would be cases where the 15-year extension would provide relief.  Now that he has come so far in increasing the period from eight to ten years he might consider the matter further when the Bill is before the Seanad.  I do not press the matter further than that.  I do not think there are many people involved in this category, but if there were any such people who would be helped by the additional extension of time I should like to see them helped.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 6 :</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 20, after &ldquo;than&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;twice&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a fairly important amendment and I ask the Minister to give it serious consideration.  Section 15 relates to a person who holds land generally as a yearly tenant and extends relief to persons in this category who come within the terms of this section.  One of the requirements of the section is that to be entitled to relief thereunder the yearly rent must be less than the rateable valuation of the property at the date of service of the notice.  A number of cases have been brought to my attention where difficulties arise under this heading.  The other aspects of this section do not seem to offer any great difficulty: the fact that the land must be covered by permanent buildings, that it must be held under a yearly tenancy or something similar, that there must be proof of a certain number of years holding under one or more of the tenancies for a period of not less than 25 years, and a certain number of other items which do not give rise to any great difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties which has been brought to my attention in a <Col N="1264" /> number of cases is this requirement that the yearly tenant in such circumstances must show the yearly rent is less than the rateable valuation of the property.  Many householders who will be attempting to take advantage of this section will be living in houses which are quite old and, in those circumstances, it is more than probable that the rateable valuation assessed at the time will be quite small.  I know cases which seem to fit into the section where the valuation is as low as £2 or £3.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow people who would otherwise be able to claim relief under this section to do so provided their yearly rent is less than twice the rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably accept the point that it is the intention of all of us, in accordance with all principles of fairness and justice, to try to extend the relief that can be given under this Bill to as broad a category of people as possible.  I suggest to him that, if this amendment is accepted, yearly tenants whose rent is less than twice the rateable valuation will be able to take advantage of this section of the Bill.  If he accepts the viewpoint that yearly tenants who would otherwise qualify should be permitted to qualify and should not be excluded merely because their yearly rent is slightly more than the valuation, I would ask him to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: Much as I would like to oblige the Deputy because of the case he has made, I am afraid the proposed amendment would be an important change of substance since the circumstance that the rateable valuation equals the rent has been taken to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the rent is an occupational rent.  This is because the original valuations were the annual letting value.  This, in turn, would suggest that any house with a rent equal to or greater than the valuation would not be subject to a ground rent tenancy.  Because the amendment, if accepted, would be an important change of substance, I am convinced that a change of this kind in the law, if it were to be contemplated at all, would be inadvisable without first <Col N="1265" /> getting the views of the Landlord and Tenant Commission on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have to accept that it relates to the basic position whether a person's occupation is as a ground tenant or otherwise.  I suggest to the Minister that, while this Bill is designed to cover people paying ground rent and does not deal with the situation of occupational rent, if one looks at it in another way, it is very difficult to consider a rent which is slightly more than the valuation, perhaps only £1 more, as being an occupational rent.  There may have been some historical factors for having the ground rent fixed at the time slightly higher than the rateable valuation.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that I am not attempting to open the door completely.  I see the difficulty of dealing with this Bill on the basis that we are dealing with ground rent tenants only.  I suggest quite seriously there are cases where rents which could only be classified as ground rents exist which are slightly greater than the rateable valuation.  We could look at it from the point of view of how rateable valuations were fixed.  It is correct to say that rateable valuations in many parts of the country are not always on a totally even basis.  A house with an old valuation of £5 in one place might have a valuation of £7 or £8 in another county.</P>
      <P>This is not an attempt to breach the entire situation and open up the advantages of the Bill to other than genuine ground rent tenants, which is what is intended here.  It is an attempt to meet some quite genuine hard cases which have been referred to me.  I can tell the Minister specifically of such cases which would come within the terms of this section if this amendment were accepted.  I can refer him to some cases in County Wexford where valuations appear to be of the order of £3 or £4 and the rents of the order of £5 or £6.  I gather there are quite a number in this category. By no stretch of the imagination could rents of that category, no matter how long ago they were fixed, be classified as occupational rents.  They are ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> I am sure people in other parts of the country are in a similar situation. They are being left high and dry, unless we try to cope with the problem raised.  The way in which I suggest doing it is quite simple.  It does not upset the balance as between constitutional claims on the property in any way.  It merely extends the scope of the Bill to include people who are paying ground rents and who, if we do not change the Bill, will not be able to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have had cases from one specific area quoted to me.  The Minister referred earlier to a specific amendment he made to deal with a situation in Cappoquin.  I am glad he accepted the representations made from that area and incorporated the necessary amendment to meet the situation. Perhaps I could refer to this suggestion as being the Wexford amendment, and I am sure the Minister will be as anxious to look after Wexford people as people from Cappoquin.  It may be that he would like to take further advice on the position and get some word from the Landlord and Tenant Commission.</P>

It would probably need to be included on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  I will leave it with the Minister on the basis that it seems to me to be an absolutely genuine case. These are people who cannot be classified as other than ground rent tenants and they should be able to take advantage of the Bill.  The suggestion in my amendment will bring them within the terms of the Bill without being unfair to anybody.  If the Minister is prepared to see if it can be incorporated in the Bill I am prepared to leave it at that.</P>

      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 17 to 21 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g)  the price paid by the lessor in purchasing the land and the amount of the site fine paid by the lessee,</P>
      <P>(h)  the number of years in which the rent has already been paid by the lessee,</P>
      <P>(i)  the costs and expenses which have been incurred by the lessee due to the failure of the lessor to maintain any local amenities such as gardens, footpaths, playing spaces which he had covenanted to do under the terms of the lease,</P>
      <P>(j)  the failure of the lessor to make any demand for payment of rent over a period of years.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with section 17, with that part of the Bill which relates to the price to be fixed by the arbitrator. This arises when the ground rent tenant is not entitled to take advantage of the automatic multiplier under the Bill.  If he is not so entitled he will have to have the price to be paid fixed by the arbitrator who, at this stage, is settled as being the Registrar of Titles.  There are a number of factors to be borne in mind by the arbitrator in assessing the price, including the rent, the length of time that the lease has been outstanding, the current yields on Government securities and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters which we discussed at some length on Committee Stage was the requirement that the arbitrator has to bear in mind the cost and expenses incurred by the landlord in reinvesting the purchase money.  I did make a number of points in regard to this matter on Committee Stage.  The first point was that this cost and expense should not be a matter for the ground rent tenant but a matter for the landlord.  I was, and still am, anxious that that requirement of the arbitrator should be <Col N="1268" /> removed from the terms of the Bill. I pressed the Minister strongly on this point and suggested to him that, if he could not accept what I had to say, he should at least bear in mind that the landlord should be restricted in the costs and expenses that he would incur and pass to the tenant.  The Minister has come some of the way to meet me, subject to the qualification that I was anxious that the entire costs and expenses being put on the tenant should be removed. The Minister has not accepted that point but I am glad that he has come some of the way to meet us and has accepted that such costs and expenses should be reasonable, and that is specifically provided for in the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister has accepted that any such costs and expenses should be reduced to as reasonable a proportion as possible, I suggest that he might go the whole hog and eliminate them entirely.  I welcome the suggestion that they cannot be unreasonable costs and expenses.  That was one of my major fears on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: The trip to China is out.  I am sure that a number of landlords will be very sorry to hear that. Allied to that amendment there was the suggestion that certain other factors should be borne in mind by the arbitrator in assessing the purchase price.  I am now putting before the House the suggestion that certain additional items should be considered by the arbitrator. There are four points involved.  Again, I am glad that the Minister has accepted one of the four points&mdash;that the arbitrator should be entitled to bear in mind the expenses suffered by the ground rent tenant in maintaining local amenities which the landlord should have done, and which he is in breach of covenant for not doing.  I will be making a similar argument to the Minister. He has accepted that this is a matter which must be borne in mind by the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's reaction but, having gone so far, I put it to him that the other points which we <Col N="1269" /> suggested should also be borne in mind by the arbitrator and might also find a place in the Bill.  The other three points relate to the price paid by the landlord, the number of years in which the rent had been paid by the lessee and the failure of the lessor to make any demand for rent over a period of years, and go to the root of what the landlord himself paid for the property in question and on which the arbitrator is now fixing a price.  It seems only reasonable that the arbitrator should bear this in mind.  It is not a totally determining factor but it should be borne in mind by the arbitrator in assessing the purchase price as between the lessor and the tenant.</P>
    <P>The length of time is another factor which I believe the arbitrator should bear in mind.  In regard to the failure to make any demand for payment of rent, it seems that the landlord must not rate the value of his property very highly if he has not bothered to collect the rent.  It seems a reasonable point for inclusion.  It is something that the arbitrator should bear in mind when fixing the price as between the landlord and the tenant.</P>
    <P>In summing up, I welcome the fact that the Minister has reduced the question of expense and reinvestment to what would be reasonably incurred and that he has now provided that the arbitrator must bear in mind any expenses of the lessee in maintaining amenities which the landlord should have maintained.  Having gone so far, I would ask him to go the whole hog and allow the other factors which the arbitrator could bear in mind in reaching an equitable price as between the landlord and the tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: On Committee Stage I dealt at considerable length with the position in relation to section 17 (g). In it I pointed out the position whereby, when the property is acquired by the tenant, after arbitration the landlord was entitled to be paid the costs and expenses incurred by him in investing the money payable in respect of the acquisition of the fee simple.  I have never heard of a situation where a person disposing of his interest in a property had his costs and expenses paid by the purchaser in respect of the investment of the moneys.  It is a unique position.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his amendment deals with the expenses which would be reasonably incurred and so he defines to some extent the limit of costs and expenses which a vendor would be entitled to in the investment of these moneys.  The Minister should go a step further and wipe out this section altogether. I do not know of any situation where a landlord would have his costs and expenses in investing his moneys obtained from the tenant paid by the tenant.  This is an unsatisfactory situation.  The 1967 Act had a provision analogous to this but it was not so far-reaching.  The arbitrator decides on what he considers a fair price to be paid by the tenant to the landlord and the landlord has then to invest the money.  It could happen that a landlord on disposing of quite an amount of property would decide to call in some expert advice.  This advice would be very expensive and far removed from the usual source of advice that people seek on investment, and the expenses could be enormous.  The provision is qualified to some extent by the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, but who decides what is reasonable?  The Minister has gone some of the way; he should go all of the way.  If the lessor fails to make any demand for payment of rent, that is OK; but I hope that a statutory limitation with regard to the collection of debts would apply in this instance as in all others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: During the Committee Stage debate, when we had a <Col N="1271" /> similar amendment for discussion, I explained the reasons why I then found that amendment unacceptable. The reasons given then, which were valid then, are valid now.  I did, however, accept that paragraph (i) of the proposed amendment was acceptable and accordingly, as will be seen from amendment No. 9, this amendment is designed to meet this point.  The amendment in the names of Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Enright would require the deletion of the existing paragraph (g) and would have the effect that the arbitrator would not be required to take into account, in determining the purchase price, the costs and expenses of the landlord in investing the purchase money.  The retention of this provision is necessary to protect the section from any challenge on constitutional grounds which might arise if the landlord's interest was in any way lessened by the Bill's provisions. However, in amendment No. 8 I propose to meet the Deputies' point to the extent of specifying that these expenses must be reasonable.  The new paragraph to be inserted would require the arbitrator to take into account various matters in favour of a reduced purchase price.</P>
      <P>It should be emphasised that section 17 (2) consists of a list of considerations which are only a guide to the arbitrator in drawing up the price and that this list is not exhaustive, nor does it mean that the arbitrator is restricted by its contents.  Indeed, paragraph (i) enables him to have regard to such other matters as are, in the opinion of the arbitrator, relevant to the determination of the purchase price.  The parties to the arbitration will therefore be free to bring any matter to his attention and it will be up to him as arbitrator to decide whether or not such matters are relevant to the determination of the purchase price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the matters to be inserted by the proposed amendment, it is considered that some of them are not relevant to the determination of the purchase price.  For instance, a site fine, if any, paid by the tenant when he purchased the house is irrelevant to the <Col N="1272" /> determination of the value of the property being acquired.  That property is the landlord's interest under the lease. Similarly, the question of how long the rent has been paid or whether it has been demanded is irrelevant.  The eriteria in section 17 (2) can be described as a package deal that has as its purpose to evaluate the interest being acquired.  It is the same as is in the 1967 Act and has stood the test of time, having been found fair to all parties.  It was based on the recommendation of the Ground Rents Commission, made with full regard to the constitutional issues involved.  If it were changed, in particular so as to tend significantly towards a lower purchase price, there is no doubt that it could be held to be confiscatory and would lead to constitutional problems.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the determination of the purchase price of the fee simple or any other interest by arbitration, and the paragraphs of section 17 (2) set out the matters to which the arbitrator is to have regard when determining the price a willing purchaser would give and a willing vendor would accept.  I indicated my agreement with the argument that, where a ground rent lessee has been involved in costs and expenses because of the lessor's failure to observe any covenants in the lease for the maintenance of local amenities such as footpaths, those costs and expenses should be taken into consideration in the determination of the purchase price that the ground rent lessee should have to pay.  Accordingly, I am proposing in my amendment No. 9 that such costs and expenses should be included in the matters to be regarded in arriving at the purchase price.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to the period of time during which the simplified procedures for purchase of dwelling houses shall continue.  Section 18 provides that these simplified procedures shall have effect only in relation to applications made under that section during a period of five years.  The amendment proposes that this period should be increased to 25 years.  This would mean that householders would have a much longer time during which to take advantage of the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a rather long tradition in respect of ground rents.  I am sure that the Minister as well as Deputy Enright and I had in mind ensuring that every person paying ground rent would have the option and should be encouraged to buy out his ground rent.  It seems clear that if this is the object it will not be achieved within a five-year period nor even within a 25-year <Col N="1274" /> period.  If we are genuinely anxious that householders convert their titles into freehold by taking advantage of the Bill, is it not obvious that the longer period in which they have to do that the better chance there is of the desired situation being brought about.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that by substituting a period of 25 years, far more people will take advantage of the legislation. On Committee Stage the Minister referred to the need to put a time limit on the Bill.  The main point he made was the need to introduce a sense of urgency so that people would take advantage of the Bill.  That sense of urgency is there already, on the part of those who intend taking advantage immediately of the legislation.  These are the people who will apply to the registrar to purchase their ground rents very soon after the Bill is enacted. However, by no stretch of the imagination will the number of people who will be involved initially go anywhere near the total number paying ground rent.  This Bill, as is the case with most landlord and tenant legislation, is very complex and many householders do not understand fully what it is all about.</P>
    <P>In view of the rather complex legalities involved I do not blame people for not understanding the legislation.  It will be a long time before many of them become aware of their entitlements under the legislation.  That awareness may arise only by chance when, for instance, property is passing to another member of a family or when there is a marriage settlement or in the event of someone selling a house and moving to another.  At that point they would be likely to wish to take advantage of the legislation.  I do not accept the Minister's point that there must be a relatively short time limit in order to encourage people to take advantage of the Bill.  People involved in a tenant organisation who are involved actively in following this legislation will be all right.  They know the situation.  There is no need for any pressure to be brought to bear on them.  They will be standing by waiting for the registrar's office to open. However, that situation applies only to a certain section.  Let us look after <Col N="1275" /> all sections.  It was my intention originally that there would be no time limit but if the Minister insists that there must be a time limit, let us make the period one during which many more people would be enabled to take advantage of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The second point made by the Minister on Committee Stage related to the amount of effort and money the Exchequer would devote to manning and maintaining the ground rents section of the Land Registry.  Surely the Minister must accept that with the effort that is put into establishing such a section and into recruiting the necessary personnel and providing all the necessary trimmings that go with that operation, it is not sensible to impose a cut-off point after five years.  The major expense involved would have been incurred already and in the main the only continuing expense thereafter would be the payment of the staff but since at that stage the staff would be civil servants, presumably the Minister could find other jobs for them in the Department.  I suggest that the proper course to adopt would be to allow the staff continue doing the job for as long as necessary.  If the Minister accepts that it will be necessary to extend the legislation for longer than five years why should he draw the line?</P>
    <P>I do not want at this stage to appear to be speaking politically or to raise the matter of words like &ldquo;abolition&rdquo;. If we are seriously interested in giving ground rent tenants the opportunity to buy out, let us put it on the Statute Book and give them a reasonable time in which to do so.  The period of five years is not a reasonable time.  I would hazard a guess that the majority of people will not be able to take advantage of this Bill during the five year period.  There are many examples I could give of categories of people who will not be able to do so.  The obvious thing to do is to extend the time.  If the Minister wants to put some limit on the provisions of this Bill, the recommendation we have made is that it should be increased to 25 years.  That is not unreasonable.  If the life of this part of the Bill were extended to 25 <Col N="1276" /> years, there is a fair chance that most people would have knowledge of the situation and would have the opportunity to take advantage of it.  In such a situation it might be difficult to have any sympathy for people who would not have availed of the section at the end of that time.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment and to accept that the five-year period is too short.  If there has to be a time limit, the period of 25 years is much more reasonable.  If we are seriously interested in achieving the end of the ground rents system, then by changing the limit from five years to 25 years we have a far greater chance of the majority of householders taking advantage of the provisions of the Bill. If we do not change, any pretentions about achieving the end of the ground rents system cannot stand up.  I cannot put it more strongly than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is the third Landlord and Tenant Bill that has come before the House during the past 18 months.  The former Minister for Justice brought in a Bill and this is the second Bill introduced by the present Minister. One political correspondent, looking at the original list of amendments put forward on Committee Stage, thought that the debate on this Bill would last until Christmas.  This matter has not dragged on; it has now reached the concluding stages.  There are some minor amendments which the Minister has tabled.</P>
      <P>This section strikes at the very root of this Bill because of the time factor involved.  The Minister has been very open-minded in all the discussions that have taken place and he has met most fairly the points of view expressed on all sides of the House.  Deputy O'Keeffe agrees with me that the Minister has gone out of his way to be helpful and co-operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are bringing in a cut-off point within five years of this Bill becoming law.  The Minister admitted to Deputy O'Toole that he intended bringing in and training approximately 50 or 60 additional staff in the Land Registry to deal with work arising from this legislation.  I do not imagine that these people have yet commenced training <Col N="1277" /> and I do not know when it is intended that they should do so.  It must be admitted that it will take a long time to train people for this highly complex and difficult task.  They will be dealing with titles, some of which may go back as far as the twelfth or thirteenth century.  People who may have no previous experience will have to investigate these titles and then furnish vesting certificates.  The Minister will have to arrange accommodation for them because, as he admitted in reply to questions from Deputy O'Keeffe and myself, there is not sufficient accommodation in the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>All these factors being taken into account, it is obvious that this five-year limit is far too short.  In one of his statements to the House the Minister said that a benefit was being bestowed upon people, a gift waiting to be accepted, and that if people did not want to accept it, it was their hard luck.  I put it to the Minister that there are sizeable numbers of people involved who are working on limited fixed incomes and it is difficult for them to amass £300 or £500.  They may find that they cannot get this amount together and then they will discover that the five-year period has elapsed.  This factor must be borne in mind.  All claims will be dealt with which are lodged within the five-year period.  Nevertheless, by the imposition of a specific time limit the Bill is being curtailed and there will be a cut-off situation which is not necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>No further ground rents can be created.  The Minister on Committee Stage dealt with the fact that he does not want the additional staff to be employed indefinitely on this work.  I accept that and I do not want to see additional expense for the taxpayer. If the Minister employs 60 additional people to discharge this job and if the work load is not sufficient he can vary the number employed on the work. When the business trickles away he can have these people placed in other jobs.  The Minister's point about people being presented with a gift does not wash with me.  He also made the point that he does not want to have staff there with no work to do.  If there are <Col N="1278" /> not sufficient jobs for them there, the Minister will be able to use them elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider inserting in the Bill wording to the effect that at the end of a five-year period he will have power to extend the measure if that is deemed necessary because of the volume of business.  I would go along with such a provision but I do not think the Minister will do that.  We have had a number of more controversial measures that were renewed by order and that was accepted by both sides.  This measure is not so controversial.</P>
    <P>At the end of a five-year period the Minister or his successor will have to bring before the House legislation extending the measure we are discussing now.  The Minister has a number of options open to him.  He can agree to our amendment and extend the time. Deputy O'Keeffe and I would go along with him if he retained power to order that the measure be extended.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the publicity given to this measure on television, radio and in the newspapers, many people will not know about this until someone they know buys out their ground rent. Only then will such people be aware of this measure.  The Minister can show his vision by agreeing to this basic amendment which goes to the heart of the Bill.  By not including it in the Bill the Minister is restricting the advantages and merits of the Bill. He is telling people that unless they take advantage of what he is offering now they will have to do without it later.  The amendment is most reasonable and the Minister should accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: The passion with which Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Enright argued this amendment is most encouraging.  To me it indicates that the benefits are quite substantial.  During the course of discussion on Second Stage I said that I wanted to emphasise that the five-year limit was not designed to reduce the State's financial commitment to the scheme.  I said that on the contrary the time limit may well increase that commitment because it will encourage all tenants to avail themselves of the scheme.  That was on 8 February.  On 22 February I had the <Col N="1279" /> opportunity of replying on Second Stage and I dealt with the arguments raised by many Fine Gael Deputies, who spoke on the five-year limit.  I said then there was no question in my mind of making the scheme an open-ended one.  I repeated the argument that the limit of five years is important because it will encourage all ground rent tenants to exercise their rights as soon as the Bill becomes law. I had a lot more to say but I do not want to repeat it now.  We had a fairly long discussion on Committee Stage on 12 April.</P>
      <P>I believe that the scheme which is going to last for five years will work and that it will encourage tenants to exercise their rights as soon as the Bill becomes law.  It is extremely important that we should see clearly that it is only the low-cost scheme that is restricted in its life to five years.  Persons who cannot avail of this scheme for some reason will be entitled to acquire the fee simple under the 1967 Act.  I thought I had eased the anxiety of Deputies during the course of the debate on Committee Stage when I said that all applications made under this Bill up to the five-year period will be dealt with.  This is so irrespective of how long it may take after that five-year period to deal with the applications submitted.</P>
      <P>To leave the scheme open-ended or as a 25-year period would be extremely unwise.  It could be allowed to drag on and on and it would have the opposite effect to what I have in mind.  I accept what Deputy Enright has said that, as a result of the publicity given to this topic by the media because of discussions here and elsewhere, there will be a flood of applications to the Land Registry to be processed as and from the date the Bill becomes operable.  I should like to assure the Deputy that the staff are ready to deal with it.  We are ready to meet the onslaught whenever it comes.  I should like to assure the Deputy that the staff will be working in close proximity to this building and it will make it easy for Deputies to visit their office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conscience, I could not have whatever staff may be involved in the unit concerned sitting twiddling their <Col N="1280" /> thumbs, waiting for 25 years for people to make up their minds whether to buy out their ground rents.  Naturally, staff costs are very high and we could not have those people sitting around doing nothing.  I am satisfied that the bargain we are giving so far as legal costs are concerned will be clearly recognised as a bargain.  Even a sale in Clery's or Guiney's only lasts for a period; it is not a sale for 52 weeks. The bargain we are giving so far as legal costs are concerned will be there for five years.  I accept this has been a serious bone of contention between the two sides of this House since we started to debate this legislation but I am convinced I am right.  However, I will be the first to admit that time will tell.</P>
    <P>I hope, whoever the Minister for Justice is in five years' time, that it will be incumbent on him to come before the House to do anything further about it.  I am sure it will not be necessary for him to do anything about it.  If there was any glimmer of hope to be given at this stage that that five-year period would be extended the Deputies would see that there would be need for the Minister for Justice in five years' time to come before the House to have amending legislation agreed to extend the limit.  I want to say, quite categorically, that there will not be any extension of the five-year period for which the legal costs will be available for the nominal sum of £5 to those who want to buy out their ground rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am afraid that I am at odds with the Minister on this point. I cannot accept his arguments in relation to this amendment.  He referred to our acceptance of the clear benefits under Part III of the Bill.  Now that we are near the end of the debate on this Bill let me be quite clear and explicit that I fully accept that the procedures suggested in the Bill are a considerable improvement on the procedures which existed under the 1967 Act.  They are providing a system which will simplify the procedures for householders buying out their ground rents.  I welcome this Bill from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not want there to be any <Col N="1281" /> confusion arising out of my opposition to the Bill, particularly on Second Stage, which related largely to the fact that the Bill did not measure up to a certain commitment given in a certain document before last June.  That was my basic argument at that time.  The provisions of this section are of benefit to householders.  They are largely modelled on similar provisions in the National Coalition Bill.  They are not original provisions at all.  I certainly would, as the Minister mentioned, argue with passion on the benefits of this simplified procedure.  I would not like my opposition to this Bill at another level to be misconstrued.</P>
    <P>In relation to the time limit, any suggestion that more people will buy out their ground rents in a five-year period than a 25-year period does not stand up.  If we are seriously interested in as many householders as possible to take advantage of this part of the Bill, surely the longer time we allow them to do that the more people are likely to take advantage of it.  That seems to me to be common sense.  The Minister suggests the sense of urgency the five-year period will introduce, will result in queues forming the day after the Bill comes into effect.  There may be queues of people forming the day after the Bill comes into effect, whether it is a five-year period or a 25-year period, but I am thinking of the people who never heard of this Bill and who may not hear about it for 20 years.  We might be a little like someone living in a glasshouse, having discussed the terms of this Bill for a period of at least 20 hours.  We do not want to lose perspective.  I have no doubt that a large number of householders who are paying ground rents at the moment have not a clue about the terms of this Bill.  It will take a long time, perhaps a series of coincidences or otherwise, to have it get through to them that this procedure is there and that it would be in their interest to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>I have to reject the suggestion that more people will be encouraged to take advantage of the Bill by having a five-year time limit.  I believe that, if a time limit is necessary, a period of 25 years must, in all common sense, result <Col N="1282" /> in a far greater number of people being able to take advantage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright covered the point with regard to staff in the Land Registry who will be dealing with this matter. The staff necessary to deal with the number of applications coming in are maintained.  If there is a large number of applications there must be a large number of staff and if there is a small number of applications the staff is reduced.  The Minister will have to bear in mind that, no matter what the time limit is, a certain number of staff will have to be maintained for quite a considerable period.  This procedure envisages that moneys will be lodged and vesting certificates given. However, the landlords' interests and the mortgages thereon will have to apply thereafter to the Land Registry in connection with their respective claims to the moneys lodged.  That may take a long time.  I am certain it will be found that there will be a surplus of funds, as was found in the courts from time to time when they checked the books, never claimed for a variety of reasons.  Accounts will have to be kept and there will have to be staff there for a long time to deal with that.  There is no problem whatever, if the heavy ploughing is done, no matter how long it takes, whether five years or ten years, in shrinking the number of staff and the premises, bringing the staff back into a small section in the Land Registry, maintaining it there to provide the service and continue the work of transferring freeholds, issuing vesting certificates and also dealing with the landlords' side of the business involving the moneys lodged.</P>
    <P>This is a point on which we must disagree.  The five-year period is too short to allow anything like the majority of the ground rent tenants to take advantage of the terms of the Bill.  I am not completely happy with the 25-year period.  I do not see any reason for the time limit but if there is a reason the 25-year period is a lot more reasonable.  I have to press the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 37 and 38, to insert:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Registrar may, however, dispense with service under subsection (1)  where the applicant satisfies him that it is not reasonably practicable to effect such service. In any such case, the Registrar shall serve notice of the application <Col N="1285" /> on every person who appears to him to be the owner of any estate, interest or incumbrance which would be extinguished by the issue of a certificate under section 22 (1), so far as it is reasonably practicable to ascertain such persons.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and others had a number of amendments on Committee Stage in regard to the difficulties faced by an intending purchaser under Part III who though, required by section 22 (1)  to serve notice of his application on his immediate lessor, might have lost all contact with his landlord and might have paid no rent since before the foundation of the State.  An amendment was moved to deal with the difficulty, and was accepted by the House, the effect of which was to add to section 22 (1) a provision that service of that notice may be effected in any manner provided for by section 63 of the Act of 1931 or section 23 of the 1967 Act.  This makes it clear that service of the notice may be effected by sending the notice by registered post to the person to whom the rent is paid at the place of payment.  However, Deputy O'Keeffe remained unconvinced that this amendment would be adequate to enable service of the notice to be effected in a case where rent had not been paid for many years and I undertook to re-examine the matter.  The amendment before the House proposes a procedure for an intending purchaser who has failed after reasonable attempts to locate or identify his immediate lessor.  I think this amendment will put beyond all doubt that a person in the situation described by Deputy O'Keeffe can avail himself of Part III of the purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>The amendment, with drafting changes, is not dissimilar in substance from one of the Opposition amendments, which I have already mentioned, moved by Deputy Enright on Committee Stage.  That amendment was intended to deal with much the same kind of situation.  It enabled the Registrar of Titles to dispense from the requirement in section 21 (1) to serve notice on the immediate lessor in a case where the purchasing tenant cannot identify or locate the person to <Col N="1286" /> be served.  Instead the Registrar of Titles is himself required to seek out the person or persons entitled to sell to the ground rent tenant so far as it is reasonably practicable to ascertain those persons before arbitrating on the purchase application and before the issue of any vesting certificate.  This change will not, in effect, involve any work in the Land Registry since the Registrar of Titles is already required to seek out persons entitled to shares of the purchase money so far as they can reasonably be ascertained in connection with the distribution of that purchase money.</P>

      <P>: I welcome this amendment.  It certainly meets the point we made on Committee Stage. The Minister was, I think, satisfied that our point was a genuine one and related to the practical experience of both Deputy Enright and myself.  This amendment seems to meet the position and so there is no opposition to it.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 15, after &ldquo;dwellinghouse&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than arrears an action for the recovery of which is statute-barred)&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 22 (2) requires the Registrar of Titles before issuing a vesting certificate to a purchaser under Part III to satisfy himself <i>inter alia</i> that the ground rent for the dwelling-house has been paid to date.  On Committee Stage Deputy O'Keeffe argued against this requirement.  The debate centred on the possibility that, if rent had not been paid or demanded for very many years, the purchaser might be required to pay all the arrears before getting his vesting certificate.  I pointed out at the time that under the Statute of Limitations of 1957 at most six years arrears of rent would be payable.  However, since Deputy O'Keeffe felt that the wording of section 22 (2) left room for doubt as to the applicability of the Statute of Limitations I undertook to look into the mater.  The Statute of Limitations would, indeed, apply but the amendment now proposed is designed to put the matter beyond any doubt whatsoever.</P>

      <P>: Again, I welcome this amendment but not with the same unqualified welcome I gave to the last amendment.  I welcome it in so far as it accepts one of the two points I made on Committee Stage, namely, to ensure that a householder would not be required to pay rent going back beyond the statutory period when obtaining his vesting certificate; in other words, any rent which would otherwise have been statute barred would not be revived. The Minister's amendment covers that point entirely and to that extent I welcome it.</P>
      <P>The other point relating to the establishment of the Registrar of Titles as a rent collector as it were was based on the principle of the registrar having an obligation placed on him to ensure the rent was paid up to date.  The Minister has met me half way and we can take the amendment as acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I had a communication from the Chair to that effect. Without questioning the Chair's decision in any way, I think I should say that the requirement to register would be related also to section 23 (3) which provides for fees to be fixed so as to meet the full cost of dealing with the relevant application except in relation to subsection (1).  In other words, that subsection (1) of section 23 provided that fees would be a fixed sum in relation to an application under Part III but that any other fees that would also be fixed by the Minister would be fixed so as to meet the full cost of dealing with the application. In those circumstances, if there were to be an addition as I suggested in amendment No. 13 involving registration of the vesting certificate, one must couple that with the proviso as to fees in section 23 (3).  I did not push the Minister to the extent of requiring, as it were, the registration fees to be paid but merely that the registration job would be done.  So, with respect, I suggest that initially looking at my amendment you would take the view <Col N="1288" /> that it might involve a charge on revenue because there is a fee payable on registration&mdash;that is quite an understandable initial view&mdash;but if you couple it with section 23 (3) where there is provision that fees would be fixed to meet the full cost of the registration, that argument would not arise.  I suggest that the Chair might look again at the amendment in the light of what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Chair had no option but to rule out the amendment.  As I see it, it forms a potential charge on the revenue.  The purpose of the amendment was to provide for registration of vesting certificates in the Registry of Deeds.  Under existing enactments, a statutory fee of £4 must be paid for each such registration but the amendment provides that registration shall be completed by the registrar.  Its effect is to make the charge payable by him.  This involves a charge on the Revenue and such an amendment cannot under Standing Orders be moved by a Private Member. The Chair regrets that this decision is necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate on 3 May as reported at columns 179-80 of the Official Report, Deputy O'Keeffe indicated that in his opinion it was not clear whether tenant purchasers of houses provided by local authorities prior to the enactment of the 1966 Housing Act would be entitled to acquire the fee simple in their dwellings.  The 1966 Housing Act repealed all previous legislation enabling housing authorities to provide houses and it was considered in drafting section 26 that all houses provided <Col N="1289" /> under the earlier legislation could be deemed to have been provided under the 1966 Act.  However, the position has been further examined and I am advised that it would be worth while to put the matter beyond all doubt by amending the section so as to give the right to acquire the fee simple to the owner of any house provided under the 1966 Housing Act or any Act repealed by that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is not readily audible in the offices in which I work. If possible, this matter should be looked into.  We are dealing here with a most important Bill and this is something we must all realise.  Referring to reports and considering statistics that have been published only recently, one can only express alarm at the increase in the number of accidents at work and particularly at the increase in the number of fatal injuries at work.  It is good that we are given this information but it makes very serious reading. There is an increase in the number of people being killed.  This must cause us grave concern.</P>
      <P>In 1975 there were 21 fatal accidents at work and 3,421 reported accidents. In 1976 18 people were killed and there were 3,581 reported accidents.  In 1977 there was a decrease in the number of people injured.  The figure was down to 467 but there was a substantial increase in the number of fatal injuries at work.  This I deem most serious. This year seven people were killed in factories and 13 were killed on construction sites.  On docks, wharfs and quays, one person was killed, in electrical stations one person was killed, in mines two people were killed, and in quarries two people were killed.  That is most depressing and alarming reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics are cold and analytical to look at.  Losses of life have occurred. Families have been deprived of breadwinners. In accidents people have <Col N="1291" /> been maimed for life.  They have lost limbs.  They have been left semiinvalided. They have been left with brain injuries, eye injuries, and so on. This emphasises how urgent it is that we should tighten up our legislation dealing with industrial safety.  All of us in this House must try to see how we can help.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not touch on agriculture. I realise the difficulties involved in trying to include agriculture, but it is an important omission.  Mr. Michael Dillon, <i>The Irish Times</i> farming correspondent, referred to the number of people injured in farming accidents. Again this makes serious and sad reading.  He said there are at least 30 fatal accidents on farms each year. That is a very high figure.  He said if we look around we will see that quite a proportion of farmers have suffered some injury, perhaps are missing a finger or two, or have a lame leg or an injured back.  Agriculture is perhaps our main industry.  Mr. Dillon was very fair when he said farm safety laws are difficult to enforce.</P>
    <P>I was brought up on a farm and I appreciate the difficulties.  If there were no difficulties, agriculture would have been included in the Bill.  We should face up to the situation and legislation should be introduced by the Department of Labour in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, the IFA, the ICMSA and other farming organisations.  We cannot allow a situation to continue in which 30 people are killed at work. Many accidents can occur on farms. Serious injuries occur daily at the power take-off point of tractors.</P>
    <P>Far more care will have to be taken in regard to safety of design of agricultural machinery.  It is almost impossible to legislate safety regulations for people whose clothes may be caught in a power take-off, but we must try to do something about it.  Countless injuries are occurring in silage making. As the Minister is aware, people drive up on the silage pit and roll it and, when it is nearly full, it is simple for the machine to roll off and the driver is trapped underneath.  There are no <Col N="1292" /> protective railings to prevent a farmer or his worker from being injured.</P>
    <P>Regulations have been made about safety frames on tractors.  This is most desirable, but they can be enforced only on the roads.  More people are injured in their own fields and yards than on the roads by tractors overturning. The Minister has no power to go onto private property and tell somebody to put a safety frame on his tractor.  I believe the position is a little better in England where they are taking steps to ensure that safety frame regulations are enforced and farmers are compelled to have safety frames on their tractors.  Some advertising on television about safety frames on tractors has been worth while and emphasised the injuries which can occur without them.  Nevertheless, a substantial number of people have not bothered putting them on their tractors. These are simple matters but it is important that the Minister should bear them in mind.</P>
    <P>A great many accidents are caused by the negligent towing of trailers and the towing of machines behind tractors. The Minister is aware that the only way in which a negligent person can be caught at present is under the Road Traffic Act.  If a person neglects to take proper precautions before bringing a vehicle onto the road and another person is injured as a result of this negligence, there should be some way of ensuring that the negligent person is made liable for his action.  All the regulations in relation to machinery and the towing of vehicles are under the Road Traffic Act.  Some procedure should be introduced by the Department in conjunction with the farming organisations to try to achieve safer machinery designs.</P>
    <P>I have another important point to raise and it is something I have considered since an incident occurred in my constituency in which a lorry carrying a dangerous substance was involved. The Minister and the officials of the Department are aware of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, which deals with a large number of dangerous materials.  Section 24 of the Act reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> (1)  A dangerous substance for the purposes of this Part is a substance which the Minister by order declares to be such on the ground that in his opinion it constitutes a potential source of danger to person or property.</P>
    <P>(2)  An order under subsection (1) may apply any provision of this Act to the substance to which the order relates.</P>
    <P>Section 26 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Health, by regulations provide for the protection of persons against risk of injury caused by any dangerous substance.</P>
    <P>The Act also contains a section in relation to the conveyance of dangerous substances.  A number of Government Departments have been negligent in regard to making regulations for the carriage of dangerous substances.  I say this reluctantly as I do not wish to make serious charges.  As far as I am aware, we have not made any regulations for the carriage of dangerous substances.  If there are regulations, the Minister should tell us about them.</P>
    <P>Section 62 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may make regulations for the purposes of subsection (1) other than the purposes for which bye-laws may be made under sub-section (3).</P>
    <P>The carriage of dangerous substances is a subject that must be tackled immediately.  I am sure that those involved in the chemical industry are worried about the lack of regulations. I believe that legislation will be introduced in England in regard to the transportation of chemicals and I believe that similar legislation is urgently required here.  The Bill should include some provision to ensure that markings are placed on every load that is carried around this country. The markings should include information about the type of chemicals being carried and other information which would be of help to our emergency services in case of accidents.</P>
    <P>I am not the first person to raise this matter.  The head of the environmental <Col N="1294" /> technology department of the IIRS, Mr. Lynch, read a paper on hazardous industries in Ireland on 1 December 1977.  In his speech he detailed the position in regard to the transporting of dangerous chemicals. He pointed out that the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, enables the Minister for Labour to declare any substance which in his opinion constitutes a potential source of danger to persons or property to be a dangerous substance.  He also said that, unfortunately, the Minister had never designated any substance as a dangerous substance for the purposes of the Act.  Section 24 of this Act has never come into being.  Without the implementation of this section there is no statutory control in Ireland over the hazards of the transport of dangerous substances.  Perhaps the most dangerous substance that can be conveyed anywhere is a lorryload of petrol.  Every day people pull up at filling stations casually smoking cigarettes and so on.  An enormous number of people could be fatally injured as a result of carelessness in loading or unloading petrol.  Every effort should be made to tighten up the regulations regarding this.</P>
    <P>This country is becoming more and more industrialised and we have many more substances of a highly chemical nature than we used have.  The amount of what could be considered dangerous substances which are being transported in this country make it alarming to realise that regulations to control them have not been brought in.  I am not going to labour the point.  I do not wish to make a song and dance about it, but I wish to bring to the Minister's attention and to the attention of the Department of Health this glaring deficiency in our present legislation which must be dealt with by the regulations we are empowered to bring in under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1962.  A disastrous situation could arise at any time due to regulations not being brought in.  I leave the matter in the Minister's hands.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill deals with the general duties of manufacturers and so on as regards plant for use at work. This section is important for person <Col N="1295" /> working on plant in industry.  Manufacturers should furnish to employers and employers should furnish to their employees all necessary information regarding the machines.  Operating instructions should be supplied in written form.  Very often only verbal information is given and the person receiving it has not time to assimilate all the detail.  Written information should be furnished to employees in regard to the very often highly complex machinery on which they are working.  Also safety tests should be carried out during the manufacture of machines and all machines should be certified by the Minister's Department as suitable for the job for which they are intended. If imported machinery is considered unsafe the Minister should have power under this Bill to make public his dissatisfaction with it.  He should have power to declare such machinery unsafe and to publish notices to that effect.  It often happens that people do not become aware that machines are unsafe until it is too late.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with noise.  The report furnished by the Minister which deals with accidents at work and with the report of his inspectorate also dealt with the question of noise.  Injuries that make news are, firstly, fatal injuries and, secondly, such serious injuries as the loss of limbs.  I wish to dwell briefly upon the subject of types of injuries which are never reported to the Minister.  These types of injuries may have lifelong effects.  I am speaking of injuries to the ears and the eyes. This is a matter upon which it is difficult to legislate.  Examples of industries where this problem exists are the textile industry, the manufacture of bottles and woodwork.  People are working in these industries day in and day out and because of the noise around them all the time they become partially, not fully, deaf.  Their hearing is impaired and they suffer from this disability until they go to their graves. I am sure the Minister has visited many textile factories and he will realise that the noise in them is unbelievable. I do not think that I have ever seen anybody in a textile industry wearing proper ear protection, and the <Col N="1296" /> same applies to the bottling and woodwork industries.</P>
    <P>Showbands and so on are an industry. They create employment and many people apparently experience happiness when listening to them. However a highly eminent doctor has said that because of the high frequency sound in a lot of dance halls, discotheques and so on, the hearing of large numbers of young people will be permanently impaired.  It is serious that young boys and girls may have their hearing impaired 10, 20 or 30 per cent and that this can become a permanent disability.  Anybody who visits these dancehalls is aware of the power of the equipment which the entertainers there have.  The noise that can be generated from these musical instruments is such that it can and does have serious effects on the people listening, especially if they listen regularly.  Of course people at the age of the majority of those listeners like it good and loud&mdash;apparently the louder it is the better it is enjoyed.  Nevertheless, I ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I am dealing basically with the industrial situation, but on all these matters the Minister should, if possible, in consultation with medical advisers and advisers from his Department and the Departments of Health, and Industry, Commerce and Energy, try to achieve a situation whereby a tolerable noise level would be specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am charging the Minister with a difficult task, but unless there is such provision there will be people whose hearing will be impaired partially for the rest of their lives as a result of damage caused them at their work place.  When the sound in any industry exceeds what is regarded as a tolerable level it is essential that the industry in question be obliged to supply protective ear equipment for the employees.  It would be a matter for the inspectorate of the Department to ensure that such a regulation was complied with.  The statistics that have been supplied to us by the Department down through the years have not included information in regard to partial deafness, but I know from <Col N="1297" /> talking with people employed in industry that their hearing is affected by noise levels that are too high.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the question of accommodation for meals and so on and makes specific provision to ensure that where there are more than ten people employed there is a facility for boiling water, for instance.  While this is to be welcomed I should have liked the section to be more specific, to have set out the type of accommodation that should be provided and to specify that, for instance, proper heating should be provided with that accommodation.  It is important too that there be proper ventilation in areas where meals are prepared and eaten.  In the absence of specific provision in these areas many things will be taken for granted.</P>
    <P>Section 16, too, is to be welcomed. It deals with the provision of proper washing facilities.  These are very important. It is essential that both hot and cold water be provided for workers in industry.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with eye protection. As a result of working in areas that are dirty or foggy or where there are fumes there is the danger of one's eyes being damaged.  It is important that where necessary such protective items as goggles and screens are provided.  I have been endeavouring to find the report of the inspectorate which deals with injuries to eyes, but if I recollect properly one of the conclusions in that report was that many people working in conditions that might be damaging to their sight failed to use the protective equipment provided.  It is regrettable that this should be the situation. This question is dealt with, too, in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the risks involved to sight in certain industries we should endeavour to ensure that people be compelled to use protective equipment where this is provided, but we must ensure also that where necessary the employer makes the necessary equipment available.  An employee has a duty to himself to avail of whatever protective gear that is made available. In the case of apprentices in particular there should be compulsion in this regard.  Time and again one meets <Col N="1298" /> people who have suffered damage to their eyes or ears as a result of not taking the proper protective measures while working in areas which put them at risk in regard to these faculties.</P>
    <P>There is a section also which deals with the provision of fire escapes and so on.  In this regard I would venture to say that only very few concerns exercise sufficient care in the training of staff in regard to the effective use of the most basic fire fighting equipment or in regard to information about fire escapes and so on.  Better training in these areas could result in fewer accidents in industry.  Many fires could be prevented.  The Minister's Department should have some means of finding out whether fire prevention measures have been taken in a specific industry and they should also be able to ascertain in conversation with the workers whether they have been trained in the basics of fire prevention and fire fighting.</P>
    <P>There are not adequate provisions in this Bill dealing with the protection of the skin and hands of workers. Safety gloves should be provided in many instances.  Far too many people suffer from skin diseases which they have contracted at work; dermatitis is just one of these.  Many of these diseases could be prevented if more care were taken in the initial stages. The simplest method of prevention is the provision of gloves, especially in industries where there is a likelihood of sores or skin rashes.  Skin diseases are very common in this country and every effort should be made to prevent them.</P>
    <P>I now refer to planning applications. In the early stages there is much emphasis on the external environment and there is not sufficient emphasis on controls and standards inside factories. Many industrialists, having built factories, find that the fire officer then comes along with a lot of regulations. Such regulations should be specified in the planning permission. This would avoid such situations. More co-ordination is necessary between the planning officers and the fire prevention officers.</P>
    <P>A sizeable number of people will be <Col N="1299" /> needed to enforce the provisions of this Bill.  It will be necessary to increase the number of inspectors attached to the Department of Labour. It is important to ensure that industrialists will not be delayed and there must be a sufficient number of people to carry out this task efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>: When first I became aware of the Minister's intention to introduce a Bill dealing with safety in industry, I was fairly happy.  Realising the shortcomings of the present legislation and the improvements and the sophistication of industry today, I thought this was badly needed.  Having seen the Bill and read the Minister's speech, I am rather disappointed.  The Bill is completely inadequate.</P>
      <P>It should have been realised that it was necessary to bring in a comprehensive Bill to deal fully and adequately with safety in industry and not merely to amend the Factories Act or to tinker around to find curative treatment.  This Bill totally ignores the Office Premises Act, 1958, and fails to cover in any way agricultural workers.  If my knowledge is correct, agricultural workers are covered by an Act which goes back to 1896 and nothing has been done since then, in spite of farm modernisation and the sophisticated machinery now used by farmers.</P>
      <P>There is no mention whatsoever of the health problem at work.  As one who spent many years on the factory floor and several years as a trade union official I realise the shortcomings of the present legislation.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. Health Services Eligibility: Motion (Resumed) .</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Connell on Tuesday, 16 May 1978:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, noting the serious and growing anomaly in the income eligibility limits of non-manual workers for health services and maternity care under the <Col N="1300" /> Health Acts relative to manual workers, and in particular noting that with rising income levels many thousands of non-manual workers are now excluded from free hospital care, calls on the Government to abolish all income limits forthwith.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that it is the Government's intention to review the income limits and criteria of eligibility for the purposes of limited eligibility for health services in conjunction with the introduction of a pay-related health and social insurance contribution scheme in April 1979&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Labour Party wish to emphasise that any income limit for cover under the Health Acts for any category of worker is fundamentally wrong.  We believe that there is a growing acceptance in our community that such an essential service as hospitalisation should be available to all persons, irrespective of income and category.</P>
      <P>In April 1974 the income limit for insurability under the Social Welfare Acts was abolished.  It was announced at that time that the income limit for limited eligibility under the Health Acts would also be abolished.  This decision was only deferred pending the completion of negotiations with the medical consultants.  In April 1974 an income limit of £2,250 was introduced pending the completion of negotiations. This income limit was raised to £3,000 in July 1976.  At present, approximately 38 per cent of the population are covered by the general medical services scheme and therefore have full eligibility for health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we know the extent of medical card issues, great doubt surrounds the extent of the availability of limited eligibility benefits.  The Department of Health's present estimate is that <Col N="1301" /> 50 per cent of the population are covered for limited eligibility.  There is, however, a margin of error, among other reasons because of the time lags between increases in incomes and the income limit being raised.  It must be pointed out that in 1958 some 90 per cent were covered by free and limited eligibility as opposed to the current estimate of 85 per cent.</P>
    <P>The remaining 15 per cent of the population are responsible for the full cost of any medical services they require. This 15 per cent can only insure themselves against such costs with the VHI, a private organisation.  I consider it intolerable and highly undesirable to have a situation where health insurance becomes a matter of indvidual concern for the worker without employer or State involvement, as is the case in VHI cover.  It must be noted that no provision is made by the VHI for cover against the costs involved in the birth of a child, cover that is available under the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>The present income limit of £3,000 for limited eligibility for non-manual workers was set in July 1976.  The scope of limited eligibility is declining rapidly due to changes in earnings since that date.  We believe that unless the income limit is abolished by the end of this year a high percentage of workers at present with limited eligibility will have no cover.  They will be forced to pay for the full cost of any medical services they require.  I am convinced from correspondence I have had and from complaints received from trade unions that acute difficulties have been created for large numbers of workers and there is the threat posed to many thousands more as income levels increased this year as a result of the national pay agreement and so on.</P>
    <P>Due to the present income limit of under £58 per week scores of thousands of non-manual workers in the public and private sectors are ineligible for free hospital treatment even though they are on comparatively low salaries, as we pointed out to the Minister.  I was astonished when the Minister on 1 March stated that non-manual workers who were eligible under the <Col N="1302" /> £3,000 a year limit when it was introduced in July 1976 would continue to be eligible for limited eligibility services at least until the beginning of 1979.  There seems to be a complete gap in communication between the Minister and myself in that regard. The Minister slid away from the implications of what we were referring to on 1 March and we let him get away with it.  Persons who exceeded £3,000 for the first time after 1 July 1976 will retain eligibility until at least the first Monday in 1979.  However, what was not mentioned by the Minister and was not mentioned in this debate were those people who were entitled to limited eligibility and whose income exceeded £3,000 prior to 1 July 1976 and who were cut off on 31 December 1977.  I put that point to the Minister but he slid away from the implications.  I want to know how many thousands of people are involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out that the first Monday of each successive year will be a cut-off point for further groups of people unless a new scheme is introduced immediately.  The Minister gave a correct answer to the question on 1 March but it was only half an answer.  I was astonished at his reply. The Minister knows much more about the implications of the cut-off point than he is prepared to concede.  He said that non-manual workers who were eligible under the £3,000 a year limit when it was introduced would continue to have eligibility.  I hope I have now convinced him that coverage until 1979 does not apply to employees whose earnings exceeded £58 per week due to increases other than increases under clause 3 of the national wage <Col N="1303" /> agreement.  Let him ask the staff of the Eastern Health Board who have been administering this scheme.  Perhaps the Minister will reissue some regulation. Perhaps his Department will get in touch with the administrative staffs of the health boards but I have been assured that apart from the increases covered by clause 3 of the national wage agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: On a point of order, this is a very important point.  Deputy O'Connell was very anxious yesterday that we should clear up the situation for the benefit of all concerned.  I wish to state quite categorically that the source of income has nothing whatever to do with it.  It does not matter where the money comes from.  It is the amount of income received that matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am delighted to hear that, but I suggest that the Minister informs the administrative staffs of the health boards.  Workers come to me, they come to Deputy Barry in Cork and they come to organisations such as the Post Office Workers' Union, the Distributive Workers' Union and to the appropriate sector of the ICTU and they say that overtime payments, incremental increases, productivity increases and so on are sufficient to rule out a person for eligibility.  There is a major anomaly here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to contrast the situation with the farming community, which the Minister dealt with competently in his speech yesterday and which Deputy O'Connell also stressed.  Farmers with a rateable valuation of £60 a year are eligible for limited eligibility services under the Health Acts.  The Government acknowledged in the recent budget that that rateable valuation is equivalent to an annual income of at least £5,400 per year.  This means that farmers with an income of up to £100 a week are eligible for hospital services and maternity care under the Health Acts, whereas non-manual workers with an income over £58 a week must pay for the full cost of these medical services.  That is an outrageous anomaly.  One should not have <Col N="1304" /> to wait until April 1979&mdash;and I have the gravest doubts about that date&mdash; for the Minister to eliminate that anomaly.</P>
    <P>I accept that the present system for determining eligibility is extremely complex and I accept that it contains many anomalies.  The Minister gave an excellent example last night where a foreman in a pub is ruled to be a non-manual worker and the man behind the bar is a manual worker.  I could give many more anomalies.  A man driving an engine is deemed to be a manual worker but the person checking the tickets is a non-manual worker.  These beautiful distinctions were introduced by Fianna Fáil&mdash;servants and nonservants. Such distinctions destroy social structures and are completely discriminatory.  The whole system is enormously expensive to administer.</P>
    <P>This problem can be resolved only by the abolition of the income limit for non-manual workers.  I would urge the Government not to fall into the trap.  There is a tremendous temptation open to the Minister here.  All hell will break loose if the temptation is yielded to to introduce a new eligibility limit, a new cut-off point for manual and non-manual workers, that is to make it £5,000 or £6,000 a year and if a manual worker goes over £5,000 he will be hammered.  I suspect the Minister would love to yield to that temptation but he knows the political consequences of it.  That would mean that manual workers for the first time would have an outstanding service, which they have had down through the years, taken away overnight.  That would be enough to get Fianna Fáil out of power in the next election without any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>Thousands of workers are now affected because they cannot afford to wait until April 1979.  There is no assurance that the system will be in operation by April 1979.  I know the staff involved.  I know the Revenue Commissioners' problems and I know the problems of introducing a pay-related social insurance contributory system.  I know those problems are connected with the health services as well.  God help the Minister if he dares to bring in a 1 per cent or 2 per cent clawback <Col N="1305" /> on salaries in terms of the health services. It is bad enough getting an 8 per cent increase under a national pay agreement to be told the following year: &ldquo;now we will take 2 per cent back because we will give you an extension of the health services&rdquo;.  This would cause great problems for the Minister.  There are major administrative and political problems to be resolved which are currently being tossed around the Cabinet and I do not see those problems resolved by next April.</P>
    <P>The Minister met the congress representatives on 19 December 1977.  It was emphasised to him that the decision was urgently necessary and that further delay in rectifying the injustices and anomalies inherent in the present situation could not be tolerated.  The Minister was then informed that thousands of workers on comparatively low salaries were losing eligibility.  One of the factors we must bear in mind here is that the Government have implemented reduced social insurance contributions for insured people earning less than £50 per week.  The Government have explicitly acknowledged in that that £50 a week is a relatively low pay threshold.  It was some considerable time ago that that £50 was announced by the Minister but the operation of the income limit for non-manual workers for eligibility for hospital treatment and maternity care is not significantly above this figure of low pay.  It is £58 per week.  If one adjusted, even on a pay increase basis or a cost of living basis, the £50 from the time the Minister previously announced it, it would be around £58 now.  It means that people on comparatively low incomes are losing eligibility. I do not accept the argument that if people are knocked out they can well afford the cost.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is necessary for me to repeat any other examples of the anomalies which have arisen in making a distinction between manual and non-manual workers.  I believe that any discrimination in a socially just society, based on category of worker, must be unacceptable.  Apparently the working party on the definition of limited eligibility, set up by the Department of Health in January 1977 by the then <Col N="1306" /> Minister for Health, Deputy Brendan Corish, have not been able to resolve these problems.  The Minister must know that the only way they can be satisfactorily resolved is by the abolition of the income limit for non-manual workers in order to bring them into line with manual workers.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to the NESC Report, No. 29, published last July which conclusively refuted the arguments put forward against the abolition of the income limit on eligibility and, in particular, expose the absurdity of the distinctions made between manual and non-manual workers.  The Minister is well aware that we have pressed for an immediate decision on the matter. Trade Unions, in particular, are astonished, that no decision has been reached.  I could quote what was said about this matter in the Garda Editorial, <i>The Garda Review</i> and many other magazines where industrial and private sector workers are astonished that the Minister has not given a decision.  It is no use saying that people are all right until the end of the year and that there is nothing to be worried about.  Everybody is worried stiff as national pay agreements occur and their health costs increase.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows a universal limited eligibility has been rejected by the consultants.  I consider that Deputy Haughey is a most competent politician, that he is superb in many ways.  I would not agree with him on many things but as a politician and a Minister he has a lot of experience and I believe he is the man to take on this job.  The Minister said he would go down in the history of the country as the best Minister for Health the country ever had.  Now is his chance to prove that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>: I never said that. That would be a form of egotism which is not natural to my character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: That may be a Freudian slip, but we will continue. The consultants and the doctors maintain that if we had a universal limited eligibility there would be a massive increase in demand for the health services. The NESC Report, which dealt <Col N="1307" /> with some major issues in health policy, suggested that the demand for hospital care is quite low.  The last place on earth I want to go is into hospital.  The people in Ireland are not rushing into hospitals demanding hospitalisation.  They also suggested that the extension of limited eligibility to the remaining 15 per cent not covered would not result in them demanding immediate hospitalisation as the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union suggest.  They are trade unionists but when it comes to professional care and so on the delivery of income is far more important than the delivery of health care.  I say that with the greatest respect to my collague, Deputy O'Connell.</P>
      <P>I suggest that patients by and large demand care when they are not well. Some of the 15 per cent would inevitably opt to continue using private facilities.  The public expenditure implications lashed around the place by the medical profession of universal limited eligibility are quite small.  The medical associations unambiguously predict massive demands but their predictions are quite contrary to the evidence of health care systems in other countries.  The doctors are the very people who determine by and large the demand for hospital beds. People do not go to doctors telling them to send them into hospital. People want to be cured.</P>
      <P>The NESC Report pointed out that it is the doctor who translates an in-individual demand for help into an effective claim on resources.  I agree with the report when they said:</P>
      <P>Doctors ration scarce health care resources and their power to ration scarce hospital bed care would be no less under the universal limited eligibility that we feel is bound to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the case is quite clear. The Minister should tell certain people to go away.  Limited eligibility will cost a certain amount of money but I believe that a careful costing within the Department will show that it will not cost a great deal of money.  I also <Col N="1308" /> believe that the cost of administering the current complex programme of full and limited eligibility must be substantial.  Perhaps in the research section of the Minister's Department a very careful assessment has been made of the saving which would be possible if means testing was abolished.  I am quite convinced that if one asked each of the health board programme managers tomorrow morning &ldquo;How many of your staff are actually engaged in processing those claims?  Let us release them to do more protective work for the community&rdquo;, one would discover that the savings would be quite substantial.  The present system is an administrative clumsiness and costliness.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on this note.  The late Deputy Donogh O'Malley went out to the NUJ Conference in Bray and shocked everybody out of their trousers, including the then Taoiseach, and announced free post-primary education.  He had to explain himself to the next Cabinet meeting as to what in God's name he was up to.  He said that it was their problem.  He told many a story about it.  He said, to the then Taoiseach, &ldquo;Your problem is to find the money.  I made the decision. I made the historic announcement.&rdquo; The present Minister for Health and Social Welfare should do a similar thing and say to his colleague, the Minister for Finance &ldquo;Now, George, your problem is to find the money.  I have got a lot of votes for my party at the next general election.  I have made an historic decision.&rdquo;  Then, of course, he could disappear to Kerry onto his island away from the consultants before they got him to change his mind.  The Minister should take an historic decision this year and I have no doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister knows precisely what it would cost.  In <Col N="1309" /> all seriousness it would have a traumatic effect on the situation at present obtaining in which many constituents I represent are quite uncertain as to their rights, quite apprehensive and even confused as to their precise eligibility.  Above all, I believe a genuine injustice is being done, that of, say, somebody coming out of a hospital, getting a bill, checking it out and being told: &ldquo;You are out.&rdquo;  That kind of traumatic experience for individuals and families is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>I have approached the subject as far as I possibly could on a non-ideological basis, on as factual a basis as possible on the grounds that I want to see discrimination, class distinction, the professional cosiness, the particular allocations of resources to individuals within the profession, ended in the health services.  Successive Ministers did not do it.  They took on the last Minister for Health and they beat him. I believe the present Minister can do it. I also believe, in total deference to my colleague, Deputy O'Connell and other members of the medical profession, we would have a better health service, we would have consultants who would know where they were; the Medical Union and the Irish Medical Association would know exactly where they were in terms of the future development of the health services of this country and that we would have a national health service of which we would all be proud.</P>

Therefore, the Minister may well be the best Minister for Health in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I agree fully with the Minister when he says there is urgent need to review the <Col N="1310" /> income limit of £3,000 for eligibility for hospital and maternity services.</P>
      <P>It is quite unnerving to sit here listening to irresponsible talk about giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the Department of Health to extend the service without making any provision for the cost of such extension.  I am not sure if the last speaker was being serious or glib about a very important area of health care here.  The present Minister for Health is absolutely concerned about the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, is constantly in touch with the situation on a day-to-day basis.  To listen to speakers making such remarks without making positive provision for a bland extension of the health services is quite appalling.</P>
      <P>I have always been critical of the manner in which limits are structured, particularly in relation to the health services.  This limit of £3,000 is no exception to that criticism.  Before discussing the pros and cons of the limit itself it is important to bear in mind that a new set of circumstances will prevail next April when the new scheme of pay-related contributions by workers will be implemented.  This will represent a new departure in health care to cover a sector of the community and replacing the present fixed contribution of 50p.  We all realise that the present limit of £3,000 is inadequate. We are all in agreement on that but it is a matter of trying to devise, formulate and cost-out a more efficient system.  It is more important to be able to operate a higher level of efficiency within the health services and not merely throw out figures and limits merely for the sake of political gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was very interesting to hear the Minister in his speech last evening trace the history of the limit of eligibility from £600 in 1953 to £3,000 in 1976.  I was prompted to make some calculations of the purchasing power of the £ in that period.  For instance, the purchasing power of the £ in 1953 compared with 1978 represents £5, or five times the amount.  Yet in medical terms that is not a realistic assesment at all because medicines, patient requirements, the complexity of the health services, cost of hospitalisation and so on have become far more <Col N="1311" /> sophisticated and complex.  Indeed the demands on doctors and so on are more immense.  Let us say that £1 in 1953 would have purchased an enormous amount of medical aid compared with, say, £5 in 1978.  The Minister's approach of trying to relate the amount of contribution to what a person earns is a sensible and constructive one.  In passing it is my belief that private medicine and health care should work in harmony with the health services; both must be dove-tailed and operate complementary to each other.  There is a place for both services.  If you like, there must be the competitive element interacting between the health services and private medicine.  It is strictly in the interests of the patient to maintain the highest possible standard of health care.</P>
    <P>At this juncture it is important to take a look at the entire percentage of persons covered under the various health services.  We have, say, 38 per cent covered by medical cards; 45 per cent would be covered under the limit of £3,000 we are now debating and the remaining 15 to 20 per cent would have no cover themselves at all but could attain cover through the voluntary health insurance scheme or any other private insurance cover available. It is my belief that a free-for-all hospital service would not necessarily lead to efficiency in the running of hospitals.  Anyone familiar with the waiting lists in hospitals and the pressures that are occurring would quickly realise that just by extending overnight, as was suggested earlier, the entire service would in no way lead to a more comprehensive or efficient service from the patients' point of view.  And this is all that matters.  The service in the UK leaves a great deal to be desired from the point of view of the level of efficiency operating in the national health service there.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent, harmonious relationship between doctors working in private practice and specialists as well and, indeed, in our public health care also.  What is needed here is the highest level of efficiency, constantly monitored by the Department of Health.  This particular area of the <Col N="1312" /> £3,000 limit is one area being closely scrutinised by the Minister at the moment.  The complexity of eligibility also arises.  It is not clearly understood by many what they are eligible for. Many people feel when they attain a certain standard of earnings&mdash;£3,000 in this case&mdash;they cease to have any cover.  It may not be widely understood, but it is a fact, that people have this cushioning or buffer period of two years extra cover.  It is a carry-over period which protects them.  Many people do not realise that.  I would suggest that it might be a constructive exercise if the Minister were to mount some publicity campaign informing workers they are entitled to this carry-over period.  It is something that is not clearly understood.  I know literature has been put out and the book produced by the Department of Social Welfare is excellent.  However, a quick reminder to people moving out of the £3,000 upper limit that they are entitled to an extra two years carry-over period would be a good idea.  I have run into many cases where people were pleasantly surprised to learn their benefits continued on.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about 1.3 million people or roughly 45 per cent of the population covered by this scheme. As I and previous speakers have said, we are unhappy about the level.  It is not in present money terms in line with what we would all like it to be.  However, let us take the years between 1973 and 1976 during which we had an accumulated inflation of nearly 86 per cent.  In the early part of last year inflation was running at close to 18 or 19 per cent.  This meant that 100 per cent inflation had occurred in four years.  The limit was set in 1974 at £2,250.  In 1976 it was increased to £3,000.  That rate of increase is slightly less than 30 per cent.  Yet, in that space of time, the accumulated inflation rate was running at nearly 60 per cent. There is really no gain, therefore, in finger pointing and saying that the level is now totally out of place.  We all realise that.  We all realise a more efficient system is needed instead of just striking upper limits of eligibility.  It would be more prudent to wait until next <Col N="1313" /> year when a new set of levels will prevail, a new pay related structure for health contributions.  It would be imprudent to tamper with the present highly complex system.  The gain would be minimal and perhaps cause more confusion in an already confused situation.</P>
    <P>Where health is concerned rigid income levels of eligibility are not always the answer.  Hardship cases are accommodated under the health services. This is a good thing.  I would prefer to see a sliding scale of benefit and contribution. Health is not just a black and white issue in which you can fix a certain level.  This is what was done in the past.  There are many shades of grey and there is a big area for examination here.  I have every confidence that the Minister and his Department are actively engaged in endeavouring to structure out the best formula whereby persons who fall into this category will benefit to the maximum degree.</P>
    <P>Here, perhaps, we should take a look at the highly efficient working of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. Maybe there is some area here that could be copied by the Department of Health.  Perhaps it would be possible to allow workers to invest in whatever scale of eligibility they want with, of course, a minimum level.  Maybe it would be possible to give them the option of buying extra benefit, if they wish to do so, provided they invest through their employment structure in a minimum level and their employers are given the option of investing more to give their employees that extra benefit if they desire it.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board is an excellent body.  It has served the community in a very desirable manner since its inception.  Perhaps there is a case to examine the giving of a flexible system of coverage to workers.  Everyone realises that people are at their most vulnerable when they are ill in hospital.  They certainly do not want to be burdened by large hospital bills, by worry and the anxiety of trying to cost out of their budget how they will meet these bills. The Minister is aware of this.  He has made many statements to the effect <Col N="1314" /> that he is engaged in a very critical overhaul and examination of the level of cover that people can be given within the health services.  But money cannot just be printed and lashed out just for the sake of doing something. It does not follow that by providing money you will solve a problem.  You have to get to the root cause of the problem and correct it at the root and then by all means spend the extra money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear that he is not satisfied with the criteria of eligibility.  Over the years anomalies have developed in the system, the principal one being the distinction between manual and non-manual workers.  It is all very well to say in 1978 that there should be no distinction between manual and non-manual workers, but this is discrimination and so on.  But 20 years ago, or less, manual workers had to be protected within the health service.  This is a carry-over from that time.  The Minister is aware of this.  Perhaps it is an unfortunate distinction that has been made through the years; nobody likes it but there was a time when it had to be made. We might be excused for saying now that it is a reflection of the advantages gained by manual workers in rates of pay and conditions generally.  This is a good thing but we must approach it constructively and not try to be divisive or create an attitude which does not necessarily exist among workers.  There were days when manual workers were badly paid and had poor security and were not getting a fair share of the cake.  This is why the distinction was made.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that it has given rise to an anomaly in eligibility for health services but seeing it in the broader context it could be regarded as the price of progress and a very good thing in a sense.  Perhaps the Minister could consider the advisability of a survey to try to quantify the percentage of manual and non-manual workers, possibly through the Revenue. If that information could be gathered it would be invaluable to his Department.</P>
    <P>The rate of inflation over the past few years has resulted in money losing <Col N="1315" /> value.  The rules of limited eligibility are such that they provide protection against large-scale loss of eligibility in times of declining money value.  The Minister has made a clear statement and because of its importance and the misunderstanding that seems to have persisted in this debate it is necessary to underline it.  All insured workers who were eligible because their earnings came within the £3,000 limit when it was introduced in July 1976 are still eligible and will retain eligibility at least until the beginning of 1979.  It does not matter what was the source of the increase in their income.  That is a factual statement of the position. This might be criticised in the system of limited eligibility.  For example, if through some good fortune a worker whose pay is within the limit receives a massive increase in pay which puts him into the wealthy class, he retains his eligibility.  This carry-over period is most important.</P>
    <P>One benefit of this carry-over entitlement period is that it gives time to study how the system operates, its defects and the changes that can be made.  The Minister has assured us that this is being done.  He has highlighted some of the defects and indicated his intention of remedying them so far as is reasonably possible.  He has accepted that the £3,000 limit is now out of date and urgently needs review.  For reasons I have given I do not feel it is absolutely necessary that this should be done immediately.  Hasty action now could cause more problems in the long term.  Therefore the Minister's amendment to the motion is sensible and worthy of support.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins last night and Deputy Desmond this evening said that the carry-over provision applies only if the increase in income is due to the national wage agreement.  The Minister clarified this position briefly but it is important to refer to it again.  Any worker whose pay was within the £3,000 limit in July 1976 was eligible then and retains eligibility until the beginning of 1979 irrespective of the source of the increase.  Wage agreement considerations do not apply here. <Col N="1316" /> Even a change of employment would not matter, or if the extra money was earned from two jobs, he would still retain eligibility.  The misunderstanding might have arisen due to a provision made in 1976 which related to payments under the national wage agreement.  Under that specific provision a person whose remuneration went from less than £2,250 to more than £3,000 between April 1974 and July 1976 by virtue of pay awards under the national wage agreement was allowed to retain eligibility for one year in addition to the normal carry-over entitlement period.  That provision was designed to meet a special situation which obtained then and affected only a limited number of people and was of limited duration.  It did not affect the normal carry-over period.  This may have caused the confusion.  The carry-over period protects workers for its duration and this is the important point.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell produced estimates of what it would cost to extend free hospital service to the entire community. He estimated it would cost £12.5 million.  I do not think that takes into account the cost of hospital maintenance for persons who are now ineligible.  It is costed only for those who are eligible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  The costs I gave were for those who were not eligible and who were using the VHI.  Based on the VHI figures they are for people who are ineligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>: There would be a substantial loss of income from ineligible persons who now make a payment towards their hospital service but who under a free-for-all scheme would be entitled to receive the services without charge.  In addition, there would be an extra cost through the payment of subventions on behalf of patients in private accommodation, patients who are now ineligible for such subventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point was made by Deputy Collins concerning the position of persons who on starting work have an income above the limit of £3,000.  He pointed out that such persons would <Col N="1317" /> not have an opportunity of availing of the benefits of the scheme.  A number of points arise here.  A person coming into that standard of wage earning straight from school is on his way to very high levels of wage earning.  It could also be argued that at that age there is not the same danger of needing hospital treatment as there would be at a later age.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the House should treat this matter very cautiously and be prepared to give the Minister the opportunity of formulating a very much more workable system than that which pertained in the past.  I have every confidence this is being done.  It would be the height of folly to tamper with the present system.  It has to be coaxed along now, bearing in mind that the carry over period will protect people who might feel they are ineligible at the moment.  I urge the Minister to point this out quite clearly by way of press advertisements if necessary, to indicate to people that they have this extra period of time and this extra eligibility of which they might not be aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this motion because it is very serious.  The income level is causing tremendous hardship to a large number of people. I am at a loss to understand why the income limit cannot be adjusted as a matter of course.  No great mechanism is required to lift it to £4,500 or £5,000. It would not affect the smooth running of the health services in any way. There is no will to do this.  It is quite clear the reason is simply that there is no money and no money will be made available.</P>
      <P>I want to make the point that when a bank went bankrupt, there was money to compensate the shareholders, people who invested and took a risk at high interest rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not discussing banks.  I am discussing the fact that money is not available for hardship but it can be made available in other areas to people not suffering the same degree of hardship.  I am at a loss to know why that happened.  Large numbers of people genuinely thought they were covered under the health services but when they were hospitalised they got sizeable bills.  When they disputed them, they were told they were non-manual workers.  In many cases they were engaged in manual work.  Who decided whether this job is manual and that job is non-manual?  That is a very <Col N="1319" /> moot point.  In the case of many people I know, a great deal of the content of their work was manual but when they sought the cover and protection of the Health Act they found they had not got it.</P>
      <P>A man with five or six children earning £3,000 a year has not got much scope to provide cover for himself and his family.  Great stress is now laid on health and preventive medicine and care but a man who has not got the wherewithal may have to deprive himself and his family of much needed health care because the Minister will not accept this motion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brady sat on the fence.  He did not know whether to agree or disagree with the motion.  His view was that he saw hardship and he saw the need for the motion, but obviously on the instructions of his Minister he could not support it.  I am more than surprised that no action is being taken. This is a breach of faith on the part of the Minister, or perhaps he is not responsible. Perhaps the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development sent out the instruction that they are not giving any more money for health.  That appears to be the trend.  Will we improve our health services?  No; we will run them down.  There is no question about that. If there were any genuine concern, this motion would be accepted.  What would it cost to raise the thresholds to a reasonable figure?  I doubt that it would put any great strain on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last June we had plenty of money for this gimmick and that gimmick, but now when we get down to the very bedrock of society, the health of the people, we have not got the money.  It is an indictment of the Government that they will not provide this type of money.  It is not a great deal, but I suppose if you are broke you cannot pay.  They could go with the begging bowl and borrow more.  This is something worth borrowing for.  As we have to wait until April 1979, non-manual workers in particular will have to remain healthy until then as they cannot afford <Col N="1320" /> to be hospitalised in the meantime. There is no point in saying that they can join the VHI, that they can join this and that.  They will not have eligibility for a number of months but in the meantime they are contributing to social welfare and are not receiving any benefits.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that this motion has not been accepted.  The anomalies between manual and non-manual workers in these days of automation are not easily seen.  Nowadays one wonders who is manual and who is non-manual.  If you were a manual worker two years ago you could now be sitting behind a fancy control board operating switches.  Is a bus driver or a bus conductor a manual worker?  Is a barman a manual worker?  The situation is farcical and I am surprised that action cannot be taken.  I know several people in my constituency who received help when they needed it.  Afterwards they were presented with the bill which they could not pay.  These bills should be paid as an interim arrangement until we come to a satisfactory settlement in April 1979.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister realises the stress and hardship that is being created at present?  It is not good enough to sympathise with these people because sympathy cannot pay the Eastern Health Board or any other health board.  I am not blaming the Minister for this severe breach of faith. If the Minister controlled the pursestrings I am sure he would be only too willing to agree with the motion. He is obviously under orders not to accept the motion.  I would ask him to consider the financial structures of his Department to see if any cutback can be made to meet the situation until April 1979.  If the £3,000 limit had been linked with the cost-of-living index we would not be appealing to the Minister to do what is just and right.  However, that has not happened and, consequently, we are faced with a serious situation.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister will not meet this motion.  He admits that there are anomalies but says that they will be eradicated when the new scheme is introduced in April, <Col N="1321" /> 1979.  That is all very fine but we cannot wait that long.  We must not allow people to be exposed to the dangers in which they will have to put themselves because of their noncover. The denial of this motion means that we are putting people at risk and this is a serious matter.  What can I tell them when they come to see me? I cannot tell them to wait until April 1979.  I will have to tell them that the Minister will not increase the thresholds because there is no money in the kitty.</P>
    <P>The Government have deprived this area by overspending in other areas. In their first few months in office there were fanfares of trumpets coming from the Department of Health about all the great things they were going to do.  This is the first measure that we have pressed for, and rightly so.  I do not know the amount of money that would be involved in improving the service.  Whether it was a great amount or a small amount of money it would alleviate stress and hardship.  There is no point in telling someone that he is not entitled to cover because he is a non-manual worker.  People who earn £58 per week are not covered.  It is the worst type of hypocrisy to blow our trumpets about the great health service that we are going to have.  It does not do this House any good when we use it as a platform for PR exercises and for self-glorification.  The test is here.  If we are so concerned we should deliver the goods instead of shillyshallying. A case cannot be made against immediately raising the thresholds.  There is no point in the Minister talking about the great scheme which he intends to introduce.  We want the money on the table now.  We cannot put so many people with such low incomes at risk.  We have heard of America as the country where you have to have the readies in before you go in through the hospital door.  They have a reasonable degree of wealth. The people I am talking about with large families and that kind of income are relatively poor, but they will have to have the money before they will be signed into hospital now.  Is that our new approach?  Is that our social conscience towards health?  I hope it <Col N="1322" /> is not.  If it is, God help the health of this nation; it will deteriorate.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to stand up and be critical of the Minister not accepting this motion, but I know the hardship that Deputies, particularly in urban areas, see among people who are non-manual workers on low incomes&mdash;and a large number of them are because their social status has changed slightly.  Many years ago manual workers were the badly paid section, but because of changes in technology and emphasis on industry the manual worker now is well paid, and rightly so.  But the non-manual worker now is the one left behind in earning, and we should recognise this. To give this recognition surely we must raise the income allowance. What should be done is abolish the non-manual and manual situation. That can be done at the stroke of a pen and surely there will be no opposition to that, and it will give the people the protection they deserve and should have but are not getting.  I appeal to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>: This motion in the name of the Labour Party has given all of us an opportunity to debate the issue and to highlight the gross injustice in the present system.  We must be clear about what we are asking the House to do.  We are not asking the House to extend the income limit for eligibility.  We are asking for total abolition of the limit for eligibility. This motion which asks us to increase the £60 valuation is not our motion and I am totally opposed to it.  We are <Col N="1323" /> not asking the House to bring the millionaire farmers into the scheme. We are not asking it exclusively for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy is talking about bringing in the millionaire farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, but we are not asking that we merely extend the income limit for eligibility and at the same time bring in the millionaire farmers.  That is contrary to our thinking. The £60 valuation for farmers is the equivalent of £5,400 a year which represents £108 per week.  We are talking about the gross injustice in the situation of the farmers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the urban worker with £57.70 per week at present but we do not think that extending the limit of eligibility will correct it.</P>
      <P>Since I moved this motion in the House I have been inundated with telephone calls about people who were barely above the £3,000 on 1 July 1976, some of them by as little as £20, and they are ineligible for free hospitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: How much have they now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>: The amount at the moment would be about £4,000 and they are ineligible.  This is a gross injustice and a considerable hardship to them.  If we take the £3,000 on 1 July 1976 and bring it into line with the cost of living allowing for a 14 per cent increase last year and an 8 per cent increase this year, we would be talking in terms of £71 per week at the moment.  They would have been eligible immediately and they would have been covered.  There are 85,000 people involved in that.  That is not my figure, it is the Department's figure, and represents a lot of hardship for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has on his hands a big problem which he has inherited.  It is a problem which has arisen over the years.  As the Minister has emphasised, it is the case of the manual workers&mdash;<Col N="1324" /> who were lowly paid at one time but who, through the strength of unions, have achieved their rights&mdash;and of the non-manual workers, who have no industrial muscle to bring their levels of payment or their salaries into line with what they should be at present and therefore they find themselves in a predicament.  It is grossly unfair to leave such people out.  The Minister cannot resolve it by deciding next April to declare a ceiling of £6,000.  I do not exaggerate when I say that there are manual workers getting £10,000 a year at the moment or £200 a week, and they are entitled to free hospitalisation.  If next April the Minister should bring in this new arrangement making the cut-off point £120 per week he would render ineligible at least 200,000 manual workers.  There would be an outcry and they could take the Minister to court for depriving them of their established rights.  The Minister is doing his best and I know he wants to resolve this.  The working party did not really come up with an answer.  They threw more anomalies in the Minister's way.  They did not solve the problem for him.  Therefore, he has a problem on his hands and I do not envy him.  It is not his fault; it has arisen over the years, but it causes tremendous injustice.</P>
    <P>It would be in the interest both of the Minister and of the Department to solve this problem once and for all. Incidentally, Fine Gael have not declared their views or their policy on this matter.  They talk, though, of extending the limit but it is time for them to declare their position and to say whether they are in favour of free hospitalisation.  That is what is involved&mdash;free hospitalisation for the extra 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that as soon as such a scheme is introduced people opt for hospitalisation.  The evidence is that this is not the case.  So far as we are concerned the 15 per cent who are excluded are in the professional class. They are not the lower income group and, consequently, they are not the people who make the demands on hospitals. Given the Minister's positive moves in the field of preventive medicine and having regard to the realisation <Col N="1325" /> on the part of doctors and consultants that hospitalisation is not the answer or that hospitalising one for the purpose of investigations is not necessarily the answer, there is not likely to be a tremendous demand for hospital beds.  If we were talking only about the lower income group, the situation might be different but that is not the case.  Many tests and investigations can be done outside the hospital. If we streamlined many of the diagnostic and out-patient services we would not need to send so many people to hospital.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a further 7 per cent or so would avail of free hospitalisation.  It could be argued in relation to maternity services that when we discouraged the practice of babies being delivered at home we threw a tremendous strain on the maternity hospitals.  That was not the case but the result of that change was that the lives of many babies were saved who would otherwise have died as a result of not being delivered in proper conditions.</P>
    <P>We must not continue to impose hardship on people who cannot afford hospitalisation.  One man I spoke to recently told me that because he is only slightly over the limit for free hospitalisation he must pay and that his bills are colossal.  People in that situation are reluctant to go to hospital. This can happen where there is danger of cancer or of something requiring urgent attention.  The person says he will not bother having attention, that he will wait and perhaps the problem will go away.  For such people the fear is not necessarily of hospitalisation but of the financial problems that would follow.  We must realise that those people who from 1 July have incomes of even slightly more than £3,000 will be caused hardship in the event of having to go to hospital.  If they have children at school and all the other costs that go with living today they will have enough on their plate already without the added burden of hospital bills.  I am pleading the hardship clause for such people but that is a degrading procedure.  It is humiliating to have to supply such information and very often what happens is that a man will borrow from the credit union rather than plead hardship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> I know that there is rapport between the Minister and the profession.  Once the profession are assured that they will not be steamrolled into any situation, they will co-operate with the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister would consider indexing the £3,000 category by way of ministerial order.  That would not cost a lot of money.  I am sure it would not cost any more than invoking the hardship clause for the people concerned.  The Minister might consider that as a temporary measure and not for those who were in the £3,000 bracket on 1 July 1976.  The Minister was absolutely right in what he had to say about the situation.  The health board corroborated everything he had to say in that regard.  But if the Minister could see fit to introducing a temporary measure in order to deal with the situation of the other people involved he would be doing a good day's work.  I am convinced that in any such move he would have the co-operation of the doctors.  Anybody wishing to introduce a system must have the co-operation of the people who are expected to work that system but first there must be consultation. That is one of the principles of trade unionism.  On the last occasion consultation did not take place.  The doctors' objection was that they were simply told that the system was being introduced.  Secondly, there was a lack of understanding in the whole area of payment to doctors.  Again, that was a bad mistake.  There is no point in anyone saying that the doctors forced the then Minister to capitulate.  We were all deluded on this score and the question was put into cold storage in the name of the Finlay Review Body.  In other words, it was put into a limbo.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to introduce acrimony to the situation.  However, I am putting it on the record that there was no question at that time of the profession refusing to co-operate but they did not wish to be left in a state of suspended animation.  They wanted a solution.  Many of them said they would work a salary system for oncall service but there was no question of the Department negotiating with them so that they were never made a firm offer by the Department.  The doctors like any other organised group <Col N="1327" /> are looking for a living.  They, too, have a trade union.  No one would wish them to have to work the old iniquitous pool system whereby a surgeon received £6 for a major heart operation.  It is important that we realise what is involved in the motion, that is, the abolition of income limits <Col N="1328" /> in respect of eligibility for hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>In this examination of the situation I am confident that the Minister will realise that this is the only answer to the problem, that it is the only way of eliminating the problem of manual versus non manual workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Data for purposes of conservation and management of stocks at international level is collected on the basis of statistical areas drawn up by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.  Most of these areas encompass waters within the fishery limits of more than one country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> The state of the stocks of the more important species in these areas is reviewed regularly by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea of which Ireland is a member, and which recommends the desirable maximum level of exploitation.  These recommendations form the basis of the EEC Commission's proposals for the total allowable catches within the waters of the member states of the European Communities.</P>

It is only introduced where the school authorities and the principal teacher are in favour of the method and the teachers involved voluntarily undertake it.</P>
