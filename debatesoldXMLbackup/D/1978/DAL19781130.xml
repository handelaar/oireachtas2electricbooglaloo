    <Title>European Monetary System: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to make a statement to the House about my recent meetings with the President of the French Republic, the British Prime Minister and the German Federal Chancellor.</P>
      <P>The meetings were concerned mainly with the proposed establishment of a zone of monetary stability, designated a European Monetary System, primarily within the European Community.  The Minister for Finance and I outlined in this House on 17 October last the main principles of the proposed system and the possible benefits and disadvantages for Ireland: and the House debated the issue over five days in all.  While there have been developments and provisional agreements have been reached by the Council of Ministers in certain limited areas, the main features of the system remain as they were then outlined. However many important features remain to be considered by the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday next, 4 and 5 December.  These matters cannot be decided bilaterally.  They can be dealt with definitively only by the Nine in a Community framework.  The proposals have, therefore, not yet been finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the outstanding matters for discussion are of crucial importance in relation to a decision on this country's participation in the system.  I refer, in particular, to the conclusions to be reached on the Government's case that significant Community action is needed to strengthen the Irish economy in a new monetary system.  The position is that the final shape of the system is not decided and that the ultimate nature of the circumstances, by reference to which a decision on our participation would have to be taken, is known now in only marginally more detail than when the House debated the Conclusions of the European Council meeting here last October. Moreover, my recent meetings <Col N="411" /> have made it clear that these ultimate circumstances could not be inferred with any degree of confidence from the confidential documentation available as a result of the work undertaken by the Community bodies&mdash;the Monetary Committee, the Economic Policy Committee and the Committee of the Central Bank Governors&mdash;nor from the discussions hitherto in the Economic and Finance Council.  Accordingly, no purpose would be served by a further debate in the House before the meeting of the European Council nor by the publication of papers which could not advance knowledge on crucial issues beyond that given in the statements here by the Minister for Finance and myself on 17 October.  In this connection, it is essential to bear in mind that the Government remain in a negotiating situation.  No decision has been taken as yet, one way or the other, on participation in the system.</P>
    <P>However, while it is not proposed to hold a further debate nor to publish a White Paper before the Brussels Council, I fully intend to honour my previous commitments to the House and, in particular, my indication that it would not be my intention that Ireland should enter the EMS until the Dáil had had an opportunity for a further substantive debate.  The Bremen Conclusions contain the following statement:</P>
    <P>Decisions can then be taken and commitments made at the European Council on 4 and 5 December.</P>
    <P>That statement is, of course, an aspiration, indeed a commitment, but in the nature of things it cannot be a prophecy. I do not know if decisions will be taken or commitments entered into: neither does any other Head of Government. However, if agreed conclusions are being formulated and if, in my judgment of the emerging outcome of the meeting, the circumstances are right for Irish participation in an EMS likely to come into operation on 1 January, my commitment will be to recommend participation. If in these circumstances, the Government were to favour our membership, the matter would then be brought before the Dáil for approval <Col N="412" /> before the Christmas Recess and thus before our entry into the system.  As a basis for such a debate, it is, as I have said, proposed to publish a White Paper.</P>
    <P>The Government have received various representations on this subject, some of which have sought to have any decision deferred until consultations with the bodies making the representations and other interests have taken place.  I may say that the possible effects of membership on the economy and on its various sectors have been subjected to extensive examination since last July and that the results will be taken into account by the Government, against the background of the final circumstances of possible membership, in reaching their decision.  While it might be helpful if the time-table were to provide the opportunity of further consulations&mdash;which, it seems, it will not&mdash;the decisions involved are, in the final analysis, a matter, in our democratic system, for the Government and the Oireachtas.  All representations will of course be taken fully into account before final decisions are made.  My recent meetings have helped considerably, I believe, to prepare the ground for those decisions.</P>
    <P>At my meeting with President Giscard d'Estaing in Paris on 22 November, I told him that Ireland was anxious to join the new system because we had a deep commitment to the ideal of closer European integration within the Community and because of the potential economic advantages we saw in participation under the right circumstances.  I stressed that our decision depended entirely on the circumstances being favourable.  In this connection, I told him that the political commitment and psychological will were there but recalled the recognition by the European Council in Bremen that measures to strengthen the less prosperous economies within the Community would be essential for the success of the system and explained our case for financial assistance from the Community to offset the initial effects of the system, if we entered.</P>
    <P>The President, for his part, exhibited a strong wish to have Ireland enter the system from its inception.  He indicated his support and understanding of our position and recognised the merits of our <Col N="413" /> case for assistance to ensure a favourable environment for growth and investment in our economy.  He was not, of course, in a position to give any firm commitment to any particular level or form of aid.  Such a decision is for the Community as a whole and cannot be pre-empted by the outcome of bilateral consultations.</P>
    <P>We also discussed in a general way the President's proposal that &ldquo;Three Wise Men&rdquo; should be given the task of exploring the problems posed by enlargement in respect of institutions, mechanisms and procedures.  This matter is to be further discussed at next week's meeting in Brussels.</P>
    <P>At my meeting with Mr. Callaghan in London last Monday, we discussed the EMS, the &ldquo;Three Wise Men&rdquo; proposal, the forthcoming meeting of the European Council, the Common Agriculture Policy of the Community and fisheries. We also discussed Northern Ireland as part of the regular review of the situation there.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister told me that the British Government had not reached any decision on participation in EMS and I indicated that the Government here had likewise taken no decision as yet.  We had a wide-ranging review of the options, and as a result of our very full and constructive discussion I think it is fair to say that both sides have a very much clearer understanding of our respective positions.</P>
    <P>I found the Prime Minister shared my view that greater monetary stability was very desirable and in the long-term interests of both our economies, of the Community and of the world.  Mr. Callaghan showed the utmost goodwill and understanding of our position and expressed the wish that whatever happened and whoever joined or did not join in the EMS, the results would be in our interests.</P>
    <P>Our discussions on the Common Agriculture Policy revealed, not surprisingly, of course, differences of view and of approach.  Mr. Callaghan expressed well-known British views.  I stressed that where problems could be shown to exist, the solution to them should not involve modifications of the basic principles and mechanisms of the policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> In relation to Northern Ireland, I reiterated the approach I put forward when we met in September 1977, against the background of the proposed increase in the number of Northern Ireland members at Westminster, and indicated the Government's concern at the prospect of further integration.  The Prime Minister reiterated his Government's policy to the effect that they were not moving towards integration.  He also expressed satisfaction at the degree of security and economic co-operation.  We also took note of North-South aspects of EMS.</P>
    <P>At my talks with Chancellor Schmidt last Tuesday, the principal item that engaged our attention during our four-hour meeting was again the European Monetary System.  We also discussed fisheries, institutional questions, the domestic scene in both countries and general world trends.  I may say that our discussions were particularly cordial and constructive.</P>
    <P>On the EMS, I again set out very fully our attitude.  I was greatly encouraged by the Chancellor's very positive response.  He made very clear his strong desire to have Ireland within the system and his special interest in our remaining in it, in the event of a decision to join.  He expressed his understanding of our attitude and his willingness to support transfers of resources in the event of our entry.  Indeed, his response indicated that he will be prepared to support transfers to Ireland to the fullest possible degree. Methods of effecting these transfers were discussed.  Here again, I want to stress that there was no question&mdash;nor could there be&mdash;of settling in bilateral discussion matters on which the decision is for the Community, with the participation of all member states.  However, the Chancellor indicated that the German Presidency would make the fullest possible use of the time between our meeting&mdash;between last Tuesday and next Monday&mdash;and the European Council to formulate proposals for transfers on the lines we had been discussing, in preparation for the Council in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I maintained our position that grants should be the predominant element in transfers.  Our discussions revealed, however, a variety of possibilities by <Col N="415" /> which unsatisfactory features of some existing or possible new mechanisms to which I had drawn attention could be overcome.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the possibility of increased German investment in Ireland in the more favourable circumstances that participation in a zone of monetary stability, with substantially lower rates of price and cost inflation, could bring about over the medium-term.</P>
    <P>I may say that I came away from my discussion with Herr Schmidt much encouraged that it may prove possible to secure agreement in Brussels that will ensure the right circumstances in which to give effect to the Government's desire to join in this major new step on the way to closer European integration.</P>
    <P>In general, I think my discussions with all three Heads of State or Government greatly advanced mutual understanding of our positions and enabled me to form a clearer view of the likely position of the three leaders when we meet in Brussels, in the Community framework, to take decisions on the nature and form of the system.  On the basis of what happens at that meeting I would hope that the Government would be able to recommend to this House whether or not Ireland should participate in the system from the outset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, in relation to one aspect of the Taoiseach's speech, that part of his discussions with the British Prime Minister which concerned Northern Ireland and the British policy and tactics in relation to Northern Ireland, I trust that he expressed the depth of the concern that exists in all quarters here about the way in which British tactics in relation to Northern Ireland&mdash;perhaps it is too strong to say policy&mdash;have evolved.  I am speaking in particular in relation to the increase in seats under pressure from Loyalist members of the British Parliament and the refusal to introduce PR as a method of election for this purpose.  I trust the Taoiseach pointed out the phoney character of the so-called constitutional argument, that the method of election to <Col N="416" /> the British Parliament must be uniform, in view of the fact that in the past different electoral systems were employed for university and other seats, and the equally evident phoney character of the argument in view of the fact that the European elections in Northern Ireland will be conducted on the basis of PR.  It is important that the British Government should know that and I trust the Taoiseach conveyed the fact that the concern of everybody here is about the way in which the drift has set in in regard to British policy and tactics in relation to Northern Ireland and the adverse effects of this on the possibility of a solution being reached there in circumstances where otherwise the situation may be internally evolving somewhat more favourably with a view to some kind of a political solution.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the main burden of the Taoiseach's statement today relates to the European Monetary System.  During any negotiation of this kind the Opposition have to have regard to the importance of not prejudicing the national interest. The Government have in this case abused our forebearance.  The Taoiseach led the House, and the country, to believe that before a decision would be taken a document setting out the issues would be published and we would have a further debate in the House.  What he said at the time was clear.  He referred to the possibility that there might not be a decision at the meeting of the European Council, but it is now evident that a decision is strongly possible and, from the tone of his remarks, very likely.  In these circumstances the failure to publish the document and have a debate is a breach of what the House, and the country, clearly understood from what the Taoiseach said.  What was particularly deplorable was that when the Leader of the Labour Party and myself pressed the Taoiseach for further clarification of any ambiguity in his statement he met that with a show of petulance designed to prevent further questioning and by that means to carry through this evasion.  It is difficult to accept that type of approach to a matter as serious as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has alleged that a Green or White Paper could not be produced now, but when he was faced <Col N="417" /> with the fact yesterday that the British Government had produced a Green Paper, and when I pointed out to him that there was no reason why we should not, he suggested that the British Green Paper was of little value.  On reading through the British Green Paper one will see that it does not state what the British Government intend doing any more than the Taoiseach has formally announced his intentions in advance of the negotiations. However, the British Green Paper does a number of things which are useful and which would be extremely useful had something equivalent been done here.  That Paper sets out the characteristics that the British Government think a European Monetary System should have.  Our Government have not told us their view on this except &mdash;incidentally scrappily&mdash;in respect of one or two aspects.  There was no overall statement of their view of where Irish interests lie.  The British Green Paper also explains authoritatively the issues involved in the technical but potentially very important question of the &ldquo;parity grid&rdquo; approach as against the &ldquo;basket approach&rdquo; and the reasons for the British Government's preference for the latter.  I recognise this as a technical matter but at the same time I recognise its potential importance.  We should have had more discussion about Irish policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>We had some explanation by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development on this point but his explanation did not cover the ground adequately. Nothing was said by him about the importance to us, in view of the desirability of avoiding an unnecessary break of sterling parity, of the desirability of supporting that system most likely to enable Britain to come into the EMS if we have not ourselves any significant interest in supporting the alternative.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development conveyed to the House that in our case there do not exist compelling arguments for our economic situation in favour of the &ldquo;basket&rdquo; as against the &ldquo;parity grid&rdquo; approach situations which affect Britain. However, we have an interest in the British situation, and if there is no net balance advantage to us between the two <Col N="418" /> then we should have been told why we supported one which made it less likely that Britain would join when, in fact, it is in our interest that Britain and ourselves should join simultaneously.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper published by the British Government refers also to issues that remain outstanding concerning the splitting of credit between the short-and medium-term.  We have been told nothing about this matter.  The House, informed financial opinion and general public opinion have had no guidance on these issues.  We depend on the British Government and fragmentary newspaper reports for information.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 28 of the Green Paper states that the Irish Government &ldquo;support the British Government's argument in favour of a firm commitment to bring the pattern and scale of net resource transfers attributable to Community instruments into conformity with the Community's objective of bringing about convergence in economic performance of member States&rdquo;.  We all know that is British gobbledygook for dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy, disguised in phrases that are meant to sound harmless.  Why should we have to learn from the British Government what the Irish Government's attitude is, and do our Government realise the dangers of supporting Britain's policy in this area when this policy is directed primarily against the CAP?  Is this statement in the British Green Paper regarding the Irish Government's position correct?  We are entitled to know at least what is our Government's position.  We should not have to read the British Government's Green Paper to find out.  If it is correct, why are the Government supporting Britain on this issue where we have a contrary interest but apparently opposing Britain on the issue of the &ldquo;Parity-grid&rdquo; versus the &ldquo;basket&rdquo; where, according to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, we have no particular local domestic interest and where we have an interest in Britain joining?</P>
    <P>The Green Paper published by the British Government has a discussion of questions concerning the possible effects of joining the EMS on economic independence, on the battle against inflation, <Col N="419" /> on price competitiveness and the balance of payments.  We could do with some authoritative material from our Government on these issues but we are denied this and have to turn to a British document for it.</P>
    <P>We are also denied what the British Parliament has been permitted, debate at the final stage of negotiations before commitments are entered into.  As a result of the tactics pursued by the Taoiseach and his Government, while I am free to ask questions of legitimate concern to the Irish people, answers to which could not prejudice our negotiating position, the format of this discussion makes it impossible&mdash;and is deliberately designed to make it impossible&mdash;for me to receive answers before the fateful decision is taken.  In this connection the Taoiseach's comment this morning that the Bremen communiqué simply meant that there was an aspiration to take decision and that in some way this means there will not be decisions, is an obvious evasion.  The fact is that decisions are contemplated.  In his speech the Taoiseach made clear the possibility of entering into commitments on behalf of the Government and the Dáil which once entered into are unlikely to be overturned, given the parliamentary situation here.  He assured us that before decisions were taken there would be a debate and a document of some kind to set out the facts.  We have not had that.</P>
    <P>Although I cannot get answers today to the questions I shall put, nevertheless I intend to ask some of these questions. They are questions that relate to matters that do not affect our negotiating position. There are other questions I could ask but which I am deliberately refraining from asking because of the national interest.  I am confining myself to questions the asking of which will either not affect our bargaining situation or, in some respects, will strengthen it.  It certainly needs some strengthening after the events of the last few days.</P>
    <P>My first question is, if it is the Government's view, as reported, that the sum of £650 million in transfers over five years is the sum required if the United Kingdom joins but that the <Col N="420" /> transfers needed if Britain does not join would be much larger.  This has been suggested on behalf of the Government if I understand it correctly.  Is this the Government's view?  How much larger would the transfer need to be and what kind of sums have been discussed and put forward?  Given the strong likelihood that Britain will not join at the outset, has the Taoiseach in discussions with the other Heads of Government named and sought a higher figure or has he contented himself with discussing the £650 million, despite indications on behalf of his Government that the sum would be inadequate if Britain does not join?  If it were possible to get a reply to that question&mdash;and it is not possible having regard to the nature of the debate&mdash;it could not damage our negotiating position. It could only strengthen it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not having a debate.  We are only having statements.  The Deputy referred to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret if I made a technical error.  I thought everything I said made it clear that it is not a debate&mdash;that is the whole problem. There is no reply or answer.  I can only make a statement, and I have been saying that more or less for the past five minutes.  To use the word &ldquo;debate&rdquo; was a technical error.</P>
      <P>The reply to the question could not damage the Government's negotiating position.  It could only strengthen it. Quite clearly the Government are avoiding giving it in order to protect themselves against criticism if they fail to attain the aim.  The Government are sacrificing the national interest in order to ease public opinion to accept a failure in the negotiations, even though in doing so they are contributing to the failure of the negotiations.  I regard that as grossly irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to know if the Government accept, as would appear to be the case from what the newspapers reported on the Taoiseach's remarks after Bonn, that any form of loan, even if there were a moratorium for some years on repayment and even if interest rates were subsidised, could be a substitute for <Col N="421" /> a transfer given that the loan has to be repaid and will be in addition to our already very high national debt figure. Do the Government not accept that the value of a loan of the kind suggested could be no more than the annual difference between interest payable on it and the interest at which it could otherwise borrow?  In the EMS we could borrow in Deutsche Marks presumably at interest rates similar to the German Government when we were in the system, namely 6½-7 per cent at present, and the benefit on a loan of, for example, £100 million would be only £6,500,000-£7 million for the years of the moratorium and perhaps half that thereafter if the interest rate could be in the order of 3 per cent.  Of what value would be £6,500,000-£7 million, reducing after three years to half that sum, by comparison with the £130 million which the Government said was needed and the £600 million on the basis of what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said in the MacDougall Report would be required in relation to economic union?</P>
    <P>In relation to this point the Taoiseach's statement this morning is disturbing.  Yesterday he told journalists&mdash;I presume with a straight face&mdash;and I shall quote from one of the newspapers, that &ldquo;the attractiveness of loans could match that of grants depending on the terms on which they were made available&rdquo;.  Surely the Taoiseach knows, as well as every Member of this House and most, if not all, of the electorate that a loan can only be as attractive as a grant if it is interest-free and non-repayable, which means it is a grant.  How did the Taoiseach conceive that in making such a statement to the press&mdash;it was reported in various forms in different papers&mdash;he was maintaining the strength of our hand for the final negotiations, as he has claimed to be doing?  How did the Taoiseach talk to this House this morning about transfers in the terms he used as though loans were transfers?  He said that Chancellor Schmidt supported transfers to the fullest possible degree but it was evident from what he said subsequently and from what is reported in the newspapers that what the Chancellor has been offering <Col N="422" /> are loans.  The Taoiseach is starting now to describe these as transfers which Chancellor Schmidt was said to be supporting in the fullest possible way.  A loan is not a transfer.  There should be no attempt to pretend it is.  A loan has to be repaid.  Perhaps there may be some slight delay in the interest payment, or a slight reduction.  It may be worth £3 million or £6 million a year but, in the end, it has to be repaid.  There is no transfer. The Taoiseach should not seek to mislead the House on a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>I should like to contrast the weakkneed approach of our Government with the tougher attitude of the Italian Government who, as reported in this morning's paper, have laid down a negotiating brief which involves insisting on firm commitments.  These are the kind of commitments the Taoiseach says he did not give us about a document and a debate on the European Monetary System.  The Italian Government are insisting on firm commitments and on a transfer of resources from strong to weak EEC countries as well as assurances that sterling will gradually be brought into the scheme, which I would think is much more important to our economy than to the Italian economy. Yet, there is no evidence that the Taoiseach is taking any similar tough line to that of the Italians.  On the contrary, we seem to be giving away a large part of our negotiating hand before the negotiation actually takes place in its final form.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the Regional Fund does not provide a satisfactory vehicle for transfers?  There have been suggestions that any grants we would get, which might be a minority of the total, would come under the Regional Fund.  The Taoiseach must be aware that approvals of grants under the Regional Fund lag several years behind commitments of money by the Community and payments lag several years behind approvals.  He must be aware that such moneys can be spent only on a narrow range of projects which do not include many of the sectors of the economy which will need aid to enable them to adjust to the disciplines and rigours of the European Monetary <Col N="423" /> System, or many of the purposes for which we will need to provide aid within our own economy.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Taoiseach&mdash;but I will not get an answer at this point&mdash;what will the position be with regard to exchange control and the dollar premium.  What, if anything, have the Government negotiated on this subject? Now that the Exchange Control Bill is law, the Government could clarify these issues quickly and should do so before uncertainty about them begins to affect us adversely.  What steps&mdash;and this a crucial question on which I intend to dwell for a few minutes&mdash;have the Government taken to prepare Irish industry, or other sectors likely to be affected adversely, for the impact of the European Monetary System?</P>
    <P>The Government have had six months notice of this, as we all have had.  I should like to remind the Taoiseach that when a previous Fianna Fáil Government were in office under the Taoiseach, Sean Lemass, after the breakdown of the Western European Free Trade Area negotiations in 1958, the then Taoiseach saw that this meant we would have to join the EEC.  He approached the predecessor organisation of the Confederation of Irish Industries and he proposed a study of the effects on industry. With Professor Quinn I had the honour of undertaking the pilot study of the woollen and worsted industry arising from this initiative, and our recommendations led to the establishment of CIO which studied in co-operation with the trade unions the 85 per cent of Irish industry which could be and in significant measure was affected by free trade.</P>
    <P>What have this Government done faced with what must be seen in the short term as a new threat to the very sectors of our industry which have already suffered most from the combination of the freeing of trade under the Free Trade Area Agreement with the United Kingdom, the freeing of trade in the EEC, and the world recession?  Have they been in touch with industry?  Have they been carrying out studies of vulnerable sectors?  If they have, there has been a remarkable silence about it. <Col N="424" /> Have they consulted with industry as to what kind of aid will be needed and how it might be given?  I see no sign that any of this has been done.  As far as one can judge, industry has been kept as much in the dark as this House.  It has not been prepared for the problems.</P>
    <P>Moreover, because of this failure, our negotiating position has been drastically and perhaps fatally weakened.  In the absence of such studies, the Government have not been able to convey any convincing reason to our EEC partners for the proposed transfers.  They have been content to go with the begging bowl looking for transfers without being able to explain why they need the money, or what they propose to do with it.  All we have heard from the Government so far&mdash;and we have heard it only very indirectly as far as I can recall&mdash;is that the money would be for investment purposes, apparently mainly for infrastructural investment.  This is not where the immediate need will be if we enter the European Monetary System and the United Kingdom remains outside.  The need will be in industries like textiles, clothing, footwear and furniture, and others which are vulnerable, industries which from the moment our currency starts to appreciate through its link with the Deutsche Mark and the Dutch guilder will begin to suffer an erosion of their competitive position in the home market and in most export markets.  This problem will be many times more acute if the United Kingdom remains outside and our pound depreciates <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling as well as non-EEC currencies.</P>
    <P>Have the Government even sought to ensure that the form of aid we receive would be such that they could use it to aid these and other vulnerable sectors? Have they sought agreement that these sectors can be specially aided and an assurance that aid to them, whether deriving from Community transfers or loans or from domestic sources, will not be treated by the Community as a distortion of competition?  Have they considered what form aid to these sectors might take?  Will it not be necessary that this aid should in significant measure help the current accounts of affected firms rather than consist of capital injections? What type of current aid is <Col N="425" /> proposed?  In addition to current aid, will there be a new scheme of adaptation grants for industry?  These are questions industry is asking and is deeply concerned about and to which there have been not only no answers but apparently no questions by the Government to industry as to what its need are likely to be.</P>
    <P>I have identified particular sectors I believe may be adversely affected.  Do the Government agree with this diagnosis, or do they think there are other sectors which will suffer?  Surely we should be discussing these matters now in time, rather than when it may be too late to do so because the terms negotiated may not provide the right type of aid or permit us to use that aid in the manner necessary to safeguard the sectors which will be hurt in the initial stages of membership.  These are the kinds of issues which should have been dealt with in a Green Paper or White Paper before now.  These are the issues we should be debating but are not debating.  These are the issues the Government should have briefed themselves on before entering these negotiations.</P>
    <P>I have a sense of frustration at watching the Government fumbling, failing to diagnose or tackle the real problems and losing opportunities in the negotiation.  Not merely have the Government failed in these ways, but they have positively exacerbated the problems we will face in the European Monetary System.  They have done so by raising expectations they cannot meet.  They have made our industrial relations situation which is vital for success in the European Monetary System worse rather than better.  Now, having got themselves into difficulties by the manner in which they have raised expectations, encouraging a consumer boom of unprecedented dimensions, largely met by imports, they have started to threaten tax increases or cuts in subsidies, thereby inciting new pay claims outside the national agreement framework.</P>
    <P>The present atmosphere of our industrial relations would be profoundly worrying even if we were not going into the European Monetary System.  Inside <Col N="426" /> that system where, as the ESRI have suggested, there might be a 5 per cent maximum on pay claims if we are to avoid further massive unemployment, the atmosphere created by the Government is little short of disastrous.  Instead of thrift they have encouraged conspicuous expenditure, above all on motor vehicles where the main boom has been and the import content of which is huge.  Instead of moderation in pay claims they have encouraged extravagance.</P>
    <P>This intensely worrying situation which we must all face together in the national interest has not been helped by Ministers like the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development making optimistic speeches, so described in a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, about how the European Monetary System will boost foreign investment and foreign trade.  Those Ministers know as well as the Taoiseach, and as well as we all know, that the benefits of the European Monetary System will be hard won, and won over a long period of time, and will be secured only if we fight successfully instead of encouraging inflation at home.</P>
    <P>In this connection we should note the view of the EEC Commission, reported this morning, that the success of revaluation against sterling such as is likely to emerge if we join and the United Kingdom remains outside, or is loosely associated with the new move without joining it, &ldquo;would depend on Ireland's ability to impose a greater measure of discipline on the economy from the point of view of monetary, fiscal and incomes policies&rdquo;.  It is not necessary to ask whether we are nearer to or further away from any such discipline after 18 months of this profligate Government.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be short run gains for some people from membership. The group I can best identify in this respect are the importers of German cars to this country, who will certainly gain in the short run.  That is a very limited class who have not done too badly recently despite the rise in the Deutsche Mark.  For the rest, the immediate effect will be to create difficulties for various sectors, which we <Col N="427" /> have to overcome successfully if we are to secure the benefits, and the undoubted considerable potential benefits, in the longer run of membership of a system which could help us to maintain a reduction in the inflation rate, if we can secure it.  If we fail to secure it in the early stages then membership could aggravate rather than help our situation.</P>
    <P>This debate is inherently unsatisfactory. The Government have contrived a situation in which they can evade their responsibility, accepted by the United Kingdom Government, to inform Parliament and the people of what the European Monetary System issues are and how the problems it will create might be tackled.  The Government's approach has visibly weakened the confidence of employers, of trade unions and even of farmers who require, and I am inclined to think could be given, reassurance that reference prices will not be reduced, hitting their income.  They have not even been given reassurance on that point nor has it been mentioned or referred to at any stage by the Government.  The result of weakened confidence in the different sectors of the economy through the Government's handling of this problem is that if we enter we shall do so in poor shape not only economically as a result of the Government's profligate behaviour over the past 18 months, but also in poor shape psychologically.</P>
    <P>When we meet to have our debate on this subject after the European Council meeting, I shall expect the Government to answer the questions I have raised.  I know it will be too late then for these answers to affect beneficially the outcome of negotiations, in some cases a discussion could help, and the answers will come very late to reassure worried people who have been quite unnecessarily left in the dark about many aspects of a decision which will affect their lives profoundly.  Even late in the day I trust we will get answers to these questions and that the White Paper when it is published after the decision has been taken will at least give us the kind of basic information and guidance which the House, the people and the different sectors of interests need, if we are to approach, in the four weeks that remain, <Col N="428" /> this new situation in any kind of shape to come through it successfully.  We are all equally concerned that we do so.</P>
    <P>The effects of membership would be beneficial in the longer run but the immediate impact is unknowable and carries dangers, some of which we can identify and some of which may be difficult to identify.  I hope we can approach those problems constructively when the time comes.  It is my function in this House to raise issues and questions the Government ought to answer.  It is my function to critice deficiencies in the Government's handling of matters affecting the economy, negotiating tactics and techniques.  Having done that, and when the decision has been taken, we will have to evaluate whether that decision was a wise one for the country.  It will not be an easy thing for any of us to evaluate.  We will have to make our best judgment in the national interest and, having made that judgment, whatever it may be, we will have to try to make the best of the outcome of a situation which has been brought about through this initiative.</P>
    <P>As I said, if we can make progress towards European Monetary Union this would be of great value and importance to us and to the other countries of the Community, but we have a hurdle to overcome.  The hurdle for us is bigger than for any other country, not merely because of our basic economic situation of underdevelopment or because our economic and psychological situation at this moment is bad because of the evidence of the last 18 months&mdash;and these are important factors&mdash;but in our case because the special problem of a change in the currency relationship with our vitally important trading neighbour is also at issue.  That is something no other country has to face and it creates problems no other country will have to tackle.  We will need very considerable solidarity if we are successfully to tackle the three aspects of the problem if and when a decision is taken to join this EMS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that this morning we have this procedure of a statement, if one could call it such, by the Taoiseach, by the Leader of Fine <Col N="429" /> Gael and myself on our possible entry into the EMS.  I find it hard to envisage in what circumstances the Taoiseach made the decision to treat this House and the Opposition with the contempt which is obvious in his statement on his visit to the three Heads of State.  Listening to him was like listening to a female relative describing a social visit to some very cordial and nice people and telling in very general terms the subject matter which had been discussed.  There is nothing in this statement which clarifies to any degree the situation with regard to the possible repercussions on all sectors of our community of our entry into the EMS.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Government claimed that because we are in what is described as a negotiating position, it is not possible to have a full debate in this House prior to the summit meeting next week.  That reflects a total lack of trust by the Taoiseach in elected Members on the Opposition benches.  He should have more faith and trust in the integrity and sense of responsibility of Members in the national interest.  Although we have been provoked by his attitude in the last number of weeks, we have displayed a high degree of responsibility and concern for the national interest.</P>
      <P>It would be no harm to put on record that the question of the EMS was discussed by the parliamentary Labour Party. We had, and have, very definite observations to make regarding the Government decision and the possible effects of our entry under the terms which appear to be emerging, but we refrained from publishing anything of that nature because the Taoiseach was abroad negotiating on behalf of this country.  As I said, he should show more trust in elected Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although much has been written and there has been a lot of talk in general terms about our possible entry into EMS, very few legitimate questions have been answered.  Throughout the country, in business, commerce, the trade union movement and the farming community there is very considerable unease and disquiet as to what the possible effects of our entry into EMS might be.  We can only look back at the initiative for EMS and try to trace it to the present point, to <Col N="430" /> pose legitimate questions and hope that even at this late stage those legitimate questions will be answered by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>The initiative was taken not by the Community but by the Heads of State of Germany and France.  They met prior to the Bremen meeting, initiated the concept of EMS and launched it at the Bremen meeting.  It might be a good thing for this country to join the EMS but at the moment no one on this side of the House is in a position to say if this is true because we have not been given legitimate information on vital matters concerning our possible entry by the Government.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not possible to make a value judgment on the merits or demerits of joining, but from the French and German point of view there is no doubt that they wish the EMS to operate.  It has very definite advantages for their economies.  Anyone who during the past number of years has had an opportunity of attending any meeting at which Chancellor Schmidt has been present will know that he has a certain approach to Europe's economic problems and that he has advocated that approach on every occasion possible.  However, it may not be the approach that is suited necessarily to Irish conditions.  I wonder if proper comparisons have been made by the Government between conditions prevailing in the stronger economies of France and Germany and conditions prevailing here, taking into account the various stages of development in both economic and social terms that exist in the various European countries.</P>
    <P>At Bremen the Taoiseach gave an enthusiastic reception to the whole idea of the EMS.  That was a very serious mistake on the part of one who was going into a very difficult negotiating period.  The next development we can trace is that Ireland is seeking a transfer of resources to the extent of £650 million, but the Government have not given any indication of how this figure was arrived at or of what was the origin of it. They have not told us the basis for the figure.  If they are seeking a transfer of resources of this extent in order to cushion us against the initial impact of entry surely they made an in depth <Col N="431" /> analysis of what the effects of entry would be on the various sectors of our economy, agriculture, industry and so on.  It is only by way of an in depth study that this definite figure spread over a five-year period could be arrived at. Conversely, in the absence of any such study the figure is nonsensical.  But if the study has been undertaken and the figure arrived at on that basis it cannot be claimed legitimately to be a negotiating secret.  One way or the other the House is not being given the information to which it is entitled on a matter of this nature.  The people generally are entitled to know the possible effects of membership of the EMS.  So far we have been denied the relevant information in this whole discussion.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that a sum of £650 million is inadequate in terms of cushioning us against the effects of entry.  When this question is probed by impartial people, by economists, for instance, who do not have any political axe to grind, it will be seen that there is a further obligation on the Government to state how the figure of £650 million was arrived at.</P>
    <P>We do not even know whether this figure was based on the assumption that the UK will join this monetary system or whether it was based on the assumption of their staying out.  If the figure is based on the assumption of their joining what, then, is the figure we should be seeking? Surely that is not a negotiating secret either.  This lack of information is undermining the national interest.  It is treating with the utmost contempt the Members of this House, and that contempt on the part of the Government can spring only from their having 84 seats.</P>
    <P>The figure of £650 million has been referred to at all times by the Government in terms of a transfer of resources by way of grants.  That was clearly the intention up to the time of the Taoiseach's meeting with the German Chancellor, but so far as we can glean from press reports, and there is some indication of this in the statement this morning, the Taoiseach came away from that meeting with a rather different view, the view that instead of sum of £650 <Col N="432" /> million in the form of a transfer of resources by way of grant, it could be by way of a package made up of various components.  These components would be some amount of grant and some of what are described as soft loans, with some being made up also by way of the possible channelling through the existing EEC machinery of the regional and social funds.  This change occurred after the Taoiseach's meeting with the person who could be described accurately as the economic hard man of Europe.  Surely the Taoiseach is not suggesting seriously to the House or to the Irish people that a loan, whether it be soft- or a hard-term loan, could be described as a transfer of resources.  It is a transfer of resources, but with the transfer going in the opposite direction.  We ultimately are transferring more of our resources into the centre of Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same as if you were to suggest to any Irishman or Irishwoman with a bank account who comes in to see the bank manager, has a little chat with him and gets an overdraft, that that is a transfer of resources from the bank to you.  I do not think you will find any Irish people prepared to accept that as a transfer of resources, but that is precisely what it is. That is what a loan is; it is the same as a bank overdraft.  The bank will accommodate you under certain conditions, and when the time comes and the credit squeeze arrives the transfer of resources very definitely goes in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now being told by the Government that there will be at least some element, and a fairly substantial element if I know my Herr Schmidt, of transfer of resources from this country into the richest part of the Community.  Surely the Taoiseach is not trying to suggest of this country that we can take into consideration a loan, irrespective of the terms of that loan, as being a transfer from the richer to the poorer parts of the Community.  If we are to have a package deal a considerable part of which will be comprised of a loan and irrespective of the terms of that loan, how do the <Col N="433" /> Taoiseach and his Cabinet reconcile that with their comments and their policy with regard to foreign borrowing?  Make no mistake, when you get a loan through the Community, from France, Germany or anywhere else, you are engaging in foreign borrowing.  We have been told both before and since the last election that one of the major mistakes of the last Government and one of the major elements in our economic difficulties was the extent of our foreign borrowing.  Our foreign borrowing at 13 per cent of GNP was described by Fianna Fáil, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and other leading Fianna Fáil spokesmen as a potential economic disaster for this country.  They said they were determined to rectify this; they were going to put us on the steady course.  Initially they were bringing it down from 13 per cent of GNP to 10.5 per cent and from 10.5 per cent down to 8 per cent by 1980.</P>
    <P>How can you reconcile that with going over to negotiate at the summit with the Chancellor of Germany, the President of France or anyone else to engage in further foreign borrowing?  Is it disastrous only if someone other than Fianna Fáil does it, even though Fianna Fáil have maintained that it was a disastrous policy for a long time?</P>
    <P>The figure of £650 million has been mentioned.  That is approximately 10 per cent of our GNP, and spread over a five-year period it is 2 per cent added on to our foreign borrowing.  How do you reconcile one with the other?  I do not understand and I am sure it is confusing to the people as well.</P>
    <P>These are legitimate questions to which we are entitled to answers.  The Government cannot continue to hide behind this suggestion that &ldquo;We are in a negotiating position and because of that we can give you no information; we will not answer legitimate questions, and if you ask them and press for them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;, as the Tánaiste said to me, &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;you are being un-Irish&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste said that when I questioned some aspect <Col N="434" /> regarding the EMS.  I think it was whether it might be desirable to look a little more closely at our economic relationship with the UK and not to be too carried away by nationalist emotionalism.  The Taoiseach&mdash;the Tánaiste said to me across the floor of this House that I was anti-Irish.  That is on the record of this House.</P>

      <P>I said the Tánaiste. Even at the risk of being described again as anti-Irish by the Tánaiste I will continue to ask legitimate questions about matters that have a serious potential effect on the standard of employment of our citizens.  It is now emerging in the mind of the public that the Government and the Taoiseach are hiding behind this question of a negotiating position.  Certainly there are things that cannot be disclosed. There are things that in the national interest we should not and would not pursue at this stage of the negotiations, but there are a vast number of things that can and should be disclosed. I and my party will continue to raise those issues and seek answers to the questions on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conditions that may have affected the attitude of the Taoiseach after his meeting with the Chancellor of Germany was that there would be a package of loans and grants and possibly money in some other form channelled through either the Regional Fund or the Social Fund.  There was another condition that any loan made available to this country as a soft term loan would not require repayment to commence for a period of three years.  I sincerely hope that the Government's primary consideration is the national interest.  This <Col N="435" /> Government sat in Cabinet on two days last week and they are going to have several more two-day meetings with the purpose of trying to find money to maintain the services in this country.  A very attractive carrot to be offered is hundreds of millions of pounds that you do not have to commence to repay for a three-year period.  I hope that that would not be a factor in determining the Taoiseach's attitude to entry into the EMS.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The consequences of a decision being made on any basis other than the national interest could be disastrous for this country.  The Taoiseach is being forced by the persistence of both the Fine Gale Party and my own Party to go through the motions of having a discussion in this House, belated though it may be, but he knows the outcome.  If Fianna Fáil decide that we are going into the EMS they have 84 votes to ensure that we do go in.  I wonder under what conditions we will go in.  If the response from the German Chancellor, the President of France and the other Heads of State next week at the summit meeting is such that in the Taoiseach's view we should enter, what conditions will be attached to our entering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach recall the conditions that were attached to the money that was given by way of soft loans to the Italian Government?  Does the Taoiseach not accept that if we get a substantial loan or grant, but particularly a loan, from either one or a number of other governments or through the machinery of the EEC that they by virtue of the fact that they are giving us that loan will impose certain conditions and that they will have the right, to quite a considerable extent, to determine what way our economy is going to be run in the years to come?  I wounder would the Taoiseach tell us, as far as foreign borrowing is concerned, if the Government will have to forfeit their sovereign right to determine that solely on their own.  I wonder is there a likelihood of conditions being imposed in relation to the rate of wages, collective bargaining or <Col N="436" /> the question of a statutory wage agreement?  Could such conditions be imposed upon us as a condition for some of these loans?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of our expenditure on the social services.  They may say we must put our economy right, and they are judging it in the context of a German economy and what might be good for a German economy and saying that we might have to do the same things although we are in a totally different situation.  They may tell us to cut back on expenditure in certain areas. They will be able to determine to a considerable degree, our budgetary strategy. These are legitimate questions and we are entitled to answers to those questions.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects.  Forty-seven per cent of our exports are to the United Kingdom, and they have now stated that for the moment they are not going in, they are going to hold their hand. Whether we like it or not and whether it offends the Irishness of the Tánaiste or not it happens to be an economic fact of life that we are very closely linked to the British economy.  If we break from that economy, if we break our par with sterling, it will have other effects.  What is going to be the effect on trade and commerce between the North and ourselves? We have been given no detailed analysis nor even an insight into what the Government's thinking is on what the possible developments or repercussions of that might be.  That is a legitimate question.  It would not in any way affect the negotiating position.  But we are denied any answers whatever to these legitimate questions.  Have the Government given serious consideration to the fact that maybe for the time being we might be better off to hold our hand and see how the thing develops, wait to see what Britain is going to do?  If we did that it would not affect our trade with the United Kingdom and it would not affect our trade as it now is with the other European countries and the rest of the world as it now is.  Surely we are entitled to the Government's thoughts on these things.  We are entitled to know have the Government given any serious consideration to these things.  But under the guise that we are in a negotiating position <Col N="437" /> we are denied all information on legitimate questions which only a Government are in a position to properly analyse to come up with reasonable assessments.</P>
    <P>One of the things that emerged in passing was the fact that when the Taoiseach met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan, he had some discussions on the common agricultural policy.  We have had statements being made by leading members of farmers' organisations that they are extremely worried that on our entry into the EMS there would be a change in the unit of account and that that could result in a 20 per cent drop in farm incomes.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  I do not know whether it is possible or not.  I do not know whether it is likely or not, but surely the Government must be in a position to have made an estimate of the legitimate concerns of farmers and to reassure them, or at least say it is possible, or say something.  There is another aspect.  We know the British policy towards the CAP is not the same as our own but that we agree to differ.  I do not think that the British Prime Minister will just agree to differ and leave it at that. They are determined to break the present operation of the common agricultural policy, and they have made no secret of their determination to do that.  I wonder has the Taoiseach any indication that not only is there a possibility that on our entry a change in the unit of account will be made a vehicle for having a drastic change in the operation of the common agricultural policy but that it is quite possible that one of the terms that would be negotiated by the British Government for their entry, when they consider fit to enter, would be that there would be a change in the operation of the common agricultural policy.  These are all issues that can have very serious consequences for our people and there is an obligation on the Government to answer these questions. Without the type of information that we have legitimately asked for but which we have not got, there is not too much more we can say at this stage on the question of EMS.</P>
    <P>There are six conditions that this party will have uppermost in their minds <Col N="438" /> when the question of whether or not we support entry into the EMS comes before this House, and I will list them for the Taoiseach and the House: (1) that there is adequate transfer of resources in the form of grants to the minimum extent of £650 million over a five-year period, any loans to be in addition to this transfer of resources; (2) that the transfer be in the form of grants which are untied, without conditions and capable of being applied as the Government see fit in order to protect employment: for example, they should be capable of being used for either capital or current purposes; (3) that if agreed, the grants should be used by the Government as expenditure on new projects in addition to current schemes and not as a substitute for them; (4) that there is no alteration in the real value of the CAP income to the Irish economy; (5) that there is a clear commitment given by the Government that there will be no statutory incomes policy, that they will not introduce such a policy and then tell us that it is because of our membership of the EMS and that we have no option but to introduce a statutory incomes policy; (6) that the impact of the final scheme be properly evaluated by the Government and be presented by them to the Dáil showing employment effects in the short run, employment effects in the medium term, effect on our GNP in 1979, effect on the rate of inflation in 1979 and budgetary changes, particularly with regard to foreign borrowing policy.  The answers we get to those six legitimate questions will determine our attitude towards our entry into the EMS when the Government finally get around to answering them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 16, to delete lines 52 to 60 and in page 17 to delete lines 1 to 10 and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The value of imported goods for the purposes of this section shall be their value determined in accordance with the acts for the time being in force adopted by the institutions of the Community relating to the valuation of goods for customs purposes, modified by the substitution of references to the territory of the State for references to the customs territory of the Community, together with any taxes, duties and other charges levied either outside or, by reason of importation, within the State (except value-added tax) on the goods and not included in the determination.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment, of which notice was given to the Special Committee, is of a technical nature.  It is intended to remove any doubts relating to imports from other member states by ensuring that valuation for the purpose of charging VAT shall be in accordance with the customs law concepts, even in the case of importations from other members states of the Community where, because of the advent of the concept of a single customs territory for the whole Community, customs law would not otherwise apply.

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third occasion for me to speak on this Bill but I shall not detain the House very long. Before the adjournment last evening I had made a number of comments with regard to the technical difficulties of establishing liability in claims that might arise against a seller or manufacturer. This Bill will place very firmly the onus of responsibility to the consumer squarely on the seller.  I would hope, however, that the seller in certain circumstances would not have to carry the liability or, shall we say, the can for some foreign manufacturer because of any difficulties or delays in gaining access to a manufacturer who may be situated far away from this country.  It is, of course, only proper that the seller would accept responsibility but the Minister will be aware of the difficutly where, for example, in the case of a defective piece of machinery, many thousands of such pieces might have been sold before the difficulty showed up and the liability could be so huge and so extensive that a local agent or seller just could not handle the extent of the claims.  As I indicated previously, the manufacturer very far away, perhaps on the other side of the world, may decline to handle such claims and, on that basis, the seller or the local agent could find himself in a pretty serious dilemma.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the fly-by-night individual merchants who operate in hired halls in different parts of the country but particularly in the cities.  The consumer needs protection in this area and the only effective way is to ensure that only legitimate traders are permitted to trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> The public should be repeatedly warned against buying in that type of market. As we all know, many inferior goods are being peddled about today under the guise of direct from manufacturer to consumer.  This type of business seriously damages the economy.  It affects jobs and, of course, it gives the consumer a pretty raw deal.  Obviously in situations like this there will be no recourse to anybody if the goods turn out to be defective at a later stage.  The Minister may have some plans to curb this type of trading which takes advantage so cleverly of the average consumer.</P>
    <P>The section relating to the sale of used cars is very timely and, indeed, necessary. In this area not only is the buyer put at risk as far as good value for money is concerned but, more seriously, what is also at stake is the serious risk to life and limb that will result from the sale of unworthy or defective vehicles.  A person purchasing a used car&mdash;say three- or four-years old&mdash;could have some years ago without any difficulty gone direct to a garage and would have been quite satisfied that, in the event of any defect or any problem arising, the guarantee would be honoured without any difficulty, but the position today is different.  Garages are not anxious to sell three- or four-year-old cars, and such vehicles are pushed on to private traders many of whom operate form backlane garages or caretaker addresses in Dublin's flatland.  Such dealers sell their cars under the guise of a private sale. Many such advertisements appear in the Dublin evening newspapers and I am sure that of the vehicles advertised very few of them are private sales.  Many of these cars are unsafe.</P>
    <P>This is an area of policy that will be difficult to control.  Many people buying cars for the first time are, unfortunately, attracted by such advertisements.  One can readily understand this because very often those buying their first car have a certain amount of money to spend.  It is imperative that the consumers who, through lack of experience or mechanical knowledge, buy from such unregistered and dishonest second-hand car dealers are given protection.  We must also endeavour to differentiate between such traders and the genuine <Col N="446" /> private person selling a vehicle.  This will be difficult, and it will also be difficult to put the onus of liability, should the need arise, on the dubious unregistered car dealer.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been welcomed by all sides, but the success of it will depend on consumers.  Shoppers must be careful about the traders they deal with.  It would be wrong to label all transactions as doubtful and we are fortunate in having a majority of upstanding, honest and reputable traders.  However, we must warn consumers to exercise caution when buying certain lines which carry a greater risk than others.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on the drafting of the Bill and I suggest that it be given wide publicity to ensure that buyers understand their rights in the event of experiencing dissatisfaction with goods purchased.  Use should be made of chat shows on radio and TV to inform consumers, particularly women, where they should go for value and inform them of their rights as consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing this non-contentious but comprehensive piece of legislation.  It is the first time such a Bill has been introduced.  It will fill a lot of loopholes which are being used by dishonest traders.  We should use the Bill to inform the public to be on their guard against the dishonest dealing that is taking place throughout the country.  We should warn them to be careful about the type of goods being marketed.  Some of them are sub-standard and of questionable origin. Irish manufactured goods are of the highest standard and carry a guarantee. A lot of the sub-standard goods are marketed by companies which are set up overnight and go out of business just as quickly.  The result is that Irish consumers are cheated.  The companies I have referred to cease business before the Revenue Commissioners have time to identify them and list them for VAT purposes.  Many of the goods, which are unsafe, are easily disposed of to the gullible <Col N="447" /> public.  I have in mind items like calculators which are sold to school children without batteries.  These children when they fit a battery discover that the calculators do not work.  The same can be said of transistor radios which are sold by roadside traders and it is pleasing to note that many people now consider such radios as junk.</P>
      <P>We should use the Bill to enlighten the public about their rights.  Cheap watches are another commodity that are most unsatisfactory and often do not work. Many of the small domestic appliances used by housewives have no recognised manufacturing name or no indication of their source so that the purchaser has no redress if anything goes wrong with the appliance.  The monster auctions that are widely advertised state that goods can be exchanged, but this does not happen in practice.  Many electric cookers and some other appliances are geared towards other forms of voltage than are used in this country.  Cookers designed for the English market operate on a 240 voltage system and they are not efficient when used here where we have a 220 or even lower voltage system.</P>
      <P>A very slick professional type of advertising is used to promote all these goods.  Every effort should be made to clamp down on the people involved in this practice.  Most of the goods marketed are of foreign origin and there is little, if any, contribution to the Irish Exchequer.  The people involved will try by every means possible to evade or avoid paying VAT, income tax or any other contribution towards the Exchequer. They could be called parasites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision regarding the minimum requirement for guarantees is to be welcomed, as is the provision to protect the public from inertia selling.  Frequently embarrassment is caused to people, particularly in the country, when they receive unsolicited goods and I am glad there is a provision to deal with this matter. I welcome also the provision to deal effectively with unsolicited entries in directories.  Last week I saw a bill for £69 to an Irish company for an unsolicited entry in a telex directory from an unknown company operating in <Col N="448" /> Dublin.  The Irish company whose telex was supposed to have been listed knew nothing about the directory nor were they approached to make an entry in it. Some companies from the United Kingdom are operating up to four such companies here because the law forbids their operation in England.  We are being used as a base from which these undesirables operate their shady companies. For that reason I welcome the inclusion of the provision in the Bill.  It will help the legitimate concerns on whom a shadow has fallen.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision which ensures that finance houses giving loans to the public for the purchase of goods are equally liable with the supplier of the goods and equally answerable to the buyer for the fulfilment of the contract. This will protect reputable retailers who serve the public and who contribute to the State.  They are not in the business of tricking the public.  They will have nothing to fear from this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 10 will protect the public.  It states:</P>
    <P>(a)  an implied condition on the part of the seller that, in the case of a sale, he has a right to sell the goods and, in the case of an agreement to sell, he will have a right to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass, and</P>
    <P>(b)  an implied warranty that the goods are free, and will remain free until the time when the property is to pass, from any charge or encumbrance not disclosed to the buyer before the contract is made and that the buyer will enjoy quite possession of the goods except so far as it may be disturbed by the owner or other person entitled to the benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed.</P>
    <P>I take it that this acknowledges what is known as the &ldquo;retention of title&rdquo; clause imposed on retailers by some suppliers. Will the Minister of State let me know if this imposes an obligation on the retailer where there is such a clause affecting the goods to advise the customer of the position?  The setting out of minimum information to be specified in a guarantee is also to be welcomed.  A reputable <Col N="449" /> retailer will welcome the intention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other provisions in the Bill will help the customer.  I speak as a retailer of the type of goods the Bill intends to cover.  I welcome the Bill and I support its adoption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a great deal to say on this Bill, but a few matters are obvious by their omission.  Trading stamps or anything to do with them do not seem to be covered by the Bill.  At a later stage the Minister might let us have the benefit of her consideration of this and other related matters.  What are the views of the Government on the question of trading stamps?  My view is rather uninformed and I have not had the benefit of the research which is available to Government Departments but, over a considerable period, I have come to the conclusion that trading stamps are not in the best interests of the consumer, despite the best efforts and the costly and highly financed propaganda of those who try to suggest the reverse.  Before the next Stages of the Bill, this matter should be considered and some stand should be taken, perhaps contrary to my stand, but it would be interesting to know on what basis a contrary stand could be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the biggest and best-known trading stamp company is based outside this country and, in the final analysis, does not give value for money but reaps a rich reward for which ultimately the consumer pays.  The decision on who may utilise these stamps is discriminatory.  I wonder whether the Minister has considered, first, that a number of such stamps are never collected from the retailer.  Secondly, others are collected but never see the light of day again, because they are destroyed or mislaid and not cashed in.  Thirdly, on looking through the well-illustrated catalogue of gifts, as they are described, which may be collected on the surrender of the requisite number of stamps, and which are calculated on the basis of <Col N="450" /> what the stamps cost the retailer, I consider they are not value for money.  The charge is exorbitant without taking into account the first two points I raised.  To a degree I consider the stamp trading business is a racket which trades on the misconception of the consumers that they are getting something for nothing.</P>
    <P>There is the further complication that, whether or not they believe they are getting something for nothing, they are led to the belief that they might not otherwise have acquired what they get in this way because the wherewithal might not be provided by the breadwinner. This may have a certain validity and adds to the attraction of the stamp trading situation.  The Minister must do something about the discrimination in the appointment of those who may use these trading stamps if she is satisfied that, whether we like it or not, we will continue to tolerate them.  I do not believe we should.  I admit freely that my opinion on this is merely that of an observer and is not based on the research which is available to the Minister's Department for her guidance.</P>
    <P>Roadside trading is also omitted from the Bill.  I wonder why it was not dealt with, as this Bill would appear to be a readily available vehicle for making this type of trading legitimate if it is regarded as beneficial, or controlled and properly supervised by the prices people, the revenue and tax people, and so on.  It rather surprises me that this has not been dealt with.  I would ask the Minister to give this matter more thought, although I am sure she has already had thoughts on it and may well have very good reasons for not including roadside trading or Sunday markets, or whatever you like to call them, which have become such an established feature of our retail outlets and retail trading that they cannot be ignored any longer or regarded as merely a passing phase with so little consequences for the commercial life of the country as not to merit consideration.</P>
    <P>Electrical goods of unsuitable voltage are being brought in here, not necessarily by roadside traders or Sunday marketeers only but through normal electrical goods importing channels.  This is a matter of concern.  I am not in a <Col N="451" /> position to say that such goods are dangerous because of their unsuitable voltage, but I am aware that they are a very bad buy.  If your current is under a certain figure these electrical motors are liable to burn out.  This is not generally appreciated.  With the normal variation in our voltage, far from reading 240 or 250, the figure some of these motors require, there are times when our voltage drops to 210.  If it drops below that any electric motor carrying the load for which it was intended, and requiring a 220 or 250 voltage, will undoubtedly end its life prematurely and at very great cost to the user.  This matter is of considerable concern and has already added up to a considerable cost which should never have arisen.</P>
    <P>We hear people advocating the Buy Irish Campaign within our restricted boundaries.  The variation in the percentage of VAT charged here and across the Border or in Great Britain causes a great deal of concern.  That, compounded with the facility which results from membership of the EEC, where people can bring in goods for their own use worth £50 without paying duty, provided they live ten miles from the frontier, creates a very considerable disadvantage for our retailers over which they have no control.  There is nothing illegal being perpetrated by those who shop elsewhere than with their normal retail outlets.</P>
    <P>It is hard to say to these people that elsewhere the VAT charged might be 8 per cent as against 40 or 20 per cent here.  It is very difficult to blame these people for buying elsewhere in these days of euphoria that surrounds our Europeanism since joining the EEC.  It is no longer an unpatriotic act, in the purely insular sense, that it was some years ago to purchase elsewhere than from our own manufacturers.  Would it not be better if we very seriously looked at the total mark-up of goods from the point of production costs to consumer price rather than the system we now have where there are controls at various points?  This makes way for profiteering in some cases, and perhaps unfair competition in others, resulting in a rather difficult if not impossible situation for <Col N="452" /> the ordinary retailer of relatively modest dimensions as against the bulk buyers who have etablished themselves not to our disadvantage but to the disadvantage, if not extinction, of the people who depend solely on the retail trade for their livelihood.  The idea of percentage mark-up in total production costs, or farm gate price, to the ultimate retail price would be a better, neater and fairer system of pricing goods and attempting to control prices than the system which exists at the moment which not only appears haphazard but in many cases is not to the benefit of the consumer.</P>
    <P>No effort has been made to cover pyramid selling in this legislation.  I ask why it has been omitted rather than make any comments on it.  There may be good reasons why it is not covered, but if there are it would be to the benefit of the House and the public to hear them, because it is not recognised or accepted by the majority of people as being in the general interest of the general public or the consumer.</P>
    <P>Secondhand cars were mentioned. Nowhere is there a greater hazard in every day life than trying to purchase a secondhand car with a chance of coming out of the deal feeling reasonably happy because one got value for money.  This Bill does not cover that situation as fully as it might although the Minister might be able to enlighten us why the provisions did not go further than they did. Private sales are not covered here.  It is commonly accepted that a number of secondhand car transactions take place outside recognised garage outlets.  While this Bill covers transactions which take place between private individuals and recognised outlets it cannot but be a failure in regard to the remainder of the transactions.</P>
    <P>The majority of recognised car traders are honest in their dealings, but what effect will the provisions in this Bill, have on recognised outlets?  Will this legislation not have the effect, first, of bringing about an increase in the overall level of prices in the secondhand motor trade in order to cover the contingencies that now become legal rather than moral obligations?  Secondly, will it not have the effect also of driving away further business from the recognised outlets to <Col N="453" /> the private individual, thereby creating a situation where those who would not be prepared to conform to the law would give the trade a bad name by reason of subterfuges being found through the various individual outlets?  The legislation may have the effect of increasing the numbers of such people and, having regard to the financial reward involved, of inducing them to increase their business to the ultimate detriment of the purchasing public?  I make these comments in the hope either of being enlightened by the Minister's greater knowledge of the overall picture or in the hope of spurring her to consider these questions and to make amendments, if necessary, before the Bill is enacted.</P>

      <P>I thank the very many Deputies from both sides of the House who have taken part so far in the debate.  They have made useful and constructive contributions to what has been a very good debate, a debate during which the problems facing the consumer today were well aired.</P>
      <P>First, I would refer to some points raised by Deputy B. Desmond.  Perhaps inadvertently, I did not make myself quite clear in my opening remarks in the areas in which the Deputies subsequently raised some questions.  Deputy Desmond appeared to think that car repairs are not covered in the Bill.  I assure him that &ldquo;services&rdquo; are intended to cover car repairs.  The confusion may have arisen in regard to car sales on the one hand and to the example of services I gave during my speech.  The list I gave then was not intended in any way to be comprehensive. I might have mentioned, for instance, a point that was raised subsequently by Deputy Lemass when she inquired whether dry cleaning would be covered as well as car repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point on which Deputy Desmond sought clarification concerned my reference to the strong representations I had received on the question of the roadworthiness of cars.  Perhaps it would have been better if I had used the words &ldquo;It had been strongly represented to me&rdquo;.  However, the arguments put forward and which convinced me to use <Col N="454" /> the present form in the Bill were put forward during internal consideration of the Bill.  They were not external representations which is what Deputy Desmond seemed to think, that is to say, they were not from political sources or from vested interests.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to both Deputies O'Toole and Desmond for their very warm response to my invitation to approach the Bill in a co-operative spirit.  I trust that the <i>entente cordiale</i> that exists between Deputy O'Toole and me will not be spoiled if, arising from the Deputy's reference to the Consumer Bill brought forward by Deputy Bruton, I make the point of recording that regardless of the publication on 1 November of the Consumer Protection Bill, 1978, the present Bill was already scheduled for 7 November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the remarks made by Deputy McMahon in that regard also, I can tell the Deputy that consideration of this Bill and reexamination of the Consumer Protection Bill, 1977, involved consideration of even far more issues than those involved in the 54 sections of the Bill before us. For instance, there were some recommendations in the report of the National Consumer Advisory Council which it was decided not to include in the 1977 Bill.  All of these had to be reconsidered when we were talking of re-introducing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is another point and a more important point, and one which is illustrated very well if we compare this Bill with another Industry, Commerce and Energy measure which was before the House recently and which will be before the Second shortly.  I refer to the Industrial Development Bill, which is essentially an administrative measure to provide funds for the IDA.  That is an essential function of the Oireachtas and one to which we must address ourselves at frequent intervals.  A Bill of that nature is relatively easy to prepare compared with the measure before us, which is concerned with the fundamental rights of persons, natural and legal rights as between buyer and seller, between consumer <Col N="455" /> and producer.  A measure such as the Sale of Goods Bill is likely to have a much longer life cycle than a measure of the other type to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill before us is concerned with people's rights, its drafting required very careful attention.  This is reflected in the length of time it has taken to bring the Bill to this Stage.  Deputies O'Toole and Desmond expressed a preference for the title &ldquo;consumer protection&rdquo; rather than the title I have used.  It seemed to me that for Deputy O'Toole perhaps the important word should have been &ldquo;protection&rdquo; but other supporters of the &ldquo;consumer protection&rdquo; title might hold that the operative word was &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;. I tried in my speech to spell out the reason for preferring the title &ldquo;sale of goods and supply of services&rdquo;.  To those remarks I would merely like to add a definition of consumer protection as given in one of the reports of the NPC and which was to be found originally in an important work on this subject, namely, the report of the Moloney Commission in Britain in 1962.  This definition of consumer protection is given as those measures which contribute directly or indirectly to the consumer's assurance that he will buy goods of suitable quality, appropriate to his purpose and which will give him reasonable use and that if he has a just complaint there will be reasonable redress.  On the basis of that definition I submit that consumer protection involves even much more than what is included in this Bill. As I have said before, this measure is not by any means the last measure that this House will be dealing with in terms of consumer protection.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment, from Deputy Keating in particular, regarding my use of the phrase &ldquo;a lawyer's Bill&rdquo;. When I used that phrase I was not suggesting that this Bill was one merely for the benefit of lawyers, although I hope it will make matters easier for lawyers by spelling out many points which might otherwise have to be argued.  What I meant was that the Bill was highly technical in the legal sense.  The subject matter concerns so many complex legal points and involves necessarily so many <Col N="456" /> technicalities of law that it would not have been practical to produce a Bill that was at one and the same time both meaningful and comprehensive and capable of being expressed in simple terms.  I am very gratified by Deputy Desmond's praise regarding the structure and the lay-out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to matters that are envisaged as the subject of separate legislation.  These matters included pyramid selling, roadside or casual trading and also so-called monster sales.  Deputies will appreciate that behind these matters lie some very difficult legal problems particularly from the point of view of drafting effective legislation to deal with them.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bill, any legislation to control roadside or casual trading, a method incidentally which is of deep and widespread concern all over the country, is intended primarily in the interest of legitimate traders&mdash;as was brought out clearly by Deputy Blaney&mdash;and not so much as a matter of consumer protection.  However, the provisions in the present measure apply to goods bought from casual traders and to that extent should have a restraining influence on the activities of such traders.</P>
    <P>I was gratified that so many Deputies in welcoming the Bill acknowledged that, while it was pro-consumer, it was not anti the producer or the distributor who gives good value, plays fair and avoids sharp practice.  It will be welcomed by all reputable manufacturers, producers and distributors, as are all consumer protection measures.  It makes their lives so much easier and facilitates the honest traders in every case.</P>
    <P>As might be expected with a measure such as this, the debate has ranged far beyond the ambit of the Bill.  I was gratified, for instance, to hear a number of Deputies stress the importance of a questioning and critical attitude on the part of consumers generally.  This is something which I have always stressed any time I have spoken publicly and also in this House.  A number of Deputies stressed the need for more and comprehensive methods of consumer education and information.  I endorse Deputy Moore's view that the value of this <Col N="457" /> measure, like that of all consumer protection measures, will be lost to some extent if the public at large do not inform themselves of its provisions and make sure to look for their rights when seeking goods and services.  I also recognise the importance of what a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Woods and Deputy Desmond, said about providing detailed consumer information. Unless I am mistaken, this is what Deputy Keating was getting at in his references to his concern about the Bill being too difficult for the ordinary lay person.  He said that a major task would arise in acquainting the public generally of what the measures in this Bill and other proposed consumer protection measures would mean to them.  As Deputy Woods stated, that is primarily a matter for the new Director of Consumer Affairs.  Very much of what Deputy Keating talked about was covered in the Consumer Information Bill, 1978.  Where was Deputy Keating when that Bill was being debated in the House?  He has a lot of points and comments to make on the lack of control over the advertising associations and advertising generally, but all that was covered in the Consumer Information Bill, 1978.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods and Deputy F. O'Brien raised the question of small claims courts.  The desirability in principle of setting up such tribunals is easy to accept.  It has, however, been much more difficult up to now to find the right basis on which they might be established.  The National Consumer Advisory Council have already studied the matter and in their report to me they saw this court system as being grafted on to the present District Court system. The National Consumer Advisory Council recognise that the implementation of such a recommendation would require detailed study, and I am consulting the Minister for Justice about this.</P>
    <P>The small claims schemes which are operated under local authority auspices, on a voluntary basis, in London and Manchester, are sometimes cited in this House and other places as models for small claims schemes in this country. However, I understand that these <Col N="458" /> schemes have not proved as successful as was hoped and that their voluntary nature makes for certain drawbacks. The operation of small claims through the ordinary court system throughout Britain is facilitated by the availability of court registrars, qualified legal personnel whom we do not have in our District Courts.  As a greater awareness of consumers' rights develops, and depending on our experience of the operation of the present measures when enacted, it will be my intention to keep under review this question of introducing small claims courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Filgate raised the question of the applicability of the Bill&mdash;particularly section 13 dealing with sales of cars&mdash;to sales between farmers of secondhand machinery.  I appreciate the Deputy's point that farm machinery is now very expensive and that the cost, even in secondhand condition, of many types of farm machines runs to four figures. In so far as good title and freedom from encumbrance are concerned the provisions of the Bill and of the Sale of Goods Act regarding merchantable quality and fitness for purpose apply to such sales only where the machinery is sold by a trader.  In other words, these provisions would not be covered in a sale from one farmer to another.  The special provision for motor vehicles in section 13 is very much related to the question of the safety of the general public and a farm machine would be subject to these provisions only if it were classifiable as a motor vehicle.  The position under the Bill of a farmer buying such equipment directly from another farmer is no different from that of say, a furniture manufacturer who is buying secondhand machinery from another furniture manufacturer.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole and Deputy Desmond referred to the possibility of State aid for the consumer movement.  In other countries consumer bodies have developed their activities to the point where they have regular and enduring sources of income.  The place of <i>Which</i> magazine in the affairs of the consumer movement in England is an example of what I mean.  In countries more affluent than ours charitable foundations of industrial origin are to be found which <Col N="459" /> have been a source of funds to the consumer movement.  Some State aids for the consumer movement should be available because this would enable the movement to articulate better the voice of the consumer in Ireland.  A recommendation on these lines was made by the consumer education committee in their report.  I have accepted that report and sent the various suggestions in it to the appropriate Ministers.</P>
    <P>Deputy V. Brady and Deputy F. O'Brien referred to the dangers associated with the sale of inferior imported electrical goods and Deputy Blaney today mentioned the same point. Regulations under the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961 and the European Communities Act, 1972 provide that electrical equipment may not be leased, sold or imported unless it is safe.  These regulations are constantly policed by my Department in conjunction with the IIRS and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland which is a body set up to promote electrical safety of equipment and installation and to encourage the awareness of electrical safety amongst the general public.  In 1978 there were eight successful prosecutions and in 1977 there were eight also.  In all instances traders were required to withdraw the unsafe items from sale.  In many other cases traders have volunteered to remove items from sale when it was pointed out to them that equipment was unsafe.  Now importers are beginning to ask beforehand whether certain equipment would come within the regulations.</P>
    <P>Door to door sales was a point raised. Apart from section 47 and section 44 of the Bill dealing especially with the cooling-off period and unsolicited goods, there is an EEC directive under discussion which we will have to apply here when it has been passed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass urged that there should be some guarantee that the consumer will be able to obtain spare parts for consumer durables for a specified number of years afterwards.  This is a matter on which I have great sympathy with the consumer and one to which a <Col N="460" /> great deal of thought was given in the preparation of this Bill and in the preparation of the Consumer Protection Bill, 1977.  The National Consumer Advisory Council in recommendation in No. 3 in chapter 2 of their report went some way along this road.  It has to be recognised that most leading manufacturers of consumer durables do provide spare parts and a spare parts' service for what must be regarded as a reasonable period in relation to the life of the article and the production period of the model concerned.  It would be unreasonable to impose by law a requirement that might cut across the commercial judgment of manufacturers, and it must be recognised that it is on this commercial judgment that the manufacturers' reputation and ability to survive depend. Some product lines have to be discontinued and situations like those mentioned by Deputy Lemass will and can arise.  The approach in the Bill in section 12 respects the commercial judgment of the manufacturers and the interplay of competition but it does provide a degree of protection by enabling the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to make orders requiring that in the appropriate cost representations made by all manufacturers or suppliers that they will provide standard parts for a period of X number of years and this will indeed form part of the contract.  In this regard consumers should not overlook the possible long-term advantages of preferring a product of home manufacture because at least if one buys a product that is produced and made here one has some hope of getting the spare parts when and if one needs them for a longer period.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the first point raised by Deputy Blaney and that is the position of trading stamps.  The question of trading stamps is a matter which is subject of separate legislation and I would like to say at this stage that a Bill to control trading stamps is at a very advanced stage in the Department and it would be my hope to introduce it very early in 1979.  I do not think at this stage that it would be appropriate to discuss the provisions of that Bill.</P>
    <P>I have, I hope, covered the main points which were raised on the Second <Col N="461" /> Stage of the debate.  The debate, as one might expect, ranged far beyond the proposals in the Bill.  Once again I am very grateful to Deputies on both sides of the House for their contributions.  I said on moving the Second Stage of this Bill, the real discussion or the discussion of the measure in earnest will take place on Committee Stage.  Therefore, if there are any points which Deputies made in their speeches on Second Stage which I have not covered in my reply I hope these matters can be raised again on Committee Stage when we can have a longer and fuller debate.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Agus an Dára Léamh á mholadh agam don Bhille seo maidir le Comhairle Náisiúnta na gCáilíochtaí Oideachais a bhunú, measaim go mba chóir dom i dtosach báire cúlra an scéal a thabhairt i láthair.</P>
      <P>Bhi an moladh seo a leanas i leith bunú Comhairle Náisiúnta Cáilíochtaí Oideachais sa tuarascáil a chuir an Coiste Stiúrtha ar Oideachas Theicniúil i lathair an Aire Oideachais i Mí Aibreáin, 1967:</P>
      <P>One of the ways in which demand could be stimulated would be to give due recognition to the various awards to be obtained in the Regional Colleges. We recommend the establishment of a National Council for Educational Awards, responsible for (1) setting standards of admission to, and qualification from courses in technical education; (2) approving examination syllabuses in appropriate courses provided in Regional Colleges or other technical schools; (3) awarding certificates and diplomas to those successful in approved examinations and (4) negotiating reciprocal recognition of equivalent qualifications with other countries, particularly Britain and the EEC.  At the highest levels, the Council would discharge functions similar to those of the Council for National Academic Awards in Britain, but it would also be responsible for the awards at technician and craft levels.  It would be duly representative of educational and professional institutions, industrial, commercial and cultural interests and the appropriate State Departments.</P>
      <P>Sin mar a dúirt an tuarascáil sin.  Is dóigh liom go raibh an Seanadóir Ó Maolcatha ina chathaoirleach ar an gcoiste sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt an tÚdarás um Ardoideachas ina chéad tuarascáil, a bhain leis an tréimhse 1968-69, go mba chúis imní dóibh an dianghá a bhí le h-ardú i stadas an oideachais teicneolaíochta agus an ardoideachais ceirde sa tír seo agus le <Col N="464" /> aitheantas ar bhonn náisiúnta a bheith ar fáil do bhuanna na rannóige sin den oideachas.  Dúirt siad gur ardaíodar ceist Comhairle Náisiúnta Cáilíochtaí a bhunú, le linn diospóireachta a bhí acu leis an Aire Oideachais agus gur iarr an tAire orthu tuarascáil a sholáthar faoín gceist.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an tÚdarás ag scrúdú toscaí an ardoideachais i gcoitinne, adeir siad, fuair siad amach go raibh éileamh seasta ann ar chúrsaí nios aoirde sa teicneolaíocht agus i sain cheardaíochta éagsúla, agus go raibh cúrsaí den tsort sin de dhith go mór i limisteir áirithe. Taispeánadh dóibh go raibh na cúrsaí ag teastáil, agus éileamh ortha, ón lucht tionscail agus ó mhicléinn.  Bhí sé sin faighte amach i dtús ama ag na coláistí teicneolaíochta, a raibh dlú-bhaint acu leis an gnó, agus do dheimnigh dhá staidéar a deineadh faoi scáth an OECD&mdash;&ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; agus &ldquo;The Training of Technicians in Ireland&rdquo; go raibh an scéal amhlaidh.  Bhí an tUdarás sásta nár mhór an t-oideachas teicneolaíochta a thabhairt go leibhéal níos aoirde, agus a scóip a leathnú, dá mbéadh sé chun coinneáil ar chomhchéim mar ba chóir le fás eac-namaíoch na tire.</P>
    <P>Bhí sé ina bhac mhór ar ardú is ar leathnú an oideachais teicneolaíochta, i dtuairim an Udaráis, nach raibh raon sásúil dámhachtana ar fáil i bhfoirm teastas, diplóma nó céimeanna chun freastal ar an réimse seo den ardoideachas, agus ba lú dá réir sin a tarraingt don lucht foghlama.  Samhlaíodh go raibh sé mar a bhéadh i rannóig na h-ollscolaíochta dá mbéadh gan aon chéim ollscoile a bheith ann.</P>
    <P>Is féidir gur measadh, ag an gcéad amharc, adeir an tUdarás, nár ghá ach an dlí a athrú sa chaoi go mbéadh sé ar chumas na n-ollscol céimeanna nó dámhachtana oiriúnacha eile a bhronnadh ar mhicléinn na n-institiúidí oideachais teicneolaíochta, mar go raibh cuid dá gcúrsaí inchurtha, ó thaobh ábhair agus caighdeáin de, le cúrsaí ollscoile. Bhí céimithe ins na heolaíochta, maille le hailtirí agus innealltóirí lán-cháilithe ag teacht amach as na coláistí teicneolaíochta cheana féin, agus bhí cúrsaí in ábhair speisialta ag leibhéal iarchéime 'á reachtáil iontu dá lucht <Col N="465" /> léinn féin agus do dhaoine as na coláistí ollscoile.  Mheas an tUdarás, mar sin féin, go raibh difríocht bhunúsach idir fheidhmeanna ollscoile agus feidhmeanna institiúide teicneolaíochta, agus go mbéadh sé cuid mhór in aghaidh nádúir agus aidhmeanna institiúide teicneolaíochta dá gcaitheadh sí a curaclam agus a modhanna oibre a chur in oiriúint do riachtanaisí ollscoile. Luaigh siad freisin nach mbíonn in-stitiúid teicneolaíochta i dtaobh le cúrsaí de chaighdeán céim ollscoile, ach go mbionn uirthe, chomh maith, freastal ar mhicléinn a bhfuil oideachas iarbhun-scoile críochnaithe acu ach nár éirigh leo coinníolleacha iontrála ollscoile a shásamh, nó nach bhfuil oideachas ollscoile uathu, agus a bhfuil cúrsaí tríú leibhéal de chineálacha eile á niarraidh acu.</P>
    <P>Leag an tÚdarás béim air nár chóir a mheas go raibh oideachas teicneolaíochta &mdash;arna idirdhealú ó theicneolaíocht féin&mdash; teoranta do mhúineadh scileanna tion-sclaíochta no tráchtála.  Ba chóir cion cuí den éigse a bheith mar chuid de gach cúrsa den chinéal sin.  Bhéadh sé iontuighthe, mar sin fhéin, agus an chuid chomh-ghabhálach seo den chúrsa á eagrú, gur lena fheidhmiú i gcúrsaí tionscail, tráchtála nó ghairme a bhí an léann seo 'á chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Having due regard to the considerations to which I have referred, the Higher Education Authority came to the conclusion that if technological education were properly to serve its students and function in the fullest interest of the economy, a concrete step towards this should be the establishment of a council for national awards, with the safeguard that the standard of the diplomas and degrees awarded by it be in no way inferior to those of the universities.  It considered that the council should be given powers on the following lines: (1) to grant certificates, diplomas and degrees to persons who had successfully completed courses of study at third level educational institutions other than universities; (2) to determine the conditions governing the grant of such awards; (3) to approve courses of study to be pursued in order to qualify for such awards, including where appropriate arrangements <Col N="466" /> for industrial and commercial experience in association with such a course.</P>
    <P>Having considered the report of the Higher Education Authority and all other relevant considerations the Government decided in February 1972 to set up the National Council for Educational Awards.  This council was established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis for a period of three years from March 1972 with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>
      <i>General Function</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  To promote, facilitate, encourage, co-ordinate and develop technical, industrial, commercial, technological, professional and scientific education and, in association with these, liberal education;</P>
    <P>Éigse mar a luaigh mé cheana.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Particular Functions</i>
    </P>
    <P>2.  To grant and confer certificates, diplomas, degrees and other awards to and on persons who shall have pursued at educational institutions recognised by the council courses approved by it under conditions approved by it and who shall, to the satisfaction of the council, have passed examinations and/or other tests set or prescribed by the council appropriate to the courses of study as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>3.  To grant and confer certificates, diplomas, degrees and other awards to and on persons who at the time of the establishment of the council were pursuing at educational institutions courses of study approved by the council under conditions approved by it and who, subsequent to the establishment of the council shall to the satisfaction of the council have passed examinations and/or other tests set or prescribed by the council appropriate to the courses of study as aforesaid;</P>
    <P>4.  To award and confer degrees to and on persons who to the satisfaction of the council, shall have carried out research at a standard approved by the council under conditions approved by the council at or under the supervision of educational institutions;</P>
    <P>5.  To appoint from time to time such and so many boards of studies as it considers <Col N="467" /> necessary for the proper exercise of its functions and to assign from time to time to these boards of studies the supervision of such areas of study as it may deem fit.</P>
    <P>That was the brief for the <i>ad hoc</i> council.  The <i>ad hoc</i> council consisted of a chairman, 21 ordinary members appointed by the Minister for Education, three additional ordinary members to be co-opted by the council by resolution and a director who would also be a member of the council.  The constitution of the 21 members appointed by the Minister was as follows:</P>
    <P>7 members holding academic posts in universities;</P>
    <P>6 members with teaching experience in a higher education institution other than a university, at least three of whom held teaching posts in such institutions;</P>
    <P>5 members having experience in industry, agriculture, commerce, public administration or related fields;</P>
    <P>3 members having experience in post-primary education.</P>
    <P>In the first annual report 1972-73 of the National Council for Educational Awards, the chairman in the foreword to the report stated that the establishment of the council marked an entirely new and very significant development in relation to third level education in Ireland.  He stated that for the first time in our history it was now possible to give authoritative national recognition and status to third level non-university educational institutions and to their students who passed examinations and tests of the standard approved by the council.  This recognition was to be expressed in the national certificate, diplomas and degrees which the council was empowered to award.  The council believed that this would lead to a more widespread appreciation, both nationally, and internationally, of the very important contribution made by these institutions to economic, social and cultural development and would significantly enchance their general standing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> The National Coalition Government in connection with their decisions of 14 December 1974 on higher education decided that the National Council for Educational Awards should not be given the power to award degrees.  The council as reconstituted in December 1975 was not formally given this power.  In view of the fact, however, that a degree level course in hotel and catering management in the regional technical college in Galway was already underway at the time of the reconstitution of the council and since no university was as yet in a position to validate the course in question, the National Council for Educational Awards was empowered to award degrees to students who successfully completed this course in 1976 and 1977.  This was one of the illogicalities of what I believed was a wrong decision at that time.  The intention was, however, that in non-university institutions, where degrees were to be awarded to students, such awards were to be made by the universities.</P>
    <P>This was the situation when I became Minister for Education in 1977 and my first consideration had to be to set the situation right by restoring its degree awarding function to the NCEA and establishing an appropriate basis for the establishment of the council under statutory authority.  The Bill is a most complex one.</P>

      <P>When I took office and got the necessary Government decisions I set in motion the necessary proofs for the putting together of the provisions of this Bill.  I checked progress every week and I believe that the Bill is a very good one.  I gave this care to the Bill because of its importance.  If I should like to be remembered for anything I should like to be remembered for this Bill.</P>

      <P>And I quote from a letter I received from a person who has wide <Col N="469" /> knowledge and experience in the technological sector.  He said that the Bill is most comprehensive, equal to, if not more significant than, the 1908 Universities Act and the 1930 Vocational Education Act.  When enacted it is bound to have a profound impact on the future direction and evolution of higher education in Ireland and also on national development.  He goes on to say it reflects my own deep interest in a commitment to education and suggests, and I hope he is right, that I am erecting a monument more lasting than bronze, to coin a phrase.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a complicated one, far more complicated than would appear on the face of it.</P>

      <P>I now propose to summarise the main provisions of the Bill as it has been presented.  While for this purpose I shall refer to some sections of the Bill I do not propose to go into detail in relation to such sections beyond the point of indicating their relationship to the general purpose of the Bill.  Such discussion in detail will be appropriate only on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I should draw attention to the interpretation of institution in section 1.  It is stated that an institution to which this Act applies means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the National College of Art and Design,</P>
      <P>(b)  the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin,</P>
      <P>(c)  the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick,</P>
      <P>(d)  Thomond College of Education, Limerick,</P>
      <P>(e)  any Regional Technical College,</P>
      <P>(f)  any institution specified by an order made under section 20 of the Act by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should state that this provision in section 1 is not directly related to the provision at section 5 dealing with the appointment of ordinary members.  Since there is only one institution in existence of the kind referred to at (a), (b), (c) and (d), it is appropriate that the name of the institution should be given.  In the case of (e) the individual regional technical colleges are not named as they come under the composite definition of the category of colleges referred to.  The provision at (f) allows for the recognition of any other institutions specified in an order made by the Minister and is necessary to meet the situation of colleges to be included for the purpose of the acceptance of courses being followed in them by the NCEA whether these colleges are <Col N="471" /> already in existence or whether they come into existence at a later date.  This degree of flexibility is necessary in the existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 2 states that the council shall be known in the Irish language as Comhairle Naisiúnta na gCailíochtaí Oideachais and in the English language as the National Council for Educational Awards.  It is to perform the functions assigned it by this Act.</P>
    <P>The general functions of the council as set out at section 3 are to encourage, facilitate, promote, co-ordinate and develop technical, industrial, scientific, technological and commercial education provided outside the universities, whether professional, vocational or technical, and also in this connection to encourage and promote liberal education.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 3 specifies some particular functions of the council. These include the function of conferring degrees, diplomas and certificates and other educational awards to persons who have attended or otherwise pursued or followed the courses of study or instruction conducted by or provided under supervision of an institution to which the Act applies and which are courses which for the time being are approved by the council.</P>

      <P>They include persons who&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.  have either attained a standard regarded by the council as satisfactory in examinations or other tests of knowledge or ability set by the council or which for the time being are so approved of and relate to such courses or have performed in a manner regarded by the council as satisfactory other exercises approved of by the council.</P>
      <P>The council may also recognise a degree, diploma, certificate or other educational award conferred, granted, or given to persons who successfully complete the courses referred to or approved of such courses of study or instruction if it is satisfied that the standard in general of both&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  a particular course of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of an institution to which the act applies and relating to professional, scientific or vocational education, which course may be partly concerned with liberal arts; and</P>
      <P>2.  examinations or other tests of knowledge or ability conducted in relation to such a course corresponds or is analogous to any relevant standards for the time being in force in universities.</P>
      <P>Subsection (c) of section 3 (2) states that the council may assess the standard maintained for the time being by any institution to which the Act applies as regards any appropriate course of study or instruction.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of promoting degrees, diplomas, certificates or other educational awards conferred by it, the council may&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  take such steps as it considers appropriate either within or outside the State,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  co-ordinate, or assist in co-ordinating, in such manner as it considers appropriate any two or more <Col N="473" /> courses of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of, one or more institution to which the Act applies,</P>
    <P>3.  for the purpose of enabling students to attend or otherwise pursue or follow particular courses, assist the transfer of students&mdash;that is very important&mdash;from one institution to another institution.</P>
    <P>In this connection also it should be noted that under subsection (2) of section 3 the council may through the Higher Education Authority advise the Minister in relation to the cost of providing, or continuing to provide the financing of any courses of study or instruction approved by the council or the cost of modifying any course of study or instruction to the extent necessary to secure its approval by the council.</P>
    <P>I may say that I attach very considerable importance to these provisions in relation to the steps which the council might take to promote its degrees and other awards within or outside the State. I may assure the council that it will have the full support of the Minister for Education in this matter and I anticipate that it will have also the support of educational authorities and other professional groups which will be affected in relation to the recognition of qualifications awarded by the NCEA.  I would expect that there would be no reluctance in regard to the promotion of these qualifications and advice to students to follow courses leading to them in substitution for qualifications which may have been sought after from outside the country hitherto in the absence of the appropriate provisions for a fully satisfactory range of qualifications certified and available within the country.</P>
    <P>I consider it also extremely important that arrangements should be worked out to facilitate the transfer of students as appropriate from one institution to another and the co-ordination of courses between the regional technical colleges and the national institutes for higher education, as well as where appropriate the National College of Art and Design, and, in certain instances, the universities, to facilitate the students and secure the maximum opportunities for advancement <Col N="474" /> throughout the whole range of third-level education.</P>
    <P>It will be generally accepted that the NCEA in planning and co-ordinating courses will need to take into account at the same time the financial consequences of such planning and co-ordination. Under the Higher Education Act, 1971, the HEA has responsibility for advising the Minister of the need or otherwise for the establishment of new institutions of higher education and the nature and form of these institutions.  It must also maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education.  It is appropriate, accordingly, that it is through the Higher Education Authority that the council would advise the Minister on the cost of providing or the financing of courses approved by it or the cost of modifying any courses of study or instruction to the extent necessary to secure its approval by the council.</P>
    <P>The council is to consist of a chairman, a director and 23 other members.  Section 5 sets out the procedure for the appointment of the members of the council other than the chairman or the director.  In this connection I should emphasise that the provision made in this section is for the purpose of establishing a council which would be best able to discharge the functions being assigned to it under section 3.  I want to emphasise that the individual members are not being appointed to promote the particular individual interest of any separate institution and their allegiance is to the council and not to the institution on the recommendation of which they may have been appointed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The details of the proposals in the section may be discussed further on Committee Stage.  My concern is that the provision in the Bill would make for a well-balanced and competent council, representative of the main areas of professional and academic activities involved.</P>
    <P>I am aware that since the Bill was published observations have been made on behalf of the National College of Art and Design.  It appears to be represented that this is an institution which should be given the right to recommend one or <Col N="475" /> more members for appointment to the council.  It is my firm intention to consider this matter further on Committee Stage of the Bill.  I welcome this opportunity to say now that the interest being expressed by the authorities of the College of Art is very welcome to me.  I have intimated to the Board of the College the advantages to art education in the college, as the national college, and in the country of having their degree awards made through the National Council for Educational Awards.  I conveyed my views to them in January 1978 and I am now pleased that the board are anxious for representation.  Five professors and three tutors from the college have already written to me in the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that nine of the 23 members other than the chairman and the director shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister and it is subsequently provided that before making a recommendation under the section the Minister shall consider to what extent industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce and any other professions or the staff and students of regional technical colleges need representation on the council.</P>
    <P>I may state for the record that of the remaining members four should be appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, four should be appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, two should be appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of Thomond College of Education, Limerick, and that one each should be appointed on the recommendations of the Governing Bodies of University College, Cork, University College, Dublin, University College, Galway, and the Board of Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the council may establish boards of studies.  It may request the boards of studies to make, in relation to specified subjects, courses of study or specified branches, areas, aspects or other divisions of educational research, recommendations to the council concerning any one or more of the following.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> (a)  courses of study or instruction therein to be followed by persons for the purpose of obtaining an educational award from the council.</P>
    <P>(b)  standards to be maintained as regards any such course or other conditions subject to or in accordance with which any such course is to be conducted,</P>
    <P>(c)  the standards to be applied and maintained in relation to examinations and tests undertaken by persons attending or otherwise pursuing or following any such course.</P>
    <P>In relation to making recommendations to the council, the board of studies has to have particular regard to the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  the standard of work and the facilities for the time being available at any institution at which the course of study or instruction being considered is conducted or at which it is proposed to have the course being considered conducted, as may be appropriate;</P>
    <P>(b)  the curriculum and syllabus of the courses of study or instruction being considered;</P>
    <P>(c)  the requisite qualifications or the proposed qualifications of persons conducting the course;</P>
    <P>(d)  the arrangements and facilities provided or to be provided for the practical training of persons attending or otherwise pursuing or following the course;</P>
    <P>(e)  the arrangements, facilities provided or to be provided for the examination or testing of the persons concerned;</P>
    <P>(f)  the standards required or proposed for admission to such courses, and</P>
    <P>(g)  the standard required or proposed for the award of any degree, diploma, certificate, or other educational award at the conclusion or at any other stage of the course.</P>

      <P>The most recent water quality measurements in Dublin Bay as a whole were part of a study commissioned jointly by Dublin Corporation, the ESB and the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  This study was completed two years ago.  While I am not in a position to give the date or other specific detail of any measurements taken during the course of the survey, the main conclusion of the report on the survey was that the bay, apart from its inner harbour, was in good condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Dollymount area, it is important to distinguish between Dollymount Strand and the harbour side of the Bull Wall.  The beach area at Dollymount is one of six representative locations around our coast at which monitoring is currently being carried out for the purpose of the EEC Directive on Bathing Water Quality.  The results of monitoring to date show that water quality at this location is very much higher than the standards sought in the directive.  The scientific process whereby pollution levels are monitored is dictated by the terms of the directive.  It involves <Col N="479" /> a number of water quality parameters which must be checked regularly during the bathing season.  The monitoring process is a uniform one for all member states.</P>
    <P>The harbour side of the Bull Wall does not come within the scope of the EEC directive as it is not apparently frequented by a large number of bathers. However, the biological standards of the directive would not be met at this location and Dublin Corporation have recently erected a notice advising the public against bathing on the harbour side.</P>
    <P>The question of health risk associated with bathing in contaminated sea water has been the subject of much detailed study and the conclusions, I understand, have been that the risk is negligible and that it is largely a question of amenity rather than health.</P>

The results of monitoring at this location during the 1978 bathing season indicated that the quality of the water is well within the high values in the directive, that is, the mandatory standards which must be observed.  The bathing beaches in the Dublin coastal resorts have been the subject of a continuous bacteriological monitoring programme by the Eastern Health Board for the past two years.</P>

The Bull Wall bathing place is not frequented by a large number of bathers and consequently does not come within the scope of the EEC Directive on Bathing Water Quality.

      <P>The EEC directive concerning the quality of bathing water was notified to member states on 10 December 1975. The directive requires member states to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive within two years of its notification, that is, 10 December 1977.</P>
      <P>The object of the directive is to ensure that the quality of bathing waters will comply with prescribed standards within ten years.  The directive applies only to bathing places in which bathing is explicitly authorised or in which bathing is not prohibited and is traditionally practised by large numbers of bathers.

      <P>No new statutory provisions were required to implement the directive in this country.

The plant is designed to handle 100,000 tons of solid waste and 30,000 cubic metres of liquid waste per annum.  It serves the city and neighbouring communities having a total population of 520,000 people.  Actual operating costs are not yet known but are likely to be high.  A levy is charged for refuse collection which is roughly equivalent to 12p per bin of 90 litre capacity.</P>
      <P>As regards the Dublin area, the establishment of such a plant would be a matter for consideration by the local authorities concerned.  However, present methods of disposal for both domestic refuse and sewage sludge are far cheaper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to help and advise Dublin Corporation in every way possible, but there are many problems in the way of setting up such a plant.  For example, the Salzburg plant is on a site of 200 acres and about 200 to 300 tons of solid waste are brought in daily and dumped in an immediate storage tank.  The Deputy will appreciate that consumption must be very large to justify the expenditure on such a plant. The Austrian plant is situated in a rural area away from houses because there is a characteristic smell of refuse in the immediate vicinity but the compost is not objectionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sewage from the Dublin areas is disposed of by means of six sea outfalls: Howth Outfall&mdash;Sewage from Dublin norty city is discharged after screening via an outfall at Howth Head; Ringsend Outfall&mdash;Sewage from the centre and <Col N="489" /> south city area is discharged here after treatment consisting of screening, grit removal and sedimentation; The Whitebanks Outfall&mdash;This discharges crude sewage on the ebb tide upstream of Poolbeg Lighthouse; West Pier Outfall, Dún Laoghaire&mdash;Crude sewage is discharged on the ebb tide; Bulloch Outfall, Dún Laoghaire&mdash;Screened sewage is discharged on the ebb tide; Shanganagh Outfall&mdash;Sewage is discharged via a sea outfall after screening and sedimentation.</P>
    <P>Some local pollution is caused by the Whitebanks discharge but despite this the conditions in the bay are not ecologically harmful.  This is confirmed by the Report on the Survey of Environmental Conditions in the Liffey Estuary and Dublin Bay of June 1976. The existing conditions do not constitute a danger to public health.</P>
    <P>The bacterial levels of the coastal waters are within the limits prescribed in the EEC Directive on Bathing Water Quality Standards, except within the area enclosed by the Bull Wall and the South Wall.  It is not considered that a danger to public health exists even from bathing in this area.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the new treatment works at Ringsend is to allow for the growth in population and to pick up the untreated Whitebanks discharge.  Treatment and disposal will be on similar lines to that already in operation for the existing works at Ringsend.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the new treatment works will be fully operative in mid-1982 when the new main pumping station is due for completion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that while bathers may not be in danger there is visible pollution which, to say the least, is unsightly and environmentally objectionable?  Therefore, would he take some action to make conditions less hazardous in areas such as the area used by the Half Moon Swimming Club pending the operation of the new outfall works?</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Surely the Minister has information in his Department indicating the prices of various types of houses particularly with reference to the 1,250 square feet-area house which happens to coincide with the house for which grants are available?  Is the Minister telling us that there are not available statistics showing the various prices in respect of certificates of reasonable value fixed for houses of 1,250 square feet?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that to ascertain the lowest price approved for house of specified floor area there would be required the expenditure of <Col N="493" /> staff time that would be totally out of proportion to the usefulness of the exercise. A comparison of such prices would be of very doubtful value because the lowest price in any category could well be a freak price and completely unrepresentative of the generality of prices. For example, the lowest price in a certain county approved in June 1977 was £7,200 for a detached bungalow of 1,109 square feet while the comparative figure in June 1978 was £8,000 for a terraced house of 852 square feet.  The relevant quarterly averages were £13,133 &mdash;that was for the second quarter in 1977&mdash;and £16,264 for a quarter in 1978.  This shows how untypical were the lowest prices.  A freakishly low price can be due to a house being built in a remote area in respect of which there was a negligible site cost or to a house having been built and sold a considerable time prior to the application for a CRV or to a house being built by a housing co-operative for a member, the work including some voluntary labour.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> While this matter is one which concerns Dublin Corporation, who ordered and let the houses, the National Building Agency who organised their construction and the contractor who built them, I have kept in constant touch with developments regarding the investigations into the problems affecting the roof trusses in these houses.</P>
    <P>I have received a copy of the final report of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, who were commissioned by the agency, in consultation with Dublin Corporation, to examine the houses, determine the causes of the roof movements and assess the adequacy of the remedial measures proposed by a firm of structural engineering consultants who had been specifically engaged by the agency.  The institute consulted an expert from the British Building Research Station during the course of their investigations.</P>
    <P>The investigations revealed that serious defects in the roofs of the houses at Finglas South, section 2, were confined to three house blocks, comprising 18 houses in all and that the remaining 328 dwelling were affected to a minor degree only.  The report of the institute concluded &ldquo;that the principal cause of the progressive roof movements encountered on site was the out-of-plumb of trusses as built&rdquo;.  The report indicated that in 94 per cent of the dwellings, the movement of roof trusses did not exceed two inches.  Copies of the report have been available in the Oireachtas Library since 16 November 1978.</P>
    <P>The contractors for the scheme have been instructed by the National Building Agency to carry out the remedial works recommended by the structural engineering consultants and approved by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  This is a matter to be dealt with by the parties to the contract&mdash;the contractors, and the agency acting on behalf of the corporation.

      <P>The number of new houses completed in 1977 was 24,548, of which 6,333 were local authority dwellings and 18,215 were non-local authority dwellings.  It is estimated that new house completions in 1978 may exceed 26,000 and that local authority completions may be of the same order as in 1977.  The White Paper on National Development 1977-1980, published in January 1978, indicated that on the basis of assessments of housing needs, the Government would ensure that completions would be maintained at levels between 21,000 and 27,000 a year up to 1980 to meet ongoing demand and make inroads into the backlog of unfit or overcrowded dwellings.  Completions in 1979 will be within this range, but it is not possible at this stage to give a more precise estimate of completions in advance of the finalisation on next year's budget.</P>

      <P>The position is that the local authorities sought from the Government last year £100 million to carry out their programme.  They were authorised to spend £88 million approximately but we must bear in mind the fact that when the local authorities made <Col N="504" /> their applications for funds early in the year they took into account all the schemes which they assumed could possibly be completed by the end of 1978 without having due regard to the need and without having a proper survey carried out as to the real needs in various areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give consideration to the problems of those local authority tenants whose houses were not provided with open fireplaces; and if he will provide compensation in full for the cost of installing open fireplaces in local authority houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme of grants was introduced in October 1974 for the installation of fireplaces or solid fuel heaters in houses including local authority houses, which are centrally heated only.  These grants are payable irrespective of whether State assistance was paid previously for the provision or reconstruction of the house.  The combined State and supplementary grant amounted to two-thirds of the cost of the work or £400 per house whichever was the lesser.  In November 1977 on the introduction of a revised scheme of house improvement grants I announced that a State grant of up to £600 or two-thirds of the cost, whichever is the less, is available for installing a fireplace or solid fuel heater in any house which has no heating facilities other than a central heating system.  In addition, a local authority may make a reconstruction loan to a tenant or householder to enable him to meet his share of the cost of the work.  Unsecured loans of up of £200 may be made.  I intend to introduce <Col N="506" /> amending legislation to enable unsecured loans of up to £600 to be advanced by local authorities subject to the same income limit as applies for the time-being to local authorities house purchase loans schemes.  Pending this change in the legislation, a loan of up to £600 may be approved and an instalment of up to £220 may be paid immediately.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, open to local authority tenants of centrally heated houses to have fireplaces or solid fuel heaters installed with the aid of these grants and loans.  Work done on a co-operative basis is reckonable for grant and loan purposes.  It is not possible for me to provide compensation in full for the cost of such works due to the necessity to conserve capital resources for more urgent projects such as the provision of new dwellings and local authority house purchase loans.  I have ensured, however, that the necessary capital is being provided to meet the costs of the grants and loans for the installation of fireplaces under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The position is that we must be realistic.  It may well happen that applications will come in from a number of local authorities for revision. The time now available to carry out a review of electoral areas is very short and any such review would have to be of a fairly limited nature.

      <P>By way of conclusion to this introduction of the Second Stage of the Bill, I desire to draw attention to a statement of a former Minister for Education, Deputy Pádraig Faulkner, in his address to the National Council for Educational Awards on the occasion of the inaugural meeting of the council on 11 April 1972 and to my own statement of 18 November 1977 announcing that the NCEA would be the degree-awarding authority in the case of students who successfully completed degree level courses in the National Institutes for Higher Education, Limerick and Dublin and in the Thomond College of Education, Limerick, and in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> The then Minister stated that the existing system of awards could neither continue to meet the needs of existing colleges, nor have any prospect of extension of fulfil the requirements of a third-level non-university sector which was significantly expanded by the addition of the regional technical colleges, the College of Physical Education and the Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.  He also stated that the achievement of a national self-sufficiency in this area appeared to be a desirable objective in itself and one which could be realised by pooling the expertise of people from the universities, from technical and general education, from industry, from business, from the professions, and from research.</P>
    <P>In my own statement of the 18 November 1977, I stated that the Government, having had an opportunity of considering all aspects of the matter, were convinced that the best interest of the universities and the NIHE, Limerick and Thomond College of Education would be served by restoring to the National Council for Educational Awards the power to award degrees in the case of NIHE and Thomond College of Education.  This would afford the NIHE and Thomond College of Education the flexibility and freedom which, with the support of the NCEA, would enable them to develop to the fullest extent programmes, the foundations of which have been firmly laid during the course of their association with the universities.</P>
    <P>I stressed that a serious responsibility rested with the NCEA to ensure that the degree awards granted to students who successfully completed courses in the institutions for which the Government decided it should be the awarding body were comparable in value and esteem with similar awards granted by other degree-awarding authorities, on the basis of comparable courses at home and abroad.  This was a task which presented to the NCEA a challenge which the Government felt confident they would meet responsibly and wholeheartedly. They had good reason to be confident.</P>
    <P>I must not allow this occasion to pass without paying tribute to the work of the chairmen, the various members of the <Col N="533" /> council, the members of the boards of studies, the director and staff of the council who have done Herculean work since the <i>ad hoc</i> council was constituted. Their task, difficult and time consuming at any time, was made much more difficult by the schizophrenic policies advanced by the Coalition Government. The NCEA was established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by a Fianna Fáil Government in the full conviction that they would make an extremely valuable contribution to the progress of education in this country.  It is on the basis of the same conviction that I recommend this Bill to the House establishing the council on a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>I should like to take up the matter raised by Deputy Horgan relating to an explanatory memorandum. I have always understood that it was customary to produce an explanatory memorandum in the case of major legislation.  The Minister stated in reviewing the Bill that there was no need for one because the wording was so clear, yet in the course of his speech he said it was a complicated Bill.  If it is a complicated Bill we are surely entitled to an explanatory memorandum and the absence of one reflects badly on the Minister.  I assume the Minister takes responsibility for the final form of this Bill.  Is that correct?  Is the Minister accepting that responsibility?</P>

      <P>If that is how the Minister views a Bill we shall have to revise the whole concept of what constitutes a Bill.  The alternative is that the Minister did not read the speech given to him by a civil servant, that he came into the House and read the script <i>holus-bolus.</i>  In fact he did not find out his own error because he did say &ldquo;Article 1.&rdquo;  Then, having suddenly thought about it, he realised he could not refer to Article 1 of a Bill&mdash;he might refer to Article 1 of the Constitution&mdash;he quickly changed his usage of words and thereafter properly referred to the sections as sections.  But the fact that he allowed this speech to be circulated containing the words &ldquo;Article 1&rdquo; and so on leads me to think that he had not even read the draft prepared for him.</P>

It needs an explanatory memorandum because it is so sloppy.  The gaps in it are glaring; the references in it not at all clear.  As the Minister said, the Bill is a complicated one.  It is also a sloppy one. If the Minister assumes responsibility for it, which he must, likewise he must accept responsibility for a very bad piece of work.  Perhaps he is to be forgiven on this occasion for coming into the House ill-prepared with regard to his speech and a Bill for which he is responsible, because I suppose we should be welcoming back the wandering minstrel of Fianna Fáil from his foreign travels, back to the work he should have been doing for the past year and a half.  As was written recently by an educational correspondent, the Minister is to be found everywhere except in his office.  That is a sad comment for any correspondent to have to make in respect of any Minister.</P>

      <P>The manifesto said that the council would be established immediately on a statutory basis.  I asked last June when the Bill would be published and was promised that it would be available before the commencement of the present session.  The Bill was not produced before the commencment of the present session.  I was given an assurance it would be published in November.  Nearly one-and-a-half years after the Government came to office we have the Bill.  One would have imagined that that would have afforded ample time in which to produce a Bill proper to the NCEA.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case.  The Bill was introduced on Wednesday, 22 November.  At that time I asked for time to consider the Bill.  The Minister nodded agreement, that it would be ordered for Tuesday, 28 November but that that would have to be by agreement with the Whips.  Now the Bill is being forced on the House by the cussedness of the Minister and his party.  His allegation yesterday morning that I was not prepared for the Bill was a gurrier type remark in respect of my position as Opposition spokesman on Education.  I thought I was dealing with him on an intellectual and sensible basis, but his attitude yesterday morning certainly does not deserve anything from me except contempt in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to clarify the position because of his stupid remarks.  This is a Bill which will affect third level education in years to come.  It is an important Bill.  It is one that deserves consideration and, if it deserves consideration, then it deserves time in which to be considered. I asked for that time when the Bill was introduced last Wednesday week because there are many vocational interests affected and many vocational interests would naturally react, either favourable or unfavourably, and so I asked for time to have a feedback, if you like, from the many vocational interests involved and affected by the Bill. The only conclusion I can come to is that the Minister does not want time for <Col N="537" /> such a reaction.  He wants the Bill through before it can be criticised by me and before the educational interests involved have time to consider the Bill.</P>
    <P>Bills are not widely circulated.  They are circulated to Members.  It takes time for them to circulate down to the interests involved and so it would necessarily take time to get a reaction.  I had my own mind quite clearly made up on the Bill.  Obviously the Minister does not want to grant time to the House to consider the Bill.  He wants to ram it through for his own little purpose so that no one will have an opportunity of criticising it. The honeymoon is over and it is time now to get down to bread and butter politics and get legislation through as quickly as possible.  That, of course, will not be done.  We have the Second Stage debate today.  We will have another Second Stage session next week and that will be the end of it before Christmas. After Christmas the Second Stage will be continued.  Then there will be the Committee Stage.  The Committee Stage will be lengthy.  As a result of a cursory reading of the Bill last week I have no fewer than 20 amendments, obvious amendments like one correcting the male chauvinism of the Minister in respect of the appointment of a chairman and vice-chairman. Obviously he assumed there are no intelligent women around the country whom he might like to appoint to the chair.  There are amendments like that designed to correct the male chauvinism the Minister shows in this Bill.  It is an appalling mistake to make in this day and age to have the words &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;vice-chairman&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the sloppiness of the Bill the Minister has dared to bring into the House.  In the course of his introductory statement he referred to the historical attitude of various Governments.  I quote:</P>
      <P>My first consideration had to be to set the situation right by restoring a degree awarding function to the NCEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, of course, is the stand he took as spokesman on the Opposition benches.  I do not know what he means by his having &ldquo;to set the situation right&rdquo;.  What he is, in fact, doing is confirming the binary system of administration of third level non-university education.  He is not doing anything right or wrong.  He is establishing a binary system in respect of third level education.  There are aspects of that system which are good and aspects which are favourable.  There are some with which I would not agree. There are also aspects of a comprehensive approach to third level education which have good facets and bad facets. <Col N="539" /> There is no right or wrong in what the Minister is doing here and so the words he used certainly give a wrong impression, a kind of cheap political connotation of the bravery of the Minister in this field.</P>
    <P>The NCEA was established in 1972 on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It had power to award degrees.  When the National Coalition Government took office they examined the whole area of third level education and in a statement on 16 December 1974 the Minister discussed the pros and cons of both the binary and the comprehensive system.  A decision was taken by the Government in favour of a comprehensive system of third level education.  It is interesting to note that the Irish Federation of University Teachers in a submission on the Bill has also come out in favour of a comprehensive approach to third level education.  I think we can take it that is a non-political body, a body of academics looking at a situation which not only affects their own position but also affects the whole system of third level education, and so they cannot be judged to be political in the context in which the Minister seems to view the whole approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>They have come out in favour of a comprehensive system, a system that has a great deal to commend it.  It is not a black and white situation.  It is a matter of balancing the pros and the cons.  In regard to the binary system there is a danger that one section or the other&mdash;in this case specifically the non-university sector in the NCEA&mdash;might become the poor relation in the third level system. There is that danger and the Minister alluded to it in his speech where he called for high standards of academic achievement. That, of course, is necessary when there is that danger.  Indeed, I was perplexed to see in the Bill references to university standards in the binary system.  Section 3 (2) (b) (iii) states:</P>
    <P>corresponds or is analogous to any relevant standards for the time being in force in universities.</P>
    <P>What is meant by: &ldquo;standards for the <Col N="540" /> time being in force in universities&rdquo;? What universities are referred to; Galway, Cork, Dublin, Coleraine, Kiel or London University?  No specific standards are laid down in the Bill and standards vary in universities.  That phrase is vague and gives very little meaning.  It is not the only occasion that reference is made to universities.  Section 12 (3) states:</P>
    <P>The power vested in the Council by subsection (1) of this section shall, in so far as it is practical so to do, be exercised so as to ensure that the standard of any course of study or instruction, or any examination or other test of knowledge or ability, in relation to which the power is exercised or its syllabus corresponds or is analogous to any relevant standards for the time being in force in universities.</P>
    <P>We have that phrase, &ldquo;standards for the time being in force in universities&rdquo;, cropping up again.  That phrase indicates that little consideration was given to the structuring of the Bill by the Minister. We cannot ask the council to assess courses of study or awards on the basis of relevant standards for the time being in force in universities.  We are establishing the NCEA on a statutory basis for the purpose of allowing it to assess courses, establish standards, confer degrees, diplomas and certificates based on courses having been completed and standards for the time being in force in universities?  It is the vaguest phrase I have come across in the Bill.  There is no meaning at all to it and it should not have been included.  It will cause derision among the members of the council and will give cause for concern to those in the third level non-university sector who feel that the universities have too big a say in the work of the NCEA.</P>
    <P>The binary system may inhibit the free flow between the two sectors unless adequate safeguards are made.  It is important that students in the non-university third level sector have an automatic right to transfer to any institution in the non-university or university sector.  Under the binary system there is a danger that universities who are independent of the non-university sector <Col N="541" /> may decide that the original standards of entry to the non-university college were not sufficient for their purpose.  They may adopt that narrow attitude rather than look at the standard of academic achievement of the student attained in a course of study.  One must be concerned with reports today which indicate that our leaving certificate is not being recognised by certain English universities for entrance purposes.  If our leaving certificate is now being questioned our university degrees may also be questioned, as they have been in relation to one or two faculties.</P>
    <P>The binary system may lead to a situation where the non-university sector under the NCEA might become the poor relation of the third-level system.  That must be avoided at all costs.  If it happens the whole system will be superfluous at great expense.  That will happen unless the certificates, diplomas and degrees awarded stand up to the test of public scrutiny.  It is very important to ensure that there is a free flow for students between the non-university and university sectors.  This also applies to the staff of the non-university colleges and the universities.  There must be free access to each sector.  The lecturers in the non-university sector must feel free to transfer from that sector to the university sector, and <i>vice versa.</i>  An important aspect which would facilitate a free flow is the superannuation scheme which will be adopted by the NCEA when established. That matter is dealt with under section 14.  It is important that the scheme subscribed to by the staff be flexible so that staff can transfer from the technological colleges to the university colleges.</P>
    <P>I understand that a scheme was recently established for local authorities and that is the scheme which would be most attractive.  We are talking about 500 lecturers in the non-university sector. Another aspect of the binary system which deserves mention is the question of the degree of duplication which may arise.  In an integrated system everything would be done through a centralised acceptable scheme but under the binary system there may be a danger of duplication of resources.  I should like to mention the whole complex structure <Col N="542" /> now evolving in relation to the financing, planning and co-ordinating role of the NCEA <i>vis-à-vis</i> the HEA and in the context of the Department's involvement in the whole area of non-university education. Section 3 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás shall, in addition to the specific functions given to it by this Act, have the general functions of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  furthering the development of higher education,</P>
    <P>(b)  assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment,</P>
    <P>(c)  promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research,</P>
    <P>(d)  promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education,</P>
    <P>(e)  promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority were given the function of furthering the development of higher education.  The <i>raison d'être</i> for their establishment was that they would be the central authority where higher education would be developed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the role of the Higher Education Authority in the sphere of third level education.  In the context of the binary system now being established by the Minister, there is bound to be confusion in relation to the planning and co-ordination of the third level sector.  I should like to refer again to the submission which I received from the Irish Federation of University Teachers dated 22 November and to quote from that submission.  The second paragraph, page 2, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IFUT believes that there is a need for a single body which is competent and has the authority to plan the <Col N="543" /> development of 3rd level education in both the university and non-university sector.  It further believes that the Higher Education Authority, suitably modified, is the appropriate body to undertake this role.  In order to carry out this enlarged function properly, it will be necessary that the Authority undergoes a significant expansion of its facilities.  In addition it will be necessary that the membership of the Authority be adjusted to take account of this expanding role.</P>
    <P>The submission continues:</P>
    <P>The corollary of this proposal is that the NCEA would revert to its original role as an academic validating body for the non-university sector.  However we envisage that the HEA would be required to consult the NCEA in relation to proposals for development in the non-university sector. Similarly in relation to proposals from the university sector the Authority should be required to consult a statutorily established Conference of Irish Universities.</P>
    <P>While we envisage that the funding of the major part of the non-university sector should continue to come directly from the Department of Education, we would see the need for adequate mechanisms of communication between the Authority and the Department in relation to the funding of the new development.</P>
    <P>That is a comprehensive approach by the Irish Federation of University Teachers and it has much to recommend it.  This is a non-political body who are interested in the future of higher education.</P>
    <P>The same submission discussed also academic validation and made an interesting point that I shall quote:</P>
    <P>While welcoming the restoration of degree awarding powers to the NCEA we would oppose a statutory limitation of the possibility that some colleges might apply to one of the universities for the award of degrees.</P>
    <P>That is an interesting viewpoint put forward by IFUT.  There is no mention <Col N="544" /> in the Bill that the NCEA will have the monopoly of awarding degrees in the non-university sector.  As far as I know, there is no explicit, positive statement that the NCEA will have the only right to award degrees, diplomas and certificates in the colleges mentioned in section 1 of the Bill.  While the NCEA, when they are established properly, will have rights in relation to the colleges specified in section 1, and specified in an order made under section 20 of the Bill when it is an Act, there is no limitation on the right of a college to seek recognition for its courses from one of the universities. I should like a statement from the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>It is possible to infer from the Bill as now structured that the colleges may still be allowed to seek recognition for their courses from institutions of higher education other than the NCEA. Perhaps that is good.  Freedom of academic standards is important in this third level sector.  The universities have always been proud of their independence. They abhor interference from outside.  It is good that colleges in the non-university sector should be allowed to look at their destinies, the manner in which they want to go, the path they want to tread, and decide accordingly whether to go to the NCEA for certain awards and/or to go to a university or a university college for other awards.  This may lead to healthy competition. It may help the non-university sector to avoid the possibility of becoming the poor relation in the binary system now being established by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to dwell on the question of the binary system versus the comprehensive system.  This is a small country with a population of three million or so, the same size as the population of a large English city.  We seem to be setting up a complex structure of third level education. I have serious doubts and reservations on whether we are wise to adopt the binary system.  In the long term, a comprehensive system, a unified system, has more to offer to the non-university sector than the binary system.  The traditions of the universities, Trinity College and the Colleges of the NUI, have much to recommend them.  To date their <Col N="545" /> degrees have been accepted in foreign lands.  There is an excellent argument for ensuring that the tradition of academic excellence is passed on in a different form to the non-university sector.  The non-university sector is a different animal from the university sector.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the regional technical colleges in the early seventies was an excellent development.  The NCAD is mentioned in the Bill but Kevin Street and Bolton Street are not mentioned for some peculiar reason. These technological colleges take a different form.  They have a different entrance qualification.  They have a different structure of learning.  They deal with technological and technical subjects and complementary studies which are vital to the future of this country.  The structures of the non-university sector, the manner in which they pursue their courses, the manner in which they teach their subjects, the manner in which they assess entrance qualifications, and the manner in which the NCEA assess qualifications at certificate, diploma and degree levels should be completely different from and independent of the assessment methods of the university. They are completely different sectors and healthy sectors.  This is a good move.  I am somewhat familiar with it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the granting of the degrees, diplomas and certificates, it might be good to use a unitary system so that we would know that what we have and hold dear in the traditions of our universities, their standards of academic excellence, could be used for the benefit of the non-university sector.  This could have been done through the HEA.  It could have been adapted and its membership could have been substantially increased.  Its powers could have been changed and its functions could have been made stronger than they are. The powers given to the HEA in the Act could have been stronger if the Government had been serious about the functions they wanted it to perform.</P>
    <P>I will not vote against the Second Stage of the Bill but I will be putting down a large number of amendments. On balance, I have a personal liking for a unitary system in Ireland because of the size of the country.  The necessary <Col N="546" /> flexibility to adapt to a comprehensive system could be achieved without too much difficulty and with the goodwill of those in the universities and also the goodwill of many excellent people in the vocational sector in the regional colleges and colleges of technology.  The role the regional colleges and the colleges of technology have played in education in recent years is worthy of note, mention and praise in this House.  I was saddened to a certain extent by the absence of any reference in the Minister's speech to the role they have played in education in Ireland particularly in the past decade.</P>
    <P>Newly established regional colleges have done exceptionally well in establishing themselves as institutes of education to which young people want to go.  That is the acid test of their success. They want to go to the regional colleges because of the high standards insisted upon not only by the boards of management and college councils but also, and more important, by the staffs from the principals down to the class three lecturers and part-time lecturers.  It is a matter of sadness that the management structure in the colleges which was laid down on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in the early seventies has not been formalised.  The Minister is only too well aware of the unrest in many regional colleges about the structure of management.  I do not refer to Cork College because it got in fairly early and got its structure and carried on.  The other technical colleges did not get their proper structure of management and the &ldquo;ad hockery&rdquo; of the Department in this area is to be deplored.  If unrest is allowed to develop into industrial action, not only will we have a very unhappy and dissatisfied staff but many courses throughout the regional colleges will be upset.  This requires not lip service but a commitment to resolve it.  The Minister is fully aware of this problem and I am sure he will take the bull by the horns and resolve it before it worsens.</P>
    <P>In my view a unified system would be the best system in the long run for a small country.  I do not want to be misinterpreted and I do not want any mud slung at me when I say that.  It is not that I favour the universities because I do not, for they have not adapted to changing <Col N="547" /> times.  They have not introduced courses to suit the seventies and eighties. I do not hold any brief for the universities. I am merely looking at the sector as it is developing.  I hope the binary system succeeds but I feel that in relation to the long term development of the non-university sector the umbrella of the HEA, adapted to include representation from technological colleges, schools of science, art, business, engineering and so on, could have been adapted to be the overseeing body for the third level sector. That is my personal opinion and I am entitled to express it.  I express it not in a political sense, but, as I said, as a personal opinion.</P>
    <P>I am not voting against the Bill because I hold that opinion.  This Bill will establish a binary system.  I am satisfied that is the wish of the Government and that it will be followed through by the Minister.  I am giving a personal opinion that the comprehensive system, the unitary system would be a better long-term vehicle than the binary system and the HEA could have been expanded to cater for this sector.</P>
    <P>There are a number of references to the HEA in the Bill.  Section 16 specifies that:</P>
    <P>In each year there shall, in accordance with section 12 (2) of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, be paid by An tÚdarás to the Council, out of moneys received by it under section 12(1) of the said Act, a grant or grants of such amount as An tÚdarás thinks fit.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification of that.  I assume it relates only to the expenses of the NCEA itself in its administrative capacity and that it does not refer to the expenses of the various colleges in the system to be operated under the Act.  I take it that the Department will continue to finance the colleges which they already finance.  This is peculiar because three of the colleges mentioned in section 1, the NIHE Dublin, the NIHE Limerick and Thomond College are funded by the HEA directly whereas the other colleges, the National College of Art and Design and the regional technical colleges are <Col N="548" /> funded from the Department.  We are going to have a fragmented system of funding.  Some of the colleges will be funded through the HEA and others will be funded directly by the Department.  I do not know if that is sensible, but I doubt it.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to An tÚdarás in section 3(2) (e) which says that the NCEA may</P>
    <P>through an tÚdarás, advise the Minister in relation to the cost of providing, or continuing to provide, or the financing of any course of study or instruction approved of by the Council or the cost of modifying any course of study or instruction to the extent necessary to secure its approval by the Council.</P>
    <P>Why is this paragraph necessary?  I understand why there may be a need for it in relation to the colleges designated by the HEA, but up to now the other colleges have been financed directly by subventions from the Department.  It now appears that all advice must go through the Minister and through an tÚdarás. This indicates that an tÚdarás will have a bigger say in the future.  This is fragmentation.</P>
    <P>I do not know the real meaning of this section.  For instance, it would be simple for the NCEA to tell the Minister directly what the cost of the courses will be, especially in the colleges not designated by the HEA.  There should be no problem.  It would be simple to sit down and write a letter to the Minister.  Why does it have to go through an tÚdarás? Is there some long-term thinking here that all the colleges will be funded by the HEA or is it a mechanism where the HEA will have a budgetary say in the running of all the colleges?  If so, why establish the NCEA on an independent statutory basis?  If the HEA is going to do the work of the NCEA, there is no need to establish the NCEA.  Either we are going to have an NCEA with full standing, power and rights or we are not. If we are going to mess around with a half-way house situation, that will be very undesirable to say the least.</P>
    <P>The rolé of the HEA would need to be clarified under this Bill.  I am sure that reservations have been made about the <Col N="549" /> role of the HEA in the third level sector. Members of the HEA want to know where they are going and what functions they will carry out as the original authority established to monitor activities in the third level sector.  This point has not been clarified; it has been muddled in references in the Bill.  If there had been an Explanatory Memorandum that might have helped.  That did not happen and it is not to the Minister's credit.</P>
    <P>What will be the role of the Department of Education in relation to the financing of the NCEA and of the colleges under their auspices?  At the moment they fund regional colleges and the National College of Art and Design, and the HEA funds the NIHE Dublin, NIHE Limerick and Thomond College.  There is a fragmented system that is not understood by anyone.  The HEA might not know what the NCEA were doing in one field and the NCEA might not know what the Department were doing in respect of any course not designated by the HEA.  Therefore, the Minister is encouraging confusion whereas he should have taken the opportunity of the Bill to clarify, to streamline and to crystalise the various systems of financing, of administration and of governing the third-level sector.</P>

      <P>The Government Deputies may not have been present for the Minister's speech when we were told that the Bill was complicated.  Perhaps for some Members of the Government side the Bill is more difficult to understand than is the case for other Members, but what is difficult for me to understand is that the Minister is allowing the confused situation to continue in the third level sector.  Indeed, it is likely to become more confused in the coming year.  The liaison between the Department, the HEA and the NCEA is not established in this Bill.  Therefore, one gets the impression that the right hand will not know what the left hand is doing in the area of planning and co-ordination.  It <Col N="551" /> was a serious omission by the Minister not to tackle this essential question of planning and co-ordination in the non-university sector in the context of the role of the Department of Education <i>vis-à-vis</i> both the HEA and the NCEA.  This whole area should be examined in depth and streamlined and it is most unfortunate that this has not been done.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;planning&rdquo; is not used at all in relation to the function of the council as specified under section 3 of the Bill. We expected to see the words &ldquo;planning&rdquo; and &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; which were often linked together in debates on the NCEA.  It now appears that the council are not being given the planning function in full.  Although the Minister did mention it in his speech, it is not inscribed in the Bill.  This showed, in the Minister's word, a schizophrenic policy in relation to the role of the NCEA.  In passing he used the words &ldquo;schizophrenic policy&rdquo; of the National Coalition Government in relation to this sector.  This is not correct. The policy which the National Coalition Government adopted was a comprehensive policy and that was spelled out quite clearly in a policy statement by the then Minister in December 1974.  There was no schizophrenia evident in that but there is certain schizophrenic thinking in a number of sections of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In particular the planning role of the NCEA must come into question, principally because the financing of the colleges is not coming through the NCEA. Finance is what determines real planning. If you have finance you can do your own planning.  The question of finance is still fragmented.  Some of it comes from the Department and some from the HEA and no financing or funding operation is being given to the NCEA under this Bill.  The absence of the words &ldquo;planning&rdquo; and &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; leads me to conclude that it was because of submissions made by the HEA to the Minister that the planning function was not put in.  Again a halfway house measure is being adopted by the Minister.  In relation to finance it is not streamlined; in relation to planning, it is still being left over.  Section 3 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> (1)  The functions of the Council shall be generally&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is a peculiar phrase to put into a Bill, it is very vague, not specific, very weak, not strong</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to encourage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is fair enough</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;facilitate, promote, co-ordinate and develop technical...education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Decidedly delicate.  I thank the Deputy for his assistance.  If you are going to establish an authority on a statutory basis you give them teeth; you specify, you give them teeth and you leave nobody in doubt as to the power of the NCEA.  If they are to be given the role of being the umbrella under which the non-university sector of third level education is to develop in the coming years, this section does not give the NCEA the teeth which they deserve. The only conclusion I can reach is that the HEA had their say with the Minister and because of representations made to him the question has remained unresolved as to who is to plan and co-ordinate the non-university third level sector.  It has not been resolved and this Bill does not resolve it fully once and for all.  I am sure the Deputies over there would like to see it resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have many more problems to cover. The composition of the Council of the NCEA is a delicate area.  There were howls of protest, and quite properly, that the National College of Art and Design, our next-door neighbours, have not been represented on the council.  I have had voluminous representations from the staff of NCAD.  The Minister obviously saw a glaring gap in the Bill when he himself did not give the college a place on the Council.  I inform the Minister now, through the Chair, that I will be moving an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that representation will be given to the NCAD on the Council of the authority.  They deserve it because the NCAD is a very important college in <Col N="553" /> the non-university sector in regard to the whole development of art and design in Ireland and in relation to industrial and commercial development.  The central area of activity in that branch of education lies in the NCAD and that the Minister omitted to give that college representation is a glaring defect.  One might even consider him forgetful.  Certainly he was not slow today in recognising that he had forgotten about it.</P>

      <P>On 16 November last I tabled a question in the Dáil to the Minister for Education if, further to his reply to Question No. 173 of 20 June 1978 that, in relation to the future status of the arts department of the Dún Laoghaire Technical Institute, it would be necessary for him to consult the Higher Education Authority, he would state the date on which he communicated with the authority seeking their views on the matter, if any reply had been yet received from them, and the contents of this reply, if any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally on the 16 November last, I asked the Minister if he would make a statement on the current policy of the Government in relation to the views of the Higher Education Authority on the future status of his art department.  With particular reference I asked him as to the future prospects of the Dún Laoghaire art department becoming a constituent or an ancillary third level college of the National College of Art and Design, based in Dún Laoghaire.  By implication I put forward a proposition for consideration by the Minister.  I was very surprised and more than annoyed to get back from the Minister the following <Col N="554" /> reply and I quote from volume 309, column 1210, of the Official Report of 16 November:</P>
    <P>The manner, method and timing of consultation with the Higher Education Authority in this regard are matters of the normal organisation of departmental business and I do not consider it appropriate to furnish the details requested by the Deputy.  I shall make a statement in the matter in due course.</P>
    <P>I have been nearly ten years in this House and I am not going to take that kind of reply from anybody, be it either by a departmental draft or a ministerial sanctioning of the draft or a ministerial responsibility for it because most Government Departments provide, in relation to a question of that nature, vastly more information.  I have repeated the question here and I have attempted to raise this matter on no less than four separate occasions in this House in the past month.  Since the question was tabled by me on every occasion, although the question was entirely in order, the Ceann Comhairle found reason for allocating the time to some other question, I raised this deliberately on the adjournment and I repeat my question to the Minister.  He said last June that he was going to ask the HEA for their views as to what they considered to be the most appropriate status for the art department of Dún Laoghaire technical institute.  I am asking him now has there been any movement on that request? I am asking him did he make the request?  I am asking him when was the request received?  Have they transmitted any view on their part to him?  I am asking him is there any Government policy on this matter?  I remember attending a meeting in the Royal Marine Hotel early last May when the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, my constituency colleague Deputy O'Donoghue, indicated that within a matter of months there would be a clear-cut decision on the part of the HEA and the Department of Education and the Government in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>As the House may not be aware of it, although a number of questions have been asked on this matter in the past few <Col N="555" /> years, the Dún Laoghaire technical institute has an art department.  It is known as the School of Art, even though I understand formal official recognition has never been given to a school of art as such.  But it does run third-level courses, validated as we know by the Department of Education and by the National Council for Education Awards, and the Minister has accepted that for the next two years at any rate the NCEA validated awards will continue to be sought and qualifications will be issued in that context within this art department. There is a staff as of now of about eight full-time teachers.  There are some 118 full-time students.  There are some 550 part-time students and there are some 30 part-time staff.</P>
    <P>All of these students and their parents and the part-time students and indeed the staff concerned, and I here include the part-time staff as well, are very concerned about the future prospects of the school of art.  Officially the school exists as a second-level institution.  It is quite evident that there is not the space, there is not the full complement of third level staff.  In the short or long term, while the school continues to have second-level status, it cannot possibly have the budget or the equipment which would normally be allocated by the Department to such an institution running fully validated third-level courses.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of local agitation on this matter.  There has been a great deal of local concern and recently I attended the public meeting in the Royal Marine Hotel in Dún Laoghaire on 8 November last to discuss the future of this school of art.  The local Vocational Education Committee is very seriously concerned about the matter because, as the Minister is quite well aware, the school of art has grown up under the general auspices of the Vocational Education Committee and my understanding is that the VEC does not regard itself, in the short-term or in the long term, as having responsibility for a third-level institution as such.  In the past it has not been allocated a budget which would enable it to administer a third-level school and it is not likely in the <Col N="556" /> future that it would be in that kind of administrative position.  It has a substantial responsibility for a thousand young students in Sallynoggin Technical School, Dún Laoghaire Technical School and Blackrock Technical School; there are 200 apprentices who are in the motor school in Dún Laoghaire; they also have responsibility for a large number of other part-time students all outside the school of art.  The VEC has had the greatest difficulty over the years in getting to grips, even administratively, with the situation of the school of art because of the uncertainty and the budgetary problems which it has faced down through the years with the growth of this school.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there has been, and the Minister might well be aware of this, considerable confusion about the situation. There seems to be a naïve view among some people that the whole responsibility for the future of this school rests with the VEC.  This, of course, is quite wrong.  The VEC have been unfairly and excessively abused for not ensuring that third-level status is granted.  This of course is quite unfair.  For example, colleagues of mine including three who are on the Vocational Educational Committee, Councillor Jack Loughlin, Councillor Doyle and Councillor J. O'Mahony, have assiduously attempted to promote third-level status with the other members of the VEC.  Indeed I am glad to see here present this evening my constituency colleague, Deputy David Andrews.  He has also, together with other members of the VEC, been particularly helpful in trying to bring about a final decision in relation to third level conditions.  I do not believe there is any party political acrimony on this matter but there have been a number of side issues like the social insurance stamp, the local VEC and so on.  There were some quite libellous allegations made about the administrative staff of the VEC.  A certain amount of nasty abuse has been levelled where there is no need for that kind of irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>Is the school of art to remain as a second-level separate institution or will it be established as a separate third-level College of Art and Design acting as a <Col N="557" /> new institution?  Is it envisaged that it will become a constituent third level college of the national college?  Is that a consideration which should be taken into account?  I strongly hold the view that in the long term&mdash;this will take about ten years to bring about&mdash;in the South Dublin area stretching from Blackrock to Bray and Greystones that huge catchment area of South Dublin, there is a great need for the 200,000 people who live there of a regional technical college. There is very little prospect of a proper economic, social and industrial development in that area without a regional technical college.  I would like to see that there but in the meantime we have the problem of the future of the School of Art.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us this evening what assistance he may be able to give.  I particularly stress to those who have been agitating about this matter that the final decision rests exclusively with the policy decision of the Department and with the Higher Education Authority.  I stress, contrary to some public impressions which may have been created, that to date no Minister for Education, either of the previous Government or of this administration, has given any commitment in writing on this matter.  It is commitments in writing that matter not polite words at deputations about considerations and hoping to do this and that.  We want to know if the Higher Education Authority have given any indication of the policy line they feel should be followed by the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for the very great assistance he has given in the interim period to the Dún Laoghaire School of Art.  The members of the VEC appreciate the sanctioning of additional teaching staff to the school of art and they appreciate the sanctioning of additional money by the Department of Education to the school of art.  I am sure they would wish me to thank the Minister for the interim assistance he has given, which is very much appreciated by the teaching staff concerned, by the VEC and by the students.  It is fair to say that within the fairly limited second level budget available to the Dún Laoghaire VEC they have allocated the highest <Col N="558" /> possible proportion to the school of art they could get sanction for.</P>
    <P>It is to the credit of the VEC over the years, which might not be appreciated now, that the current CEO, Mr. Séan Clayton, was instrumental in having a school of art set up under the auspices of the VEC.  Some of the snide abuse levied at him by some journals for eventually not doing this and not doing that is entirely unwarranted.  While there have been considerable administrative difficulties facing the VEC they have been internal to a situation where a school of art exists and is endeavouring with the greatest of difficulty to have a third level course pursued.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give us some indication of a timetable, because in 1977 the school received approximately 700 applications for 35 places.  This year and next year I can see a tremendous inflow of further applications.  The matter has to be clarified in the near future by the Minister.  I know that the ordering of business is not entirely in the Minister's hands and that he has had a fairly exhausting day today in ordinary legislative work.  I regret having to impose on him this evening but I thank him for giving me the opportunity of raising this matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the chance of clarifying some of the points about the Dún Laoghaire Art School.

      <P>My records and files show that no great interest was taken in the school of art during four-and-a-half years, The resounding kick in the bottom <Col N="559" /> from the electorate seems to have sharpened aesthetic and educational interest in many people.  The matter of the future status of the art department in Dún Laoghaire Technical Institute has to be viewed in the general context of third level planning and cannot be considered on its own.  The Higher Education Authority have an obligation to advise me on the development of third level education in general and the Dún Laoghaire college must be considered in that context.  The consultation is not merely about the school of art in Dún Laoghaire but about the whole development of third level education in the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire areas.  The fable of the blind men and the elephant comes to mind.  The blind man who had the elephant by the tail thought he was grasping one object and whoever had the elephant by the ear thought he was grasping something else.  We must take an overall view of the third level education scene.  Any decision must be taken on a rational basis with our resources in mind.</P>
      <P>I have a particular interest in the Dún Laoghaire School of Art.  I met a group of people representing parents, students and friends on 11 May this year and this group included the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, as well as the former Taoiseach and other representatives.  I explained to them, as I have now explained to the House, that I could not make any instant decision on the status.  I undertook to investigate three possible areas where I could help the art department to continue the work for which they have become deservedly famous.  I am happy to say I have followed up my undertaking with appropriate action in the matter of continued validation by the NCEA, the provision of material assistance and the provision of extra staff.  On the first point, the NCEA have agreed to continue their <i>ad hoc</i> validation facilities for three years.</P>

      <P>The understanding in the Department is that it is three years.  The courses concerned are the one-year visual education certificate course, the two-year national certificate course in visual studies and the two-year national certificate course in design communication.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of art materials, I sanctioned the expenditure of a sum in excess of £60,000&mdash;in fact, more than I was asked for&mdash;for the current year and I sanctioned the provision of a supernumerary grade A post of responsibility for the art department.  On 13 November last I sanctioned four additional whole time posts.  There are now nine posts for whole time teachers to cater for some 118 full-time students, as well as ample part-time staff.  As well as the professional staff, clerical and administrative assistance has also been given.  I also sanctioned recently additional posts for one senior clerk, one clerical officer and three clerk-typists for Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee.  They may deploy this staff where they think the need is greatest.  If they consider the greatest need exists in the art department, they may deploy this staff there.</P>
      <P>The House will agree that the actions I have taken are an indication of a positive attitude by me towards the school of art in Dún Laoghaire.  I know the standards they have achieved and for that reason I am committed to sustaining them.  I am not aware in detail of the background mentioned by Deputy Desmond in relation to people being attacked and so on.  In view of the support and sustenance which I have given by way of money, professional staff, administrative and clerical staff, it is the plain duty of the VEC to use these facilities to the utmost to keep the art department going without any kind of brouhaha or pressures.  While it is said that irritation produces the pearl in the oyster, too much irritation or agitation in a school will interfere with educational development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Education and custodian of the whole educational good, any action I take must be taken advisedly <Col N="561" /> and with due regard to the many other areas which require my attention and sympathetic support.  I must also have regard to advice which may be tendered to me by institutions which have been set up <i>inter alia</i> to do just that.  I refer, of course, to the Higher Education Authority and the NCEA.  Decisions in the educational sector cannot be taken unilaterally or in isolation from the overall context.  That is the point I made at the beginning.  For me to attempt to act in isolation in this or any other instance would be to invite chaos in a delicately balanced area.  It would also be an open invitation to other interests to press their claims, irrespective of the consequences to education as a whole. We have come a long way in our efforts to build up our non-university educational facilities over the years but <Col N="562" /> we still have a considerable way to go before all our needs are satisfied.</P>
    <P>We should strive for harmony and rationalisation.  No institution already doing good work in any field of educational endeavour need fear the results of such striving.  My guiding principle must always be the optimum good of the totality of the educational scene.  I cannot allow myself to be deflected from the achievement of that aim.  In particular, I am impressed by the quality of the head of the art department and the quality of the work done in that school and it is on that basis I have given the considerable support to the school in the context already outlined by me.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the number of firms under the joint AnCO/European Social Fund industrial training scheme in 1977 who have not yet presented claims for moneys due to them; and the implications of this for other firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">

      <P>In 1977 under the training grants scheme for domestic industry AnCO approved grants for 60 firms and the European Commission approved matching grants from the European Social Fund in all cases.  To date, 28 of those 60 firms have not presented claims in respect of grants approved for 1977 training, either from AnCO or the Social Fund.  Claims for payment from the remaining 32 firms have been submitted. In all those cases the AnCO grants have been paid and claims for matching Social Fund grants have been submitted to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>So far as AnCO grants are concerned, the fact that some firms have not submitted claims has had no implications for those firms which have submitted their claims.  As regards Social Fund grants, in the initial stages of dealing with the claims approved in 1977, (i.e. early in 1978) claims were not submitted to the Commission until a sufficient number was received to be submitted together to Brussels.  Since that initial stage, however, all claims received have been sent to the Commission very quickly. Unfortunately, however, the Commission requested that some claims should be represented on a different basis and this has caused some delays in payments.  Every effort is being made to ensure that payments are made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware of what happened in this case and it may be helpful to the Deputy if I recount the sequence of events.</P>
      <P>In January 1978 the social welfare officer learned that the pensioner in the case was no longer living alone and that she was no longer, therefore, entitled to the living alone allowance of £1 a week in addition to her basic pension of £9.40 a week.  Shortly afterwards the social welfare officer raised a question about the basic pension being paid in the case on the grounds that there had been a change in the pensioner's means.  Following this the pensioner's book was recalled in April 1978 as it appeared that she was no longer entitled to a pension on grounds of means.</P>
      <P>Subsequently there was an appeal in the case and on the 18 October 1978 an appeals officer decided that the pensioner was entitled to pension at the reduced rate of £2.40 a week.  A pension order book at this rate was issued to the pensioner on the 27 October 1978.  Arrears which were due to the pensioner have been issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Dunmore school authorities object to the encroachment on their catchment area of a bus bringing pupils to the post-primary schools in Glenamaddy.  The route in dispute has been in operation since 1968 and to <Col N="531" /> change it at this stage would disturb the established practice of attendance at the Glenamaddy schools from this area.  A local meeting between the parties involved which was presided over by a senior officer of my Department failed to reach agreement on the issue.  The service to Glenamaddy as it operated up to the closing of the schools for the summer holidays this year is being continued for the present.</P>
