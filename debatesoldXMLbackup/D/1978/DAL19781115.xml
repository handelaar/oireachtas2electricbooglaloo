      <P>I should like to raise again the question discussed yesterday about the possibility of a substantive debate on the EMS.  There would seem to be some ambiguity about this and we should like to have it clarified one way or the other.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to assure us that the meetings in December will not take decisions in the matter?  If he is not in a position to give us that assurance, I suggest he is bound by what he said in the Dáil on 11 October when he assured us there would be a debate in the Dáil beforehand unless those meetings were not to take decisions. Can he assure us now that decisions will not be taken there, and if not will we have a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any assurance as to what will happen on 4 and 5 December.  I would wish, and I think this is what I will do if decisions have to be taken, to refer such decisions back to the Oireachtas and to the Government, if it is not possible, and it is unlikely to <Col N="898" /> be possible, to have a debate in advance on the specific details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that when the heads of Government meet they may not take decisions in the strict legal Community sense of the word, but what will be decided at that level will be unalterable thereafter, so much so, indeed, in the case of the regional fund, that the expenditure was regarded as obligatory because a decision had been taken at that level. Because such decisions are unalterable thereafter, the effect of what the Taoiseach proposes is that this House will not have an opportunity to consider this matter until decisions will have been taken, and the nominal business of having a debate afterwards would not mean anything.  The Taoiseach gave us clear assurances in this matter.  He told this House:</P>
      <P>I propose to have a more substantive debate as soon as we know what the issues are and what problems accepting the EMS would pose for us. As of now, even if the Brussels Summit on 4 and 5 December come to conclusions about it&mdash;I do not know if that is likely, but if it is&mdash;I hope that the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing it in advance.</P>
      <P>When pressed subsequently by the Leader of the Labour Party the Taoiseach kept on saying that it was his intention to have such a debate, and when the Leader of the Labour Party questioned him further he then, in a somewhat petulant way, said that if the Deputy were less insistent he would get a lot more co-operation.  That technique headed off further questions on that occasion. He had given the assurances that there would be a substantive debate in the House before possible decisions on 4 and 5 December.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not get myself involved in pedantics.  The Deputy quoted me as saying that I hoped it would be possible.  That still remains my position.  I can assure the Deputy that I will not pull a fast one on him or anybody else as far as the EMS is concerned. The Deputy will appreciate from <Col N="899" /> his experience in Europe that neither the German Chancellor nor the French President knows exactly what will happen on 4 December, and they are the two initiators of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday when I asked him about a further debate and about allowing time for such a debate, the Taoiseach asked me for a reference of the earlier discussion.  It was on 11 October and it is reported at column 93 of the Official Report.  I will quote from that debate:</P>
      <P>Mr. Cluskey: The Taoiseach mentioned the question of 3 December. Am I to take it that there is a possibility that we will enter into the European monetary system before the Dáil and the public have an opportunity of fully debating the whole question?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach: I would not think so.  That would not be my intention.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cluskey: It might not be the Taoiseach's intention but is there a possibility?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach: I would not think there is a possibility of that.</P>
      <P>Any normal person would take that as a clear commitment by the Taoiseach that there would be a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate, as the Taoiseach mentioned yesterday, that there is a time factor involved.  Apparently it is now desirable for the Taoiseach to visit a number of heads of State before 4 December, but when the Government are about to take a decision, or there is such a possibility, that will have very far-reaching effects on the livelihood of many other people and on the quality of life here, surely in a democracy it is possible to find time for the House and the public to enter into a public debate before any commitment at any level is given?  I again ask the Taoiseach to consider having a sitting over a weekend if necessary.</P>

      <P>I want to say again that I will not avoid any commitment which I have entered into, but from what Deputies FitzGerald and Cluskey have quoted it is obvious that there has not been any commitment, because I was not in a position to give it.  The EMS, as far as Europe is concerned, is an entirely new concept, if one disregards the &ldquo;Snake&rdquo;.  It is certainly an entirely new concept as far as we are concerned.  On 11 October I could not anticipate the course of events that would bring the EMS into effect.  I cannot do so now, and that is why I cannot give a firm undertaking about a debate.  I will assure the Deputies that I will not enter into commitments unless I am satisfied that we will have an opportunity here to endorse any such commitments.</P>

      <P>On 11 October, in one of his replies to Deputy Cluskey in regard to our entering the EMS before the Dáil would have had an opportunity to debate the question fully, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;I would not think there is a possibility of that&rdquo;.  Suspecting there might be some trap, because of the way in which the Taoiseach uses language, Deputy Cluskey asked: &ldquo;There is no possibility?&rdquo;  Then, in a show of petulance, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;If the Deputy was less insistent he would get a lot more co-operation.&rdquo;  We cannot do business like that in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister please begin again as the House is noisy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill outlines the purposes of the Bill and details its provisions, I will confine myself to a résumé in this statement of the principal points of interest to the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill has two purposes.  First, it is designed to continue the existing exchange control legislation in operation for a further four years.  This matter is covered by section 2 of the Bill.  The present legislation, which is contained in the Exchange Control Act, 1954, the Principal Act, as continued in operation by the Exchange Control Act, 1974, is due to expire at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Bill will amend the Principal Act so as to enable the Minister to extend the provisions of the Act to transactions with the United Kingdom should the need ever arise.  Sections 3 to 6 of the Bill deal with this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the continuation of the present legislation, I might recall that our exchange control system had its origin in the emergency legislation introduced during the Second World War. The object then was to restrict outflows, both capital and current, to non-sterling area countries in order to ensure that we would have access to the sterling area pool for hard currency required to finance essential imports.  Since the war control has been relaxed progressively in line with the movement towards greater convertibility of currencies, the freeing of international trade and the assumption of commitments with the International Monetary Fund and the OECD <Col N="903" /> and under the Treaty of Rome.  These commitments in general, require us to avoid restrictions on current international payments and transfers and, in addition, under the Treaty of Rome, we are obliged to liberalise certain capital transfers to other Community countries.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, our present exchange controls restrict capital transfers only, though personal capital transfers to and direct investments in other EEC countries are liberalised, as also, to a certain extent, are personal capital transfers to other countries.  Current transactions are not restricted but they are supervised to ensure they are not being used to evade capital controls.</P>
    <P>Our exchange control was designed to take account of our membership of the sterling area, which is termed the &ldquo;scheduled territories&rdquo; for the purposes of exchange control legislation. Transfers within the scheduled territories are not restricted except where there is a non-scheduled-territory interest in the transaction.  At one time, the scheduled territories included, in addition to the State and the United Kingdom, almost all the countries in the present British Commonwealth and some other countries which had close financial ties with the United Kingdom.  Today they include only the State, the United Kingdom and Gibraltar.</P>
    <P>When the Exchange Control Act, 1954, was being drafted, it was hoped that in the then foreseeable future it might be found possible to return to full convertibility of sterling and, accordingly, the Bill was expressed to expire after a period of four years.  Since then it has been found necessary to pass continuance Acts every four years.  Today, while the second amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF and the emerging European Monetary System can be seen as steps in the direction of greater international monetary stability, there seems little prospect of our being able to dispense with exchange control powers for some time to come.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, therefore, provides for the continuation of the Principal Act in operation for a further four years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> The amendments proposed in the remaining sections of the Bill are contingency provisions, foreshadowed by the Minister for Finance in his statement in this House on 17 October in the debate on the proposed European Monetary System.  The extension of exchange control to the United Kingdom might become necessary in the event of a change in the fixed parity relationship between the Irish pound and the pound sterling, for instance, if we were in the European Monetary System and the United Kingdom remained outside.  It might be necessary in that situation to control the movement of funds into and out of the State from and to the United Kingdom to the extent necessary to restrict undesirable speculative movements.</P>
    <P>The first amendment, which is in section 3 of the Bill, would enable the Minister, by regulations, to exclude the United Kingdom from the definition of the scheduled territories.  The &ldquo;scheduled territories&rdquo; are at present defined in section 3 of the Act as including (a) the State, (b) Northern Ireland, Great Britain the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and (c) such other territories as may be prescribed by the Minister for Finance by regulations.  While the provision gives the Minister wide powers in regard to the definition of the &ldquo;scheduled territories&rdquo;, he has no power to exclude the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  The amendment would allow the Minister to alter the definition by regulations, to exclude these territories either in whole or in part.  It would thus give the basic power to apply exchange control to transactions with the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, if the need should arise.  If this power were availed of, it would follow that a further regulation would be made under the Minister's existing powers to exclude Gibraltar, which, apart from the State, is the only other territory included in the &ldquo;scheduled territories&rdquo; at present.  It would, of course, be possible for the Minister to make regulations bringing the United Kingdom or other areas back within the scope of the &ldquo;scheduled territories&rdquo; at a later date if that were desired.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> The existing powers in the Act in relation to the importation of currency notes&mdash;section 15 (2)&mdash;and the exportation of currency notes and other financial instruments&mdash;section 16 (2)&mdash;do not apply to transactions with the United Kingdom.  The amendment in section 4 would remove the existing limited prohibition in section 15 (2)&mdash;in respect of which an exemption has in fact been given by regulations&mdash;on the importation of United Kingdom currency notes from outside Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  Instead, it would allow the Minister for Finance to prohibit the importation, except with his permission, of such scheduled territory or foreign currency notes as might be prescribed by him by regulation.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that any regulations made under this provision might also specify the areas from which such currencies might not be imported.  Under the new section, therefore, the Minister would have power to make regulations prohibiting the importation of Irish currency notes which had been illegally exported, which are not covered by the present provision, or of currency notes of other countries including the United Kingdom, should inflows of such notes threaten to have a destabilising effect. The proposed amendment would, of course, have no effect until such time as regulations were made under it.  Such regulations would provide that normal inflows of notes&mdash;for example, for business or tourist visits&mdash;would not be affected.  Similarly, in relation to section 16 (2) of the Act, the amendment in section 5 would allow the Minister, should the need arise, to control the export of currency notes, postal orders and assurance policies to the United Kingdom. The subsection at present allows the Minister to prohibit the export of currency notes and other financial instruments to any place other than the United Kingdom.  The enabling provision would not come into effect immediately but would depend on the making of a commencement order by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a consequential technical amendment to sections 18 and 19 of the Act to ensure that any import prohibitions <Col N="906" /> introduced under the proposed amendment to section 15 (2) are covered by the Customs Acts in the same way as existing import and export prohibitions.</P>
    <P>I should stress again that all these amendments are contingency provisions. They will not come into effect when the Bill is passed, but will be brought into operation when and if the need arises by ministerial regulations in the case of sections 3 and 4 and by ministerial order in the case of section 5.  Any regulations made must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House within the next 21 days thereafter.</P>
    <P>In summary, then, I am asking the House to agree to two matters&mdash;the extension of the basic exchange control legislation for a further four years and the necessary amendments to enable the Minister for Finance to extend these powers to cover transactions with the United Kingdom should the need emerge at any point.  I trust the Bill will be acceptable to the House on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are accepting this Bill even though we regret the necessity for continuing exchange control again for the fifth or sixth time since the original Act was brought in in 1954.  Going back over the Dáil debates since then it is interesting to note the irony that on every occasion a Minister for Finance has stood up in this House and said that the Act had been brought in initially with the intention and in the hope that exchange control would not be necessary after the expiry date of the Act, that is four years, and each Opposition spokesman on finance regretted the necessity for having exchange control. The words used on every occasion and again by the Minister of State this morning were virtually the same each time an extension or amendment of the original Act was brought in.  It is regrettable that after almost 25 years exchange control is still necessary in the chaotic monetary world that exists at present and has existed for 40 or 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something different in this morning's amendment in that it includes the UK, as it is termed.  It amounts to a provision whereby if the Minister at any <Col N="907" /> time feels it is desirable or necessary he may extend exchange control to the UK or &ldquo;the scheduled territories&rdquo; as they are defined in the Act.  The necessary but unfortunate timing of this amending legislation is going to cause some concern to the unknowing in the business community who will possibly but erroneously connect it with the present negotiations for entering into the EMS. The Minister should take the opportunity to underline and reiterate as strongly as possible that this is enabling legislation and will not be brought in even in the event of our going into the EMS and the UK not going in.  I hope the Minister will confirm this when he is replying.  The fewer controls on capital there are the better.  With the possibility of those controls existing between what is our main trading partner and ourselves, the people engaged in that trade should be given every assurance that that position will not change on 1 January next if we go into the EMS and the United Kingdom does not.</P>
    <P>Very recently the Central Bank have not been allowing the forward buying of £s sterling after 1 January.  This is causing concern in the business community and could have the effect of credit that would normally be available in England being take up here from the ordinary commercial banks.  It is a valuable source of credit for the business community and for the country in general that somebody can buy goods now and agree to pay for them in six months time so that the goods being disposed of gain a premium before the cheque has to be written.  At the moment it is not possible to do that in the UK because of the Central Bank order.</P>
    <P>This is causing even more concern because it is possible today to buy forward, say, German marks; in other words, if somebody engaged in business wants to buy his goods from Germany on a credit basis, paying for them in three, six or 12 months time, he can so determine today in consultation with his ordinary commercial bank.  He can buy German marks today and he knows the risk he is taking forward.  But this is at the moment.  It is a problem which would <Col N="908" /> be very easily and quickly solved because of the large number of imports taking place, particularly at this time of the year.  There is concern in the business community that it is not possible to do this with £s sterling; that it is not possible to obtain credit from a company in England and guarantee to pay them in six months time in £s sterling on any date after 1 January next.  The Central Bank's argument is that it is not necessary to buy forward sterling because there will be no change in the rates applicable between the Irish punt and the £ sterling at that time and that they will still be on a one for one basis. Everybody would hope that that would be the case.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Minister will understand and bring to the attention of the Central Bank that what it is hoped may happen&mdash;and will almost certainly happen&mdash;is not sufficient when a contract is being drawn up.  It must be on a firmer basis than that.  The Minister should assure the House and the community generally that only as a very last resort will the provisions under the section of the Act that allowed the scheduled territories to be brought within the exchange control area be used.  The Minister will understand that the Border between the State and Northern Ireland is one very good reason why there should not be control.  We do not want any further erosion of the free flow of people and money across the Border. We do not want the very practical problem that in what is called the high season, that is the summer months, somewhere about 50,000 cheques every week are cashed in this country and in English banks.  Apart from the money involved, that is an enormous volume of paper alone that needs handling.  This will mean more work for the banks if it has to be put through an exchange control system.</P>
    <P>As a last point on this, because of the uncertainty of the present situation, if we go into the EMS on 4 December and Britain do not, what happens on 1 January to the English notes at present in circulation?</P>

      <P>I am not discussing the EMS.  I am discussing the effect this Bill would have if we join the EMS.  The section amending the definition of the scheduled territories is included because of the possibility of our joining the EMS and England not joining it.  I want to find out from the Minister whether he can see a danger to our economy if during December people felt English £ notes would be discounted on 1 January and if they started to refuse them in shops.

      <P>While previous debates on Bills of this kind may have been of academic interest only, on this occasion the position is dramatically different. For the first time there is a possibility that the powers sought in this Bill will be invoked.  In the event of Britain staying out of the new monetary arrangements in Europe, this Bill will have a very material effect on economic relations between the two countries.  The likelihood of Britain staying out has increased rather than diminished since the meeting at Bremen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about the possibility <Col N="910" /> of a change in parity between the Irish £ and the British £.  In that event, this Bill will take effect and there will be a threat to Irish jobs because half our export trade is with Britain.  If the British devalue against our currency, our goods will be at competitive disadvantage on the British market as against British goods, and Irish jobs could be lost.  That makes more acute the necessity to get an adequate capital resource transfer in the new monetary arrangements.  The prospect of gaining such a capital resource transfer is far from certain. Discussions are continuing and it does not come within the ambit of this Bill to consider the likelihood of those discussions being successful.</P>
    <P>With the powers sought in this Bill likely to come into effect for the first time, it becomes all the more necessary to get that capital resource transfer to avert a deflationary impact.  There will be a much closer relationship between the real state of the Irish economy and the value of our currency.  Up to now, we have been able to mask our failures in the home economy by deficit budgeting, by the protective umbrella afforded by sterling's international role.  That possibility will not be there in the future should the events foreshadowed in the discussions on the EMS become a reality.  There will be a very much closer relationship between our performance at home and our failures and what happens to our currency.</P>
    <P>From statements made by the British Prime Minister it does not appear that they will be entering the new arrangements because of their fears about their impact on their inflation rate and their employment rate.  We will have to be more stringent about our national accounts and how we run our economy. The old lackadaisical deficit budgeting will not be possible to the same extent as it was previously.  The decision of the trade unions yesterday shows the kind of difficulties we will be up against next year.  The unions had to make that decision because of their fears&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The cost of living will be affected by the abolition of children's allowances and the phasing out of food subsidies.  However, I do not wish to elaborate on that.  We will have other opportunities to do so.  It is doubtful that the Government have fully assessed all the implications for the Irish economy of a break with sterling.  After over 100 years, it is difficult to make a full and comprehensive assessment of how closely the economies of the two islands have become intertwined.  Many people considering our monetary future and the kind of arrangements we may make in future probably dismiss too lightly the practical difficulties likely to arise in the event of a break with sterling. I do not know whether any authoritative study has been made by the Department of Finance.  Certainly one is overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the political division of this island we are now to have for the first time a very sharp difference in the economic regimes of both north and South.  This will lead to a good deal of dislocation in cross-Border trade apart from the difficulties that will result for <Col N="912" /> Irish industry and business in terms of our close connection in this regard with the British economy.  One sympathises with the view that it would be better in the long term to yoke the Irish economy to the healthier economies of the Continent but the dislocation that may result during the period of re-adjustment may prove fatal for many of our industries. Our economy is so small compared with those larger economies that difficulties of adjustment even for a short period could prove fatal for many sensitive sectors of industry and business.  I trust that the Minister will address himself to some of these points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned yesterday evening I had been summarising the observations made by Deputies during the course of the Second Reading and commenting on the paucity of the material that their contributions contained. The former Minister, Deputy Clinton, having said that he would not be bitter about the subject, proceeded to make an extraordinarily bitter contribution that was extraordinarily devoid of any constructive thinking.  To support his case, such as it was, he quoted copiously from the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.</i><Col N="921" /> There is a great irony in the former Minister quoting from the editorial matter in that journal having regard to the fact that the editor was the person designated by the Minister on the last day of the tenure of office of the Coalition Government to be the chairman of the National Agricultural Authority.  He was a member of a great many other State and semi-State boards under the tutelage of the Coalition Government.  It is worth noting without comment that the close friendship and neighbourliness between the former Minister and the editor of the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> was common knowledge for at least 30 years.  It is not to be wondered at that the former Minister had sheaves of quotations favourable to him and the regime he stood for and he quoted them copiously. Apart from showing this friendship very clearly, they threw very little other light.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputies on both sides of the House that the need now is to get the Comhairle established and working as quickly as possible.  It is difficult for me to edit the widely diverging views expressed by Deputies opposite on such important matters as whether or not the Foras should be integrated with the other services. If I understood Deputies Hegarty and Bermingham correctly, there is a better way to do it.  In making that assertion they agreed with what the Bill proposes to do.  They proceeded to raise smaller objections which did not really amount to anything and which were sometimes based on obvious misapprehensions, such as the misapprehension about the charging of fees for advisory services.  It was alleged that this is provided in the Bill and it is not the case. This demonstrates the paucity of the objections raised by the Opposition, although they were slightly more vocal in opposition than they were last year during the debate on the Bill setting up the National Agricultural Authority. During that debate only two Deputies spoke on the Minister's side, only two spoke on Committee Stage and they were against the Bill rather than for it.  I am pleased to see that since the situation has been corrected they have recovered their eloquence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was made by Deputies <Col N="922" /> Woods and Callanan and possibly by others about the formidable amount of paperwork associated with the farm modernisation scheme which now confronts agricultural advisers.  This point has been made repeatedly both inside and outside the House but we must ask how true it is.  Is it true that the individual adviser is snowed under with application forms for the farm modernisation scheme, of which I have personal experience as a farmer?  I have to say that I find no great difference between the documentation for the farm modernisation scheme and that for the old farm improvement scheme of long ago.  I had no difficulty whatever in handling these forms in a very short time.  Deputies and others should be sure of their facts before making bland assertions that it is not possible for advisers to get out on the land because they are stuck in offices coping with vast quantities of paperwork.  I doubt that is the case.  If it is the case, the Comhairle will deal with the question of providing clerical assistance.  I do not think this matter gives rise to serious difficulty for advisers, especially in the western counties where a great many farmers have not applied for classification under the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to comment at this stage on the supplementaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not recall anything in the Bill which has anything to do with supplementary applications under the farm modernisation scheme.  I commented on speeches made by Deputies on both sides of the House and I am expressing a view that the certitude with which they spoke regarding the enormity of the paper work involved in the farm modernisation scheme is not at all clear to me and I would need a great deal of substantiation before I would accept that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>In Wexford there are as many supplementaries as there are plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the case, the Comhairle will take the appropriate steps <Col N="923" /> in providing clerical assistance.  In his very comprehensive contribution, Deputy Smith delineated with great precision the reasons why the disassociation of An Foras Talúntais from the advisory services is the correct procedure.  There is no need for me to elaborate.  He commented on the great fuss being made about this Bill in the presence of the long-lasting difficulties which beset the farming industry as a result of errors made during 1974 and 1975.  He spoke of the calamitious loss of cows by slaughtering into intervention in those two years which is now bearing fruit and showing itself in the disappointing calf crop this year.  This situation will carry on into next year because when 650,000 cows are killed in a single year the absence of the calves they might have produced becomes obvious within two or three years.  I have no doubt that the Opposition will be the first to harp on this.  It is due to the idiotic insistence of the Coalition Government on allowing cow beef to go into intervention. That situation has since been corrected.</P>
      <P>The profound effects of that very ill-judged course are quite as bad as our failure during that time to seek a calf subsidy, as the Italians did, rather than the slaughter subsidy which we foolishly sought.  The folly of this was pointed out by members of Fianna Fáil, including myself.  I remember the Minister saying he did not think a calf subsidy would be appropriate for our conditions.  How wrong he was and how dire the consequences are now.</P>
      <P>Another inherited feature to which Deputy Smith referred is the legacy of disease we inherited as a result of the total stoppage of disease eradication for two years, the stoppage in the beef classification scheme which was in an advanced state of preparation when I left the Department in 1973&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I must tell Deputy Bruton, spokesman on agriculture for the Fine Gael Party though he may be, that his own contribution was no brilliant offering in any respect whatever.  I was talking about the disastrous running down of the sheep flock which took place under the Coalition Government. We have to attempt now to reconstruct the situation we found there too.  Of course, the really idiotic course the Coalition took was in prosecuting the persons to whom they wished to sell sheepmeat.  I doubt very much that they see the error of their ways even now.  But no matter.  The situation is immeasurably better than it was then.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking of the seeming incoherence of the Opposition from the point of view of anything approximating to unity of approach.  We now have Deputy Bruton almost lashing himself into a frenzy on the dire consequences that will follow from the separation of An Foras from the advisory services, the isolation into an ivory tower of <Col N="925" /> An Foras because of its progressive and gradual removal into the world of pure science, divorced from the humdrum workaday world of farmers.  We know this is not true and Deputy Kenny and Deputy O'Donnell said it is not the truth because in the course of their contributions they paid particular tribute to the work of An Foras&mdash;Deputy O'Donnell in the case of that body's work in west Kerry and Deputy Kenny in the case of that body's work in Connemara.  Which way do Deputies opposite want it?  It was not clear from their contributions? I want to make a passing reference to the search by the Opposition for the root causes of the action the Government are taking.  Our attitude even when we were in Opposition has always been consistent and crystal clear, and it remains so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> Its clarity is enshrined in the Bill before us now in sharp contrast to the two-way attitude of the Coalition.  Deputy Clinton and others, but notably Deputy Clinton, have arrived at the answer to the source of it.  It is my vindictiveness, my viciousness and so on.  Anyone listening to Deputy Clinton yesterday would be in no doubt at all as to where the bitterness lay and as to where the disappointment lay because &ldquo;The best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley&rdquo;, which is what happened in Deputy Clinton's case.  That is not to say that the new advisory service and An Foras Talúntais will not be the better for the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Nuair a deirim &ldquo;forbairt na Gaeltachta&rdquo;, tá san áireamh agam ní amháin forbairt eacnamaíochta agus forbairt shóisialacha ach chomh maith leis sin forbairt chúltúrtha.

Thóg mé cúpla comharchumainn chun taispeáint, chun cruthú, an dea-obair is féidir a dhéanamh san bhforbairt phobail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá cúpla ceisteanna agamsa don Aire faoi ghluaiseacht na comharíochta agus go háirithe na comharchumainn.  Cúpla mí sular fhág mé oifig Aire na Gaeltachta bhí cúpla cruinnithe agam le Comhdáil Chomharchumann na Gaeltachta.  Tháinig ionadaithe ó na comharchumainn ar fud na Gaeltachta le chéile cúpla uair chun a gcuid fadhbanna a phlé, agus bhí eagras maith ann ar feadh tamaill, agus sular fhág mise an oifig cuireadh an t-eagras sin ar bonn níos sásúla agus ar bonn seasmhach, agus bhí mé ag plé conas is féidir gluaiseacht na comharíochta a chur chun cinn.  Bhí sé beartaithe ag an am sin lár-ionad a bhunú sna Forbacha i Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe agus oifigeach lán-aimsireach a cheapadh.  Phléigh mé an cheist go léir leis an IAOS agus is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil an IAOS antábhachtach agus gur thugadar antacaiocaht do ghluaiseacht na comharíochta sa Ghaeltacht.  Níl fhios agam ar ceapadh an t-oifigeach lán-aimseartha sin.  Bhí sé scriobhtha go mbeadh láreagras sna Forbacha, go mbeadh foireann lán-aimseartha ann, agus go háirithe, go mbeadh Comharchumann <Col N="929" /> na Gaeltachta ceapaithe.  Bhí mo Roinn sásta tacaiocht airgeadais a thabhairt an t-am sin.  Chabhraigh an IAOS go mor chun é sin a dhéanamh.  Níl fhios agam an raibh aon dul chun cinn faoi sin.  Níor léigh mé aon rud sna páipéir ar feadh tamaill faoi.  Ba é mo thuairim an tam sin, agus sé mo thuairim fós, go gcabhródh lár-eagras nó lárionad mar sin chun ghluaiseacht na comhariochta a chur chun cinn agus go gcabhródh eagras mar sin go mór chun na comharchumainn a neartú agus an ghluaiseacht. a chur chun cinn ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Níl fhios agam cad iad polasaíthe an Aire, níl fhios agam conas is féidir leis an Údarás gluaiseacht na comharíochta a chur chun cinn, ach deirimse go láidir nach mbeidh aon mhaitheas chor ar bith san Údarás sin muna mbeidh sé mar phríomh-aidhm ag an Údarás gluaiseacht na comharíochta a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Horgan tagairt fada do chúrsaí oideachais na Gaeltachta.  Cé nach bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta freagrach go díreach i dtaobh cúrsaí oideachais, mar sin féin tá baint mhór ag cúrsaí oideachais sa Ghaeltacht le leas na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus leas na teanga chomh maith.  Nuair a bhi mé im Aire na Gaeltachta tharla fadhbanna mar sin ar fud na Gaeltachta agus chabhraigh an tAire Oideachais an t-am sin, Risteárd de Búrca, go mór, agus tá creidiúint mhór ag dul dó as ucht iar-bhunoideachas árd-leibhéil a chur ar fáil do mhuintir Inis Mhóir, muintir Choirr na Móna agus Indreabháin.  Ní raibh aon iar-bhunoideachas ar fáil do muintir Oileáin Árainn go dtí an tam sin, ach tré an chabhair a thug an tAire sin ag an am, tá cúrsai oideachais ardleibhéil ar fáil san cheantar sin anois.</P>
    <P>Ach tá fadhbanna eíle ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Tá ceantar mór Ghaeltachta i dTír Chonaill ina bhfuil an teanga beo fós, agus san cheantar mór sin níl scoil iar-bhunoideachais ar chor ar bith.  Tá na dáltaí san cheantar Ghaeltachta sin ag dul go dtí áiteanna eile taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht go meánscoileanna agus ceardscoileanna.  Ní féidir le héinne leas na teanga agus leas na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn nuair atá an scéal mar <Col N="930" /> sin.  Tá obair an-mhór le déanamh i dtaobh sin.  Níl aon mhaith bheith ag caint faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta, faoi fhorbairt na Gaeltachta nó faoi leas na Gaeilge muna bhfuil beartaiocht ceart maidir le cúrsaí oideachais suas go dtí an t-Ard Teistiméireacht i ngach ceantar Ghaeltachta.  Bhí sé amaideach ar fad i gcás na nOileán Arainn.  Sna h-oileáin sin tá teanga beo, láidir, agus i rith na blianta bhí ar na daltaí as Arainn dul go dtí meánscoileanna agus ceardscoileanna san Ghalltacht.</P>
    <P>Baineann cúrsaí oideachais go mór le forbairt na Gaeltachta, because the educational dimension of Gaeltacht development impinges greatly on the responsibility of the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  There is a need for full post-primary facilities in Gaeltacht areas.  I had discussions with the Department or Education on the normal criteria for the granting of senior cycle or post-primary facilities in places like Inis Meáin, a small area and I was told that the numbers were not there and so on. However, in fairness to the Department, I must state that the officials were most helpful.  I feel that the normal criteria applicable to the Gaeltacht and to larger population centres for the granting of post primary facilities should not apply in the case of the Gaeltacht.  It was Mr. Richard Burke, my former colleague and the then Minister for Education who recognised this fact in regard to Inis Mór, Cornamona and Indreabhán, where three junior cycle vocational schools were upgraded and are now providing full senior cycle facilities.  The other classical example of where the educational defect enters into it is in the Gaeltacht Lár of Tír Chonaill, a huge area called in English the mid-Donegal Gaeltacht and which comprises many small villages and parishes.  It is a huge area where there is no Gaeltacht post-primary school.  The children from there when they are finished primary school have to go into the Gaeltacht for their post-primary facilities.  Is fadhb anamhór í.  Ba chóir don Aire bheith í gcónaí ag féachaint uirthi.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana, ní raibh i gceist agamsa labhairt inniu go dtí gur léigh mé na páipéiri maidin inniu.  Chonaic mé ar pháipéar amháin &ldquo;Gaeltarra's Frantic <Col N="931" /> Appeal to the the Government&rdquo;.  I read in this report that, concurrently with the Dáil debate on the future of the Gaeltacht and the bringing in of new legislation specifically for the purpose of accelerating Gaeltacht development, we have Gaeltarra Éireann's frantic appeal to the Government.  &ldquo;The highly successful semi-State agency, Gaeltarra Eireann yesterday issued an ultimatium to the Government: do something quickly or it would be impossible for us to attract further investment to Gaeltacht areas.&rdquo;  Fuair mé cupla nóiméad o shin an tuarascáil bhliantiúil de Ghaeltarra Éireann a fhoilsiódh inniu.  I want to point out that this reference in the news media this morning is the publication today of Gaeltarra Éireann's annual report for 1977.  Of course, it is nearly a year out of date now but nevertheless it reveals a very serious and alarming situation: it is most unusual for a semi-State body to issue ultimatums to the Government of the day.  This reflects the gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>I referred to this when I was speaking here the last day in no sense of political acrimony, but I stated the fact that Gaeltarra Éireann were now having extreme difficulties in attracting new investment to the Gaeltacht by reason of the fact that the grants and inducements being offered in these very remote areas are no better than those offered in Dublin and other major centres.  The very points I made two weeks ago are spelled out this morning and are clearly illustrated in this annual report.</P>
    <P>While the report refers to 1977 I understand the position has worsened in 1978.  In two month's time Gaeltarra will be publishing their preliminary review of the year.  From my information I understand that the situation in relation to attraction of investment has worsened considerably in 1978.  It was bad in 1977 and has been commented on in the annual report.  Since this State was founded and far back in the establishment of the Congested Districts Board special recognition was given to the remoteness, the isolation, the extreme economic and social problems of the removed, peripheral, maritime regions which are <Col N="932" /> the Gaeltacht areas.  The territory catered for by the Congested Districts Board coincides to a large degree with the area for which the Minister has responsibility now.  Special grants, special incentive, special inducements were given.  They were always continued right down along until recent times and now Gaeltarra are in the position, as I said here, and I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of today's date:</P>
    <P>The carrot of export tax relief, ready built factories, available labour and capital grants, which Gaeltarra offered to foreigners were the same as those offered by the IDA, which could offer factories in Dublin and in the provinces with a better infrastructure. Hitherto the Gaeltacht areas were more enticing, because their capital grants were higher and they had a greater number of ready-built factories.</P>
    <P>The <i>Independent</i> report went on:</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the organisations said yesterday: &ldquo;We want the Government to boost our incentive package and restore the edge we had on other industrial development agencies at home and abroad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that there is very little in this and in fact without my being aware of it Gaeltarra were commenting now on the exact points I commented on two weeks ago.  It is nonsense to bring in a Bill to set up a new development agency for the Gaeltacht when at the same time we have the agency which is responsible making frantic appeals to the Government to do something.  I said that my main criticism of the Minister's speech the last day was the fact that he did not indicate precisely what powers the Údarás would have, what new grants, incentives and concessions would be made available under the new Údarás.  My reading of it is that there is nothing in the Bill to indicate that incentives and the grants and differentials in favour of the Gaeltacht regions will continue and I defy any Deputy in this House, irrespective of what party he belongs to, to stand up and say that the Gaeltacht should not <Col N="933" /> have a favourable advantage in the matter of industry.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that we are trying to establish industry in the western regions which are remote and isolated and have bad communications, bad roads, bad telecommunication services; they have all the disadvantages that one could think of and we are trying to overcome these barriers and therefore there must be special concessions available. There should be a grant differential in favour of the Gaeltacht as there has been down the years.  This puts the Minister in a very difficult position.  I do not want to make it more awkward but I want to say that we on this side of the House will support him if he brings in an amendment on Committee Stage of the Údarás Bill in which he will announce a new deal for the Gaeltacht.  The future of the Gaeltacht depends on the creation of jobs because without jobs the people will not stay in the Gaeltacht and without people we will have no Gaeltacht and without a Gaeltacht we will have no language.</P>
    <P>We must try to ensure that it will be made possible for the maximum number of people to stay at home and live and work and find a satisfactory livelihood with a decent standard of living in every parish from Donegal to Cork which is designated a Gaeltacht area.  If Gaeltarra Eireann now find themselves in the position that they are unable to attract industry and investment to the Gaeltacht what is the point of bringing in an údarás?  This makes a mockery of this question and I am very disappointed to see that this situation has arisen because the annual report for 1977, even though it is nearly a year old now, reveals a very satisfactory position and I would not be human if I did not feel a certain sense of pride and satisfaction at the tremendous progress that is revealed there.  To put it simply, the fact is that when I came into office in 1973 there were 1,836 people employed in the Gaeltacht and at the end of 1977 the figure was 4,200.  We must bear in mind that this was in the middle of a serious world economic recession.  In the five-year period from the beginning of 1973 to the end of 1977 employment in the Gaeltacht more than <Col N="934" /> doubled.  This is no mean achievement and it reflects very great credit on Gaeltarra Éireann despite any criticism that might be levelled at them.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the performance of Gaeltarra Éireann during that period which reveals a correspondingly satisfactory situation and that is the traditional industries of tweed and knitwear and so on.  The Rannóg Trádala Ghaeltarra Éireann, mar a tugtar orthu, showed an enormous improvement because in 1974 a major reorganisation and restructuring was carried out on the knitwear and tweed division of Gaeltarra.  I recall early in 1973 going down to Kilcar to visit the old woollen mills there.  I never saw such a horrifying dump as it then was.  There was a proposal before the previous Government to have this mill rebuilt and new plant and equipment put in, but it was not approved.  At that time we gave the go-ahead and today we have one of the most modern tweed mills in Europe in that place.  The traditional trading companies of Gaeltarra Éireann, such as the tweed and knitwear factories, continually returned an annual loss.  That was redressed in 1975 and there has been a very substantial increase in the profit since.  The annual report for 1977 shows a huge increase in sales, up to £1.39 million, an increase of 45 per cent. Up to 90 per cent of the total production was exported.</P>
    <P>There are bound to be difficulties in relation to industrial development in those remote areas.  I said the last day that the foundation for a new factory had often to be hewed out of rock, that narrow roads had to be widened, power lines had to be laid and water and sewerage provided.  This is a huge job, and people who live in urban areas do not appreciate the difficulty in attracting jobs to those Gaeltacht areas.  One can point to this industry and that industry which had problems, but I want to say that during the period of the - world economic recession we doubled employment in the Gaeltacht and converted a loss-making situation in the textile division of tweeds and knitwear into a profit-making situation.</P>
    <P>Prior to my time as Minister for the <Col N="935" /> Gaeltacht, particularly when the present Minister for Transport and Tourism was in charge of the Department of the Gaeltacht, there was a strong momentum in relation to job creation in the Gaeltacht.  He believed that the provision of jobs was a top priority.  It is a pity that we now see the situation where the momentum appears to have gone out of Gaeltacht industrial development and job creation.  There is nothing in the Minister's speech to show how the momentum that was there seven years ago can be reactivated again.  This side of the House and everyone interested in Gaeltacht development and the welfare of the Gaeltacht must be concerned when they find that this State body are now making frantic appeals to the Government.  I am very concerned about this and I am very disappointed that, for the first time in several years, the position in relation to job creation in the Gaeltacht areas appears to have changed.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to restore the momentum.  This side of the House will support any measure the Minister brings to the House to ensure that the momentum of the Gaeltacht development is restored.  Full employment in the Gaeltacht, which must be the basic, fundamental consideration in relation to Gaeltacht development, must be the major objective of any realistic Government policy for Gaeltacht development.</P>
    <P>There will be no objection from this side of the House if the Minister comes in tomorrow and says that there will be an increase in the Gaeltacht grants, that the traditional differentials in relation to the Gaeltacht areas will be restored. Unless this is done the Minister will be faced with an impossible task, because the Údarás will be in direct competition with the IDA.  During my period as Minister for the Gaeltacht I recall talking to industrialists at home and abroad. Their reaction always was that Belmullet or Cornamona, for instance, were very far from Dublin and there would be enormous ancillary problems in establishing industries in those places, that the roads were bad and that the communications would not be as good as <Col N="936" /> they are in Dublin.  We were always able to say that there was this or that incentive, that there was an additional incentive of X, Y or Z for going to those places.  Unless the Minister can persuade the Government to recognise this fact, I believe he is faced with an impossible task.  That is the reason I have decided to add my voice to Gaeltarra Éireann's appeal yesterday.  I did not have to wait until the situation was revealed in the news media because it has been well known for some time past that the momentum had gone out of job creation in the Gaeltacht and that this was largely because the people of the Gaeltacht and development agency, Gaeltarra Éireann, had to compete on equal terms with similar agencies and similar demands for industry in Dublin and large urban centres.  Nobody can justify that.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana agus mar a dúirt mé go minic, tá fonn mór ar mhuintir na hÉireann leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Tá sé sin soiléir ón tuarascáil ar Thaighde um Dhearcadh an Phobail gur mhian le 80 faoin gcéad den phobal cabhair agus cúnamh a thabhairt chun forbairt na Gaeltachta agus leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Is féidir an rud céanna a rá maidir le Dáil Éireann agus Seanad Éireann nó aon eagras eile.  Ach tá imní orainn inniu a fháil amach go bhfuil deacrachtaí nua ag cur isteach ar Ghaeltarra Éireann agus, i ndeireadh na dála, ar an Aire féin.  Tá an obair thábhachtach sin níos deacra ná mar a bhí sé riamh.  Tá súil agam nuair a thiocfaidh an Triú Céim go mbeidh scéal nua ag an Aire agus go ndéanfaidh sé socraithe oiriúnacha chun go mbeidh Gaeltarra Éireann nó Údarás na Gaeltachta in ann tionscail nua a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht chun fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, tá súil agam go bhfuil sé mar phríomh-aidhm ag an Aire atá ann anois lán-fhostaíocht a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Is oth liom nach bhfuil a lán Gaeilge agam, agus mar sin beidh mé ag caint as Béarla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to previous speakers debating this Bill I am very saddened by <Col N="937" /> the fact that they seem to have indicated a complete lack of will to advance the Gaeltacht communities in Ireland.  Much criticism has been voiced about the powers of An tÚdarás.  Section 9 provides for any additional powers that may be conferred by Government order and this is a prudent arrangement since it would be difficult to specify accurately in advance what would be the powers. The Minister has explained this.  By degrees the members of An tÚdarás will be able to see what powers will be required and the Minister will give the necessary powers.</P>
    <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta will be established at last and I am pleased that the people of the Gaeltacht will be able to influence the activities of the body.  To me the most important part of this Bill is that the people will be democratically elected.  The majority of people will be able to influence any decisions to be taken within the specified area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is a race against time when it comes to preserving the Irish language.  Europe and the Community are putting immense pressures on the preservation of the language.  The Minister has set before the House a Bill enabling firm action to be taken and I do not see any reason why the move should not be welcomed by all Members.</P>
    <P>The previous Government spent a lot of time talking about Údarás na Gaeltchta but what actually came of it? Was it just a phantom Bill that was discussed and bandied about the place, giving hope to people but without any firm commitment?  In this instance we have a Bill before the House, and that is the difference. Talk is cheap in this respect and actions will speak louder than words. We have here a commitment by the Minister to take firm action immediately.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the obvious necessity for industry in the Gaeltacht areas and I share his view completely.  One of the greatest industries, one that has not been referred to, is the tourism potential that exists in the Gaeltacht areas.  There has been the practice, certainly in Dublin, that parents send their children to the Gaeltacht areas to learn the language, but I should like to see a greater <Col N="938" /> emphasis placed on family commitment to the Irish language.  Why not invite families on their holidays to the Gaeltacht, rather than adopting this Irish college for children approach?  An enormous advance in the language could take place if there was greater emphasis on family holidays in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the death of a Gaeltacht area in our lifetime; I refer to the Cooley peninsula area near Omeath and Carlingford.  Perhaps it is more geographically isolated than the main Gaeltacht areas west of the Shannon, but nevertheless it is an example of what can happen.  If the investment is in people to speak Irish, and to bring them to the Gaeltacht areas on family holidays, the spin-off for job creation would be tremendous.  I should also like the idea of an &ldquo;Irish Day&rdquo; being encouraged in order to promote more active family participation in the Irish language. Children are being taught Irish in school but the parents are remote from participating with them.  If the Gaeltacht sets the example, using this Bill as the foundation, this could be the starting point for a tremendous advance in the preservation and the future encouragement of the spoken tongue.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about what could be done and about Bills to be produced, but here we have at last a Bill that will be the framework for any future powers that will be needed by the people of the Gaeltacht.  These are the people who will have the say, who will come forward with ideas.  They will be democratically elected and will be known to the people of the area.  There will not be any sense of remoteness or separatism but there will be a complete understanding because those participating will be elected in the areas in question.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of issues to which I would like to refer.  One relates to the sense of confusion that existed in the Gaeltacht where people were not sure of the direction in which they were being taken.  With this Bill they will have a signpost.  It is a question now of getting down to the hard work involved but at last they have been presented with a framework that will give them every encouragement possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without referring to a point of view that I have shared.  Perhaps there is a lost generation in the matter of Irish speakers, those people who came through their leaving certificate or matriculation examinations and who rapidly lost the use of the Irish language. Perhaps a case could be made in some respects for a return to the Celtic form of lettering when presenting the Irish language.  Maybe the change-over was to facilitate the printers or the typewriting companies but many people have found the change-over to the English script very difficult.  I should like the Minister to give some thought to investigating the situation, to see if a case could be made for a return in certain areas to the Celtic script in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It will provide the framework that is necessary for the people of the Gaeltacht.  It has given new hope and a new sense of provide.  It will give great encouragement to advance the language and a greater awareness at the time to be placed on families to come into the Gaeltacht area.  The interaction that will take place in families will make or break the Gaeltacht.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Ni minic a bhíonn seans againn sa Teach seo ceist na teanga a phlé agus dá bhrí sin cuirimse fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo.  Tá súil agam go mbainfidh an tAire amach gach cuspóir atá ina aigne aige i leith na teanga agus i leith an Udaráis.  Tá brón orm, áfach, nach bhfuil an iomad sa mBille seo agus tá imní orm nach mbeidh ann, mar adúirt duine eile, ach mála gaoithe. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé beagáinin crua é sin a rá, ach táimíd ag caint mar gheall ar athbheochaint na Gaeilge agus ní fheícim sa mBille seo mórán a bhaineann leis sin.  Baineann an Bille seo le muintir na Gaeltachta, agus dúirt muintir Fhianna Fáil go dtabharfadh siad daonlathas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus is é an peaca is mó a rinne siad ná a rá go bhfuil udarás daonlathach tugtha.  Ag léamh an Bhille seo tá sé an-soiléir nach bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Rialtas am ar bith Údarás daonlathach a thabhairt do muintir na <Col N="940" /> Gaeltachta.  Is mór an chúis bróin é sin.</P>
      <P>Is dual do fhormhór mhuintir na hÉireann, idir fhir agus mhná, cion a bheith acu ar an nGaeilge.  Is léir dóibh a tábhacht don náisiún.  Is í teanga shinsearach furmhór ár ndaoine agus tá si fós ina teanga dhúchais ag cuid mhaith díobh.  Tá sí á labhairt sa tír seo ó thús na ré in a bhfuil cúntas staire againn di.  Is intí a léirítear mórán dár gcultúr agus ár saíocht ach d'féadfadh a lán dár gcultúr, an grá agus an t-ómós don Ghaeilge, bheith ar bheagán brí mura dtéann s i bhfeidhm ar an bpobal i gcoitinne.</P>
      <P>Dá bhrí sin is cuí go ndéanfaí iarracht anseo a léiriú athuair na príomhcúiseanna a bhfuil tábhacht le Gaeilge do náisiúntacht na hÉireann.  Is fíor go bhfuil grá ag gach éinne sa tír seo dá theanga.  Nil a lán daoine sásta go bhfuil ar a gcumas an Ghaeilge a labhairt chomh liofa agus ba mhaith leo ach, mar sin féin, leis na blianta tá iarracht á dhéanamh ag na daoine an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Theip ar an iarracht sin ach níor theip ar fad air.  Is í an Ghaeilge an comhartha is suntasaí ar an náisiúntacht. Bhí baint an mhór ag an idéalachas a mhúscail gluaiseacht na Gaeilge leis an staid ina bhfuilimid anois mar Stát neamhspleách.  Teastaíonn an t-idéalachas sin uainn chomh mór agus a theastaigh sé riamh.  Tá sé thar a bheith riachtanach do Stát bheag a thraidisiún náisiúnta a chaomhnú, a dhearcadh neamhspleách a neartú agus a chomharthaí aitheantais a choimeád slán.</P>
      <P>Rud an-tábhachtach i leith na teanga ná an aidhm ba cheart a bheith againn go léir jobanna a chur ar fáil. Thuigfeadh aon Rialtas go maith nach mbeadh aon tsuim ag muintir Ghaeltachta in Údarás go bunúsach fhad agus a bhí a bhfurmhór dífhostaithe agus ar an dole.  Is fíor gur thuig an t-IarAire Ó Domhnaill é sin.  Dúirt sé é sin go minic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag cur ceist an daonlathais ar leataobh&mdash;agus cuimhnigh gurb é polasaí Páirtí Fhine Gael go mbeadh sé lán-daonlathach&mdash;céard a bhí ar bun ag Aire na Gaeltachta le bliain go leith anuas ag cur an Bhille seo os comhaír na Dála.  An raibh sé ag ceapadh go <Col N="941" /> bhfáilteofaí roimh Bille mar seo?  Ar ndóigh níl mórán cumhachta ag an Údarás.  Céard a bhí ar siúl ag an Aire le 18 mí anuas?  Níl mórán le feiceáil sa mBille seo.</P>
    <P>Is mór an áis dúinn eolas a bheith againn ar ár dteanga náisiúnta agus fhios a bheith againn ar an cion atá déanta ar son na hÉireann ag an munitir a chuaigh romhainn, agus atá á dhéanamh anois ag fir agus mná na hÉireann chun leasa an chine daonna idir shaolta agus spioradálta.  Is údar nirt do dhuine é a bhraith go mbaineann sé le pobal a bhfuil ceangal beo acu i dtraidisiún lena sinsear rompu.  An tÉireannach a bhfuil foghlaim air agus atá eolach ar an nGaeilge agus a úsáideann í is fearr a thabharfaí faoi ndeara ina thaobh gur saoránach de náisiún stairiúil é agus gur duine ar leith é.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the few faltering words I tried to utter in our teanga náisiúnta indicate that I am not as practised as I should like to be.  When I say that, I am sure I echo the words of many Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a symbol of the national struggle to revive and to keep in good health a language to which we are all loyal and for which we have great affection and love, a language which has stood us in good stead in many ways and which is of importance at present in view of the increasing pressure on our culture from all sides.  Much of the culturalisation process is good and some of it is dubious.  Language is a primary facet of culture and helps us to retain a sense of independence and a sense of our identity.  It would be tragic if it was drowned in something that is totally alien to us.</P>
    <P>We all recall the dusty days in classrooms when well-meaning teachers under well-meaning Departments of Education tried to drum into us a knowledge of the language.  We are painfully aware also that the success which attended those efforts was not as great as it could have been.  I am sure many of us remember mornings at school when we stood to say our prayers as Gaeilge without understanding a word of what <Col N="942" /> we were saying.  I remember learning history, geography and other subjects through Irish.  Having changed schools I remember that I was able to give an interesting and hilarious lesson to my new teacher who did not know any Irish on facets of Euclidean geometry.  But I was able to do it only as Gaeilge.  The teacher did not understand any Irish and he could only take my word that I understood the theories I was putting forward. I understood them but I could not explain them in English and nobody else could understand me.  In my case it did not make for what might be called progressive educational development.  It is sad that the years we spent in school were substantially wasted&mdash;not totally wasted because the language effort helped us in many ways.  Some of us managed to conserve a little of what we learned.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill it appears to me that the Minister is sincere, wishing genuinely to bring about progress and to introduce enlightened reform in the areas under his jurisdiction.  This Bill constitutes an effort to facilitate the running of Gaeltacht areas, no doubt ultimately with a view to ensuring that the language survives and prospers.  If we are successfully to attend to the problems of the development of our language&mdash;particularly in the context of the EEC and the growing internationalisation of our culture&mdash;then we must endeavour to get to the roots of the reason why languages change and fade.  To my knowledge we have never done that in a realistic way. If we ask ourselves why we have at present what somebody described as being basically the ruins of a language&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hate interrupting the Deputy on this important subject.  We are really only dealing with the Gaeltachtaí in this Bill and not the revival of the language.  We dealt with the full revival of the language and all that matter in the Bord na Gaeilge Bill.  This Bill deals only with the development of the Gaeltachtaí, the establishment of a new údarás and so on.  I do not like interrupting the Deputy but, if I do not, I will have a dozen people contributing on the same lines.</P>

      <P>I will bear that in mind. If we are successfully to run Gaeltacht areas and, therefore, revive and renourish a language which is, to say the least, ailing somewhat then it is important that we understand why some languages succeed and others do not. Otherwise all we are doing is providing an apparent solution without having analysed the disease which caused the first ailment.  Seán de Fréine, in his well-known work <i>The Great Silence</i>, says that the most probable explanation of language changes is, in a nutshell, that when people change their language they do so not because it is insufficient for their needs but because their society is insufficient.  Here we have a clear indication of what is the problem with regard to Gaeltacht areas for a start.  I hope that the momentum provided by the previous Minister, which was one of his constant themes, will be taken up by the present Minister and Government in the context of this Bill and otherwise, that is, to provide a healthy, economic infrastructure in which people will want to live and remain.  Unfortunately at present the picture is not that healthy.  There is a substantial flight from the land, from those areas and the language suffers as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ostensibly the Bill is about a Gaeltacht authority but, in reality, it is about much deeper issues fundamental to which are the well-being and revival of the language.  It would be fair to say that if governments&mdash;and if I may say so, particularly Fianna Fáil Governments traditionally&mdash;laid great emphasis on the twin aims of revival of the Irish language and the reunification of our country, they have very largely failed, and the reasons have not been fully analysed.  One of the reasons may be that we have accepted the concept of the Gaeltacht as being the catalyst which would revive our language.  The time has come to question that attitude. Language is much more than a means of <Col N="944" /> communication.  For example, I do not think one can departmentalise a language; one cannot say that Irish resides in a certain reservation; we will bring it to a peak in those areas, polish it up, blow the dust off it every now and again and keep it alive and well.</P>
    <P>Language is fundamentally much more than a means of communication.  It is an intrinsic part of social intercourse, a mode of expressing cultural values and norms in the day-to-day lives of people. For example, I ask myself: Why is it that the Gaeltacht invariably is associated, on the one hand, with the Irish language and efforts for its revival but, on the other, also in the public mind with relative deprivation, poverty, hardship, joblessness, wives who are deserted half the year because their husbands are working in Manchester or anywhere else where they do not use the language? Why should we accept that the language is part of an old culture which we are psychologically allowing to die?  Why is there very little emphasis placed on the many Irish-speaking families living in urban areas?  I understand that there are of the order of up to 10,000 households in Dublin city alone where Irish can be and is spoken.  There is never one word about these people.  They are not considered to be part of any Gaeltacht. They are not the beneficiaries of any deontasaí or of an attitude which encourages financial inducements for Irish language achievements.</P>
    <P>But I am not suggesting that this is the best way of doing it either.  Perhaps the traditional, geographic and, indeed, socio-economic parameters we have always applied to the Gaeltacht should be reconsidered.  It is anomalous that people who live in the Gaeltacht&mdash;who often through no choice of their own but by virtue of their place of birth and by tradition speak Irish&mdash;somehow are seen to be people in whom there should be more Government interest, if you like, more Government patriarchy, than in people in towns and cities who go about their jobs, rear their families, who also love their language, who can speak it and want to speak it but who are rarely given a chance, encouragement or inducement to do so.  Indeed, the pressures <Col N="945" /> on these people are far greater than those on people in Gaeltacht areas where the daily concourse is often transmitted to the Irish language.  But the Irish-speaking families in Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Limerick&mdash;what encouragement or inducement do they get? I venture to suggest that if a study were undertaken of the number of these Irish-speaking families, they would outnumber families in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It deals with the Gaeltachtaí and their development and everything concerned with them but it does not deal with the revival of the language in Dublin and other cities, unless the Deputy is trying to suggest that we should make Dublin a Gaeltacht area.  I am sure he is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that we should consider what constitutes a Gaeltacht.  I see no reason why a body of people of 7,000 families could not reasonably be considered to be a Gaeltacht.  I admit that we cannot draw a geographical border or perimeter for such an area but if we are to be concerned genuinely with fostering the Irish language I do not see why the people in these areas should not have the same social, political and constitutional rights as anybody else if it is their desire to have the language fostered and encouraged by the State.  Perhaps we could have Gaeltacht membership for such areas in which we have people, families, who could enrol and insist on their affection for the language as being the hallmark of the way in which they will raise their children and that that would be recognised accordingly in the State's attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead, what have we got?  Essentially, we have the Irish language either being spoken by people in the Gaeltacht who had little choice because that was the language of their people, their peers or as an extra language for people who <Col N="946" /> in many cases are of a particular social class.  For some time, unfortunately, it has been seen to be the language of elitist groups in some respects.  Anybody who travels through Dublin or other urban centres can see English roadsigns crossed out and the Irish version being left. My point is that we should reconsider our basic attitudes to the Irish language and consider ways and means of having Gaeltacht districts in urban areas.  They are the areas where the vast majority of our people are and will be in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for despair about the state of the language if we go about it in the proper way.  The languages of Europe are prospering and they are doing so without the type of Gaeltacht approach we have here.  Surely one of the secrets about the proper transmission or the teaching of a language is the manner in which it is imparted to young people in the schools and to the not-so-young outside the school.  Irish was always taught and is being taught still largely as a dead language, a language which is not intrinsic, which is not relevant to the day to day lives of the people but which is an extra skill grafted on, something that it is nice to have but which is not seen to be fundamentally useful or relevant.  That is something we must bear in mind.</P>
    <P>Because this Bill does not deal in the widest sense with language revival I do not intend to go into that aspect in great detail except to say that it is fundamental to reconsider the way in which we have transmitted the language traditionally.  We should ask ourselves in certain areas is it inherently defective in some way?  Could that be one of the reasons why it is ailing?  I do not think the language is ailing.  People ask how the language can match the new technology of the age, how can new terms be invented, and so on?  Of course the truth is that this is a problem facing all languages.  Words such as &ldquo;television&rdquo;, &ldquo;transistor&rdquo;, &ldquo;computer&rdquo; and so on have to be invented in all languages, not alone Irish.  It is clear that the language here is not necessarily inherently defective.  I will quote further from Seán de Fréine:</P>
    <P>The theory that languages die because they are defective does not <Col N="947" /> take account of the loss of German in Spain or of French in Germany (to which reference has already been made), whereas other less developed languages like Basque and Wendish have survived in Spain and Germany respectively.  It does not explain why the Albanian-speaking colonies in the south of Italy have, by and large, been more successful in retaining their languages than their Greek-speaking neighbours.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the language here is in no way defective but the way in which it has been handled and transmitted for decades has put it in a weak position.  It is not seen as being central to our lifestyle, to the way we live.  Instead, it has been taught in our schools in a way which does not help the prospect of it remaining alive and well.</P>
    <P>I say that this language which has helped us over the centuries is alive and well, though ailing.  For that a great debt of gratitude is owed to the Irish language organisations and associations, the many groups who often with very little State encouragement, particularly in relation to the publishing of books and texts, have done such a marvellous job to keep the language as a central part of the stage of Irish life.  A lot of success of the revival movement is attributable to these organisations.</P>
    <P>The language always has been used traditionally as a political weapon and a cultural weapon by the Irish people.  It is still useful for some of our ambassadors&mdash;I do not mean our diplomatic corps&mdash;when they go abroad.  The Údarás obviously will be a small step in the right direction, but one gets the impression from the debate on the Bill and on the authority proposed by the Minister that it may be a little more than a sop to mollify certain ginger groups in the Gaeltacht.  I should have preferred a much more comprehensive Bill, incorporating a much more radical approach to the need for major social and economic improvements in Gaeltacht areas as the cornerstone of any attempt to revive the language.</P>
    <P>For instance, I do not see any reason <Col N="948" /> why the Bill could not have been used as an instrument to extend the scope and the well-being of the language outside the narrowly-defined geographic areas at present described as Gaeltachtaí.  There are many paradoxes attached to these.  It is difficult for a person living in a city to understand why living a few miles on one side of a land should be the reason as to why a person would or would not get a grant for his home.  All these things should have been looked at but they are not in the Bill.  I am worried because we do not often get opportunities to discuss issues of this kind and it is my belief that in the lifetime of this Dáil the Minister will not get another opportunity like he now has to incorporate more radical and comprehensive provisions in a Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Bill should have gone much further that it has gone.  The media, the Irish language organisations, the various publications in Irish have all helped and they are increasingly aware of the need to compete.  RTE in two programmes, &ldquo;Buntús Cainte&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trom agus Éadtrom&rdquo; have taken major steps forward.  The significance of the programme so ably handed and presented by Liam Ó Murchú is that for the first time ever people such as myself have been presented, people who are not experts in the language.  They have been encouraged to speak the few words of Irish they have and to realise that if the Irish word does not come immediately to mind an English one will suffice.</P>
    <P>I believe that attitude will be with us for a long time to come.  I reject, as fundamentally opposed to the welfare of the Irish language, the old, extremist, purist approach that if you are not an expert you should not speak the language.  I appreciate that the new, more casual approach may be somewhat offensive to purists but I ask them to accept that more people speaking the language, even if not speaking it very well, is much better than a very small number speaking the language perfectly but only among themselves and the language going nowhere in the ultimate when these people die out.</P>
    <P>I therefore think this type of programme is marvellous and has done great <Col N="949" /> good.  Much more could be done now that we have two national networks.  The possibility of transmitting popular plays and films perhaps with Irish dialogue superimposed, perhaps even running English subtitles to balance it, could be considered.  There are many possibilities and there are people better than I am at coming to terms with them.  We need to employ modern technology and methods of teaching and so on to ensure that the language lives and we must reject the old conservationist approach which would seek to keep the language to small reservations not only of our country geographically but of our minds psychologically.</P>
    <P>Language if it is to live and be meaningful should be part of our daily living.  It is not so at present and more is the pity.  The need to broaden our approach to language teaching has been very widely accepted and in a book called &ldquo;The Gaelic League Idea&rdquo; Tomás Ó Fiach said now that the smoke of battle raised by the great linguistic controversies of the past has died down one may ask the question if they perhaps focused too much attention on the educational institutions as the places where the cause of the language would be won or lost.  I think what he implied by that and says further on is that at present we concern ourselves with education in the schools and very little elsewhere.  The home is obviously the area in which we should strive to inculcate love of the language. Not a great deal is being done in that regard because the national psyche dictates that as long as we have a Gaeltacht the language is alive over there in the west&mdash;barring the Meath Gaeltacht of course.  It is something we need not worry about as it is being looked after.</P>
    <P>More attention must be directed to broadening the concept of the Gaeltacht, to getting across to people that the language and its survival are important and not just a question of people along the west coast in some ill-defined geographic area but something for which all of us have responsibility.  I hope the new Gaeltacht authority will be able to do some thinking about this and perhaps come up with some suggestions and recommendations about possibilities for <Col N="950" /> language improvement and development outside the narrow geographic confines which at present restrict them.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the statistics available show that despite the regular platitudinous tributes from.  I suppose, all sides of the political and social spectrum there is no cause for complacency. A study carried out by the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies reckoned in 1951 that no more than 35,000 people used Irish as their ordinary medium of speech and no more than 3,000 were ignorant of English&mdash;in other words English was gradually supplanting and replacing Irish as the main language for many people.  I firmly believe that both languages can co-exist. It is vital that everybody should have a thorough and expert knowledge of English but also it would be a great loss and a national tragedy if the Irish language were allowed to die.  It may sound almost blasphemous but I wonder to what extent the traditionally accepted concept of a Gaeltacht may form some of the reason why the vast majority of the population outside the Gaeltacht feel they no longer have any responsibility to encourage the language.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the great work carried out by bodies like Gael Linn and all the other language organisations.  I hope the Minister will have every success in persuading his colleagues to give extra attention, extra finance and extra help in every possible way to these organisations. I know the Minister would want that.  Recently Donal Ó Mórain of Gael Linn asked for a new deal for the Irish language.  I support him in that but the new deal should embody more than merely sums of money.  It should embody new structures and rethinking particularly about people living outside the Gaeltacht who have an equal right to a share in the revival of the language because up to now these people have been very largely ignored.</P>
    <P>For example, a special attempt should be made to get Irish language teaching reviewed and reformed, to get much more of the contents of the media transmitted in or through Irish.  This can now be done without offence to the English speaking population because we <Col N="951" /> have two national networks.  I trust that potential will not be lost on the Minister. I do not suggest, and I think it would do great damage to the language, that Irish should now be rammed down the throats of people who are cool about it and do not want to know any more about it. They have that right.  There is, always was and, I expect, always will be a basic feeling of benevolence towards the language on the part of Irish people everywhere.  A survey asking people about their attitude towards the revival of the language and its welfare showed that the vast majority of people would like to see the Irish language again a spoken language.  They did not mean that it should ever replace the English language as being perhaps the normal spoken language, the normal method of discourse but certainly the benevolence and the will are there.  Therefore, any Government measure designed to induce progress in these areas will obviously be welcomed very widely.  We should get away from the idea of the language being elitist or conservationist in relation to Gaeltacht areas.  If we do that we shall come a long way.</P>
    <P>It is very regrettable that in the case of many of us who spent years in school being taught the Irish language as we were taught Latin, being able to tell the gender of nouns, decline individual words and so on, all of this went in one ear and out of both.  It was not an enlightened teaching method.  One learns about these things too late, I suppose.  I do not know if more enlightened methods could have been used then but it is certainly tragic that so many years' works produced so little in the end when there is such great benevolence towards the language and so many people wish to speak it.</P>
    <P>From the time the Minister for the Gaeltacht took office he has exuded sincerity and genuineness in his efforts to do well for the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  One is considerably heartened because I have no doubt he would be first to admit that this tradition was handed on to him by the previous Minister whose hard work for the Gaeltacht and the language cannot be <Col N="952" /> questioned.  The emphasis the former Minister placed on having a healthy economic base is fundamental.  One cannot expect young people today, lured as they are by the bright lights and busy streets, to confine themselves to a way of life and deprivation in terms of social amenities and outlets which nobody else would tolerate and at the same time pin on them our hopes for the future of the language.  It will not work and is not working.  It is too much to expect young people to remain in these areas.  There is only one way to do it and that is to have a national redevelopment plan which will ensure that these Gaeltacht areas are healthy areas from the point of view of job creation, social and recreational environment, areas where people would want to remain and where people from urban areas becoming increasingly congested, unattractive and blighted will want to go.  It is a long time since I met a young man or woman in this city who voiced an ambition to go to a Gaeltacht area.  Those who normally want to go there are at the upper end of the social and economic scale who can afford a second home in the Gaeltacht where they can spend long weekends, or who have managed to make a total break with the problems of urban living and go to the Gaeltacht in order to farm and to spend the rest of their lives there.  Generally speaking such people are the exception.</P>
    <P>It is most unfortunate that we do not have a much more balanced regional approach to industry, to the spread of towns and to the creation and development of an environment in these areas where young people would want to go.  If the new authority pay attention to the need for this and do everything possible to ensure that every incentive is given, not merely in terms of job creation&mdash;which is important&mdash;but also in insisting on certain minimum standards of amenities and recreational and social outlets for people in these areas, their efforts may be crowned with success. However, fundamentally I am uneasy about any measure which seeks to pin all our hopes for the future of the language on geographic regions. A language cannot be geographically delineated; it does not lend itself to that <Col N="953" /> type of approach.  We should reconsider our traditional thinking in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are families living in suburban Dublin, Waterford and Cork who want to see the language doing well, but who are surrounded by English-speaking families and who hear no interest expressed by anybody in encouraging the use of that language.  They feel that every effort and thought about language revival is focused on the Gaeltacht in some area that is far removed from their day-to-day life.  We must do some rethinking here; it is not satisfactory, particularly when there are so many families who speak the language and speak it well.  I would appreciate if the Minister would do some thinking on this before he replies.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  I am unhappy that the Bill did not go further but that is the perennial unhappiness of Opposition parties.  Maybe the Minister has good reasons why the Bill could not go further.  I wish the Bill every success and I have no doubt that the Minister is pushing an open door whenever he wishes to introduce in this House measures which seek to foster the love and well-being of our native tongue.  I see this Bill as a symbol of that fight.  I hope it is successful from that point of view.</P>

I would like to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to daoine na Gaeltachta on behalf of the many children who have been hosted by them over recent years, particularly in the summer programmes.  In that connection I would like to see more comprehensive development of the recreational and other facilities within the Gaeltacht for students visiting these areas with the object of learning the language, particularly during the summer period.  An tÚdarás should consider this.  It is something which is happening not only here but in other countries also.  We will see some very interesting developments in this respect in relation to language development and learning generally, particularly in the city of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I regret that I am not in a position to furnish the information requested by the Deputy.  These prices are commercially confidential matters for the buyers and sellers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that when in Opposition the Minister protested that this kind of information should not be kept confidential because gas is essentially public property and the facts about it should be disclosed?  Secondly, is this not another device whereby An Bord Gáis will be allowed to mark up a large profit on sales to the ESB for which the consumer will have to pay?  This is another revenue raising device.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>These are two simple questions.  Is it not a fact that in Opposition the Minister took up that position? Secondly, this is another revenue on the lines of the proposed health scheme of the Minister for Health.  Is that not true?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I try at all times to be mannerly in this House.  Two questions were asked.  In answer to one I said I was not aware of what the Minister said in Opposition.  Secondly, I tried to be as helpful as possible to the Deputy by informing him of the position of An Bord Gáis in the national interest.  The third point raised by the Deputy related to the Minister for Health and, if the Deputy wants to make a comment to the Minister for Health, I suggest he should ask him a question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to Chapters 10, 11 and 12 of the Energy-Ireland discussion document on some Current Energy Problems and Options, published in July 1978, a copy of which was furnished to him.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Government have not yet taken a decision to confirm, or otherwise, the decision taken in 1973 by the Government of which the Deputy was then a member, approving in principle of a nuclear project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the estimated figures for energy needs in the discussion document to which he referred have been questioned by some economists who have come to the conclusion that there are grave over-estimations in that document?  Would the Minister accept that the need for an inquiry into the use of nuclear power is now more obvious? If there are over-estimates of our energy requirements, obviously that casts doubt on the necessity, as the Minister sees it, for having nuclear power installed to meet our energy requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that this is a discussion document and, as such, will give rise to various calculations of energy or other needs.  The matter <Col N="959" /> of an inquiry is not related to the question before me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the estimates of our energy needs are incorrect, that puts a big question mark over the necessity for nuclear power suggested by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he is aware of the growing public concern at the possible consequences of the establishment of a nuclear power station in this country; and if the Government will now agree to the holding of a public inquiry on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if the Government will consider holding a national referendum on the issue of the building of a nuclear power station in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already made clear, I welcome public interest in this matter and I am concerned that the maximum information about it be made available in a balanced way to the public generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago I arranged with the ESB to resume their public information programme, which they had in hands in the past.  I also arranged with the Nuclear Energy Board, who have a statutory duty to promote knowledge in nuclear science and technology and to act as an agent for dissemination of information on nuclear matters, to expedite the issue of suitable information <Col N="960" /> material on nuclear matters generally. Furthermore, I hope that the discussion document which I published last July with its emphasis on current problems, with special reference to electricity generation, will give a much clearer picture of the general energy situation in this country and help to resolve any doubts that may exist as to the realistic options open to us to meet energy demand in the coming decade.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the very great deal of information which has been publicly available for many years past about conventional nuclear electricity stations, I do not consider that a public inquiry, and still less a national referendum, would serve any useful purpose.  While I have no objections in principle to the holding of such an inquiry, I feel obliged to say that no valid reasons or cogent arguments in favour of the holding of a public inquiry on the nuclear project have yet been put to me.  If they are, I will certainly consider them fully.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, always glad to study any representations which interested groups may wish to submit to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in virtually no country in the world has a proposal to go ahead with a nuclear energy scheme not been met with very serious concern by the general population and that is a factor which has created a demand for a public inquiry? Would the Minister agree that this documentation and the information to which he has referred emanated from vested interests so that it is one-sided?  Is it not advisable that either a referendum or a public inquiry be held so that the views of both sides could be heard and, then, if the case of the Minister is as good as is claimed, his side should win?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important in discussing this whole question to draw a distinction between conventional nuclear energy stations and the fast breeders and reactors such as Windscale in respect of which a public inquiry was held.  The conventional type of nuclear reactor that is suggested for the Carnsore site is in use in more than 200 sites around the world in countries of various ideological administrations.  The need for a public <Col N="961" /> inquiry has not been proved to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Nuclear Energy Board are fulfilling their role as a public information centre?  They have been remarkably silent.  Also, in view of the latest information regarding health hazards to workers in nuclear stations in America where it has been found that the established safe levels have now proved very dangerous to workers, would it not be advisable to have a public inquiry into the whole matter?  It has been found in America that 13,000 workers at nuclear energy stations have been exposed to unnecessary radiation hazards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my original reply where I said that:</P>
      <P>I also arranged with the Nuclear Energy Board, who have a statutory duty to promote knowledge in nuclear science and technology and to act as an agent for dissemination of information on nuclear matters, to expedite the issue of suitable information material on nuclear matters generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that to associate Windscale energy with the Carnsore Point project is to give the impression that they are the same whereas one involves reprocessing while the other is a generating station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree also that the attitude of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in appearing to have something <Col N="962" /> to cover up while there is nothing to cover up is tending to harden attitudes and to make much more difficult the possibility of an alternative source of energy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Browne, I attempted to draw a clear distinction between Windscale and the Carnsore Point situation.  I would not accept that the attitude of the Minister has hardened in any way the various attitudes to Carnsore Point and to nuclear energy generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Concerning the Minister's reference to the ESB public information programme, would this include the flying out by them of an executive to Hamburg for the purpose of entertaining a number of Wexford county councillors, to take them to a specific nuclear plant adjacent to Hamburg and to attempt to influence them towards a favourable viewpoint prior to a planning decision being reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very long question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It requires elaboration. Can the Minister say who will be responsible for the cost of this public information programme including the exercise to which I have referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the trip to which the Deputy has referred but if he cares to table a separate question in this regard, I shall obtain the information for him.  However, I have no doubt that the councillors in the Wexford area could not be bought off by a trip to Hamburg.  I suspect they are much too reasonable and sensible for that.  So far as the cost of the ESB public information programme is concerned, it will be borne by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, I did not suggest that the councillors were taken to Hamburg.  They were already in Hamburg at an international gathering when the ESB decided to fly out one of their executives.  I should like to hear whether the cost of the information programme will be passed to the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the objective of all this is to ensure sufficient generating capacity for electricity in 15 years time and that at the moment the most likely alternative source to oil is nuclear?  Would the Minister agree also that if this is the case the sooner the better there is reached a decision that is both acceptable and seen to be acceptable to the majority of the people?  In these circumstances would it not be advisable to have a public inquiry?</P>

      <P>The reply to the last part of the supplementary is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It is important that we move away from our reliance on oil as our main source of energy.  At the time the decision was reached by the previous Government in November 1973 our level of imports of oil was 65 per cent and since then it has increased to 67 per cent.</P>

      <P>I have not had any specific consultations with the Minister for Tourism and Transport on the availability of power for industry during the approaching winter nor do I see the need for such consultations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What sort of zones?  In certain zones in Britain and in part of the Six Counties, petrol is 17p a gallon less than the fixed price here.  Where the zone is that charges more than or as much as we do is a mystery to me.  That does not really come into my consideration in this question.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that the lowest justifiable price should be applied to all petrol of the same octane rating.  A new overall flat order should be applied to petrol of the same octane rating, regardless of from which company it emanates.  Where there is a self-service, which is a developing feature of the petrol distribution, an order should be made for a still lower price, rather than leaving the situation as it is now, with people being put out of work, large amounts of money being spent on a system where the customer does the work while the distribution and oil companies reap the benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the second part of the question first.  In the conventional service station the man or boy operating the pumps normally collects the money as well.  In the self-service situation there must be someone in an office collecting the money for the petrol sold.  I believe there is very little difference in the overall running costs in these two systems.  Regarding the other part of the Deputy's question, there are commercial and distribution practices involved which would militate against the type of order suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister should not take into account the inefficiency of the distribution system operated by some companies.  Where full self-service <Col N="972" /> has replaced the old manual system, has the Minister taken into account the reduction in employment?  There is no justification for this.  Encouragement should not be given to people to reduce employment while the public still have to pay the same price for petrol.</P>

      <P>Whilst I sympathise <Col N="980" /> with the intention underlying the Deputy's question, I do not consider that the introduction of compulsory measures on the lines proposed by him would, for a number of reasons, be effective in obviating the danger to which he refers.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there have been cases where children have been locked inside dumped refrigerators?  In some cases they have, with great difficulty, been able to get out. Would the Minister not agree there is need for a notice on refrigerators drawing attention to the necessity of removing the doors before disposing of them? That would help to avoid unfortunate accidents.</P>

      <P>I am aware that what the Deputy says is true.  I am also aware that up-to-date models have magnetic doors and can be opened from the inside.  Putting on a label would not be the answer because over the lifetime of a refrigerator, perhaps ten or 20 years, the label could become detached through use or through cleaning.  There are problems with regard to refrigerators discarded in proximity to housing estates. I suggest that those dumping refrigerators should remove the lock or hasp and even the door itself.</P>

      <P>Present indications are that, given our existing refining capacity, it will at best be possible by 1985 to supply just over 20 per cent of the country's total demand for refined oil products.  Against this background, I consider it highly desirable to give serious consideration to the question of possible additional refining capacity.  Accordingly, as a first step, I have asked the IDA to carry out a pre-feasibility study for a new oil refinery project.  This study will examine the type of refinery that would be best suited to meet future product demand in this country and it will also analyse the capital and operating costs associated with such a refinery.</P>

      <P>In their January 1975 Report, the National Prices Commission recommended that the practice of advertising in the national newspapers, on the date of publication <Col N="988" /> of each NPC monthly report, the list of authorised price increases referred to in that report, should be discontinued.  The reasons for this recommendation are set out in detail in the report mentioned. Copies of the report are available in the Oireachtas Library and were circulated to each Deputy at the time of publication.</P>
      <P>My predecessor accepted the commission's recommendation.  The circumstances under which the commission made their recommendation have not changed and I do not consider, therefore, that the publication, by way of advertisements of price increases authorised, would be of any more benefit to the consumer at the present time.</P>

      <P>Since price increases by firms which have been wholly or partially exempted from price control are not included in the list of authorised price increases, the list is no longer comprehensive, and since the majority of the price increases sanctioned will have taken place prior to the publication of the report, it only confuses consumers.</P>

When the Minister was in Opposition he was very vocal in advocating the need for the <Col N="989" /> public to know whether it confused them or not, about changes in the price structures. Would it not be wise to review the situation so that the public could be brought up-to-date in relation to price increases?

In 1975 the National Prices Commission estimated that the cost of inserting the advertisement in the national newspapers, not including the provincials, would be £30,000 for that year.  I am sure the House will agree that advertising rates in newspapers have increased by 67.5 per cent since 1975.  The present cost of such advertisements, particularly if this was extended to provincial newspapers, as it should be, would be excessive in relation to the benefit to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the conclusion of the debate on Second Stage I indicated that I would be tabling an amendment in relation to the actual courses rather than the institutions that will be <i>de facto</i> recognisable for educational grants.  I refrained from doing so.  I am satisfied that the Minister has a right to retain a final say in the recognition of a course but I was disappointed, as was Deputy Horgan, that my amendments were ruled out of order.  In my amendments I was trying to widen the scope of the <Col N="1010" /> Acts dealing with higher education grants to allow for a one-year course recognition or approval where exceptional academic merit has been proved by an applicant.  That would have been a worthy step forward in the scheme.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 2 I was seeking to extend the scheme to extra-mural courses leading to an approved qualification under the higher education scheme.  I thought such a move would have been laudable but it would include many people who cannot afford to go to a university or a recognised college.  In amendment No. 3 I sought to extend the scheme to include courses which lead to professional and trade qualifications. That should be looked at seriously by the Minister.  I was thinking of trade qualifications to include apprentices under the AnCO schemes.  In many cases, because of the low income of parents, it is difficult to finance an apprenticeship period and parents feel that there should be some recognition in the higher education grant scheme to take into account their low income.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look at my amendments between now and Report Stage and, perhaps, he would be gracious enough to table an amendment for Report Stage along the lines suggested. I am sure he will get the support of the House for such amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when he was introducing this Bill, said at the beginning of his speech that the purpose of the Bill was to make legislative provision for an extension of the range of courses in respect of which higher education grants may be held.  With all respect, it appears to me that this Bill also does something else.  It makes a fundamental change in the relationship of the universities, and of university degree courses in particular, to the operation of the grants scheme.  I dislike having to repeat what I said on Second Stage on this, but as the Minister did not reply to the points I was making at that time and as an amendment which I drafted in an attempt to restore the original situation has been ruled out of order I must raise it now.  In the original Act, which we are now amending, an approved institution <Col N="1011" /> meant a university or university college in respect of its courses which are of degree standard or...any other institution of higher education.  It seems to me on the face of it that the effect of section I as we have it here compared with section I as it existed in 1978 is that, whereas in 1968 all university degree level courses were automatically considered eligible for grants under the scheme, in 1978 university degree level courses are only eligible for grants in so far as they have been approved by the Minister.  The phrase in the section is:</P>
      <P>of which the Minister approves for the time being for the purposes of section 2 of this Act.</P>
      <P>This seems to me to be a fundamental change in the status of the university degree course in particular.  While I accept that there might be arguments for bringing these under closer control by the Minister at certain points in time, it would seem to me that this is an inappropriate mechanism for doing it and that the whole question of the change should now be explained and justified to us by the Minister.  As the Bill stands, it means that the Minister, from my interpretation of it, is going to have to positively approve of all the existing degree courses in the universities, unless there are some of which he chooses not to approve, that will have to advert to and approve every subsequent degree course that is subsequently offered for the first time by a university or university college.  Even if we had an assurance from the Minister that he proposed so to recognise all courses past, present and future, this does not necessarily meet the point I am making.  If he is going to give such an undertaking with regard to approval of courses, there seems to be no point at all in bringing universities and their degree level courses into this portmanteau amendment in relation to the definition of approved institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Collins about actual courses is adequately covered by the scholarship scheme as far as the regional technical colleges and <Col N="1012" /> other third level institutions are concerned. In particular anybody who has achieved a very high scholastic standard will have absolutely no trouble in getting such a scholarship.  I would repeat that the scholarships are of the same value as the grants, that is to say, they are of the same value financially.</P>
      <P>This amendment to the 1968 Act is a broadening amendment in every sense.  It is designed to spread the effectiveness of the grant scheme and consequently I think the Deputy would agree with me that it is desirable that all consideration of the area referred to by Deputy Collins must be in the context of the existence of the other scheme, which is quite broad in its scope and takes in a very large number of students.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Horgan's point it must be remembered that the universities are recognised in the 1968 Act as approved institutions, not automatically and inclusively, but in respect of the courses which are of degree standard, and degree standard meant a course of not less than three years.  We are trying to get off the three years wagon, so to speak, in this amendment to the 1968 Act.  The words &ldquo;degree standard&rdquo; tend to obfuscate the relevance of the three years in the context of the amendment. As well as degree courses the Act refers to courses which in the opinion of the Minister are equivalent to university degree courses.  Again the words &ldquo;university degree&rdquo; were meant in the context of three years.  The purpose of the Bill before the House now is to broaden the scope of the 1968 Act.  That is precisely what it is doing by including certificate and diploma courses in non-university institutions and indeed courses of not less than two years which may be instituted by the universities.  I am sure Deputy Horgan can see that.  As of now, before this becomes law, the two year university course would not have attracted a grant.  A person qualified otherwise would not have been in a position to enjoy a grant if following a two years course which was not a degree course.  This is a significant change and it may be one to which the Deputy did not advert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no major change in principle <Col N="1013" /> as the Deputy claimed.  The whole purpose of the amendment is to make the grants available to more people, to give them a greater choice both in institutions and in courses within the institutions, whether these institutions are university institutions or other third level non-university institutions.</P>

      <P>Before calling the Deputies I would like to bring to the notice of Deputy Collins something he mentioned when he was speaking.  He said that he would be raising some matters on section 2.  Section 2 is simply the Short Title of the Bill and the Deputy may not raise anything on that section when there is no amendment to the Title. The Deputy had amendments down which would put new sections into the Bill before section 2, so if he wishes to refer to them before we come to section 2 that is all right but he may not say anything on section 2.  It is not in order to debate amendments that have been ruled out of order but there is nothing against referring to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything between the Minister and myself in relation to the purpose of this Bill in so far as it is widening, retrospectively in most cases, the category of courses for which grants may be held. But I must ask the Minister whether or not it was the case that in the ten years since 1968 there was no necessity for him or his Department to approve any university degree level course.  According to this Bill there is a necessity for him to approve the university degree level course by a purely administrative function.  Is this necessity now being created by this amending Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That point was made by Deputy Horgan on Second Stage.  I wonder if I got the point across to him that in the 1968 Act it is stated that an approved institution means &ldquo;a university or university college in respect of its courses which are of degree standard&rdquo;. The course to be of degree standard was at minimum in our university context a three-year course and four years for a basic degree in one of our universities. This amendment now extends the scope <Col N="1014" /> within the university itself.  In other words, if in the opinion of the Minister there is a two-year course initiated by the university which should attract the grant then this amendment makes it possible for it to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe I misunderstood the Minister and I do not believe that we are in any disagreement about the intent of the Bill.  I am trying to find out the effect of the Bill in relation to university degree courses.  I am well aware that the effect of the Bill in relation to university non-degree courses is new, positive and to be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may or may not be new.  I suspect, in relation to some courses, that it may be new.  In relation to the amendment which I originally put down I effectively recreated paragraph (a) of the original definition section. Then in paragraph (b) I put in:</P>
      <P>a university, university college, recognised college of a university, or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses other than those referred to in paragraph (a) of this section,</P>
      <P>that was the degree level courses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>of not less than two years duration, being a course of which the Minister approves...</P>
      <P>The point of that amendment, which was effectively only a rephrasing of the definition section we have here in this Bill was to exclude degree level courses from the apparent necessity of being formally and positively approved by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not arguing about the two-year courses.  In so far as they are being brought in under the scope of the Act it is perfectly welcome and in so far as it gives people a greater choice and scope within the universities it is perfectly welcome.  I would also argue that it is important for university two-year courses to be still subject to the approval by the Minister&mdash;this was again one of the parts of my original amendment &mdash;because it is at the two-year course <Col N="1015" /> level that the maximum opportunity occurs for transfer between institutions and between university institutions and other third level institutions.  I believe the Minister has a very positive rôle to play in that co-ordination process and that that process could be encouraged by him retaining the right to approve of courses at the two-year level.  If University College Dublin decide in the morning that they will put on a new three-year degree course in micro-biology or industrial relations and if a student applies for a grant to study this course could he be told that he is not eligible for a grant because the Minister has not approved this course?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to an inference which the Minister has given to the Bill in so far as he has stated that it widens the scope of the higher education grants scheme.  It is evident in section 1 (2) that the concept of extending higher education grants to courses outside the university was the brainchild of the Minister for Education in the previous Government, Deputy Dick Burke.  It is unfair of the Minister or anybody else to infer that this is a Bill to effect something new in the higher education grants scheme.  That is not so.  The widening of the higher education grants scheme to include courses outside the universities and so forth was brought about by a Fine Gael Minister.  I want this put on the record of the House because I was annoyed when I saw headlines in the papers last Friday, one in <i>The Irish Times</i> and another in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which inferred that this Bill was a new step forward.</P>

      <P>I would like to make it quite clear that this Bill is merely confirming <Col N="1016" /> what has been the practice since 1974 under a Bill introduced by the National Coalition Government which extended the higher education grants scheme to technological colleges and so forth.  The Minister today also, in the way he has spoken, infers that this Bill is a new one.  It is not.  It is a Bill confirming what has been done and a regularising Bill in so far as the payments made since 1974, which were possibly made illegally, are now being made legal by the retrospection in subsection (2).  I do not want to be unfair to a former Minister of the House, no matter what party he belongs to so it is important to get that point clear.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Horgan's point about the degree courses having to be approved by the Minister, which seems unnecessary. I feel that a degree course, simply because it is a degree course, should be eligible without having the approval of the Minister.  I do not believe it is a very big difference or one that we will divide on.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the problem since 1974 in relation to applicants for higher education grants which was the subject of my amendment No. 4, to which I wish to refer without going into it.  My amendment deals with an applicant for a higher education grant in 1976 who was ruled out on income grounds as being ineligible for a grant but if the applicant's father retired in 1978 that applicant would be eligible on income grounds for a higher education grant under the scheme in 1978.  At the moment the scheme demands that his application must be related to his first application and the income grounds then pertaining.  That is a very unfair element in the scheme.  I believe the Minister is sympathetic to what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 4 has been ruled out of order on the grounds that it might involve a charge on the Exchequer.  I ask the Minister to have a look at this point in the scheme which is very unfortunate. I ask him to move an amendment on Report Stage or at least to have a look at this point in the scheme and to amend it outside the House if that is possible to ensure that changes in people's incomes are looked at in a current situation not in <Col N="1017" /> a retrospective situation to the first application.</P>
    <P>The other matter which I raised in amendment No. 9 refers to the three honours plus honours in Irish requirement for entry into the scheme.  It is an unfortunate aspect of the scheme especially when one relates it to many applicants who come from low income families and who wish to pursue third-level courses.  Because they were unable to get four honours&mdash;even though they were within the income limits&mdash;they are deprived of an opportunity to go to university, to a regional college or to a college of technology.  It is a retrogressive aspect.  I suggested in my amendment, which was ruled out of order, that the scheme be amended to ensure that an applicant would be eligible for the scheme on gaining the entrance requirements for the course he wished to pursue in an approved institution.  A social injustice is being done to many applicants. I would ask the Minister to consider the matter and to amend the scheme, either on Report Stage or, if possible, on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins made a point about headlines and so on.  I accepted what he said in the House on Second Stage.  This matter was referred to also by Deputy Horgan.  He instanced the fact that the NCEA were an <i>ad hoc</i> council.  This was totally irrelevant to the point that I did not labour on Second Stage.  I am not dwelling on it now but it is <i>apropos</i> to what Deputy Collins has said, namely, that we were in a position where we purported to pay grants under the 1968 Act when we had no power to do so.  Deputy Collins indicated that he realised that this was out of order and that it should not act as a precedent in any way.  Deputy Horgan's reference to the NCEA as an <i>ad hoc</i> council was completely irrelevant.  The NCEA are not masquerading as anything other than a council set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis that will be established by statute in the very near future.  Deputy Horgan is really discussing his amendment even though it was ruled by the Chair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For instance, the Chartered Institute of Accountants have quite a strict academic requirement for a five-year period and students have to do advanced examinations.  Does the Minister consider that such students would me eligible for a higher education Grant?  Even though there is no physical institute in existence, they are an institute and they are providing the equivalent of third-level courses for participating <Col N="1020" /> students.  They achieve a professional qualification at least equivalent to a primary degree qualification. Many people from poor families who achieve a high academic qualification in the leaving certificate examination would be eligible for a higher education grant but at the moment they are precluded from participating in the scheme.

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for conceding that the situation in relation to degrees will be more or less as I have stated it although he added the point, which is true, that the same requirements will apply also to two-year courses.  One point, and I wonder if it has as much force as the Minister believes, is in relation to matters raised earlier by Deputy Collins regarding support for other types of student.  The Minister said that in so far as other types of student were concerned, the aim in general was that the scholarship schemes should apply.  Is the Minister aware of the extent of take-up and award of scholarships to people in various parts of the country?  Is he aware, for example, that in the entire administrative area of the country of Dublin last year there were only nine holders of scholarships to regional technical colleges or colleges of technology?  Does he seriously suggest that the awarding of nine such scholarships in the entire administrative area of the county of Dublin in any way meets the kind of situation that we have been describing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would find me extremely remiss if I did not know the exact extent, seeing that I answered a question which the Deputy put down to me recently.  I think he called for a written reply&mdash;I hope he did anyway&mdash;on <Col N="1021" /> this point.  He will also know that he picked the administrative area of the county of Dublin because it was by far the smallest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The much less populous administrative area of the county of Cavan would have five times plus that number of scholarships, if my memory serves me right, and so would other areas of less population.  On reading that list I do not understand why the administrative area of the county of Dublin is so small.  There is some reason for it other than that they did not apply for scholarships or that the scholarships were not available.  It is <i>ex parte</i> pleading to just mention one of the administrative areas with the smallest number of scholarships.  On Second Stage I said that my Department estimate that over 40 per cent of the students are aided one way or the other, either by way of grant, scholarship, or in some other way in the social sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>That relates to the apparent omission of the institution known as a recognised college.  The Minister is big on not doing things that have to be retrospectively legalised.  I wonder whether the omission of the type of institution known as a recognised college might not create difficulties for him or for another Minister for Education in the future.  &ldquo;University&rdquo; is self-explanatory. &ldquo;University college&rdquo;, while a bit ambiguous, is presumably a constituent college of university.  There is no reference in section 1 to a recognised college.  As we know in relation to student support, although not in relation to the award of degrees and other qualifications, there are two types of recognised college. There is the recognised college such as Maynooth and perhaps the NIHE in Limerick and Thomond College.  There are also training colleges which are recognised colleges of universities and whose students benefit from a different support system which is not as generous as was indicated in an article in a magazine published by the Minister's Department.  I would be interested to <Col N="1022" /> hear the Minister on the reasons why there was no inclusion here, as there was not in the 1968 Act, of the entity known as the recognised college and whether or not he thinks that this might create problems in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy rightly distinguished between recognised colleges.  I would read it in so far as grants are concerned and so far as custom is concerned in the unexpanded scheme that &ldquo;university&rdquo; embraced its recognised college.  I would distinguish with regard to the most recently created recognised colleges, or the most recently recognised colleges, namely, the colleges of education. They have their own grant system. The remark the Deputy made about it not being as generous as some people pretended is lost on me.  I gather that the existing scheme is working satisfactorily and that what somebody called &ldquo;a damn good bargain&rdquo; is being had by the students of those recognised colleges.</P>

The Minister in his reply referred to the unexpanded situation, by which I take it he was referring to the situation in which there are still, for example, three constituent colleges of the National University which are shortly to become independent universities.  &ldquo;Immediately&rdquo; was the word used in the manifesto to qualify higher education legislation.</P>

      <P>The Bill we are now passing is one to legalise retrospectively a certain situation in relation to the payment of grants to students following courses in higher education.  While it is a valid and necessary Bill, it is in many respects a disappointing one.  I had hoped that the Minister in this his first Bill might have taken a wider look at the structural problems of the scheme introduced originally by his administration. I should like the Minister to indicate quite simply in his reply whether or not he has completely closed his mind to the possibility of such further structural changes and whether he is sympathetic to the possibility of some changes as were outlined by us at various stages during the discussion.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the two Deputies for their help with this Bill, which is one to make legal something that has been going on for some years and which is not desirable for the national Parliament.  The Government are committed to education, as indeed <Col N="1027" /> have been previous Fianna Fáil Governments. One has to look at the Statute Book to see that, small and insignificant though this Bill may be, it is the first that has gone on the Statute Book since 1972, as far as I can remember&mdash;anyway no Act was passed during the term of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>The scheme of third level grants has, as all schemes, defects.  We will be looking at the scheme.  We are always looking at it and hoping we will be able to improve it.  I want to put on record once more the fact that I have paid on third-level grants an increase of 66? per cent over what had been paid by my predecessors.  I did this in a time of falling inflation.  I raised also the eligibility limits for people in the scheme at the lower end by 29.5 per cent and at the upper end by 21.4 per cent.  I have not held this office very long and that has been a considerable improvement in the scheme.  I think any reasonable person will admit that.</P>
      <P>The points Deputies raised with regard to the scheme, even though they did so in a referral manner, will be taken into account whenever we are having a look at the scheme.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Mar adúirt me i dtosach, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an tÚdarás agus roimh an Bille seo.  Dúirt mé freisin gurb é cuspóir na Bille ná Údarás na Gaeltachta a bhunú chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar phriomhtheanga na Gaeltachta agus forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun chinn chomh maith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> Before the debate was adjourned I was making a number of points in rela-tion to the Bill.  One of these related to the facilities in the Gaeltacht areas for children going there in vacational periods to improve their knowledge of the language.  I believe it would be advantageous to consider considerable improvement in the overall recreational and other facilities provided for these students so that in future far greater numbers would avail of the tremendous service offered by the Gaeltacht people to the country at large.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a very important Bill. It provides much wider authority for An tÚdarás than was provided under the Act which established Gaeltarra Éireann.  Gaeltarra Éireann was mainly concerned with the industrial and economic development of these regions. I was surprised that a number of Opposition Deputies made a great deal of play about the fact that in their view there is very little difference in this Bill. But even in setting out the purpose of the Bill it is clearly stated that An tÚdarás is to promote not only the economic life of the Gaeltacht areas but also the social, cultural, linguistic and physical development of the Gaeltacht.  That statement is broad enough to include a wide variety of new developments in the Gaeltacht.  I do not share Deputy O'Donnell's fears that community development and cooperatives will not receive the necessary stimulus under this Bill.  I believe the enabling legislation is there to permit An tÚdarás to develop within the Gaeltacht the most desirable arrangements for community amenities in general.  That is only right because if community development does not come from the community itself there is no point in trying to legislate for it.  The Minister has provided scope for An tÚdarás to develop the necessary arrangements in the Gaeltacht and it is then up to An tÚdarás to produce proposals and suggestions within the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In 1971 Comhairle na Gaeilge recommended that a working group be set up representative of the various interests involved to furnish a special report which was later entitled &ldquo;Gníomh don Gaeltacht&rdquo; and which in effect recommended <Col N="1029" /> the establishment of An tÚdarás.  The group did very valuable work, furnished a very comprehensive report.  They tried hard to consider various means of encouraging development in the Gaeltacht, but it is important to realise that since the group did its work we have become full members of the EEC and that this will have an influence on measures which are possible and the situation in the Gaeltacht areas. Our experience within the EEC will indicate to us the possible grants, loans and regional aid that will be available in practice.  We knew previously theoretically what might be available in the early seventies but we now have much greater knowledge in practice of the operation of the EEC and how it can be used beneficially for particular groups of people.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is important that An tÚdarás be recognised as a training authority especially so as to benefit from the EEC Social Fund.  Section 11 gives power to transfer certain functions from an tÚdarás to An Chomhairle Oiliúna.  It says that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Labour, arrange for the transfer to An Chomhairle Oiliúna of some or all of the functions of An tÚdarás in relation to training, including retraining, of workers.  This provision is desirable, but I think An tÚdarás should develop and promote its own training programme in association with AnCO and ensure that it gets maximum benefit from the EEC Social Fund which has been of tremendous benefit to industry generally.  I should certainly like to see the Gaeltacht areas getting the maximum possible benefit from these training funds.</P>
    <P>I was also impressed by the fact that there is a novel approach in the Bill.  It provides for seven representatives to be elected democratically from these areas. This differs from the original recommendations in &ldquo;Gníomh don Gaeltacht&rdquo;. This is an interesting development.  It certainly involves the people directly in the future development of their own area.  It could have parallels in other activities. I have always been very keen on the concept of community enterprise and I shall be interested to see the effect of <Col N="1030" /> this provision in the Gaeltacht areas.  It brings responsibility directly to the people themselves to make proposals for their own areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it clear that the Minister is giving the Gaeltacht community a much greater say regarding An tÚdarás than was previously envisaged. Consequently, they will be able to exert considerable influence on the affairs of An tÚdarás.  This is a novel feature in such development and the Minister is to be complimented on this step.  I shall be very interested to see how this is used in practice subsequently.  It could have lessons for us in many other aspects of community life in particular.</P>
    <P>It would not be right to discuss the Bill and move on to An tÚdarás without paying due respect to the work done by Gaeltarra Éireann and congratulating its staff on their achievements in the Gaeltacht areas in the years since that body was founded.  The functions, liabilities and staff of Gaeltarra will be transferred to An tÚdarás under this Bill.  Some years ago Gaeltarra Éireann took a major step in decentralisation, in moving to Galway as the centre of their activities.  I see this step as a further development of democratisation and development of subsidiary functions within the Gaeltacht.  I am sure it will present no problems for them because this is the direction in which they have been going in recent years.</P>
    <P>An additional power is included in this Bill.  It is the power to guarantee repayment of loans received by persons for whom Údarás na Gaeltachta have supplied financial assistance.  This power should be used particularly to sponsor development schemes for young people within Gaeltacht areas to assist them to get off the ground in establishing enterprises and working within the Gaeltacht.  I welcome this provision and I hope it will be successful.</P>
    <P>I have noted the Land Settlement Association in England under whom very many small enterprises have been established and continue to be established. They have been considered, discussed and debated by many people as to their relevance to our situation here.  In recent <Col N="1031" /> years this Land Settlement Association in England have continued to expand and develop mostly small enterprises and to provide the kind of guarantees mentioned in this Bill.  I look forward to seeing some of this sort of development within the Gaeltacht areas.  I am aware that in some areas, particularly in Bally-ferriter in County Kerry, there are some developments of this nature on a larger scale taking place, but on an individual holding basis there is still considerable scope for that sort of operation.</P>
    <P>I have listened to speakers from the Opposition claiming that there is nothing new or exciting in the Bill and that it is very much the same old hat with a dif-ferent name.  I cannot see it that way; the facts are somewhat different.  Section 9, which, as the Minister said, is perhaps the most interesting section of the Bill, gives the powers which may be conferred by Government order.  That indicates very clearly the intention of the Government and the Minister to meet by whatever means are necessary the requirements for development on the most comprehensive basis within the Gaeltacht areas.  This is a very novel and interesting feature of this Bill and I welcome it.  We may consider in future how far this kind of provision should extend to other areas and other people.  I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Well done so far.&rdquo; This is a comprehensive and very major enabling Bill for the Gaeltacht areas and I hope that the Bill, which offers a great deal of opportunity, will be followed by similar novel actions to support a very novel Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are meeting here today to perform the annual ritual of paying homage to the Irish language.  In some years it is in the form of a motion and in other years it is in the form of a Bill, but it all adds up to the same thing. I have yet to see any concrete, definite progress as a result of all our debates despite all the enthusiasm, be it genuine or otherwise.  A sad fact of the matter is that as things stand Irish is a dying language and that need not be the case.  I do not wish to be contentious politically on this matter, but over the years Fianna <Col N="1032" /> Fáil have used the Irish language not as a medium of expression but as a political weapon.  For 50 years we have been listening to them talking about the proposed revival of the Irish language. They have professed to cherish the language as no other Irish person does or is entitled to do for that matter, according to Fianna Fáil.  They do not cherish it, but they nurse it.  They leave it virtually to die out and then they come along and make, or pretend to make, a major spurt and pretend to nurse it back to good health.  If there was an ounce of sincerity in their intentions we probably would have made some progress by this stage, but unfortunately there has been none.  This Bill is merely whitewash by another name.  We have heard and seen it all before.</P>
      <P>What is needed is the will to bring back Irish as a spoken language.  Where there is a will there is a way.  Deceit and dishonesty will not revive the language one iota.  How many people in this country can speak Irish fluently?  How many speak Irish in the course of their work and in their homes?  I venture to say that the percentage is somewhere around two, or maybe less.  If we had the will as a nation I have no doubt that within a matter of days&mdash;not even a week&mdash;about 22 per cent of the population could speak Irish fluently in the course of their work and of their daily lives.  We have the basis.  All, or virtually all of us, have been educated in the fundamentals of the Irish language to a reasonable degree which would enable us, if we so wished, to speak it fluently within a matter of days if we got down to it.  But the will is lacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would dearly love to see somebody motivate the Irish race to use Irish in the normal course of their lives.  Unfortunately, that will is lacking.  It is lacking primarily because of the hypocrisy which has accompanied the so-called revival attempts over the years.  Unless we are honest with ourselves we cannot hope to go forward in this regard.  There has not been a bit of honesty; there has been hypocrisy.  I would like to see some individual or group of individuals coming forward and stirring up the Irish nation, getting us on the right road to a <Col N="1033" /> genuine Irish language revival.  That 22 per cent who I contend could speak the language within a matter of days could be raised to 52 per cent within a few months.  It can be done if we adopt the right approach, but I do not see any evidence of the right approach coming about.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell made more progress in his term of office as Minister for the Gaeltacht than did all the previous Ministers for the Gaeltacht in the preceding 15 years.  He engendered enthusiasm and got people to sit up and think.  That enthusiasm was quite infectious. Since he left office it seems to have waned.</P>
    <P>It is all right for me to use words.  Talk is cheap.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  As Minister, Deputy O'Donnell took practical steps to build up the Gaeltachtaí and to promote the Irish language.  When the National Coalition Government took office in 1973, 1,835 people were employed in Gaeltarra Éireann projects.  When he left office in 1977, that figure had increased to 4,200. That is what I call practical patriotism, and not just lip service to the language. He more than doubled the number of people employed in industries in the Gaeltachtaí.  It is sad to relate that, since Deputy O'Donnell left office, the employment figure has remained stagnant, or decreased if anything.</P>
    <P>Today's report published by Gaeltarra Éireann for 1977 makes sad reading.  I am sure the Minister and other Deputies present have seen references to it in the newspapers.  The heading in the <i>Irish Independent</i> reads: &ldquo;Gaeltarra's frantic appeal to Government&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not do what the Minister wishes me to do.  I am stating what is written here in front of me.  I will quote from <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
      <P>The incentives offered to industry in the Gaeltacht are equalled or sur-passed elsewhere in Ireland and abroad so that the slight advantage formerly offered in the Gaeltacht has decreased.  As the board's powers have been eroded by inflation, it is becoming more difficult to attract industrialists and investors.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Erosion&rdquo; is the word which crops up. At one time the incentives available to people setting up industries in the Gaeltacht were more attractive and considerably greater than those available in non-Gaeltacht areas.  That has changed. The Government have done nothing to improve the incentives for Gaeltacht industries to enable them to keep in line with grants available from the IDA for industries in non-Gaeltacht areas. Unless those incentive grants are increased shortly and soon, we will have a drastic fall in the employment which Deputy O'Donnell built up when he was Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall that report makes sad reading.  The Minister should ask himself what is going wrong.  Why does he not put a new injection of capital into the industrial projects in the Gaeltachtaí.  I believe&mdash;I am open to contradiction on it&mdash;that the money voted for Gaeltacht industries in the Estimate last year was reduced.  I should like to hear the <Col N="1035" /> Minister's view on that.  I was told there was a reduction in the region of £2 million. If that is true, it is pretty awful.  I turst that it is not true.  Sometimes people juggle with figures and I hope my information is incorrect.</P>
    <P>Recently I have been asking people to define the word &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo;.  I am not a very proficient speaker of the language and I wanted to find out what that word meant.  I am told it means all things in Irish.  Our concept of the Gaeltacht is far too narrow.  Should our encouragement of all things Irish extend beyond the present boundaries of the Gaeltachtaí?  I believe it should.  The phrase &ldquo;all things Irish&rdquo; does not just mean the language. It means traditional music, folklore, culture, step dancing, singing and so on. A number of other aspects of Irish culture should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>West Clare leads the country in traditional Irish music and should be classified as an area which deserves special attention.  It should be incorporated in the meaning of the word &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo;.  There are similar areas in County Cavan, and there is an area called Sliabh gCua in my own county, Waterford, where all these traditional customs are practised and where people take great delight in their ability to play traditional music or perform Irish dances.  These people are promoting Irish traditional culture to a greater extent than is being done in many areas which are designated as Gaeltachtaí.  We all know some Gaeltachtí are merely Gaeltachtaí in name, a bit of a sham. The whole concept should be broadened and the very word itself encourages that expansion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a sort of Welsh background.  What length of time does the word &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; cover?  Does it go back ten, 50 or 500 years?  Any native cultural activity should be covered by the word &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to dwell on the type of industries <Col N="1036" /> that have been located in Gaeltacht areas.  The primary function of Gaeltarra Éireann or of any other industrial promotion body within the Gaeltacht should be to use the available local resources.  We have had far too much of the situation in which imported industries come and go.  There are ample natural resources available. With the exception of a few Gaeltacht areas such as Ballyvourney in Cork and Rath Cairn in Meath, the Gaeltacht areas are generally on the seaboard.  It is unfortunate that our fishing industry is perhaps our most underdeveloped natural asset.  Would it not be logical to promote the processing of fish as a major industrial concern in these Gaeltacht areas?  For every Irish fisherman there is merely one person engaged on-shore in a processing industry whereas in the other EEC countries the ratio varies from 1:5 up to 1:10 in Denmark.  In other words, for every fisherman in Denmark there are ten people employed on-shore in allied industries.  We should endeavour to build up that type of national industry and there would be no better place to make a start than in Gaeltacht areas.  If the Minister restores the incentive grants to their former level compared with the IDA grants he might boost the processing sector of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Although the Gaeltacht areas are generally rather rough and wild they have considerable possibilities for forestry.  That is another native industry that could be explored to its full potential in those areas.  During the next 15 years we will have a tremendous supply of mature timber but we do not have sufficient processing industries to deal with this situation.  This area alone could provide tens of thousands of jobs.  Textiles, too, are an obvious natural resource.  This industry has been fostered considerably by Gaeltarra Éireann, especially in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Tourism is another industry which has great potential in the Gaeltacht areas because of their scenic attraction. This is an industry that is being promoted very well by Bord Fáilte in these areas but primarily the two industries which could and should be built <Col N="1037" /> up are in a sad state.  These are the fish-processing and timber-processing in-dustries.</P>
    <P>Although I began on a rather pessimistic note regarding the Irish language.  I am very sincere when I say that the language could be spoken by at least half the population if there was even a slight effort to bring about that situation.  In recent years there was tremendous interest in the revival of the language, but that interest appears to have waned.  However, the elimination of compulsory Irish for the intermediate and leaving certificates was a tremendous step forward and generated a great amount of goodwill towards the language.  There is a Shakespearean quotation which says that there is a tide in the affairs of men which, if taken at its flood, leads to fortune but which if missed leaves all life's voyage laid in shallows and in misery.  If we had taken the immense amount of goodwill towards the language in its flood, Irish would be in a much healthier state today.  It should be a priority of the Minister to ensure that the goodwill that exists is harnessed and to ensure that those people who are potential Irish speakers become Irish speakers.  It is sad that the position has not improved.  To remedy the situation it is necessary to increase to a large extent the amount of Irish being taught at school.  Unfortunately, the Irish that is being taught at the various levels of education day after day is not being manifested in terms of the language being spoken either at work or in the home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its production. It is a Bill that will have the effect of developing the culture of our country and which in particular will help to develop the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our number one priority should be to ensure the spread of the Irish language. In this context the Bill is very important and should prove very beneficial to Irish-speaking communities in particular. I come from a county in which the language is very strong, as I am sure the Minister will agree from his experience of frequent visits to the area. Since the foundation of the State various <Col N="1038" /> boards and organisations have been set up for the purpose of ensuring that the language would live, and while all of these bodies did very good work the impact on the language revival movement has not been great.  Despite all the efforts that have been made the Irish-speaking areas are shrinking fast.  In many parts of Donegal that are native speaking one finds that English is used all too often.  I appreciate that English is very often necessary for reasons of commerce and so on, but it is unfortunate that it is used so much in some Gaeltacht areas.  Those people who can speak Irish should make every effort to transact their business and to hold conversations in that medium.</P>
    <P>While work in schools is efficiently done, there is little carry over to later life.  Young people with a good knowledge of the Irish language leaving secondary and third level institutions either do not have any scope to use the language or are not prepared to bother with it.  A great responsibility lies on the teaching profession to encourage their students, irrespective of whether they live in the Gaeltacht or elsewhere, to develop their use of the language in every way.  This should be instilled into all pupils.  They should be given a sense of pride and a sense of duty to hold on to the Irish language and to speak it as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the last speaker who said that the policy of the last Government in no longer making Irish obligatory in examinations was a good move.  I consider it was a grave mistake. We all agree that compulsion is not the best way to gain an objective but nevertheless Irish should be compulsory in examinations.  If it were reintroduced it would encourage people to be more aware and more concerned about the necessity to develop and try to revive Irish as our spoken tongue.</P>
    <P>This Bill winds up Gaeltarra Éireann. I want to pay tribute to the fine work they have done down the years in the Gaeltacht district in Donegal.  They have helped to revitalise our weak economy and provided employment for our young people.  One need only go to the Gweedore estate and look over the industries <Col N="1039" /> there, which give employment to many people living in that native speaking area, to see that this is true.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the incentives being given to industry are not enough. This may be, but I hope this new body will see ways and means of developing once again many of our native industries in the Gaeltacht areas which have long since died.  The Gaeltacht areas have great potential but they are underdeveloped. The fishing industry in Donegal, which comprises a fair amount of the Gaeltacht territory, is also underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>If the small ports and harbours in these areas got proper attention, the people engaged in fishing would have the necessary means of securing their boats and they would have harbours in which to land their catches.  This is one aspect that has been badly neglected and many of our small essential ports are in a very run down condition.</P>
    <P>Another industry which has developed in the Gaeltacht areas over the years is the tourist industry.  Great strides have been made in this industry and I hope An tÚdarás will encourage more tourism for these areas.  I am sure the development of our bogs and of the forest industry will also get due attention under this Bill.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this Bill in which I am disappointed relates to the number of representatives on an tÚdarás who will be elected by the people of the Gaeltacht.  This is a major step and will give the people living in the Gaeltacht the right to put on the board the people they consider best qualified to serve their interests and to see that the Gaeltacht areas are properly developed.  There are three seats in Connacht-Meath, two in Munster and two only for Donegal.  I consider that we in the Donegal Gaeltacht, which is on a par with the Galway Gaeltacht, merit three representatives. We took as a yardstick for determining the number of representatives for each Gaeltacht area the number of Irish speakers who received the £10 deontas. The Galway and Donegal Gaeltachtaí would have 2,000 in each and on this <Col N="1040" /> alone it could be argued very strongly that Donegal is not receiving proper representation.  I do not mean that the Minister should take a seat from one area and give it to Donegal.  I ask him to have another look as this and judge it on the arguments I have made.  I am sure that as a result he will give the Donegal Gaeltacht three representatives.  It was agreed when the commission was set up in 1926 that there should be three representatives from the Donegal Gaeltacht and I cannot see any reason for changing that.  I hope the Minister will accede to this request.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the Bill is that it will enable people to elect members of the Údarás.  This is right because these elected representatives will be most familiar with the needs of Gaeltacht areas.  I may be argued that the Bill does not go far enough but we must accept that it is a step forward and it contains provisions whereby at a later stage wider powers may be given to the board.</P>
    <P>Some Gaeltacht areas are fragmented and when one crosses from a Gaeltacht parish to a non-Gaeltacht parish one finds that the difference is non-existent. There may be some way in which special aid could be provided to help such areas which have very few resources.  It is just as difficult to live in many non-Gaeltacht areas in Donegal as it is to live in Gaeltacht areas there.</P>
    <P>Various attempts have been made to give the Gaeltacht a fair deal.  However, despite good intentions and no lack of effort and finance, the end product is not very significant.  This Bill contains the elements for success; and the Minister, who is a native of the Gaeltacht, understands what is needed.  While in Opposition he did not lose any opportunity to criticise Government policy and to point out what should be done.  Now he has the chance to do something himself and I am confident he will go a good job.  He does not want to see the Gaeltacht wither and die but to see it thrive and prosper.  Action must be taken immediately. Economic conditions in many parts of the Donegal Gaeltacht are substandard. More industries and better social and recreational facilities are <Col N="1041" /> needed.  If these can be provided, the Gaeltacht, already severely eroded, can be saved.  A constructive development policy and generous finances are needed immediately.  These are the important ingredients of success in Gaeltacht areas. Since the Minister took up office he has done much for these areas and he will not be to blame if conditions are not created for the development of the Gaeltacht and the retention of its population.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Údarás should have as their first priority the retention of the national tongue as the first language in Gaeltacht areas.  While Governments over the years have given extra funds for the development of the Gaeltacht, it would be sad if the prime objective, namely, the development of the national tongue, should not be achieved.  In many parts of the Donegal Gaeltacht Irish is not as frequently used as it should be.  The new board must give priority to the development of the language.  People today are not fully aware of what the national tongue should mean to the nation.  This is due to many factors, including outside influences which have had a substantial impact on the failure to promote our native tongue.  Many people have a fair knowledge of Irish but for some reason they do not use it.  Proper emphasis must be laid on the importance of keeping alive our national language.  I wish the Minister well.  He comes, as I said, from a Gaeltacht area and he will ensure that everything possible will be done to foster and develop that part of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is welcomed by the people of the Gaeltacht, a people who in the past have had many promises made to them, promises that were unfortunately not followed up by any performance.  Naturally the people of the Gaeltacht give the present Minister great credit for what he is doing for them.  This is a first step.  More powers will be needed but the Bill makes provision for those and I am sure that when the time comes all the necessary powers will be given to them.  The people are grateful for the Minister showing such faith in them as to give them a majority on the board.  Is this, I wonder, the <Col N="1042" /> first time a majority of elected representatives have been appointed to such a board?  I hope the Minister will, in his wisdom, look at those Gaeltacht areas where there is no chance of an elected representative.  I am thinking of the Muskerry Gaeltacht in my own constituency. Where there are two places available the smaller area would not, on balance, have an opportunity of having an elected representative.  Perhaps an additional area could be created or possibly someone from the area could be appointed.</P>
      <P>We have seven islands and I would advocate the appointment of a representative of those islands.  Nobody knows the hardships and the difficulties islanders experience better than an inhabitant of those islands.</P>
      <P>The nominees should have an industrial flair.  As well as dealing with the preservation and expansion of the language the Bill also deals with industry, the provision of jobs and a better standard of living for all those in these areas.  That is why I feel an industrial flair is very important coupled with a love of the language both in public and in private.  We have on occasions seen people putting on a show for the public but not putting the language into practice in their daily lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the promotion of industry.  It is a flexible section.  Should the need arise to provide additional functions or modify some already there the Minister and the Government should act quickly.  Industries in the Gaeltacht have had a poor history.  Some have been set up for grant purposes and they have not always been the type of industry most suitable to the Gaeltacht.  Many of them may have influenced people to leave good jobs in other areas and set up homes in the Gaeltacht in an effort to provide a livelihood for themselves and their families and these people have in their own way helped to promote the language.  Industries should be established only on the strongest foundations so that they will be successful in the long term.  They should blend with the local environment.  Where possible they should be based on local resources. I am thinking of cottage industries, craft <Col N="1043" /> industries, food growing and processing, fishing and fish farming.  The latter is becoming very popular.  We should spare no effort in providing incentives to the people in the Gaeltacht where these particular enterprises can be carried on.</P>
    <P>An industry associated with Gaeltarra Éireann is the production of Aran sweaters.  This is a simple garment with a worldwide market.  It can be made by anybody who has the necessary skill.  It can be exported to any part of the world. We have all the requisites.  We have the wool.  We have the people and we have the market.  Unfortunately we cannot fill the market.  These are things that should be looked into because they could provide a high standard of living for the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is an excellent example of the type of co-operation that should exist between the Údarás and other Government agencies.  No effort should be spared to train the people in these areas in new or old skills.  We should be very conscious of some of the old skills that have been lost.  Many of these skills survive only in the Gaeltacht.  The Údarás, with the help of an Chomhairle Oiliúna, should encourage and revive these rare skills, they should help to make them profitable, so as to give valuable employment and provide craft items of which we would be proud.  During the summer tourists are anxious to buy Irish-made souvenirs and surely this is a market we should be able to supply.  Many tourists have been disappointed and annoyed not to have been able to acquire Irish-made souvenirs.  This should be promoted in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>We should also encourage fruit and vegetable growing in the Gaeltacht areas because there is a very lucrative market for these foods, a lot of which we import at present.  The Údarás should give every training incentive and encouragement to those who would grow fruit and vegetables in Gaeltacht areas.  This is an area where there is a very high labour content and such enterprise would make a valuable contribution to the economy of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>In relation to executives, we should ensure that all these project the <Col N="1044" /> Gaeltacht, the language and the culture. I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  The Minister is an example to all of us of the sort of person that should come from the Gaeltacht.  Not alone does the Minister speak the language but he sings Irish songs, plays Irish music and projects Irish culture wherever he goes.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents another commitment being fulfilled by Fianna Fáil.  I wish the Údarás well and hope they will involve themselves actively in the continuing development of the Gaeltacht.  I look forward to them coming back in the near future looking for additional powers which will be made available to them.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of the situation in the smaller Gaeltacht areas, especially the Gaeltacht in Muskerry in mid-Cork, who are looking for and are deserving of a representative on the board.  I wish the people of the Gaeltacht well and ask them and all of us to take pride in ourselves, in our language and in our culture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis na Teachtaí a thug a gcuid tuairimí faoin mBille.  Is cuma cé acu a bhí siad ar thaobh an Bhille nó ina aghaidh, ba bhreá an rud go raibh an oiread daoine anseo a raibh suim acu ann agus go dtáinig siad isteach chun a dtuairimí a chur os ár gcomhair.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana go poiblí, nílimse ag iarraidh a chur ina luí ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil na cumhachtaí ar fad a mba mhaith leo a fheiceáil ag an Údarás ar fáil sa Bhille seo.  Ba mhaith liom an méid seo a rá: tá Bille an Údaráis tugtha os comhair na Dála, rud a gheallamar agus rud a bhfuil brod ormsa anois a bheith in ann é a chur os comhair na Dála.  Beidh deis ag chuile dhuine sna blianta atá romhainn an Bille a fheabhsú agus a neartú ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag éisteacht leis na Teachtaí ón Fhreasúra, go háirithe Teachtaí Fhine Gael, cheapfá go ndearna siad fhéin cat agus dhá dhrioball, ach bhíodar anseo ar feadh 4½ bliana agus mí i ndiaidh míosa, bliain i ndiaidh bliana, chuir mé cheist <Col N="1045" /> orthu, &ldquo;Cén uair a bheidh an t-Údarás ar fáil?&rdquo; agus fuair mé an freagra céanna i gcónaí, go raibh sé réidh le tabhairt os comhair na Dála.  Ach níor tháinig sé, agus ins an díospóireacht a bhí againn anseo ar feadh cúpla lá, ní fhacamar cruthúnas ar bith go raibh Bille ar bith réidh acu le cur os comhair na Dála.</P>
    <P>Nuair a thosaigh an Teachta O'Donnell ag labhairt dúirt sé go raibh súil aige go mbeadh níos mó cumhachtaí sa Bhille. San taobh don tír a bhfuil baint agamsa leis ní bhainfinn úsáid as an abairt &ldquo;ag súil&rdquo;.  Tá seanfhocal againn a deireann: &ldquo;Ag dúil le Dia, agus nár fhealla Sé&rdquo;.  Bhuel, d'fheall an Teachta O'Donnell.  I mBille mar seo tá sé íon-tach deacair mion-rudaí mar sin a chur isteach.  Ní raibh sé sásta leis na ceantair thoghcháin agus shíl sé go mba cheart go mbeadh níos mó daoine tofa do chúige Mumhan.  Sílim go bhfuil muintir chúige Mumhan ag fáil a gcion féin sna toghcháin agus dá mbeimis ag brath ar uimhreacha amháin nach mbeadh beirt le fáil acu i dtoghcháin an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Shíl an Teachta go mba cheart duine amháin a cheapadh do na hoileáin.  Ní shílim go bhfuil sé sin ró-phraiticiúil. Conas a d'fhéadfadh fear amháin freastal ar Oileán Thóraí, ar Árainn Mhóir, Oileáin Árann, na trí cinn acu, agus ar Oileán Chléire, duine amháin bheith freagrach do no hoileáin ar fad ag tosú thuas i dToraígh agus ag síneadh síos go hOileán Chléire.  Ní bheadh sé ró-éasca toghchán ar leith a chur ar bun le haghaidh duine a dhéanfadh freastal ar na hoileáin.  Tuigimid go maith cúrsaí na n-oileán agus tuigeann chuile dhuine go bhfuil fadhbanna faoi leith ag muintir na n-oileán ach sílim go bhfuil siad féin ag fáil an lámh in uachtar ar chúrsaí le blianta beaga anuas agus gur fearr an dul chun cinn atá sna hoileáin anois ná mar a bhí scaitheamh maith de bhlianta ó shin.</P>
    <P>Tá rud amháin adúirt an Teachta Begley nach n-aontaím leis, agus sin an masla a chaith sé le muintir na Gaeltachta&mdash;na dreamanna balbha a thug sé orthu, na comharchumainn, na cearta sibhíalta, daoine eile nár tháinig amach agus nár labhair in aghaidh an Bhille seo.  D'fháiltigh muintir na Gaeltachta roimh an mBille, mar bhí <Col N="1046" /> siad ag éisteacht chomh fada leis an chaint i gcaitheamh na mblianta atá caite faoi Údarás gur shíl siad nach bhfeicfeadh siad Údarás ar bith.  Tá bród orthu anois go bhfuil an tÚdarás ag teacht agus is beag an mhaise don Teachta Begley é, fear atá ina chónaí i nGaeltacht, masla den chineál sin a chaitheamh le muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Horgan óráid a bhi réasúnta agus stuama agus molaim é dá bharr.  Dúirt sé go raibh an baol ann go bhfágfaí chuile shórt faoin Údarás agus gur fúthu a bheadh cúram na Gaeltachta ar fad.  Tiocfaidh mé leis gur pointe anmhaith é sin agus nár cheart a bheith ag cuimhniú gur ar an Údarás amháin a bheadh cúram na Gaeltachta.  Baineann an cúram sin linn ar fad.  Baineann sé le muintir na tíre ar fad, agus tá súil agam nach nglacfar leis ar an gcaoi sin nuair a bhéas an tÚdarás curtha ar bun.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé an gá atá leis an teanga, an cultúr agus cúrsaí eile sa Ghaeltacht a neartú, agus tá sé soiléir go dtuigeann sé nach mbeadh maith ar bith bheith ag caint faoin Ghaeltacht mura mbeimid ag caint faoi dhaoine.  Nuair atáimid ag caint faoin nGaeltacht táimid ag caint faoi dhaoine agus is maith liom go raibh an chaint a rinne sé stuama agus go raibh sé ag iarraidh cuidiú linn sna moltaí a chuir sé os ár gcomhair.</P>
    <P>Luaigh sé deacrachtaí a bhain leis an Ghaeltacht mar atá sí i láthair na huaire, agus beimid ag dúil nuair a chuirfear an tÚdarás ar bun go mbeidh sé láidir agus go ndéanfar na deacrachtaí atá ann i láthair na huaire a leigheas agus cúrsaí a neartú maidir le cultúr, eacnamaíocht agus chuile shórt eile a bhaineas le dul chun cinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Maidir lein an mBille féin, tá cosúlacht ann go bhfuil daoine nach dtuigeann go ró-shoiléir an chuid a bhaineann leis na cumhachtaí a bhéas ag an Údarás.  Tá sé leagtha amach go soiléir conas a bheidh an tÚdarás in ann na cumhachtaí breise a fháil agus cén chaoi a iarrfaidh an tÚdarás na cumhachtaí sin.  An lá a thosaigh an díospóireacht anseo bhí ordú tugtha ós comhair na Dála ag an Aire Iascaigh a bhain leis an rannóg atá faoina chúram, agus ar an chaoi chéanna beidh an tÚdarás in ann a gcuid moltaí a chur os comhair Aire na Gaeltachta agus an <Col N="1047" /> Rialtais agus beidh an Rialtas ansin in ann na horduithe sin a thabhairt os com-hair na Dála nuair a bhéas gá leo.  Ní rud mór é sin.  Tá sé anseo sa Dáil cheana againn.  Má bhaineann an tÚdarás feidhm as sin ní bheidh deacracht ar bith acu na cumhachtaí breise seo a fháil am ar bith a thogróidh siad é.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Aherne agus an Teachta Hegarty faoi na Breac-Ghaeltachtaí, agus luadh go mba cheart b'fhéidir níos mó áirde a thabhairt ar áiteanna a bhfuil an Ghaeilge iontu go fóill ach nach bhfuil sí á labhairt mar is ceart.  Aontaím go mb'fhéidir go bhfuil gá le dearcadh nios géire ar chúrsaí mar sin agus sílim go mbaineann sé sin leis an Údarás agus le Bord na Gaeilge a n-aghaidheanna a dhíriú ar na Breac-Ghaeltachtaí agus féachaint le teacht i gcabhair ar dhaoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu anois is atá in ann í a labhairt ach nach bhfuil ag baint an oiread úsáide as an Ghaeilge agus ar chóir dóibh a bheith. Tá sé soiléir i láthair na huaire go bhfuil cuid mhaith de na Breac-Ghaeltachtaí sin ann, áit a raibh Gaeilge, b'fhéidir scór go leith bliain ó shin, agus de bharr imirce nó de bharr faillí agus neamh-shuime i labhairt na Gaeilge go bhfuil sí ag dul i léig sna háiteanna sin.  Sílim go dtuigfeadh duine ar bith go bhfuil sé níos fusa an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais in áiteanna mar sin ná in áiteanna eile ar fud na tíre nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar bith iontu i láthair na hauire.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Hegarty chomh maith na mion-tionscail agus bhí moltaí anmhaith aige maidir le céard ba chóir a dhéanamh leis na miontionscail a scaipeadh thart ar fud na Gaeltachta. Dúirt sé go mba chóir teorainn na Gaeltachta a athrú.  Ní ceist ró-fhurasta í seo le réiteach.  Tháinig Airí agus d'imigh Airí agus rinne cuid acu teorainn dá gcuid féin, agus níl fhios agam an ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeltacht nó ar mhaithe le polaitíocht a rinneadh cuid acu, ach is doiligh a rá cén chaoi cheart chun an scéal seo a mheas nó a leigheas. Má dhéantar cúlú ar na Gaeltachtaí beimid ag caitheamh droch-mheas ar áiteanna nach bhfuil, b'fhéidir, mórán <Col N="1048" /> Gaeilge iontu ach ag an am céanna ní ceart go gcaithfí droch-mheas orthu.  Má leathnaíonn muid amach teorainneacha na Gaeltachta mar atá sí i láthair na huaire tá an dainséar ann go mbeimid ag déanamh éagóir ar na fíor-Ghaeltachtaí, áiteacha a bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt go tréan.</P>
    <P>Bhí an cheist seo faoi chaibidil ag an Teachta O'Toole agus an Teachta Kenny. Shíl siadsan go mba cheart go mbeadh na buntáistí atá le fáil anois ag muintir na Gaeltachta ag na ceantair imeallacha atá buailte leis an nGaeltacht. Sílim ón méid adúirt siad&mdash;séard a thuig mise ón méid adúirt siad&mdash;go raibh siad ag caint faoin rud a luadh cúpla bliain ó shin i gContae Mhaigh Eó, sé sin an Western Development Board.  Ar ndóigh cosúil leis an Údarás ní raibh ansin ach moladh nach dtáinig tada as agus arís cé go raibh go leor cainte faoi níor tháinig sé chun tosaigh agus níl fhios agam céard atá i gceist acu anseo.  Leis an fhírinne a dhéanamh níl fhios agam cén polasaí atá ag Fine Gael ins na cúrsaí seo mar bhí cúpla Teachta eile a tháinig isteach agus a labhair faoin Ghaeltacht agus cén áit ar chóir don Ghaeltacht a bheith.  Dúirt an Teachta Deasy, cuirimíd i gcás, gur shíl sé gur cheart go mbeadh áiteachta in Iarthar an Chláir i dteideal a bheith sa Ghaeltacht agus luaigh sé áit eile i gContae an Chabháin. Luaigh an Teachta Keating Gaeilgeoirí Bhaile Átha Cliath agus go mbeadh Gaeltacht dá gcuid féin ag muintir Bhaile Átha Cliath agus go raibh na daoine i mBaile Átha Cliath a bhí ag labhairt na Gaeilge i dteideal an t-aitheantas céanna agus atá á fháil ag muintir na Gaeltachta i láthair na huaire a fháil.</P>
    <P>Níl fhios agam go díreach céard atá i gceist ag na Teachtaí seo ar fad nó cén polasaí atá acu i dtaobh na gcúrsaí seo ar fad.  Luaigh an Teachta Deasy rud eile nach dtuigim nuair a bhí sé ag caint faoin Ghaeltacht.  Luaigh sé &ldquo;this sham&rdquo;, adúirt sé.  Céard go díreach atá i gceist aige?  Níl fhios agam.  An é go bhfuil sé ag rá gur &ldquo;sham&rdquo; atá sa Ghaeltacht féin&mdash;le úsáid a bhaint as na focail a labhair sé féin.  Más ea sílim gur cheart dó dul síos go dtí Gaeltacht Phort Láirge agus a mhíniú dóibh céard atá i gceist aige.  Níl fhios agamsa céard atá i gceist <Col N="1049" /> aige nó cén chiall atá le baint as na rudaí sin adúirt sé.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta O'Toole an cheist faoi eolas a nochtadh faoin alt den Bhille ina ngearrfar nó a bhfuil sé i gceist go ngearrfar pionós ar dhaoine i ngeall ar eolas a nochtadh.  Ní rud úr é sin. Baineann sé leis na boird Stáit eile go minic.  Ó thárla go mbeidh an tÚdarás ag plé le cúrsaí a bhéas&mdash;ar feadh cuid den am ar chuma ar bith&mdash;rúnda sílim gur cheart go dtuigfeadh éinne go bhfuil gá le rannóg mar sin a chur sa Bhille. Cuirimíd i gcás nuair a thagann tionsclaí le moltaí chuig Gaeltarra i láthair na h-uaire nó chuig an IDA ní maith leis b'fhéidir go mbeadh fhios ag an saol mór céard atá ar siúl aige ná ní maith leis go mbeadh fhios acu céard iad na moltaí a bheadh os cómhair Gaeltarra nó an IDA aige.  Ní gnách go dtugtar poiblíocht do chúrsaí tionscail go mbíonn chuile shórt réidh agus go mbíonn gach rud réidh le tosú.  Dá bhrí sin, sin an fáth go bhfuil an rud seo curtha sa Bhille agus ní shílim gur cheart go mbeadh muide ag argóint faoi.  Is rud simplí é agus is rud ciallmhar é.</P>
    <P>Dúradh nach raibh aon rud á dhéanamh don Ghaeltacht i láthair na huaire agus gur ag dul ar gcúl a bhí cúr-saí maidir leis an gGaeltacht féin.  Ní thig linn a bheith sásta go bhfuil chuile shórt chomh maith agus ba mhaith linn go mbeadh sé ins na Gaeltachtaí.  Tá deacrachtaí i gcónaí maidir le tionscail a chur ar bun ins na Gaeltachtaí, ach ó bunaíodh an Stát tá sé intuigthe i gcónaí go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta ag fáil deontaisí breise agus deontaisí nach raibh le fáil in áiteacha taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Cuirimíd i gcás i láthair na h-uaire má tá duine ag tógáil tí tá deontas de £2,000 le fáil aige.  Taobh amuigh den Gaeltacht níl ach £1,000 le fáil aige.  Tá deontaisí breise eile maidir le turasóireacht.  Má tá duine sásta cúpla seomra a chur lena theach tá deontaisí breise le fáil aige le cuidiú leis na cuairteoirí a mhealladh isteach.  Tá scoláireachtaí le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Ins na coláistí oiliúna, cuirimíd i gcás, tá 10 faoin gcéad de na h-áiteacha atá ag dul do mhúinteoirí le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá go leor leor buntáisí eile ag muintir na <Col N="1050" /> Gaeltachta nach bhfuil ag daoine atá ag maireachtáil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Sílim go dtuigeann pobal na tíre uilig go bhfuil gá leis na cúrsaí seo agus ní chuireann siad ina n-aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Beidh na cúrsaí seo ar fad faoi chúram an Údaráis ins na blianta atá rómhainn agus beidh deis ag na baill a thoghfar agus na baill a bhéas tofa ag an Aire na cúrsaí seo a phlé ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Ó thárla den chéad uair go mbeidh deis ag muintir na Gaeltachta iad féin na daoine seo a thoghadh beimíd ag dúil go mbeidh daoine ar an Údarás a thuigfeas níos fearr ná mar a tuigeadh go dtí seo céard iad na rudaí is fearr atá i ndán don Ghaeltacht agus cén chaoi is fearr a dtig freastal a dhéanamh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta i ngach áit san nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bhí go leor Teachtaí a tháinig isteach anseo agus nach raibh an Ghaeilge ar a ndeis acu agus labhair siad i mBéarla. Sílim gur breá an rud gur tháinig na Teachtaí sin isteach anseo agus gur labhair siad faoí chúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus faoin mBille fhéin.  B'fhéidir go raibh cuid mhaith acu a bhí ag plé le Gaeilge níos mó ná Gaeltacht agus nár fhan siad leis an mBille.  Níl aon locht agamsa orthu mar gheall air sin.  Nocht siad a gcuid tuairimí go breá, bríomhar, agus sílim go bhfuil sé soiléir nach bhfuil aon easaontas i measc Teachtaí faoi céard is fearr a dhéanamh maidir leis an Ghaeilge a neartú agus a leathnú amach.</P>
    <P>Ach tá rud amháin a chaithimid a thuiscint, agus sin nach mbeidh Gaeilge ann muna mbeidh an Ghaeltacht ann, agus sin é an fáth go bhfuil sé chomh tábhachtach sin go bhfuil an Bille seo os ár gcomhair anois agus go mbeidh muin-tir an Údaráis ag obair ar son na Gaeltachta sna blianta atá rnmhainn.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta O'Donnell tréimhse fhada, agus ó thárla go raibh sé ina Aire ar feadh 4½ bliana, tá tuiscint mhaith aige ar chúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus ar na rudaí is gá a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeltacht.  Luaigh sé na comharchumainn agus an pháirt atá acu maidir le leas na Gaeltachta ó bhunaíodh iad.  Sílim go dtuigeann na daoine anseo a bhí freagrach don Ghaeltacht san am atá caite na buntáistí atá sna comharchumainn.  Níl amhras ar <Col N="1051" /> bith ná gur thug siad misneach faoi leith do mhuintir na Gaeltachta obair a dhéanamh ar a son féin, agus ó tugadh isteach na deontasaí don chéad uair i 1965, deontasaí bainistíochta do na comharchumainn, tuigeadh na buntáistí a bhí sna comharchumainn le cúrsaí a chur chun cinn.  Is breá a fheiceáil anois go bhfuil na comharchumainn seo scaipthe thart ar fud na Gaeltachtaí, beagnach i ngach Gaeltacht, agus go bhfuil siad ag baint feidhme as na buntáistí atá ar fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta, go bhfuil siad ag glacadh leis na deon-tasaí bainistíochta le daoine a chur i mbun cúrsaí ins na Gaeltachtaí le cuidiú le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá rian a gcuid oibre go soiléir ins na Gaeltachtaí ar fad.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Teachta O'Donnell ceist díreach orm: ba mhaith leis a fháil amach céard a shíl mise faoina comhar-chumainn. An bealach is fearr chun an freagra sin a thabhairt dó ná a rá go raibh mé im rúnaí ar chomharchumann sa Ghaeltacht sular tháinig mé isteach sa Dáil, nó sular phléigh mé leis an bpolaitíocht.  Sílim go gcruthaíonn se sin an tsuim atá agam sna comharchumainn agus go dtuigim go rí-mhaith an obair is féidir leo a dhéanamh agus atá dá dhéanamh acu i láthair na huaire maidir leis na Gaeltachtaí a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh mórán tagairt pholaitíochta sa díospóireacht seachas ag cúpla Teachta a bhí ag cur i leith Fhianna Fáil go rabhdar ag ligint orthu nach raibh suim ag éinne eile i gcúrsaí Gaeilge nó Gaeltachta ach iad fhéin.  Nuair atá daoine ag plé le polaitíocht tá deis acu rud ar bith is maith leo a rá i ndíospóireachtaí mar seo.  Caithfidh siad seo a admháil: ó bunaíodh an Stát bhí tuiscint ag gach Rialtas faoi thábhacht na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  B'fhéidir nach raibh na módhanna nó na bealaí cearta ann le leas a bhaint as na cumhachtai a bhí ag Rialtais san am atá caite ar mhaithe le Gaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht, ach tá rud amháin a gcaithfimid a rá: rinneadh iarrachtaí, agus má theip ar na hiarrachtaí sin, sílim nach ceart dúinn bheith ag tromaíocht ar aon Rialtas mar gheall air sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Ghaeilge féin agus le <Col N="1052" /> hathbheochan na Gaeilge, cuireadh an t-ualach ar fad ar na scoileanna agus cheap chuile dhuine gur ag na scoileanna agus ag na múinteoirí ba cheart slánú na Gaeilge a fhágáil.  Is faoi sin a deineadh an dearmad&mdash;níor thuig daoine go raibh i bhfad níos mó le déanamh ná bheith ag dúil go mbeadh muid in ann an Ghaeilge a athbheochan trí na scoileanna amháin. I láthair na huaire sílim go bhfuil tuiscint nios fearr ar chúrsaí mar sin&mdash;go dtuigeann daoine nach féidir leis na múinteoirí nó na scoileanna an Ghaeilge a thabhairt ar ais muna mbíonn muintir na tíre ar fad taobh thiar den iarracht.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta O'Donnell chomh maith na hoileáin agus polasaí i leith na n-oileán.  Aris, is féidir a rá go fírinneach go ndeachaigh Roinn na Gaeltachta i gcabhair na n-oileán i gcuid mhaith bealaí.  Thug siad deontas 100 faoin gcéad le solas aibhléise a chur ar fáil, chuir siad aerstraící ar fáil dóibh.  Bhí deis i gcónaí ag páistí na n-oileán iarbhunoideachas a fháil, i meán-scoileanna agus in ollscoileanna.  Níor deineadh an fhaillí ar na hoileáin a deirtear go minic.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios againn ar fad go bhfuil saol cruaidh achrannach ag muintir na n-oileán agus go dteastaíonn cabhair uathu, ach sa chaoi a bhfuil cúrsaí ag dul ar aghaidh i láthair na huaire i gcuid de na hoileáin, in Inis Mór, Inis Meáin, ar Oileán Árainn Mhór i dTír Chonaill, tig linn bheith bródúil go bhfuil saol níos fearr ag bunadh na n-oileán sin anois de bharr an chuidiú sin.  Tá siad in ann buntáiste a bhaint as na coláistí samhraidh le micléinn a thógáil isteach.  Tá siad in ann níos mó a shaothrú ó thurasóireacht agus tá, sílim, ó bunaíodh Radio na Gaeltachta ceangal níos fearr acu leis an mórthír agus leis na Gaeltachtaí ar fad. Tá an saol athraithe ar fad le cúpla blian ins na hoileáin sin agus ní ceart a bheith go siorraí ag baint úsáide as an mbéal bocht agus ag iarraidh a bheith ag cur ina luí ar dhaoine nach bhfuil tada á dhéanamh i gcúrsaí mar sin.</P>

Luaigh sé eagras de chomharchumainn &mdash;sé sin, comharchumainn Ghael-tachta&mdash;go raibh eagras ann sul ar fhág sé an Aireacht agus go raibh duine le toghadh a bheadh ina bhainisteoir ar an eagras sin.  Níl fhios agam an bhfuil sé sin fíor nó bréagach&mdash;níl mé ag dul ag cáineadh an rud adúirt sé&mdash;ach ón eolas atá agamsa níor bunaíodh an t-eagras sin go foirmiúil.  Tháinig na comharchumainn le chéile go minic&mdash;tá fhios agam é sin&mdash;ó tháinig mise isteach mar Aire fiú amháin.  Tá fhios agam go dtáinig siad le chéile agus go raibh cruinnithe dá gcuid féin acu ach ní shílim gur bunaíodh an t-eagras a bhfuil sé ar caint air go foirmiúil.</P>
      <P>Luaigh an Teachta O'Donnell Tuarascáil Ghaeltarra atá foilsithe le scaitheamh agus a raibh trácht air ins na nuachtáin inniu.  Shílfeá ón méid adúirt sé agus ón méid adúirt Teachtaí eile go raibh éagóir éigin á dhéanamh ar Ghaeltarra, go raibh na deontaisí a bhí le fáil acu á ngearradh anuas agus dá bhri sin go raibh faillí á dhéanamh maidir le tionsclaíocht a leathnú amach ins na Gaeltachtaí.  Ó bunaíodh Gaeltarra ní shílim go ndearnadh aon athrú ar chúrsaí maidir leis na deontaisí atá dhá n-íoc acu.  Tugadh cumhachtaí breise dhóibh ó am go ham ó bunaíodh Gaeltarra féin ach níor laghdaíodh ar bhealach ar bith ar dheontaisí ná níor baineadh cúmhachtaí ar bith díobh maidir le tionscail a bhunú ins na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
      <P>Luaigh sé&mdash;agus bhí sé ag léamh as ceann de na páipéir, sílim an <i>Irish Independent</i>, luaigh sé go bhfuil ul-timatum fáighte ag an Rialtas ó Ghaeltarra maidir le cúrsaí ins na Gaeltachtaí.  Mar a thuigeann an Teachta é féin go rí-mhaith, sa gcéad áit&mdash;agus ba cheart go dtuigfeadh pobal na tíre seo chomh maith é&mdash;is ar éigean go mbeadh bord Stáit ar bith ag tabhairt ultimatum do Aire ná ag tabhairt ultimatum do Rialtas agus is aisteach an chaoi mar a dtig le páipéar nuachta rud a chasadh agus rudaí a rá i gcaoi go dtarraingeoidh siad súil an phobail orthu féin.</P>

      <P>Má tá gá leis b'fhéidir.  Níl cúis ar bith náníl fáth ar bith go mbeadh Gaeltarra ag bagairt ar an Rialtas mar nuair a tháinig mise isteach mar Aire ceann de na céad rudaí a rinne mé ná Bille a thabhairt isteach, leasú ar Bhille a bhí ann cheana i gcaoi go mbeadh siad in ann suas le £50 mil-liún a chaitheamh le tionscail a chur ar bun agus le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil. Chuir an Teachta Deasy ceist chomh maith faoi laghdú na ndeontaisí do Ghaeltarra.  Anuraidh don bhliain seo caite bhí méadú £1,259,000 ar an gcaipiteal a fuair siad an bhliain roimhe sin.  Dá bhrí sin tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag déanamh faillí ar bith maidir le airgead a chur ar fáil do Ghaeltarra le tionscail a bhunú sna Gaeltachtaí.  Caithimíd a bheith fírinneach agus an méid seo a rá agus sílim gurb é seo an rud atá á rá ag Gaeltarra chomh maith ins an tuarascáil maidir leis na cúrsaí seo: go bhfuil deacracht acu tionscail a mhealladh isteach.</P>
      <P>Bhí an deacracht sin ann i gcónaí ar ndóigh&mdash;deacracht acu oiread tionscal agus ba mhaith leo a mhealladh chuig na Gaeltachtaí.  Ba mhaith linn ar ndóigh, chuile dhuine againn, go mbeadh lánfhostaíocht ins na Gaeltachtaí.  Sin an aidhm atá againn agus mura mbeimid in ann an fhostaíocht a chur ar fáil ins na Gaeltachtaí ní bheidh muintir na Gaeltachta sásta fanacht ins na Gaeltachtaí.  Ní hé amháin fostaíocht ach fostaíocht a bhéas taithneamhach, fostaíocht a mbeidh muintir na Gaeltachta sásta cloí leis agus sásta a dhul ag plé leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tháinig cuid mhaith tionscal chuig na Gaeltachtaí agus cé gur mhaith ann iad bhí cuid acu nár fhan ró-fhada agus b'fhearr dá mbeadh muid in ann cloi leis na hacmhainní nádúrtha, mar adúirt cuid de na Teachtaí, agus rudaí a bheadh buan a chur ar aghaidh ins na Gaeltachtaí in áit a bheith ag brath anmhór ar thionscail a thagann isteach agus nach bhfanann ró-fhada agus a im-íonn leo taréis scaithimh.  Thárla sé sin san am atá caite, tá sé ag tárlú anois, agus ní thaithníonn sé sin le duine ar bith <Col N="1055" /> nuair atá airgead an Stáit i gceist go mbeadh daoine ag cleasaíocht agus ag greadadh leo nuair atá na deontaisí fáighte acu.  Níl sé furast i gcónaí a theacht thart ar na cúrsaí sin ach tá mé cinnte ins an am atá romhainn go mbeidh an tÚdarás níos áirdeallaí i gcúr-sai mar sin agus go bhféachfaidh siad le rudai a chur chun cinn a bhéas níos buaine ná cuid de na tionscail a bhí againn go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Dúradh nach bhfuil chuile dhuine sásta leis na limistéir thoghcháin.  Luaigh an Teachta Conaghan agus cúpla Teachtaí eile é seo.  Ní thig liom é a thógáil orthu go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh a thuilleadh áiteanna a fháil do Dhún na nGall nó do Chorcaigh nó do Chon-nacht no cibé áit i.  Ach rud amháin, níl tairbhe in Údarás a bheith an-mhór, is fearr a oibreoidh coiste nach mbeidh an iomarca ball air.  Rinneamar iarracht cothrom na Feinne a thabhairt do gach áit; tá a fhios againn nach dtig linn iad go léir a shásamh ach rinnemar ár ndicheall na suíocháin a roinnt amach chomh cothrom agus a b'fhéidir linn é. Tá argóint i gContae na Mí go bhfuil siad ag dul isteach le Connacht; tá argóint ag muintir Mhaigh Eo gur cheart doibh suiochán da gcuid féin a bheith acu, agus tá an scéal céanna fíor i gCiar-rai, agus dar ndoigh tá na hoileáin, mar a luaigh mé cheana ag dúil le hionadaíocht.  B'fhéidir, nuair a bheidh comhaltaí á n-ainmniú, go bhféadfaimid na háiteanna a dháileadh amach i gcaoi is go mbeidh cothromaíocht le fáil ag na Gaeltachtaí go léir ar an Údarás. B'fhéidir nach mbeidh sé sin furasta ar chor ar bith ach sin smaoineamh a rith liom féin, má fheicimid Gaeltacht mhór ar bith nach bhfuil ionadaíocht aici nuair a bheidh na baill á dtoghadh go bhféadfaimid freastal orthu ar a gcaoi sin.</P>
    <P>Ní shílim go bhfuil tada eile le rá agam faoi na cúrsaí seo.  Sílim go bhfuil athchoimriú réasúnta déanta agam ar an méid a dúradh anseo.  Beimid ag súil nach gcuirfear mórán moille ar an mBil-le agus go mbeimid in ann é a chur os comhair na Dála agus an tSeanaid chomh luath agus is féidir é i gcaoi go mbeimid in ann leanúint ar aghaidh leis na toghcháin i gcomhair an Údaráis go <Col N="1056" /> luath san bhliain atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Arís ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh le chuile dhuine a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht, agus tá súil le Dia agam go bhfeicfimid buntáiste agus tairbhe don Ghaeltacht de bharr an Bhille seo.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> The provisions of the Bill are explained in the memorandum which was circulated to Deputies on 7 November.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the upward revision of the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of grants and payments of a capital nature which can be made by and to the Industrial Development Authority.  It is also proposed in the Bill to raise the limits, which may not be exceeded without prior Government approval, on various grants which the authority may make to an individual undertaking. The opportunity is also being availed of to introduce a minor technical amendment to the statutory provisions governing the authority's powers to operate superannuation schemes.</P>
    <P>The limit on the aggregate amount of grants and payments of a capital nature which may be made by the authority, and on the aggregate amount of grants which may be paid by the Minister to the authority for this purpose out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, was increased to £400 million in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Development (No. 2) Act, 1975.  The total amount of capital issued to the authority to the end of 1977 was almost £317 million and the authority's capital allocation for 1978 is £69.75 million.  It is, therefore, again necessary to amend the statutory limits in order to enable the authority to continue to discharge their functions after the end of this year.  It is proposed in the Bill to raise the limits on aggregate expenditure of a capital nature by the authority and on the aggregate amount of grants which may be paid to the authority by the Minister to £750 million.  These higher limits will permit the authority to carry out their functions for a further three years or so.</P>
    <P>The limit, which may not be exceeded without the approval of the Government, on the total amount of grants which the Industrial Development Authority may make to a particular undertaking towards the cost of fixed assets purchased or leased and towards the cost of factory rents was raised to £850,000 by the Industrial Development Act, 1975.</P>
    <P>Because of the continuing impact of both domestic and imported inflation on <Col N="1058" /> the cost of fixed assets, an increasing number of projects would have to be submitted for the approval of the Government, if the present limit were to remain unchanged.  To avoid prolonging the period of negotiation with the promoters of what could not be regarded as major projects, it is proposed to raise the limit to £1.25 million.</P>
    <P>The limit on the amount of grants which the IDA may make, without prior Government approval, towards the cost of fixed assets purchased or leased by an industrial undertaking for re-equipment, modernisation or expansion was also raised to £850,000 by the 1975 Act.  For reasons similar to those which I have already outlined, the Bill proposes to increase this limit also to £1.25 million.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1977 there was no legislative limit on the amount of training grants which the IDA could make.  The Industrial Development Act, 1977, however, provided for a limit of £850,000 on the amount of such grants which the authority might make, without prior Government approval, to an individual undertaking.  Training grants will continue to be an important component in the authority's overall range of incentives.  Moreover, training grants now constitute a very valuable incentive in the authority's programme for the encouragement of suitable service industries to locate here.  I consider that the statutory limit on training grants should be kept at the same level as the limit applicable to capital grants.  It is, therefore, proposed in the Bill to increase to £1.25 million the limit on training grants which the authority may make without prior Government approval.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969, empowers the IDA to operate a staff superannuation scheme, subject to Ministerial approval.  As the provisions of this section may debar the IDA from operating a widows' and children's pension scheme, I propose to remove this limitation on the authority's powers by the amendment of section 27.</P>
    <P>About this time last year the House had a full and what I consider to have been a very useful and constructive debate on the activities of the Industrial <Col N="1059" /> Development Authority.  The present Bill is a technical one and is much more limited in scope than the legislation which we were then discussing. Nonetheless I intend to use this occasion to outline to the House the progress which has been made in implementing the provisions of the 1977 Act and in general to provide a quick review of the authority's activities over the past year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that it now appears that the authority will exceed by a significant margin its job approvals target of 27,000 for 1978.  This target represented the most ambitious annual level of job commitments which the authority ever aimed to secure.  Significant and encouraging as this achievement is, there can be no question of the authority resting on its laurels.  In its industrial plan for the years 1977-80, published in April 1978, the authority set itself the challenge of creating 49,500 new grant-aided jobs in the period.  This in turn would necessitate the negotiation during the four-year period of the plan, of industrial and service projects which would have the potential to provide over 100,000 jobs at full production.  In addition to adopting regional strategies, the plan embodies a programmed approach to the development of selected sectors with good growth potential, with particular emphasis on the development of natural resource based industry.  A key element in the plan is the objective of securing over half the new job commitments from within Ireland.  The plan is an interim one and has been the subject of extensive discussions with a wide range of interested parties throughout the country.  It is currently being revised and a new blueprint incorporating some significant new features and, more importantly, higher job targets will be published in the new year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Industrial Development Act, 1977, provided for a new kind of incentive to encourage the establishment of new industrial projects by persons having the necessary qualifications and experience but who would be unable to raise the necessary finance to put the project on a sound <Col N="1060" /> commercial footing.  The enterprise development programme, as it is named, was launched by the IDA in January 1978 and I am pleased to say that the response to date has been very encouraging. Nineteen projects with a total job creation potential of 850 have already been approved for grant assistance, and worth-while inquires are continuing to be received at a steady rate.</P>
    <P>The promoters of the projects already approved for grant assistance come from a variety of backgrounds&mdash;from university, banking, manufacturing and semi-State&mdash;and have individual skills and experience in such diverse areas as management, production, finance, research and marketing.  These first-time entrepreneurs have shown a true spirit of economic patriotism by giving up well-paid and secure jobs to begin a new manufacturing operation, and in so do-ing are active participants in the Government's job creation drive.  When introducing the Bill this time last year I said that the enterprise development programme was intended as an experiment. I am now satisfied that the response to the programme demonstrates that there are many people of adventure and enterprise in the country who under this programme can establish and direct viable enterprises.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Act also gave new powers to the authority to promote the restructuring of Irish industry.  A committee representative of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, CTT, Fóir Teoranta and the IDA has been established to help administer this imaginative measure.  The aim of the programme is to encourage amalgamations or acquisitions within selected in-dustrial sectors and thereby reduce wasteful competition between firms, strengthen sectoral bases, secure home market sales against imports and develop export potential.  There have not been any dramatic results to date, but the behind-the-scenes work is in progress and in time I have no doubt that this programme will prove to be a most effective instrument of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say a few words about the authority's programme of advance <Col N="1061" /> factory construction.  At present the authority is drawing up plans for a new programme comprising small, medium and large scale advance factories and cluster units to be completed in the period to mid-1980.  On 22 September I announced the first phase of this programme and I expect to be in a position to announce a further &ldquo;batch&rdquo; of factories shortly, as soon as the preliminary design and planning work is completed.  The advance factory is an important weapon in our industrial development armoury at the national level.  It is particularly suited to certain types of project particularly those in the electronics field which can get into production rapidly once the investment decision has been taken.  It is a facility which is increasingly being offered by our competitors for mobile international investment.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress, however, that it is only one in our very wide battery of incentives and other factors may be more critical in deciding the location of a project.  A town which is not &ldquo;allocated&rdquo; an advance factory under this programme should not feel that it is being neglected as a possible location for suitable new industry.  In many cases a promoter will prefer to build his own factory, towards which there are exceptionally generous grants available. Equally in many cases the authority will agree to build a special factory tailored to the needs of the particular project. The crucial factor is that there should be a suitable site available for the prospective project.  To this end the authority has built up a land bank of nearly 4,000 acres which is available for industrial development.  The IDA is always prepared to consider purchasing additional sites where these are available and suitable for industrial development purposes.  Industrial promoters can thereby be offered sites with outline planning permission for industry and many of the delays associated with land purchase are avoided.</P>
    <P>Having described the provisions of the Bill and briefly reviewed the authority's activities over the past year, I accordingly recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This party, as the party which was the major component of a Government which established the Industrial Development Authority, and which did it in face of a political opposition that belittled that innovation, welcome this Bill and would like to express, through myself and other speakers who will follow, their appreciation of and admiration for the efforts which the Industrial Development Authority have made in contributing to the economic growth of this country.  Naturally we have no objection to this Bill.  We never have opposed the State's support to this authority, which has been responsible effectively for changing the face of Irish society and of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>I will have a fair number of things to say about the Industrial Development Authority, about their efforts, about the background against which they must make these efforts, about the forces with which they have to deal and which they name, in their various reports and projections, as being constraints on industrial development.  Accordingly, I have no hope of finishing what I want to say this evening because we have ten minutes only left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to put into perspective the proposal which this Bill embodies I should like to say that it is almost doubling the amount of grants and assistance which the Industrial Development Authority will have afforded by the end of this year as compared with when it was instituted approximately 20 years ago.  It proposes to increase the maximum from £400 million to £750 million. While I know a lot of rhetoric goes on in this House from which ever side happens to be in Opposition about the small number of minutes devoted to discussing handing out immense quantities of money I have to say that the Minister's speech&mdash;I hope he will not take this personally; I know quite well it has been put into his hand&mdash;is a very inadequate account of the sort of expenditure which the Industrial Development Authority foresee over the next three years.  The Industrial Development Authority are spending in this year a little less than £70 million.  The Minister, without any explanation whatsoever, although this <Col N="1063" /> speech of his purports to be a review, even if a brief one, of the IDA's operations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No one is going to complain about the Minister devoting a page or two in his speech to a Bill which will authorise the handing out of a further £350 million.  Those may be small sums to the Minister of State but they are very large sums to ordinary people.  I expect the Minister to tell us in some detail how the Authority proposes to involve themselves in commitments over the next&mdash;as he puts it&mdash;three years or so of about £350,000,000.  I realise that they have spent £70 million this year and that the amounts of their disbursements have been increasing all the time.  Even allowing for some increase, it is a pretty staggering and steep increase, really more proportionate to a time of severe inflation and recession to suppose that we are going to absorb another £350 million&mdash;which very nearly equals the total amount disbursed by the IDA in 20 years&mdash;over the next three years.</P>
      <P>I do not want the House to mis-understand me.  I would never oppose spending money on industrial investment and job creation and I hope the Minister understands that I am not doing so&mdash;far from it.  I should like to see twice as much money spent on job creation.  I hope the Minister will not regard this as a personal criticism made in any cantankerous sense but I am complaining that we are given no indication of the kind of investment on which the IDA expect to spend this gigantic sum of money over the next three years.  If what the Minister has in mind is the likely demand on the IDA for very substantial assistance of a kind not so far envisaged in a smelter, let him say so.  What is the secret about it?  Politicians on all sides have been making headlines about smelters for the past three or four years. What is so special about this project that forbids the Minister to tell us that this very large sum may be needed in order to meet the Authority's likely involvement in this very expensive project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> He would have had no opposition from me.  I take it for granted he would have more from the Labour Party who have been pressing very hard for the establishment of a smelter and the processing of our own natural resources.  Why cannot we be told something about this aspect of the Authority's expectations?  The smelter as a job creating project&mdash;this is a point I may return to the next time this Bill is under discussion&mdash;is not really a very hot property because the number of jobs it would generate compared with the immense investment that will be required for it is very small.  As I said a couple of weeks ago, the amount of employment which can directly be expected from this smelter is roughly one-third of the employment which was thrown away in Ferenka when it closed just a year ago.  I do not want anybody to run away with the wrong idea.  I fear it is one that has been propagated and I am not saying necessarily by the Minister of State's party; in fact I must give them credit for having sounded warning notes about this.  I do not want anybody to get the idea that this smelter project, if that essentially is what the £350 million is for, or what the margin between the nor-mal likely expenditure and £350 million is required for, will solve all our employment problems or even a large part of them.  It will not; it will not make any visible difference in that regard.  It will scarcely make a hiccup or bump in the employment figures.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to suppose from that either that I am cribbing about giving the IDA money for industrial development or that I have anything against a smelter&mdash;far from it.  I am in favour of both things but I would be even more in favour of the Minister telling the House in something more generous than the three lines he devoted to the topic, on what exactly the IDA expect to spend this £350 million.  I do not mean this as a personal reflection on the Minister or the official behind him but I think we are becoming a little casual about voting money and authorising expenditure here when a Minister can produce a proposal of this kind in which there is almost a doubling of a 20-year grant record and the House is seriously <Col N="1065" /> expected to accept it in three lines of a seven page speech.</P>
    <P>I have only three minutes left and I want to mention for the Minister's benefit a couple of topics which occur to me which are made immediately relevant by things he has said in his speech.  First, he says:</P>
    <P>In addition to adopting regional strategies, the plan embodies a programmed approach to the development sectors with good growth potential, with particular emphasis on the development of natural resource based industry.</P>
    <P>I hope to deal with the natural resources in some detail later.  These are the very areas in which, partly through Government mismanagement and partly through the creation of a climate which is the reverse of the one we need and partly through slackness in guarding Irish national interests at European level, the natural resources sector has taken some body blows over recent months.  I cannot understand the Minister who has the ear of the nation, who has the first words and the last words and who could have come here on this Bill with a 100 page speech had he so wished, talking about concentration on the natural resource based industry in less than a single line when within the last month we have seen the difficulties in which the leather industry and the timber industry are.  These are natural resources, not glamorous or trendy ones of the kind that people who have never seen a lump of zinc, bronze or copper in their lives imagine, but they are real natural resources, hides and timber, things which grow here thanks to the rainfall and the kind of soil we have.  Any policy which would deprive these things of the title &ldquo;natural resources&rdquo; does not deserve the name.  In their manifesto Fianna Fáil promised to provide tens of thousands of secure jobs from natural resources.  The Minister of State will find that in the manifesto; I cannot remember the page reference; I did not expect to advert to the manifesto of his party so early in the debate.  He will find that he himself was elected and got his very large vote&mdash;on which I congratulate <Col N="1066" /> him&mdash;on a manifesto which included the following sentence:</P>
    <P>There are tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created in the natural resource field.</P>
    <P>When I find this unconsidered bland reference to the natural resource based strategy of the IDA, a sector in which there has been disaster on the industrial front within the past month, I ask myself if he and his Department and his absent chief have their feet on the ground at all.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Food Subsidies: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Cluskey on Tuesday, 14 November 1978:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the stated policy of the Government to phase out food subsidies, regards the effects of such a policy on the cost of living generally and in particular on the living standards of the poor, the underprivileged and large families as most retrogressive, and calls on the Government to review its policy intentions on this grave issue of national concern.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;deplores the mismanagement of the economy in the period 1973-1977 which resulted in the need for food subsidies and approves the dynamic programme being implemented by the Government since 1977 to rectify this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak to the motion and the amendment.  The motion, which is in the name of the Labour Party, states that Dáil Éireann deplores the stated policy of the Government to phase out food subsidies.  I am not aware where it has been stated that it is the Government's policy to phase out food subsidies.  I can only repeat what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development stated here last night, that he can find no statement declaring this. If he cannot find it there is no point in my looking for it.  The Labour Party are reacting to headlines that appear from time to time in the newspapers.  Newspapers are in the business of selling newspapers and not for creating opposition in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Briefly, there is no stated policy of the Government to phase out these food subsidies.  If the Labour Party and Deputy Cluskey are sincere in their expressions of care for the less privileged in our society, the widows, orphans, old age pensioners and the less well off, who are the greatest concern of all of us, then Deputy Cluskey and the Labour Party are at one with all of us in looking forward to the time when we can do even better for those underprivileged sections. I put it to the Labour Party that if they are sincere in what we heard last night from Deputy Cluskey when he cried salt, crocodile tears, as somebody described it, he should join with us in looking at an expenditure in the region of £56 million to £57 million to see that any saving in that huge sum of money&mdash;which this House has the responsibility to see spent to the best advantage&mdash;is seen to get the best results. That is no more than we on the Govern-ment side are doing.  It is clearly stated that the Green Paper is no more than a review of expenditure.  Any good business management would demand that from time to time you look at your policies to see if anywhere there may be a going off course which must be corrected and to review the expenditure which has taken place and the results of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsidies across the board, in this case food subsidies, are non-discriminatory <Col N="1068" /> but they benefit the rich more than they benefit the poor, and it is the poor about whom we are all so concerned in this House.  If we are true to our principles, then the Labour Party and the Members on the Opposition benches should join with us in that review to see whether we can redirect some of those vast resources into the areas where we would like to see more money spent.  The results of Fianna Fáil policy down the years show clearly that we are more concerned than any other political party for the care of the less well off sections.  The people in that bracket know that full well, and they have always looked to us to cushion them against any rising cost of living and any hardship that they have to incur. They know that we are there at all times and we have shown this concern time and time again.  In this House I have heard the record of the Coalition Government being tossed out.  They were the only people to increase social welfare to any great extent, but they increased it at the time when inflation was running at 25 per cent, when the prices spiral had gone mad.  The people who voted Fianna Fáil back into Government in 1977 know full well that the increases that we gave them would help them very much more.  They knew that the £ in their pocket would buy more because inflation was reduced.  They knew that under a Fianna Fáil administration they would be looked after.</P>
    <P>Apparently Deputy Cluskey preferred to welcome the amendment of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  He did so because he could not spell out why he wanted food subsidies retained to help the rich rather than the poor.  He preferred to play the old long-playing record of what the National Coalition achieved from 1973 to 1977.  He said he welcomed that amendment because he wanted to analyse the record of the present Government in office.  He, like everyone else on the Opposition benches, failed to get the real message that the people delivered in 1977, that the Coalition had failed dismally to take this country through rough and difficult times.  We do not deny that there was a recession during that period, but it is ironic that for <Col N="1069" /> the third time we had crisis after crisis when the National Coalition were in power.  This time it was the Arabs who had to carry the can.  All through that time we heard repeated, &ldquo;We can do nothing about this and about that; the oil crisis is responsible for everything and we are unable to steer the ship on a difficult course&rdquo;.  The people knew full well that this ship could be steered along a better course, but the men, the leadership and the commitment were not there to see us through difficult times. The people knew full well that the Coalition had failed dismally.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Cluskey said that the Fianna Fáil manifesto was the most unpatriotic document that he had seen produced by an Irish Government.  He failed to get the message of the electorate. He is still living in wonderland. The electorate delivered the message but the Opposition do not want to get it.  The message was that the people wanted to return a Government who could restore their self-respect and give them back the confidence to manage their own affairs, and they elected the Government who were prepared to do just that.  We set out in that manifesto what our planned programme was.  The people knew full well what Fianna Fáil were talking about.  They can look at our record since we came into Government.  Deputy Cluskey sought to go through that record in an effort to punch selective holes in it.  He also tried to criticise their own record, apart from blaming the Arabs for all the problems that were created, yet he turned around and said, &ldquo;We did a good job after all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If a good job results in pursuance of the policies which resulted in giving us runaway prices in spirals, inflation that topped 25 per cent, unemployment that reached 128,000&mdash;the highest ever recorded in the history of the State&mdash;if the Arabs can be blamed for all that, and if that is the record of which they are proud, fair enough.  The longer they rely on that record the longer they will stay on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    <P>The real problem was that the message was delivered and they were not prepared to listen to it.</P>

      <P>No.  He had 12 minutes left.  I will come in a few minutes to the job that he made of it last night. He did not have so very much to say and the few problems he tried to raise will be answered in due course in the debate.</P>
      <P>That is the record that the main Opposition speaker last night tried to defend. He came along to their present record, picking out selective items.  He said we should take, for instance, the rates abolition.  I will take the rates abolition. The Labour Party produced Opposition speaker after speaker on the abolition of rates.  I do not know whether they were for or against it.  When a division was challenged they could produce only nine Deputies to vote against the abolition of rates.  I doubt the sentiments behind that operation because, if they were sincere in opposing the abolition of rates, they would have been here in numbers for that division.</P>
      <P>He then went on to say every county council was short of money, that there was a curtailment of services, and that any Deputy who is a member of a local authority could vouch for what he was saying.  I am a member of a local authority and I am a Member of this House.  While I cannot speak for every county, I can speak for my own county. There has been an increase in the allocation of money for housing to Longford County Council and there is an embarrassment of money in Longford County Council.  Despite the fact that local authority engineers are working to rule, which may curtail some of the expenditure, nevertheless it was most unlikely that we would have been able to spend it all before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment stated that £530 million was allocated to local authorities this year which was £100 million more than was allocated in <Col N="1071" /> 1977.  If that is evidence of a curtailment in services.  I cannot follow Deputy Cluskey's logic.  I have seen it printed in the national newspapers that in Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation they had a surplus of cash in the region of £2 or £3 million not very long ago.  I do not know where Deputy Cluskey gets his arguments.  I deal in facts and they are the facts as I see them.  Nobody can deny them here or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole referred to chaos in the youth employment scheme.  I do not know where he gets his facts.  I do not know whether he is living in wonderland or in cuckoo-land.  In environmental schemes alone 2,000 jobs were created by 30 September of this year.  I referred in a previous debate to the work experience programme initiated by the Department of Labour because I felt young people were crying out for such a programme.  We see pages and pages of advertisements for jobs in papers but young people are shot down when they see that experience is necessary.  This work experience programme started in the first week of September so far as I remember.  Already 947 people have been placed in employment and there are 460 places waiting to be filled.  That is a fair record for any Minister for Labour and his Department.</P>
    <P>I am told there is a lack of demand for some jobs.  It may well be that some young people today are not particularly interested in the jobs available.  They are entitled to their views.  It is our responsibility to get them employment which will reward them and in which they will be happy.  I would say to young people: &ldquo;Where there is a job, take it.  It may not be the job you want, or the job you would like, but take it and move on from there and you will be the better for it.&rdquo;  I started to earn my living after the recession in the fifties.  I took many jobs.  I am in this job now and I intend to stay here for a while.  When young people go for interviews they find out very quickly there is more admiration for them if they have a job even if it is far removed from the career they intend to pursue eventually.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> The Department of Education produced 1,100 jobs&mdash;perhaps short term and temporary&mdash;to ensure that the abilities and energies of our young people are not wasted.  The young people of Ireland are our best national resource.  I heard Deputy Kelly talking about national resources before he left the House.  Let us use our young people, their energies and their idealism, and motivate them to earn a living instead of walking around in a carefree fashion until the specific job for which they are looking turns up.</P>
    <P>Our youth employment scheme is well on target and we are proud to stand over its record.  We are proud to stand over all our records since we took office.  We planned our approach and we know where we are going and how we will get there.  The people are fully behind us, even more so than when they elected us. Last September or October I read in an opinion poll that the popularity of the Opposition had dropped further than it was after their humiliating defeat in June 1977.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that Deputy O'Toole did not use the 12 minutes he had left.  I commend him on agreeing with the Minister that food subsidies should not remain a permanent feature of our economy.  He questioned when was the right time to start phasing them out.  He did not think this was the right time because he considered there is still a lot of poverty around.  We all know that.  He threw out a figure of somewhere in the region of 500 or 600 medical cards being withdrawn in Mayo.  That indicates either one of two things to me.  The withdrawal of medical cards is a significant pointer to a rising standard of living. If that number of medical cards were withdrawn, I can only assume the standard of living of these people has risen above the qualifying figure.  Was it something more sinister?  Maybe they should not have been issued in the first place.  Were they part of the price paid to win the Mayo by-election?  I do not know.  I am sure Deputy O'Toole and other Mayo Deputies will ensure that those medical cards are restored if the people from whom they were withdrawn are justly entitled to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> The Opposition never got the message. They sat back and let the learned men of the press take up the cudgels for them because they felt it incumbent on them to provide opposition when the Opposition were so lacking in knowledge about how to attack Government policy. Time and time again we have seen a reaction to the headlines in newspapers. Private Members' Motions were put down on the Order Paper.  I can only assume that the learned gentlemen of the press feel it their duty to oppose the Government since the Opposition are failing so dismally in their duty.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Deputy Cluskey's unpatriotic comments about our manifesto.  It is far more unpatriotic for the Opposition to enjoy the industrial problems which are now starting to loom up on the horizon.  I do not think people of Ireland will commend them for that.  They seem to enjoy the fact that the Government are facing serious problems here, there and everywhere.  I regard that as being totally unpatriotic. Would it not be much more appropriate that they would tell us how they think the country should be run if they do not agree with what we are doing?  I would prefer that they would bring their views to bear on those various people who might be described as armchair gentlemen who do nothing but frustrate the problems confronting us.  Ireland is at a crossroads and we have the responsibility of sending out loud and clear the message that our country has a great future.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised that there are people here who are working in what they consider to be the best interest of everybody.  I have no wish to hear Deputy Cluskey or anybody else quote from tatty newspaper clippings or from various forecasters.  It would be better that we would hear about the true position and about where we are going from here.  We know what the forecasters have been saying during the past few months about our programme.  We know that the ESRI report and also the Central Bank, which is supposed to be the be-all and the end-all so far as forecasting is concerned, disagreed totally with the forecasts of our Minister for <Col N="1074" /> Economic Planning and Development. However, we find now that both these institutions are endeavouring to retrace their steps and to produce figures that are a good deal closer to the Minister's figures.  It gives me great pleasure to be able to say that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is the best forecaster not only in this House but in the whole country.  He is the only man who has produced the figures that add up at the end of the day.  Should his figures prove wrong we would no doubt have much howling for his blood from the people opposite but he cannot be faulted on the planned programme he produced for our further development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey told us last evening that according to the best sources available the forceast in economic growth for next year is 3½ per cent.  I wonder if those sources are anything like the ones which three or four months ago produced an economic growth rate of 5½ per cent.  But we will leave it to the good sense of the people to decide who to believe at the end of the day.  The Minister forecast a 7 per cent growth rate while others put the rate at 5 per cent.  Now these other people are talking in terms of 6 per cent and I suppose that within a couple of weeks they will have changed the figure to 7 per cent.  Deputy O'Toole in a reference to the creation of 20,000 jobs said last night that we would need to produce 1,500 jobs per week between now and Christmas&mdash;a total of 9,000 jobs.  Is the Deputy not giving us credit for having created more than 11,000 jobs in the past year?  Perhaps he was only trying to boost the morale of his party.  Most of the 20,000 jobs have been produced and in this context I have dealt with the question of youth employment.</P>
    <P>We promised to reduce inflation to about 7 per cent but we find that the figure is even lower.  When we realise that in the previous three to four years the rates in this respect varied between 18 and 25 per cent we appreciate the improvement in this area.  It is a policy that has resulted in all these improvements that the Labour Party are endeavouring to tear to pieces.  I deal only in facts, not in what other people say.  The Labour <Col N="1075" /> Party said that because we were responsible for a consumer boom we would have balance of payments problems in a very short time.  I would remind them that the balance of payments' situation is also on target.  It is time the people opposite got down to the job of being an opposition and formed their own policies instead of relying on forecasters and various other people.  It is only natural that people in the newspaper business are interested in selling papers and will produce the sensational story but it is too bad when an Opposition rely for their criticism on newspaper reports.  There is no point in recalling again what transpired during the three or four years this party were out of office. The people have no wish to be reminded of those times, as they indicated clearly in the last election.</P>
    <P>I never thought that I would hear somebody say in this House that a programme that is proving so successful is unpatriotic and especially after that programme had been endorsed to such an extent by the people.  The person who makes that sort of allegation is the one who is unpatriotic and must know that he is being hypocritical.</P>
    <P>It is time that the real patriotism was brought out in the Irish people.  They displayed their patriotism at the last election when their message was that &ldquo;we are proud of our nation and are not prepared to tolerate a situation in which we are told that nothing can be done about the various problems that confront us&rdquo;.  Our people will live up to their responsibilities if we give the necessary leadership.  It is our task to motivate the people.  It is time that we stopped looking to the orchestra to call the next tune and that we stopped praising the band without knowing the name of the tune they were playing.  What we need is a new release of inspiration and idealism that will motivate our people into building on the solid foundation that we have today.  In this way we can build a more prosperous nation in which both we and our children can enjoy a secure standard of living.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude with the words of Terence MacSwiney: &ldquo;How we work today <Col N="1076" /> will determine how we live tomorrow.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I must confess to being somewhat speechless in admiration for Deputy Reynolds because there are few new Members of this House who can speak to a motion without referring once to that motion and without, in this case, referring to food subsidies despite the fact that the issue before the House is the question of food subsidies.  Fair due to Terence MacSwiney, we can hardly hold him responsible for the introduction or abolition of food subsidies. The Deputy achieved a record: not once was he found out of order.

      <P>I was out of the country on official business.  Reading last night's debate reminded me of the words used by the late Seán Dunne&mdash;&ldquo;There are more Ministers who talked themselves out of Leinster House than talked themselves into it.&rdquo;  I think he was right.  I have a premonition that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, is about to join that celebrated band of ex-Ministers if he is not very careful about the vein of his contributions in this House.</P>
      <P>One has to make a prediction about the question of food subsidies, that is, that the Minister will not get his way and his approach in the celebrated articles he wrote in <i>Business and Finance</i> before he became a Minister in which he outlined how to cut various aspects of public expenditure will not be followed by the rest of the Cabinet.  All the indications are that he will probably be defined as the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Brian Lenihan, defined him: He is a very fine man but he is best kept in another room working out statistics while we get on with the business of the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> I predict that food subsidies will not be phased out.  This has been an isolated quirk of a reduction of public expenditure thought up by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and eventually floated into a Green Paper which was treated with scant attention by most members of the Cabinet. They would have had more time for it if it had been a White Paper but since it was only a Green Paper it was obviously off-the-cuff, covering clawbacks, children's allowances, various aspects of higher education grants and food subsidies. Talking to members of the Fianna Fáil Party I find they do not take the Minister for Economic Planning and Development too seriously.  Deputy Reynolds is the only glorious exception in the Fianna Fáil backbenches I could find.</P>
    <P>This is the reality of the situation. What does one find in relation to food subsidies?  The Cabinet are making up their minds what they should do about this proposition which is being floated by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  This so-called option&mdash;a new word used in Irish economics; everything today is an option, there is no such thing as a decision or an idea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What do we find in relation to this glorious option?  We find that the urban and rural representative organisations are totally opposed to such abolition and there is a very substantial body of political opinion opposed to it.  I will give some examples. There is not one trade union in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which would agree for a minute with the Minister on the question of food subsidies.  A respected national agricultural organisation, namely the IAOS, in their submis-sion to the Minister on the Green Paper disagreed completely on the question of food subsidies and said they should not be phased out.  I am not necessarily a devotee of the IFA nor am I their spokesman, but the IFA and the ICMSA are totally opposed to the abolition of food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> Is there any comfort to be found anywhere for the Minister in relation to this proposition?  One can examine the various comments made by the different political correspondents, always assumed to be on the side of the Opposition, as Deputy Reynolds wrongly assumed. I have not found one political correspondent in favour of the abolition of food subsidies on an objective analysis.  I have found only one parliamentary correspondent, Mr. Bruce Arnold of <i>The Irish Times</i> who obliquely favours the line followed by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not found in this debate tonight one Fianna Fáil Deputy who favours the course of action being followed by the Minister.  Deputy Reynolds spoke eloquently for 30 minutes and I must confess I share a good deal of his views about economic affairs generally but never once did he refer to food subsidies or support the Minister.  Could we have from the Minister or any Fianna Fáil backbencher an indication of support for the Minister in regard to this proposition?  I am afraid the answer is that there is precisely none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will leave the national representative organisations and look at work of a research nature which has been done.  I refer to the various reports of the National Prices Commission.  In these reports objective rational analyses have been carried out on the question of the nutritional intake of certain sectors of <Col N="1079" /> the population, notably elderly people, pensioners and so on.  All these reports point out that the elderly and large families proportionately spend a much higher percentage of their income on food such as bread and milk, which are subsidised.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there has been no defence by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy of the attitude of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  They exist in two separate worlds even though the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is responsible for food subsidies.  That Minister could be described as &ldquo;Mitcher O'Malley&rdquo; because he disappears over the horizon when it comes to food subsidies. He knows that as far as the Cabinet are concerned the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is out on a limb.  At the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting last week Deputy Flynn started sawing off that limb, and it will be well and truly hacked off by the time the budget is introduced. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development will be left sitting on that limb without his policy being implemented by the Fianna Fáil Party. That is the reality.  If ever there was a political party of reality it is Fianna Fáil. We accept that.</P>
    <P>One must use one's political hazel rod in trying to divine the reasons why the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is in favour of such abolition. I refer to the celebrated &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; article published in the <i>Sunday Press</i> on 12 November last.  The Minister answered a series of questions probably put to him by telephone from Seán Cryan.  It is stated: &ldquo;O'Donoghue Looks for the Middle Class&rdquo;.  He had better not say that too frequently in Foxrock.  He was the darling of the middle class in Killiney when he told them about the wealth tax and many Fine Gael people voted for him in the constituency I represent. You should hear what they are saying now about his views on the middle class.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the Government were not prepared in their manifesto or in their political decisions in the budget or during the past 12 months to apply that principle in any of the following instances.  Was that principle applied to the wealth tax or to car tax?  No.  If a person had five cars up to 16 horse power, the tax was removed. Was that principle applied to capital gains?  No.  Was there any relativity of income?  None whatsoever.  Was that principle applied in the derating of a cottage in Kerry or a millionaire's house in Foxrock?  No.  Was it applied to the £1,000 grant for first-time buyers of new houses?  No.  Was it applied to the £600 home improvement grant?  No.  There is no relativity of income in relation to any of the previous decisions of Fianna Fáil. A person could own ten houses, all of which have now been derated without any reference to income.  A person could own 20 personal cars on all of which the tax has been removed.  There was no reference to income in regard to capital gains of £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criterion of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development must be applied to milk, butter, bread and town gas.  Here we have a means <Col N="1081" /> test.  A sum in the region of £300 million was given out in the relief of wealth tax, car tax, domestic rates and capital gains, in the £1,000 house grant and the £600 reconstruction grant.  The criterion did not apply in these cases but must apply to the £10 million subsidy on bread, butter, milk and town gas.  There is the republican party; there is the party who are concerned with the middle income group, the lower income group and the poverty section of our community.  This criterion is shattering and the Minister and the members of his party who may support his perverse theory will go down in history as the creators of an inverse means test which will apply in relation to food and food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The main beneficiaries of the relief of wealth tax are wealthy gentlemen.  It is well known that women in this country do not own the bulk of wealth; naturally it resides in the male heirs of property. The bulk of car owners are male and the bulk of rateable house owners are male. The bulk of those who get the £1,000 house grant are male and the same applies to the £600 grant for house repairs. Who are the people who own stocks and shares?  Invariably it is the male heads of households.  Food is bought by housewives and it is mothers who receive children's allowances.  Not only is there an inverse means test in operation but there is virtually a sex differentiated means test which, coming from a political party who profess a special concern for women in society, rings very hollow.</P>
    <P>Those who benefit from food subsidies are the large families, the poor and the elderly.  Proportionately they spend more of their ordinary income on food than other groups and the Minister proposes to abolish the slender benefit they now have.  I use the word &ldquo;slender&rdquo; because one would get the impression that there is a massive system of national food subsidies in operation and that the Fianna Fáil economic strategy would fall asunder overnight unless something is done about the cost of food subsidies in 1978.  We are talking about £50 million out of a national current budget expenditure of £2,500 million a year.  This is a mere 2 per cent of the <Col N="1082" /> total national budget.  Fianna Fáil are running around like a crowd of ducks caught in last night's wind trying to make up their minds about how to phase out subsidies during the next three years. I find the spectacle unedifying in relation to any Cabinet and ludicrous in terms of the current budget.</P>
    <P>Food subsidies are proportionately a very small item in the national budget.  It will not break any Minister's calculations to continue them, if necessary, for the next 20 years.  I deliberately say 20 years because these subsidies are, of course, a fixed item, an item fixed some years ago, an item which did not proportionately increase for the past two or three years.  In other words, they form a relatively small proportion of our national budget as they will again next year.  And the following year a relatively still smaller amount will be devoted to food subsidies.  The amount of the subsidy is fixed.  On the other hand, the price of bread, milk and butter when these subsidies were introduced was very much lower than it is today and so at that time the subsidies were a higher proportion of the actual price of the loaf of bread or the 1 lb. of butter.  Today, relatively speaking, the subsidy is a declining element, as it were, of the actual price.  Today, Fianna Fáil, in their wisdom, and simply because the Minister for Economic Planning and Development was so bereft of any alternatives designed to curb public expenditure, come forward with this proposition to remove subsidies.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night threw a question at Deputy Cluskey, a question we must in all honesty take up.  He asked do we in the Labour Party favour a general system of subsidies in the economy as a whole?  As Labour Party spokesman for the time being for Industry, Commerce and Energy, I would say we do not.  We have a very modest, restricted, tripartite system of food subsidies for a mere three food items&mdash;bread, butter and milk.  In so far as these are subsidised the subsidies should be retained.  We are not for one moment suggesting a subsidy should be introduced on meat or clothes or fruit, or that there should be a general system of subsidisation across the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> The previous Government selected three staple items of food, items of basic household expenditure, and decided to limit the subsidies to them.  That is the answer to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  Do we want subsidies extended?  The fact is the subsidies on the three items I mentioned should be increased in line with inflation. However, for the moment we are strongly and adamantly advocating the retention of the present subsidies in their present form without any emasculation of them by the Government in its coming budget.</P>
    <P>I want to stress now that it is not the desire of the Labour Party to upset in any way the prospect of rational and responsible pay negotiations.  To many people the question of food subsidies is much more than a mere £50 million.  It is much more than a Trinity professor of economics says it is in some article he wrote for <i>Business and Finance</i> before the last election, subsequently incorporated into the Green Paper and foisted on the Irish people.  I have not much time really for that kind of academic exercise.  Indeed, academics who indulge in that kind of exercise quickly find themselves without their ministerial portfolios. The country really deserves better in the context of trying to convince the ordinary trade unionist that he should act responsibly, sensitively and coherently in regard to future prospects in pay negotiations.  If the Government meddles stupidly, and unnecessarily, with food subsidies there will be a negative backlash from the trade union movement and the prospect of achieving a norm&mdash;I will not dare use Margaret Thatcher's phrase of an average because that would mean a series of settlements&mdash;either in a national pay agree-ment or by way of some responsible alternative will recede.  It will recede because the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is going about the whole matter in the most muddleheaded and irresponsible way one could possibly conceive.  There is nothing more likely to infuriate the average industrial worker who is currently paying 85 per cent of total income tax receipts than to <Col N="1084" /> find that the price he, his wife and his family have to pay every Saturday to the baker for bread and the dairyman for milk, will be substantially increased.  We would hope sincerely that the Government collectively would convert the Minister from his unsound approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Brian Lenihan, jocosely remarked that his colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, is better off in another room, looking after statistics, away from the heat of the Cabinet table.  I do not think it is the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who will decide budget strategy.  I have always had a great respect for the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is a party which does not create problems and, if you do not create problems, you do not have to have legislation.  If you do not have to have legislation, you do not create problems: you do nothing, let the country manage, muddle through.  That is the way it operates by and large.  That is the way Fianna Fáil have operated since they were returned to power&mdash;no legislative programme, no problems. &ldquo;Let us work away.  Jack is a very fine man.  We are all happy in Cork and, therefore, we are all happy in Dublin and, therefore, the country is happy and we will have a nice budget in time for the next election&rdquo;.  I would recommend that course to Fianna Fáil for one more year. I do not think it should get itself into a knot because of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>I believe sanity will prevail in the Cabinet but we are moving this motion as a democratic taking out of a stricture on the Government in the hope that sanity will prevail and in the hope that this proposed cutback in the living standards of the lower income groups will not come about and in the hope that the kind of nonsense perpetrated on this House last night will not recur, a nonsense which is becoming unduly arrogant, if I may say so, on the part of such a new Deputy, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, who shows an arrogance that bodes ill for his contributions in future and I for one, regret having to say that about a <Col N="1085" /> fellow-Deputy in my constituency.  But, quite frankly, after about 18 months of it we have just about had enough of it and I think his own Fianna Fáil Cabinet are just about having enough of it as well on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the case made by the leader of the Labour Party and the Labour Party have no hesitation in supporting this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only describe the speech made by Deputy Desmond as a great deal of bluster and bluff.  It is noticeable that the Labour Party Coalition partners are absent from the Chamber.  Even though Deputy O'Toole reported progress last night and had ten minutes left tonight he obviously did not have the heart to come in into the debate again and so Deputy Desmond's loyal colleagues sent out for reinforcements to the extent of five Labour Deputies to come in and support him.</P>
      <P>The people have shown that they are not easily taken in by the Coalition. When I was in Opposition, former Deputy Justin Keating said that we were a rotten Opposition.  I agreed that there might have been some merit in what he had said and pointed out that the Coalition were a rotten Government who were far better in Opposition and that in time the people would put them where they belonged, in Opposition, and put us in Government where we belonged.  The people did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government stated in their Green Paper that spending must be reviewed. The Minister for Economic Planning and Development said last night that the Coalition Government introduced food subsidies because of the high rate of inflation coupled with high unemployment. I assure Deputy Desmond that we in Fianna Fáil are very proud of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who has done an excellent job.  That Minister has been far more accurate in his predictions than the Coalition and some outside experts, including the Central Bank, have been.  The Central Bank upped their figure for growth only a few short weeks ago when they published their report.  We stated at <Col N="1086" /> the commencement of the year that we expected a growth of 7 per cent and it was said that this could not be achieved. We stated that the borrowing to prime the economic pump should not exceed 13 per cent of the GNP.  We were told that this was impossible.  Yet we have shown that it can be done.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Labour Party are not really against the abolition of rates on private dwellings, community halls and so on, although they voted against the Minister's Bill.  I am sure they are not against facilitating the hard hit motorist whom Deputy Tully used talk about by removing the tax from cars of under 16 horse power.  We fulfilled all these promises.  The Labour Party want to have it both ways.  They say first of all that we will introduce a tough budget, that we will take back whatever we gave in last year's budget and on the other hand they say if the budget will again increase the standards of living of the less well off, and is not severe, that it is an election budget to gain votes in the local elections and the European elections next year.  Depending on what sort of a budget we introduce they can refer to the Official Report and say that they predicted that there would be a hard budget or that it would be an election budget to cull votes.</P>
    <P>The people know how they are doing under Fianna Fáil as opposed to how they were doing under the Coalition Government.  Never in the history of the State was a Government so totally rejected. I have frequently stated that Governments are not elected but are rejected.</P>
    <P>This morning on the Order of Business the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy FitzGerald, gave a very peculiar definition of democracy, because we could use the majority which the people gave us to pass legislation on which we will be judged at the next general election and the one after and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond said that nobody had referred to food subsidies, <Col N="1087" /> and he only just referred to them. We are reviewing food subsidies.  We will not phase them out in one go.  This was acknowledged even by Deputy Cluskey last night.  We will not phase them out in two or three years.  We stated categorically in the Green Paper that we were reviewing the trends in spending because of the improvement in the economy.  These subsidies were introduced at a time of high inflation and high unemployment.  We set out to achieve 20,000 jobs, and we will achieve in excess of that.  Our youth employment scheme, which was delayed, is nevertheless on target.  By creating jobs and putting money into people's pockets the need for food subsidies has been reduced, so such subsidies will be phased out as we progress.  I am optimistic enough to appreciate that we will progress from year to year.  I am confident that the Government will not reduce the standard of living in the January budget.  I am satisfied that when the budget is introduced the people at the lower end of the scale will be in receipt of increases not just in keeping with the cost of living but in excess of it. It has always been part of our policy to increase the standards of living at the lower end of the scale.</P>
      <P>The continous attacks on the Minister for Economic Planning and Development are indicative of his success. When discussing this new Department earlier on it was said that it would take about 18 months to get off the ground.  The Minister has this Department working well ahead of that.</P>

I do not know what the plan is; I do not know how quickly we will progress but I am optimistic that our growth will continue.  It is good news to hear that we are at the top of the EEC league for growth.</P>
      <P>I sense a tremendous feeling of frustration, disappointment and a certain amount of bitterness because we have managed the country's affairs so successfully.  The Opposition, instead of telling us that we are right and that they will assist us, are trying to sow seeds of dissatisfaction but the general public know the situation.  They can remember the hardships they had to endure under the Coalition.  We have as our prime target the creation of jobs.</P>

      <P>There is very little mystery about the reasons which led the Labour Party to table this motion.  We <Col N="1089" /> believe that the options first discussed in the Green Paper, the policies later confided in cumainn in Clontarf, are mistaken ones.  It would be a mistaken policy for the Government to attempt now to pay for its election-inspired largesse of the last budget by the shabby strategy of taxing children's allowances and phasing out food subsidies.  I do not lose heart that the Government will abandon these policies and not proceed to implement them in the next budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of the same family of expenditure-cutting under discussion. The phasing out of food subsidies and taxing of children's allowances are part of the expenditure-cutting programme of the Government forced on them by their earlier largesse. They are anti-family measures proposed by a Government who made a free gift of £2,000 each to the nation's wealthiest citizens when they abolished the wealth tax.  If they are looking for the area from which they should collect this revenue I should like to direct their attention to the nation's wealthiest citizens who can well afford to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic expert of the Cabinet has already mused in public how his heart is struck by the unfairness that would follow if the subsidies were left in being.  In <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 12 November he explained to the nation that the rich benefit as well as the poor from such subsidies.  If this is his only worry about the continuation of food subsidies he could make up the revenue and ensure that only the rich would pay by taking back the tax free gift he made to the nation's wealthy people earlier this year.  I am not alone in thinking that the Government's policies are mistaken.  The trade union movement yesterday thought the same and a casualty for the Government's economic strategy next year is the fact that the trade union movement have decided to abandon talks on a national pay agreement.  Even the most faithful of the Government followers will accept that the decision of the trade unions yesterday is not in the <Col N="1090" /> best interests of the economy.  We regret that such an action was forced on the trade unions by the policies and contemplated actions we are discussing.  We believe that wiser counsels will prevail in the Government and that they will look for the revenue lost earlier this year from the wealthy sections of our community.</P>
    <P>One could describe the budget strategy of 1978 as an attempt by the Government to spend our way into full employment on the basis of foreign borrowing. We are aware that the employment targets showed that that policy and strategy was ill-conceived and that the economic Minister who is so worried that the food of the rich is subsidised as well as that of the poor, has confessed in public&mdash;it is becoming a weekly occurrence to confess his failures in public; an interesting trait and one which he will be forced to indulge in more frequently between now and 1981&mdash;that the employment target will not be reached this year.</P>

      <P>I found the Deputy's contribution very interesting, so interesting that I looked back on the record to see that I got each title of his credo as pronounced tonight, if credo is the correct word to use.  Before the goodies were handed out the claim was made that no substitute revenue would be necessary to pay for them.  In our simplicity at that time we did not know how this could be brought about.  We knew that at some stage the bill would have to be paid but we did not know that the areas from which payment would be sought would be children's allowances and food subsidies.  The abolition of food subsidies over whatever period will lead to an increase in the cost of living and anybody familiar with the problem will know that such an impact on the cost of living increases the pressure for wage increases. We all look for orderly progression on the incomes front and we believe that if the Government look at the problem they will abandon their policy because they will perceive from yesterday's <Col N="1091" /> decision that continuing on their course will lead to a more serious prospect for industrial relations in 1979 than the serious situation we faced in 1978.  We are aware that when the figures are counted we will have lost approximately 1 million man days through disputes this year.</P>
      <P>We have been told that it is a very fertile area of discontent in our society when a government attempts to encourage divisions.  So much of the strategy of the Government is intent on deepening divisions rather than eliminating them in our society.  That is true of the gifts given out in the 1978 budget.  Now when they are looking for the payment for these promises, for this largesse of theirs, where do they look? They seek to take the money from the average income families.  They seek once more to ignore the people who most benefit from their largesse, the people on whom they relied because it will be recalled that their statements earlier this year were that the imposition of the wealth tax and the capital gains tax on the wealthiest in our community was a disincentive to investment.  Since the removal of these taxes we have not seen the extraordinary increase in jobs that it was predicted would occur.  Instead the admission has been made publicly that the employment targets will not in fact be reached.</P>
      <P>I believe that there are many ordinary supporters of the Government party up and down the country who are concerned with the kind of actions foreshadowed in statements such as those of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue.  We are appealing to that section in the party opposite to speak to their TDs and local representatives, to such Deputies as Deputy Flynn, who according to press reports raised this matter quite appropriately and asked for information on the Government's intentions in relation to the food subsidies and the taxation of children's allowances. Well he might do.  Any Deputy who is in touch with his constituents would understand that great importance is attached to the continuation of the food subsidies.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the encouragement received from the Deputy. The reason the motion is put down by the Labour Party is to get the constructive result of getting this Government to change their minds.  If we succeed in that the putting down of this motion will have been quite worth while and we will be quite happy.  It is not put down for any other reason.  This motion has been put down and has received powerful endorsement as a result of the decision of the trade unions yesterday not to enter into wage talks because the subsidies were introduced initially in 1975 when the Government of the time wished to get from the trade union movement their co-operation for the amendment of the later stages of the national wage agreement of that year.  In a June budget we introduced subsidies to keep the cost of living below a certain figure.  In return the trade unions responded by so amending the national wage agreement <Col N="1093" /> of that year.  So there is an intimate connection between the maintenance of the food subsidies in their present form and the continuation of the national wage agreement system of bargaining and it does not surprise me that yesterday such were the worries and concern of the trade union movement that they in fact abandoned for the time being the concept of national wage bargaining as a result of this and other expenditure-cutting decisions of this Government.</P>
      <P>Of course the Government must replace revenue lost from other sources. It is very pleasant to think that certain of the problems faced by this country, employment chief amongst them, can be surmounted by such means as were chosen by the Government.  It would be a very pleasant state of affairs indeed to think that abolishing rates and tax on cars leads automatically to improvement in the employment situation.  It would be a far more pleasant world if these consequences followed.  It would be an even more pleasant world if one could do these things without looking for the actual payment afterwards.  But of course that was the claim of the Government that such payments, such hand-outs could be made, such things could happen without recourse afterwards to payment. We are now in the dreadful situation in November where all of the generosity of January is giving way to the hair-shirt policies of November.  This was predicted by us at the time as an inevitable consequence.  We did not, however, then think that such areas as the children's allowances and food subsidies would be so chosen.  It is not as if the abolition of the subsidies occurs in a situation where food prices have remained stationary because they have been rising steadily over recent months. We have seen milk, cheese, butter, bread, sugar the staple family food items increasing in price recently.  If the Government were to proceed in phasing out the food subsidies, a further twist would occur in the food price spiral.  We have already seen the result yesterday in the trade union response to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know now what they think of it. Certain estimates have been made of what would be the effect of the removal <Col N="1094" /> of the food subsidies.  It is reckoned for example that the price of milk would reach 20p depending on the period chosen, whilst butter could well rise to a minimum of £1.05 per pound.  It follows also&mdash;and this again explains the Labour Party's concern in the matter despite the assurances which Deputy Flynn has received <i>in camera</i>&mdash;that part of the concern of the Labour Party is that the removal of the food subsidies would hit average income families most greviously of all.  These are the families who have been hit by rising house prices which have risen over the past 18 months by over 50 per cent despite the fact that the Government said that by their policies they would ensure that more people would own homes than at any other period in the history of the State.  We are now in a situation where that dream of owning one's own home becomes steadily more unrealisable as a result of the hike in house prices.</P>
    <P>But these food prices which we are concerned to keep as low as possible will start going up over a period and that cer-tainly will hit the average income family most grievously of all.  These are anti-family measures and will be resisted by us.  Whatever the considerations I would hope that this Government would abandon any policies under these heads. There are political reasons why they should so abandon them.  I do not appeal to them on compassionate grounds; this possibly would be presumptuous on my part.  But certainly I say to them on political ground that contacts with their own grassroots in the constituencies throughout the country would demonstrate to them that expenditure cutting of this kind will not be borne by their supporters however massive and large their majority.  They should be aware that their majority is very large but the same drift in the country, the same rejection that met the last Government in conditions of recession may well be their fate in the difficult conditions which face us now.  The Deputies opposite should raise this question at every party meeting because many of them will no longer be here if they persist in introducing measures akin to phasing out food subsidies and taxing children's allowances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Many of the Deputies on the other side of the House will be looking at the deliberations of a future Fianna Fáil Opposition <Col N="1096" /> from the Visitor's Gallery if measures like these are carried out.</P>

    <P>Note:</P>
    <P>The annual census of mechanically propelled road vehicles is compiled <i>via</i> the local motor taxation offices and relates to vehicles under current licence as at 30 September in any year.  The details in respect of 1978 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>(b)  On the basis of returns made by licensing authorities, which are broken down only in relation to main categories of vehicles&mdash;that is, private cars, commercial vehicles and so on&mdash;the estimated revenue from motor tax on cars not exceeding 16 horsepower in 1976 was £25,000,000.  It is estimated that the corresponding figure for 1978 if motor tax were similarly charged on these categories, would be £27,500,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 153 and 154 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In urban areas, the rates for various purposes were consolidated into a single <Col N="997" /> municipal rate by the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, the City and County Management Acts passed between 1934 and 1941 and the Local Government Act, 1946.  As a result of this legislation and a subsequent clarifying provision of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, specific charges for water could no longer be made by urban authorities, including Dublin Corporation, in respect of domestic water supplies to dwellings within their areas. Urban authorities can, however, make charges for water supplied to non-domestic consumers within their areas and for both domestic and non-domestic supplies to consumers outside the urban areas.</P>
    <P>The statutes referred to in effect left the position unchanged in county health districts, including the functional area of Dublin County Council, where specific charges may apply for water supplied for domestic as well as non-domestic purposes.  I understand that specific charges for domestic water supply are not made by the county councils of Leitrim, Louth and Sligo.</P>
    <P>The Government have honoured fully their promise in regard to domestic rates.  But their commitment to abolish county and municipal rates on dwellings did not extend to abolition of charges not already incorporated in the rates.</P>

      <P>Certain dentists in County Mayo refused to carry out free of charge certain treatments under the dental benefit scheme, in accordance with the terms of their agreement with my Department.  When these dentists refused to furnish satisfactory explanations for their failure to comply with their agreement, their names were removed from the dental panel.  A further five dentists have intimated that they propose to withdraw from the scheme next month in sympathy with their colleagues.</P>
      <P>There are still a number of dentists operating the dental benefit scheme throughout the county.  In addition a qualified insured person who requires dental treatment and who is unable to obtain such treatment in his own area may be allowed any travel or other expenses necessarily incurred in attending a dentist in a convenient local centre where he can obtain treatment under the scheme free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any or all of these dentists in County Mayo who have been removed from the dental panel are free to apply for readmission <Col N="1002" /> to the scheme provided they are prepared to comply with the terms of their agreement as negotiated with the Irish Dental Association.  The dentists who have intimated that they propose to withdraw their services next month are likewise free to continue participating in the scheme.  I might add that I would be very pleased if these dentists would reconsider their position in the interests of the insured persons in County Mayo and resume participation in the scheme as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if there is overcrowding in St. Olaf's national school, Balally, Dublin 14; if children in that school are being taught in corridors rather than in classrooms; if so, the number of children; if extra temporary classrooms are required; and the number of extra temporary classrooms which will be provided and when they will be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are normal size classes in St. Olaf's national school, Balally, Dublin 14.  There are however, three classes being accommodated in the general purposes rooms at the schools. Extra curricular classes&mdash;speech and drama&mdash;each of half hour duration per week are held in a corridor area (57 sq. ft.) in the boys school.  In a similar area in the girls school, dancing classes for infants are held weekly after school hours.</P>
      <P>There are proposals for a new school at Rathdown, Balally, and it would accordingly appear that the provision of extra temporary accommodation at St. Olaf's would not be warranted.</P>
