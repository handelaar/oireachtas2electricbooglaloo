      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 9, 10 (resumed) and 7.  Business will be interrupted at 3.30 p.m. to take No. 7 and the order will not be resumed thereafter. By agreement it is proposed that for the debate on item No. 7 the following time limit will apply to speakers: opening speaker, 20 minutes; Minister, 20 minutes; other speakers, 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Tánaiste if it is the intention of the Taoiseach to make a statement to the House regarding his discussion with the President of France on our entry into the EMS.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say whether that is proposed or not.  I would have to discuss it with the Taoiseach.  The Deputy will, however, appreciate that in the particular circumstances it might not be appropriate for the Taoiseach to make a statement at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>What was said by the Taoiseach the last time I raised this issue was that the Government would give consideration to the timetable and the only barrier in the Taoiseach's mind apparently at that time was the timetable which he had from the other Heads of State.  I suggested to him at that time that perhaps it might even be desirable to meet over a week-end and the Taoiseach replied that that is being given consideration.  Has any decision been made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste accept that in all the circumstances, and particularly in view of this morning's newspaper reports, our entry into the EMS could possibly have a very adverse effect upon the beneficial operation of the common agricultural policy of this country and that it is vital that a full discussion be taken in this House before making any commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the order of the House that we are raising as to whether, in the course of the order of the House, the Taoiseach will have the debate which he said he would have before a decision was taken.  Could I also ask in what way could it be inappropriate for the Taoiseach to report to the Parliament of this country what he is reporting to the press of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what the Taoiseach's final attitude will be but the kind of statement he could make to <Col N="1705" /> this House in regard to such a statement clearly would be constrained by the fact that we are in a negotiating position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste not accept that the House is at least entitled to be told as much as has already been told to the press and then to pose questions to the Taoiseach which in his discretion he can reply to or not as he feels appropriate taking account of our negotiating position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House felt that that would be a satisfactory situation obviously the Taoiseach might give further consideration to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste not agree that a discussion at this stage in the negotiations would possibly strengthen the hand of the Taoiseach in any further discussions rather than weaken it?  Would the Tánaiste tell the House whether the Taoiseach will be here in the House next week to answer further questions on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the first part of the Deputy's question, the answer is no. As to the second part, I have not consulted with the Taoiseach on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise something on the Order of Business.  On Wednesday last the Industrial Development Bill began its Second Stage not long before the evening concluded.  The Bill was moved by the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and <Col N="1706" /> Energy, Deputy R. Burke.  He began his speech in column 1056, Volume 309, of the Official Report of 15 November.  His opening words were &ldquo;I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  Neither in opening his speech nor in closing it did he give any indication that he would not be closing the debate as is the custom and almost invariable rule in the House. Naturally that often happens when a Minister is away or unable or unwilling, for one reason or another, to conduct the debate on the Bill.  The debate was resumed on Tuesday of this week and I was the first speaker.  During all of the time that I was speaking and during some of the time during which the debate continued thereafter the Minister. Deputy O'Malley, was in his place.  I took it for granted, watching him, that he intended to intervene in the course of the debate, as would be natural enough: I would have been very surprised had he not done so.  I discovered yesterday morning that he had in fact been called a matter of seconds before the House moved to other business.  I have the unrevised report here of what happened and after Deputy White had sat down the Minister stood up and his opening words were</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  It is my desire to deal as fully as possible with the points they made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are words which are appropriate to a Minister who is winding a debate up.  They would be a little unusual for a Member, whether a Minister or not, who is contributing in the middle of a debate. I would like to make it clear and have it established that the debate will not conclude at the conclusion of Deputy O'Malley's speech but will continue with the speakers on this side of the House who still wish to contribute.  There are not many of them and we have no surprises up our sleeves and we do not in any way want to obstruct the Minister's speech.  I just want to have it established that this is not the conclusion of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair can not give any such assurance.  The Leas Cheann Comhairle clearly called on the <Col N="1707" /> Minister to conclude.  The Ceann Comhairle will have to honour that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reference in the unrevised report to what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said but, even if there had been, it is not the custom, as the Chair well knows, to put these purely formal and interlocutory expressions of the Chair into the report.  But even if it had been in the report that could not suffice to overrule the ordinary Standing Order of the House any more than the opening words used by the Minister.  The fact is that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair most of that day as indeed he was in the Chair most of yesterday and he probably did not know on Tuesday afternoon that it had not in fact been Deputy O'Malley who opened the debate.  But we knew it was not and we took it for granted that this was simply an intervention in the course of the debate which he quite naturally would wish to make.  So the words said by accident or in mistake by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle do not and could not bind the rest of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say that it was perfectly clear that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle called on me to conclude. He used those words in fact. There was no other Deputy in the House offering to speak.  I am aware in this connection that, when Deputy Burke opened the debate and was immediately followed by Deputy Kelly, one of Deputy's Kelly's constant complaints at that time, as indeed at other times too, was that I was not there and he kept referring to the Minister of State's absent chief and why was I not here to deal with the matter.  I spent all Tuesday here dealing with it.  I thought it was only a matter of courtesy to the House, and that it was assumed by everybody, that I would naturally conclude the debate because it is a matter which comes particularly within my section of the Department.  I might also add that at 6 p.m. on Tuesday there were no Deputies at all on the Opposition side of the House.  I could have asked the Fianna <Col N="1708" /> Fáil Deputy who was then speaking to resume his seat and I could have then concluded.  I chose not to do that in spite of the fact that for a period of four or five minutes there were no Deputies at all on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the Minister in front of us now who opened the debate and it was not he who moved the Second Reading.  While there would not have been the least difficulty if we had been approached and asked to agree to the Minister closing the debate or even if we had been warned that he saw himself as the closing speaker there would have been no difficulty whatever.  I am complaining about the House being taken by surprise by the Minister assuming and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle mistakenly assuming&mdash;this is the point&mdash;that this was the last speaker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a debate on it now.  The Chair's decision is clear and unambiguous in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, the most frequently heard sentence in this House in recent times is you saying: &ldquo;We cannot have a debate on this matter&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that the Standing Orders of the House govern the method and manner in which business is conducted.  A Deputy cannot stand up at any time and proceed to have a debate.  The Chair would be lacking very seriously in his duty if he permitted that sort of disorganisation to continue.  The Chair dealt with the matter under discussion.  I have sympathy with the Deputy if he did not understand.  I discussed it with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and he has no question of doubt whatever that he called on the Minister to conclude.  Any Minister, according to Standing Orders, may conclude any debate for another Minister and there is no obligation to announce during the debate who is concluding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if the House is told that.  Since you have endorsed the <Col N="1709" /> primacy of Standing Orders I await with interest your citation of the Standing Order on the next occasion this Bill is debated which entitles the Minister to intervene&mdash;perhaps he did not realise he was taking the Opposition by surprise&mdash;and take the House by surprise as he did on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask you, Sir, when you come to rule on this matter, to cite the Standing Order that says that any Minister may conclude a debate, by implication in the circumstances we are talking about, without warning.  I believe that has never been the case.  It would be a totally impossible situation if at any moment a Minister could rise and by doing so conclude a debate even if he is not the Minister in question.  I ask you to cite the Standing Order under which any Minister by standing up without warning can conclude any debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, if the Chair calls on a Minister to conclude and if the Opposition do not wish to accept that position, the point can be raised there and then as to whether or not the Minister is concluding and it can be clarified?  It cannot be contested afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is always called on to conclude when he is the Minister who opened the debate but the Minister who proposed and moved the Second Stage of the debate in the House was Deputy Ray Burke.  The Opposition took it for granted that the intervention we were looking forward to hearing from the Minister, Deputy O'Malley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we might have been warned that the intention was to switch the closing speech to a different Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a decision by the Chair.  If Deputies can come in here and say that a Minister who has been concluding was interrupted by a change of business and they want the debate to continue, the Chair can establish a precedent of that kind.  If the Minister and the Deputy concerned wish to make other arrangements, the Chair does not mind.  The Chair has got to stand by the decision taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has quite unnecessarily been given an angry point by the Government's behaviour.

    <Title>Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1978: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is twofold, that is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>to give statutory authority to the ESB's existing consultancy and advisory services work; and to increase to £1,200 million the existing <Col N="1712" /> statutory limit of £700 million on total expenditure by the ESB for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the primary function of the ESB under the Electricity Supply Acts is to ensure the adequate supply and distribution of electricity throughout the State.  This is the reason for their existence and they have a standing remit from me and my predecessors to ensure that electricity is at no time in short supply.  The board have a number of other functions which I need not detail but these are subsidiary to their main function.</P>
    <P>Since their establishment over 50 years ago the ESB have themselves carried out all design work on planning of power stations and on transmission and distribution lines, in this manner gradually building up a competent body of professional and technical staff covering a wide variety of specialised fields, including areas not directly related to the electricity supply industry&mdash;for example, fisheries.  Though there have been periods when demand for electricity was stagnant, over the past 50 years or so as a whole there has been a steady growth in the demand for electricity which necessitated frequent additions to generating, transmission and distribution capacity.  A brief comparison of the scale of operations in recent years with the scale in the early years is instructive.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31 March 1930 the ESB generated 60 million units of electricity, some 43 million of which were sold to less than 50,000 customers; total revenue was less than £500,000.  In the year ended 31 March 1978 the corresponding figures were 8,800 million units generated of which 7,300 million were sold to nearly one million customers, total revenue being £210 million.</P>
    <P>The recession in recent years resulted in a fall in demand for electricity with the result that provision of new generating capacity was put off as long as possible and proposals for further expansion were deferred.  With the fall-off in electricity demand the board found themselves with surplus capacity among their highly-skilled professional and <Col N="1713" /> technical staff.  At about that time Córas Tráchtála indicated there were openings abroad for ESB expertise and, with the consent of the then Minister for Transport and Power, the board ventured into the overseas consultancy and advisory services work early in 1975.  The primary purpose of this radical development was to utilise the surplus staff capacity then available in the board by taking up the slack and in this manner protect employment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to tell the House that the results of the board's overseas venture have been encouraging.  In all, work has been undertaken for electricity utilities in 15 countries but the board's main effort has been concentrated in Bahrain and in Saudi Arabia.  In Bahrain an average of up to 60 staff of all disciplines have been seconded to bring the managerial, financial and technical aspects of the Bahrain State Electricity Directorate up to international standard.</P>
    <P>A recent report by an independent Swedish consultant recommended that the ESB be retained until an adequate standard is reached in Bahrain.  I feel that this reflects creditably on the board. In Saudi Arabia the board have been appointed consultants for the management of two regional electrification schemes including tender assessment, design approvals, supervision of construction, commissioning and overall financial management of the projects.  There are several other areas where the board have succeeded in winning, on merit alone, useful contracts but Deputies will probably think it unnecessary for me to indicate them in detail.  Let me say, however, that the ESB are alert all the time to the possibilities inherent in selling their expertise and specialised knowledge in those areas or countries where there is a demand for them.</P>
    <P>A satisfactory feature of the board's overseas involvement has been its extension from ESB staff going abroad on assignments to foreign staff coming to Ireland for training.  For example, about 90 engineers and technicians from Nigeria have already been trained in Ireland and are now back home successfully operating a new power station there; a further 29 Nigerians are in training <Col N="1714" /> at present and there are good prospects, I am told, of further substantial numbers of trainees being sent here.</P>
    <P>A major Saudi Arabian training contract has been secured with 32 staff from that country attending an English language school in Dublin for six months before undergoing a 12 months training course in the ESB.  These examples serve to illustrate the wide-ranging scope of the board's activities and the possibilities that have been opened-up since they embarked on their overseas venture.</P>
    <P>In addition to overseas consultancy and advisory services work the ESB have also engaged to some extent in consultancy work at home, in areas where they have and are known to have special expertise not otherwise available within the country.  Their services have been utilised by a number of public bodies or enterprises in this country, including the Dublin Port and Docks Board, Bord Gáis and AnCO.</P>
    <P>While the ESB have been careful not to trespass on the field traditionally served by the consulting engineering profession in Ireland and have given assurances to this effect, I am particularly concerned that there should be no cause whatever for legitimate complaint by established consultants here about the nature and extent of the board's consultancy operations.  I have therefore sought and obtained from the board a positive undertaking that they will not interfere with the activities of other Irish consultants who have the competence to carry out the relevant project work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this undertaking will allay any fears that may have been entertained as to the nature of the board's activities in this field.  In these circumstances I am disposed to agree that the ESB should be authorised to engage in consultancy work at home to an extent consistent with full compliance with their undertaking to me.  It is my intention nonetheless to keep the board's activities as consultants under periodic review.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that expenditure on consultancy work shall not exceed revenue and I have arranged that the <Col N="1715" /> ESB will prepare separate accounts for inclusion in their annual report to me which will show clearly all relevant financial aspects of their consultancy activities. In this regard I should like to mention that in the three years ending 31 March 1978 the excess of income over expenditure on consultancy work, after allowing for all salaries, expenses, promotional costs and overheads, was about £1 million.  Apart from this favourable financial outturn, and the enhanced international status which we have acquired, it is worth noting that the ESB involvement in these large foreign assignments has drawn the attention of various public and private purchasing agencies to the possibilities of doing other kinds of business with Ireland, and as a result substantial exports of industrial goods have taken place to these areas.</P>
    <P>The ESB have kept in close touch all along both with my Department and with the Department of Foreign Affairs as to their overseas activities.  I will, however, be consulting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in advance of any future commitments which the board may propose to enter into in connection with their overseas business.  The Government regard this as a necessary step to ensure the closest possible cooperation and mutual understanding between the board and the Government Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>The undertaking of consultancy work overseas does not appear to come within the ESB's statutory powers as laid down in the Electricity Supply Acts, and there may also be some doubt that such work at home is covered by existing legislation. The board have found the lack of clear statutory authority to be a disadvantage on several occasions when contracts were being negotiated.  I am, therefore, promoting this legislation to eliminate any problems which the absence of statutory authority might create for the ESB in negotiating successfully for contracts or commissions.</P>
    <P>I now come to the other purpose of this Bill which is to provide for an increase <Col N="1716" /> in the limit of capital expenditure by the board from £700 million to £1,200 million.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory limit on capital expenditure by the ESB was fixed by the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1974 at £700 million.  The total capital expenditure approved by the board to date has risen to a figure little short of £700 million. Whilst actual expenditure to date by the board only amounts to about £600 million or so, the standing practice is that proposals for capital expenditure are not approved by the board unless the total of the proposed expenditure, aggregated with previous expenditure and commitments to expenditure, is less than the statutory limit.  As further commitments to substantial additional expenditure by the board will shortly arise it is necessary, therefore, to increase the statutory limit.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the electricity supply industry is largely capital-intensive and that the ensuring of an adequate supply of electricity in compliance with their remit necessitates heavy levels of capital expenditure by the board virtually every year.  As the lead-times with capital investments in the electricity sector tend to be long the ESB must always look well ahead when formulating their capital programme. The board tell me that, during the year ended 31 March 1978, growth in electricity demand showed an 8.2 per cent increase over the previous year and the indications are that a similar level of growth is being maintained during the current year.  The ESB viewpoint, with which I broadly agree, is that they must plan ahead for an average growth rate in electricity demand of 8.5 per cent per annum over the next decade, but with an inbuilt strategy of maximum flexibility to respond to fluctuations in growth above or below the 8.5 per cent level.</P>
    <P>The existing generating capacity of the board's system is about 2,540 megawatts.  The Poolbeg station extension which is expected to come into commission later this year will add 270 MW to the system whilst a further 80 MW generating capacity will become available when the industrial dispute at Marina has concluded.  The new station <Col N="1717" /> at Aghada, which is expected to come on-stream sometime in 1980, and the extensions to the Shannonbridge and Lanesborough stations expected to be completed about 1982-83, will between them add another 350 MW to the system.  This makes for a total capacity of 3,240 MW.  The cost of all new generating capacity, either already provided or in course of provision, is within the existing £700 million capital expenditure limit.</P>
    <P>To meet the projected growth requirements over the next decade, the board expect that they will have to approve over the next two years or so of further capital expenditure totalling about £500 million on provision of new generating capacity, additional and ancillary transmission and distribution lines, new premises and other miscellaneous items. Actual expenditure of this magnitude will not, of course, arise in the next two years or so but will be spread over a number of years up to 1985 or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, providing in this Bill for an increase of £500 million in the existing statutory limit on capital expenditure by the ESB, bringing the total permitted capital outlay by the board to £1,200 million.</P>
    <P>Before I elaborate on the purposes to which the proposed £500 million capital expenditure by the board will be put it might be useful if I reminded the House that essentially all that the ESB are proposing to do is meet expected consumer demand.  Deputies are, no doubt, aware that electricity cannot be stored and that, therefore, sufficient generating capacity must always be available to the ESB to enable them to meet demands as and when it arises, if shortages of electricity with all the inconveniences and hardship that such shortages would entail are not to arise.  Last year the ESB consumed 2.23 million tonnes of oil equivalent, some 67 per cent of which comprised imported oil.  As of now the best available estimates suggest that the ESB will consume 5.5 MTOE by 1990. How best to meet this increased requirement is the problem.  For a number of years past the ESB like most other electricity utilities, have largely relied on oil as their primary energy feedstock <Col N="1718" /> mainly because of its cheapness, ready availability and versatility.  Oil, however, is no longer cheap and there is no guarantee as to its continued availability in the future.</P>
    <P>In the uncertain energy world it would be foolhardy to ignore these facts; it would also be foolish to forget that oil is a finite resource and that demand for it over the world as a whole is increasing. The inescapable conclusion is that we must lessen our existing near-75 per cent level of dependence on imported oil as much as we can.  In our circumstances this can best be achieved by adopting the right policies in respect of the electricity generation programme.  That is why I recently sanctioned the provision of a major coal-fired station and also why I will not permit the ESB to construct any more generating stations to be fuelled by imported oil.  While I am hopeful that we can arrange in the not-too-distant future inter-connection with the EEC electricity grid, with all the mutual advantages to member states to be derived therefrom, we must ensure at the same time that we have optimum diversification in our generating plant programme at home.</P>
    <P>A large part of the £500 million proposed expenditure will be committed to the new coal-fired station which is expected to come on-stream about 1985, but there are other items and it might be helpful if I gave an approximate break-down of the total:</P>
    <P>New coal-fired station including provision for full site development works such as jetties, roadways and buildings as well as turbines, boilers and ancillary equipment for 2 × 300 MW units, £350 million; Distribution system arising out of the need to provide electricity supply to an additional 25-30,000 customers each year, £60 million; Transmission lines to provide improved supply to consumers, especially in outlying areas, £20 million; Premises such as new district and area offices, and related items, £20 million; Miscellaneous, including provision for peak-load plant&mdash;small turbines&mdash;to meet sudden heavy demands for electricity, £50 million.</P>
    <P>This break-down is indicative only, and not definitive, but what I should like <Col N="1719" /> to make clear to Deputies is that no provision is being made at this stage for capital expenditure on the ESB nuclear project.  Though this project was approved in principle by the then Government almost exactly five years ago there is no question of it now being proceeded with until the Government have fully assessed all the energy options now open to us, and made up their mind as to the nature and extent of the generating capacity needed to meet our expected electricity needs in the coming decade and beyond.  In this regard I have been impressed by the public reaction generally to, and understanding of, our major energy problems following the publication some months ago of the Energy-Ireland discussion document.  As I have already indicated any submission by interested parties on this very important question will be fully considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated elsewhere I will be putting my proposals in the matter to the Government in the near future.  If the Government should decide not to over-rule the existing decision of the last Government and that the ESB nuclear project should be processed further in accordance with the 1973 decision, a period of 18 to 24 months to permit of assembling of the ESB nuclear team, updating of plans and preparation of specifications, inviting tenders and so on will elapse from the date of the Government decision before there will be any question of acceptance of tenders and thus of an irrevocable commitment to the project arising.  I wish to make it very clear that before this final commitment stage is reached it will be necessary to place before the Oireachtas proposals to increase the ESB capital expenditure limits to cover nuclear station costs. Deputies are thus guaranteed an opportunity for full debate on this issue before there can be any commitment by the ESB to building a nuclear station.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to begin by taking up a couple of points which in the over-all context of the Minister's speech may <Col N="1720" /> be relatively marginal.  We are all glad to hear that the ESB who are the earliest and one of the most successful of our State-supported and State-promoted monopolies, should be so well thought of that they are able to sell their skill in many foreign countries.  However, I would like a little more detail in regard to what proportion of this export of skill is under the heading of Overseas Development Aid.  Presumably the skill sold to Saudi Arabia, for instance, would not come under that heading because that country is not a recipient of development aid in the ordinary sense of the word.  I am aware that the ESB have had training contacts with Nigeria but that country is not in the category of the poorer type of nation for which development aid is designed.  This contact, so far as it consists of exporting skills has been paid for out of funds which represent part of our Overseas Development Aid Programme.  In other words, some of the money we spend on development aid, we are paying back to ourselves in the shape of subsidising the employment of our semi-State bodies in passing on skills and expertise to countries who have not sufficient expertise of their own.  I am not making any particular point on this but I would have liked the Minister's speech to have included a paragraph indicating the proportion of this business which represents business we are undertaking in the context of our Overseas Development Aid Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which arises and which in the over-all context may be only marginal although of very great importance when considered separately, relates to the coal-fired station to which the Minister has referred and for which the major part of this increased expenditure will be earmarked.  The individual items to which the Minister adverted such as premises, jetties, site developments, boilers, ancillary equipment and so on amount to a cost of £350 million. Do the ESB envisage an identifiable sum for pollution control because the pollutant ingredient of a coal-fired station is extremely high?  Inherent in it are hazards which although different from the hazards associated with nuclear reactors, are even greater as I have heard the Minister say, than the hazards <Col N="1721" /> associated with nuclear reactors.  Pollution control is an expensive business and that is why I would like to have heard something about the degree to which this £350 million is to be devoted to this aspect of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. Regarding the Minister's over-all comments on the energy situation, he raised the question of the energy discussion document issued by his Department in July.  Therefore, I may be permitted to refer to that document and to say something about the options before us and which are mentioned in this document. As a document it is about as lucid as is possible in terms of being understood by the layman.  I detect at least two different hands in its compilation.  I suspect that the introduction was written by somebody other than the person who wrote the body of it because the introduction is written with less general care than is the case in relation to the other part.  However, the body of the document is helpful to the layman and, naturally, I include myself in that category.  The whole document is well put together but it is too simple.  While it constitutes a fair enough effort at informing the public in a very general way as to what are the problems before us, it is not nearly detailed enough to give the experts enough to get their teeth into it. The criticism I have heard from people who are qualified to judge in that regard is that there is much too little detail and that in order to enable technical judgment to be made about it by people who are technically expert, it would need to <Col N="1722" /> be several times the length and equipped with a great number of tables and appendices so that they could verify for themselves the correctness of the projections about efficiency, conversion. growth in GNP, the relationship between growth in GNP and growth in energy requirements, on which the document is based.  There is no unanimity about these projections.  There is a divergence of up to 50 per cent between the views of different experts as to the rate at which growth in GNP is accompanied by growth in energy demands.  For the subeditor or the newspaper correspondent whose job it is to make this stuff intelligible to the general reader this document is very good.  For the expert reader, the person on whose judgment we and the Minister will ultimately rely, it is not detailed enough.  We would not have complained had we got a much fuller, more elaborate and, naturally, more expensive document.  We have had such things, perhaps not in as technical a region.  The State has often spent very lavish sums of money on research which was supposed to be the basis for future policy.  The research done in education in the 1960s is a very good instance of that and so is the research done into the public service.  On a matter so emotional, sensitive and important&mdash;as is admitted by all sides and even by those who disagree with everything the Minister does&mdash;it would not have been out of place had a more elaborate document been introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister was requested to produce this discussion document <i>Energy-Ireland</i> which is not expected to be as elaborate as something on which a commission has laboured for five or ten years.  I was one of the people pressing the Minister to produce this.  The judgment I hear passed about it is that the detail in it is insufficient and it is not possible to form judgments on much of what the paper contains because the bases on which the judgment assumptions rest are not transparent&mdash;they are not capable of being evaluated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some details which I found surprising in that document.  One is its assumptions in regard to the country's economic growth.  I do not want to be regarded as pessimistic, but the projections, <Col N="1723" /> are based on the continuing pretty high growth level uninterrupted by any kind of a hiccough for the next 15 years or thereabouts.  Even accompanied by the qualification that they may or may not be reached, I would be very slow to plan any expensive, elaborate, controversial energy programme on them.  A somewhat more modest assumption in regard to GNP would have been appropriate. The reply to that may be that, had that proved to be unfounded and had more modest projections been exceeded, that would have left us with an energy deficit which might have been impossible to remedy at short notice.  That reply, although in theory reasonable, does not lie in the mouths of those who prepared this document.  On page 24 they are speaking about the relationship between growth in energy consumption and growth in GNP, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Essentially, we are concerned with determining what must be done to meet the expected energy demands by 1990 while at the same time avoiding the over-provision, or over-planting, as it is called, of generating equipment. It is felt that the higher growth rate situation postulated above, i.e. 24 MTOE by 1990 could be met by special or <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements in the mid 1980's and so need not be developed further in this document.</P>
    <P>That is much higher than the ones they are working on, which is about 18 MTOE and the lower level which they were assuming was something like 15 MTOE.  One would have liked some indication about what kind of special or <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements will get us the equivalent at very short notice of several million tons of oil equivalent per year.</P>
    <P>The document is deficient in regard to the energy conservation side.  The chapter about energy conservation is well-written and interesting, but again it goes into far too little detail and makes far too few assumptions about what is within the power of any Government to do.  For example, there is not enough about the impact which a proper programme of energy conservation on <Col N="1724" /> dwelling-houses would have.  In domestic use in this country an enormous proportion of our energy is consumed, a proportion roughly equivalent to that which industry takes up.  A substantial phase-in here, particularly on heating, would have a visible and significant impact on our overall energy situation.  It has often been said here in the House and outside, that a discussion document like this might have found more room for explaining what the Government might do in this regard, what they should do and what they were making up their minds to do.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of comical things in the conservation section to which I want to draw the attention of the House. They talk about conservation efforts, utilisation of waste heat, district heating and so on.  The only specific reference is to the Ballymun project in which it says that shortcomings of various kinds will need to be corrected in further applications of the concept.  There is nothing about what the Government aim to do now by way of a positive programme for utilising waste heat from large plants in such a way as to channel it into adjacent housing or into a simple industrial enterprise like a fish farm or a glasshouse. I realise that we do not have the housing density or the long, severe winters of countries which are very far ahead with research on this kind of work, such as Denmark.</P>
    <P>Simply as a matter of tactics, this discussion document is leaving a very exposed flank from the Government's point of view <i>vis-à-vis</i> their critics of whom I am one in a general way but I am not as severe as the people who have a combination of anti-nuclear and conserving the resources of the earth type of interests.  The Government should say what we might do and not merely tell us what other people do or what in a general way may be theoretically possible.</P>
    <P>A comical, or perhaps pathetic, part of this chapter is paragraph 7.3, which talks about Government policies which had effects on energy conservation.  This is an extract, and I quote from page 49:</P>
    <P>Even before the energy crisis in <Col N="1725" /> 1973-74 there were a number of Government policies which had effects on energy conservation.  These included such things as taxation of petrol....</P>
    <P>Can you beat it?  Taxation of petrol.  I must say, if that is a claim to be included in a list of conservation measures, so too is poverty or so too is physical disability which makes it impossible for a person to drive a car.  To trot out what was always thought of before as a purely fiscal revenue raising measure in the context of a document on conservation would make a cat laugh.  But that is not the worst of it.</P>
    <P>These included such things as taxation of petrol as well as grants for fuel efficiency surveys in industry.  Since the crisis further steps have been taken by the Government.  Boiler efficiency tests have been subsidised. Grants are provided by the IDA to industry towards improved expenditure on equipment which will reduce energy usage.  The IDA also provides grants towards labour and material costs for research and development projects which have a significant technical input aimed at conserving energy.  Bord Fáilte have somewhat similar grant schemes for hotels and guesthouses.  Petrol taxation has been increased.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of trouble here when the oil crisis arose.  It was alleged the Government were using it as an excuse to raise revenue by putting 15p on the gallon of petrol.  Oddly enough, the incoming Government have not been falling over themselves to take that 15p off again.  It was never represented by Deputy R. Ryan, Minister for Finance, or anybody else as a conservation measure and neither was the conservation aspect of it more than marginally discussed.  It is perfectly true, of course, that if you make driving more expensive, apart from taxation measures, you are forcing people to conserve energy and I suppose that is a beneficial by-product.</P>
    <P>What then is to be said about a policy of remitting taxation on cars?  What then is to be said in the context of conservation, which we are talking about here, of <Col N="1726" /> a policy which makes it cheaper for people to drive and which makes young people that much quicker and more easily able to acquire cars?  And what can be said about a fiscal policy which puts so much consumer spending into the pockets of the public so that the most conspicuous single result in the market of the Government's first budget at the beginning of this year is an enormous increase in the number of cars on the road and an enormous increase in the number of car registrations?  If I were ruled out of order in regard to bringing up this matter I would have submitted gracefully were it not for the fact that this Green Paper trots out the imposition and the increasing of petrol taxation as a conservation measure.  If that is a conservation measure then the remission of car tax and the general policy of the Government in buying votes at the last election has had the effect of squandering energy and that is one of the most conspicuous effects it has had.</P>
    <P>I will not go on about that any longer. I hope I have made the point sufficiently; but this is, I think, probably the most ineffective chapter in what is overall quite an informative, at least for the layman, document.  I would have wished this document to say that the Government had got, and explained what they were, positive projects in mind and were going to go through with positive projects for subsidising schemes of insulation in private houses to a degree further than is now done, of obliging the improvement of building standards to a stage where the heat loss would be as small as it is in Denmark.  In case it is objected that that would put building costs up, let me say immediately that will not be acceptable on this side of the House as an excuse when we find that, although building costs have risen by 10 per cent since this Government got into office, the price of houses has risen by 23 per cent.  If there are additional costs involved in compulsorily including further heat conservation in building the Minister ought to absorb that cost himself and the Government, through the Minister responsible, should make certain that he does so.</P>
    <P>It was only this morning I got in my morning post a document signed by, I <Col N="1727" /> think, your good self or, if not by you, by the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad imploring Deputies bilingually to turn lights off after them in the House, not to keep electrical equipment running when it was not required, and so on.  That, of course, is all very laudable even though the amount of energy saved in turning off strip lighting is extremely small.  I could have done without the document asking me to turn lights off if I thought these&mdash;I do not want to belittle them&mdash;essentially marginal hortatory measures were going to do something which had a bit of bite in it towards conserving the energy that pours out through our buildings, through our windows and our poorly built walls, from October to April year in and year out.</P>
    <P>There are two general remarks I want to make and I hope that what I say now will not be taken as offensive because it is not meant that way.  In fact, in a curious way I think it is a compliment to the ESB personnel.  I feel, and I think the feeling is shared by others, that many of the officials in the advice they give in regard to the development of new energy sources, particularly in the case of the nuclear project, are so keen on their subject and so in love with it&mdash;that is very commendable&mdash;that they cannot wait to get their hands on a new technology. That is as it should be.  If they were indifferent and apathetic it would be a very bad thing.  But I think that it is an element which, in evaluating the energy programme and the choice before us, the Minister must to some extent discount. He must make allowance for the fact that there is a certain professional enthusiasm, entirely praiseworthy, which has unavoidably and automatically crept into the advice he is getting.  While I am not saying the advice is not correct&mdash;it may well be&mdash;that element ought to be politely borne in mind and recognised to be, as it is, the product of the ESB engineers having their hearts in the right place and having an interest in their job. At the same time it is an element which might unconsciously dispose them to a degree of enthusiasm for a new technology which perhaps other considerations, <Col N="1728" /> economic considerations in particular, do not necessarily warrant our adopting in the near future.</P>
    <P>The second comment I want to make&mdash;and again I do not mean it in any offensive sense and I have to rely on a secondhand opinion because I cannot judge it for myself&mdash;is that I have encountered the view that the Minister does not dispose within his Department of the necessary overall expertise to advise him on these matters.  I cannot expect his Department to be expert on everything and, whatever expertise is there, one cannot expect it to be above a certain sort of general level.  I do not want to be taken as critical of his Department.  I am certain everyone there is good at his job and does his best, but I would not be doing my job properly if I did not pass on the opinion I have heard expressed that the volume and the quality of the advice on matters such as nuclear development within the Minister's Department is not of the level he ought to have available to him in making important decisions about our future.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is inspired by the Minister's admission&mdash;I am very glad he made it in his opening speech rather than have it dragged out of him&mdash;that it will take 18 months to two years from the moment the Government decide to stand by the programme provisionally set in motion by the former Government to give the ESB a green light for the construction of a nuclear station.  If there is 18 months or two years I strongly urge the Minister to spend the first part of that time in holding a public inquiry into the necessity for a nuclear station.  I have said this so often that I fear I may be misunderstood, but the Party I represent are not against nuclear development.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any body of opinion within the Fine Gael Party which is, on principle, against nuclear development.  It could hardly be otherwise because a Government consisting mostly of the Fine Gael Party and a Fine Gael Minister initiated it, although there was a built-in brake to the programme they initiated which included the planning programme on <Col N="1729" /> which the ESB were directed to embark in 1973 immediately after the outbreak of the oil crisis.  The Fine Gael Party do not have basic apprehensions of principle in regard to nuclear development.  I and my Party are certainly willing to go a long way in making an act of faith in the competence of the ESB to ensure that any development, whether nuclear or not, will be as safe as possible.</P>
    <P>On the other hand&mdash;I am afraid that as soon as one says &ldquo;on the other hand&rdquo; he will be accused of sitting on the fence, although I am not sitting on the fence about this&mdash;the Minister is making a serious political mistake, not in the narrow party sense but in a much broader sense, in the attitude which he has taken over the last year towards public demands for an enquiry into the proposed plant at Carnsore or wherever else it might be if there are planning permission difficulties in Carnsore.  The public demands have a most unusual distinction in that they are being articulated in <i>The Irish Press</i> which in the ordinary way can be relied on to put up as good a case as they can for whatever Fianna Fáil is up to, although to be fair to them they have been more independent in the last few years than they previously were. Only on rare occasions does this paper dissent from or show displeasure for what the Fianna Fáil Party is doing. However, <i>The Irish Press</i> seemed to wear an expression of contempt the morning after the vote on the contraception issue here in 1974, directed against the party which whipped its members through against the Bill.  There are one or two other occasions I can recall, but by and large they tend to fall into the ranks of the soldiers of destiny easily enough and they do not seem to be too worried about the rights and wrongs of a case.  This is one of the rare occasions on which they have said that they feel the Minister is wrong.  That gives these demands directed against a Fianna Fáil Government a special <i>cachet</i> which public demands normally do not have.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude to these demands is wrong.  It has not occurred recently, but about a year ago I remember the Minister sneering at the <Col N="1730" /> people who were protesting against nuclear development.  Deputy O'Malley spent some time as Minister for Justice, and this and his other experiences have probably predisposed him to think that some people will protest no matter what is done: that they are in the protesting business and they cannot be made happy. The Minister is right up to a point.  I do not delude myself that one inquiry or 50 inquiries into a nuclear development could convince everybody.  I know there will be last ditch people who are emotionally predisposed against this development no matter what the Minister does.  That feature was probably uppermost in the Minister's mind when he refused to hold this inquiry. The Minister probably believes that there is no point in holding an enquiry because in the end the Government will have to make a decision which will be just as sticky as it is now.  The inquiry will probably necessitate the spending of a lot of money, will raise a lot of dust, will encourage false hopes, but ultimately the decision will still have to be made by the Government.  In this age when a Government is faced with a decision like this which for reasons which are buried in childhood with a lot of people, which is extremely sensitive, emotional and explosive in the general sense, considerations of the kind I have mentioned ought not to be as final as they might be in a different age or in a different context.  The Government will be a loser no matter what happens.  If my Government were in office they would have been losers too.  We would probably have made a decision which would have been unpopular with a large section of the population no matter what we had done.  I realise the disagreeable nature of the dilemma the Minister thinks he is in, but my advice is that he should hold an inquiry because many people are honestly apprehensive about this development.</P>
    <P>Many people write to me, and I suppose to other Deputies, saying that they are against a nuclear station and that they want us to add our voices against it. I have always made it clear that I will not add my voice to the campaign against the nuclear station, on principle. Among the people who write, a considerable <Col N="1731" /> proportion are absolutely honest, moderate and reasonable; they are not last ditch merchants or persons in the business of protesting.  For the sake of those people who are simply apprehensive about this, and they are entitled to feel apprehensive about what they feel might be prejudicial to their lives, and the lives of their children and grandchildren, the Government should take every step possible to instruct and debate and to permit others to debate this issue.  I know that the newspapers are open and that anyone can make a speech about this subject any day of the week, that weekends can be arranged, that bus loads of people can come down to Carnsore and camp and demonstrate, and that the country is alsolutely free so far as debate and discussion are concerned.  That is undoubted and we need not waste time on it, but the Minister is being asked to take part in the debate to show that he has an open mind.  He is being asked to take on the disposition of a judge who mounting a bench, perhaps, although naturally and in general is absolutely disposed against crime, will none the less give a fair chance to the accused person in front of him.  He may have a preconception of the type of crime alleged or the type of accused in the dock but he is able to put that to one side for the duration of the trial.  That is what is being asked of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would not lay much money on the chance that the Minister will change his mind, or that his advisers will change their minds, but they are being asked to make an effort to do so and give the people who disagree with them, whatever their disposition, whether they are honest and sincere, as I believe the majority of them are, or otherwise, an opportunity to make their case in public and cross-examine the Minister's experts. They should be given an opportunity to extract from the Minister's experts the details which the paper I have referred to does not contain and of extracting from them statements about policy which are missing from that paper also.</P>
    <P>The only apprehension I have about the thing, something which I would like <Col N="1732" /> to see thrashed out at such an inquiry, is the economic dimension of this undertaking. In 1977 the cost of a nuclear station was put at £350 million, roughly, and it is clear from the wording of the paper I referred to that the people who compiled it know that that is a low estimate for today.  For all I know it could be twice or three times that sum before it is built.  We are getting accustomed to talking about large sums of money here, but with regard to this station we are talking about staggering sums in the context of what we can afford.  Yesterday the Dáil spent three hours wrangling with the Minister for the Environment about his unwillingness to subsidise the abolition of water rates in the areas which always pay them separate from the ordinary rate, but the amount involved was only £1.2 million.  The Government are so stuck for money that they cannot find it within them to complete the remission of domestic rates by adding this small item to their free gift.  I must ask myself then how they come to be so airy about sums which could be up to £1 billion by the time the station is finished. I would like to see that point argued.</P>
    <P>In connection with the safety element I am willing to make an act of faith in the competence of the ESB in this regard, but I should like to see a debate as to whether economically this thing is absolutely necessary, because it is a much more expensive type of station than the coal-burning ones.  I would like to know if we could possibly get on without such a station, without abandoning the objective, with which I completely agree, of diversifying our energy sources and not leaving ourselves dependent on imported energy fuels.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to think again about this.  It is probable that his officials will tell him that there is no provision in any of the Acts dealing with the ESB, or other legislation, for such an inquiry; it cannot be a sworn inquiry in the normal sense because there is no scandal, accident or any of the usual things such inquiries involve and there is no precedent for such an inquiry.  I accept that there is no precedent and offhand I cannot think of a statutory dress which one could throw around this inquiry, but does that <Col N="1733" /> matter?  The people who would put their case at such an inquiry will not care whether there is an Act of 50 pages on which the thing rests; they want to know if they have the ear and the open mind of the Government when putting their case. I will not be one of those protesters and I do not think my party, as a party, will be there trying to twist the Government's arm about this, but I would like to see the inquiry demonstrate the economic necessity of such a development.  Others would like to get that information also, whether or not the inquiry has a statutory basis, is an <i>ad hoc</i> structure, or is conducted under the lines of an Act or because the Minister makes a hall in the Customs House or the Round Room in the Mansion House free for a few months while this is held.</P>
    <P>In a speech I made about this some months ago I used some over-colourful expressions and <i>The Irish Press</i>, in one of its editorials, complained about the fact that I forecast a Tokyo airport situation if the Government persisted in treating people with the offhand sneering contempt with which this Minister, I am afraid, has occasionally encountered his critics and those who are apprehensive about the nuclear programme.  I was not literally trying to predict a Tokyo airport situation on Carnsore.  I may have said so in a sentence, and if so I hope it will be discounted as a piece of rhetoric, which is all it was.  The Tokyo airport situation is relevant to what we are talking about because it is a symbol of the capacity of the modern world for generating fierce, violent emotions in the matter of conservation and preserving the quality of life.  That would have seemed unthinkable in the railway age; it would have seemed unthinkable to the age that threw the loop line across the Liffey and it would have seemed unthinkable even to the age that built the ESB buildings in Merrion Street which Brian Lenihan thought could be improved with a lick of paint.  It would have seemed unthinkable even ten years ago, but it is more than thinkable now.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat that the protest groups, the Friends of the Earth, and the other groups of which the Minister <Col N="1734" /> thinks so little, have conducted themselves up to now with absolute model respect for democracy, the law and everything else.  I could not fault any of them, nor could the Minister.  There has been no trace of disorder, violence or aggressiveness about the way these protests have been put.  I would like to see it kept that way, and while it would be wrong of me to make predictions&mdash;perhaps it was wrong of me to drag Tokyo airport into this&mdash;the relevance of that is that we are dealing with an area of controversy which can generate these things.  It is the Government's job to try to foresee such things and head them off.  While the protests and anxieties about nuclear development which have been expressed here in the last two years have not got past the stage of being polite debate let alone having reached the stage of being worrying, it is the Minister's job to make sure that that remains the situation.  I urge him to accept that the best way to make sure that the situation remains so is to concede a demand which can be conceded without loss of face, humiliation or damage.  The demand for an inquiry is reasonable and I believe it would satisfy the reasonable and moderate section of the people who are so concerned.  The Minister will never satisfy some sections, but the duty of a decent Government is to make sure that the people with reasonable apprehensions and with a reasonable demand have them set at rest.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister of an occasion ten or 12 years ago in Cork when the present Minister for Fisheries was occupying the Department of Justice.  At that time a man died in police custody in the Bridewell in Cork and the post mortem on him showed that he had injuiries to his ribs, spleen and liver which were consistent with his having been beaten up or kicked in the Garda station.  The inquest lasted three days and the verdict returned was one of accidental death.  There was uproar all over the country and the kind of people interested in such things made what noise they could.  This occurred before the present phase of the IRA had been heard of and at a time when there was not a subversive showing his nose; it was at a time <Col N="1735" /> of the deepest peace.  The line taken by the Irish Association for Civil Liberties, of which I am a member, the other bodies in existence at that time, and private individuals, was that this was not clear.  They felt that this death may have been caused by the ill-treatment of this heavily drunken man while in custody in the Bridewell late that evening.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan stonewalled for two or three months until people who had never heard of the case were up in arms about it.  When newspapers were editorialising about it, and processions were being held about it Mr. Lenihan stonewalled and stonewalled and said that he was absolutely satisfied that the police had done nothing out of the way and that the thing was an accident, that the inquest did represent and already represented a public inquiry and that it had resulted in the establishment of an accidental death.  The storm grew so intense that Mr. Lynch, who was Taoiseach in those days, must have twisted Mr. Lenihan's arm because in the end he conceded, with a great deal of loss of face, what he could have conceded in the beginning with no loss.</P>
    <P>A public inquiry was set up, chaired by a judge of the High Court, as far as I remember, with a justice of the District Court and a Circuit Court judge.  These three judges sat not for three days, as the inquest had sat, but for three weeks, and they finally produced a report which they printed and published and which included photographs, in particular a photograph of a large bar stool from which the deceased had been shown to have fallen earlier that evening.  They came to the conclusion that they were certain that the man had died accidentally. He had fallen most unluckily in between the steel legs of this stool which had had the effect of crushing his ribs and of inflicting the other internal injuries. Nobody can be 100 per cent sure of anything but they were satisfied that the death had been accidental.  Like that, the protest ceased.  The following morning there was not a word about the case any more.  From that good day to this I have never heard another allegation to the effect that that man died from anything other than by accident.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> I know this is an incident taken from a quite different field but I would like the Minister to reflect on that.  It is a superb example of how conceding a reasonable demand in regard to an inquiry can set genuine anxieties at rest.  It has a political advantage for the Government because they hear no more about it.  But of course in 1967 they paid a political penalty in the sense that that Minister collected some part of the mud which a Minister occasionally collects in his official life because of his very long insistence that no inquiry was necessary. It did turn out to be necessary, and the main beneficiaries of it were the Gardaí themselves who were now shown to be what everyone wanted them to be shown to be, innocent in the matter.</P>
    <P>There are lessons to be learnt from that story of 10 or 12 years ago.  I certainly will not embarrass the Minister and I will certainly will not sneer at him or gloat if he does change his mind, but I do urge the Minister to set up an inquiry. There will be nothing in it for him but credit if he does.  He need not have inflated expectations of what this inquiry may do.  I know he will be disappointed in a sense no matter what happens, but he will at least have given to the reasonable people of the country&mdash;and there are very many of them&mdash;who are anxious about nuclear development here a chance to make themselves heard, and he will have given them a chance also to speak directly to the Government and with some hope that the Government's open mind on this matter may be influenced by what they say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a very useful opportunity to review the energy development policy of the Government and of the ESB and in the process it gives us an opportunity of giving statutory power to the ESB in relation to consultancy and advisory services work. I welcome the entry of the ESB into consultancy work abroad and I would hope to see their consultancy work here extended also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a good deal of the work done by the ESB staff who are abroad at present, notably in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.  Some of our friends are in Saudi <Col N="1737" /> Arabia and I certainly have a great deal of admiration for the work being done by the professional staff of the ESB in these areas.  They have an excellent liaison with the Irish Embassy in that area and as the Minister has pointed out the ESB has, from its general consultancy work, made a profit of some £1 million up to 31 March of this year.  I would hope to see that work extended to other parts of the Third World, the underdeveloped world and indeed to the developed nations, because there is a valuable reservoir of expertise in many professions within the ESB and indeed within other State-sponsored bodies. There is no reason in the wide world why Irish people should not go abroad and undertake such consultancy work.  I am also pleased that we are now in a position to welcome trainees from both Nigeria and Saudi Arabia into the operations of the Board here.  When one considers the tremendous growth and work in this area by both Aer Lingus and the ESB and also the other State-sponsored bodies over recent years it augurs well for the success of Irish professional skills abroad.</P>
    <P>With regard to the comments made by the Minister in relation to consultancy work in Ireland I do not necessarily share his views about the assurances that he has sought from the ESB with regard to internal consultancy work.  What is wrong, in practice, with the professional staffs of the ESB competing internally in Ireland for consultancy contracts and consultancy operations?  Why should the Minister have obtained, as he sought and obtained, a positive undertaking from the ESB that they will not interfere with the activities of other Irish consultants who have the competence to carry out the relevant project work in Ireland?  What is so sacrosanct about the work of private consultants in this country engaged in work on their own account? Why should the ESB be precluded from entering into competitive tender and availing of such work?  Indeed I would say to the Minister that when some private firm goes bang in some sector in this country the first Minister to run to the State-sponsored bodies is no less <Col N="1738" /> than the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy saying: &ldquo;Can you bail them out?  Do you think you may be able to take over part of their operations?&rdquo;  Yet when the glove is on the other hand the board is apparently precluded from entering into activities in this field.  Personally I am in favour of job creation and the full utilisation of all our State-sponsored activities both in the public and private sector.</P>
    <P>The ESB should be encouraged to sell electrical appliances commercially and sell professional expertise abroad and on the Irish market provided they are doing this on a competitive basis and that they are not unfairly undercutting other operators.  It is not very often that I seek out points of disagreement with the Minister but I do not agree with him when he says that the ESB must not trespass into the field traditionally served by the consultancy engineering profession in Ireland.  What is so sacrosanct about that profession?  Do they provide a cheaper, better or more efficient service than the engineering profession of the ESB?  It is arguable if one looks at some of the large scale projects in the country and some of the phenomenally high prices quoted in relation to consultancy engineering.</P>
    <P>I have strong reservations in relation to domestic consultancy work.  The ESB should be free to engage in international and domestic consultancy tendering without any reservations.  We have got to take the shackles off the ESB in regard to that matter because they have plenty of expertise which can make a valuable contribution in the national interest without unduly impinging on the ordinary activities of the domestic consultancy profession.  A bit of competition between them would be a good thing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general provisions of the Bill and the extension of the capital expenditure of the board from £700 million to £1,200 million, this is an opportunity to put on record some particular points I would like to make about the aspects raised by the Minister in his speech.  The view of the Labour Party is that our energy policy must aim to ensure <Col N="1739" /> that adequate and secure supplies of energy are available for all consumers at a reasonable price.  I accept that our economic and social development, above all, the creation of full employment, will require increased energy supplies.  In saying that I do not share what I regard as a very complacent approach by the Government to the means to be adopted in achieving those objectives.  The objective of increased energy supply must be achieved with the least possible risk to the health and safety of our people and our environment.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I have strongly supported the holding of a full public inquiry into the nuclear options outlined by the Minister in the Government's discussion document published earlier this year.  I deplore the decision of the Minister and the Government not to hold such an inquiry despite the great importance of the issues involved and that a substantial majority of the people are in favour of holding such an inquiry. A decision to construct a nuclear station here should not be taken until the most fundamental problem relating to such a station is resolved, namely the question of a nuclear waste disposal system.  This has not been satisfactorily resolved so far in any country in any part of the world.  During the past 12 months I have tried to read up as much of the available literature as I could.  I have spoken to parliamentarians of the Council of Europe and I have visited generating stations. I have been assured that as yet no satisfactory system has been found for the disposal of nuclear waste.  Until that problem is resolved I believe the Government should not take a decision to construct a nuclear power station.</P>
    <P>The Minister took about six dives forward in his discussion paper but this morning he has taken some steps backwards in saying that it will be some considerable time yet before a decision is taken but that he is on the point of putting proposals before the Government.  I feel, therefore, that we should convey our views sharply to him.  My party believe that our oil and gas exploration programme must be accelerated.  We must seek out further oil and gas fields We must seek substantial aid from the <Col N="1740" /> EEC to do this.  I do not believe we have sufficient internal financial resources to undertake this work which is very costly and very risky.  EEC aid would enable us to become self-sufficient in time from such finds and even to become a net exporter of such products.</P>
    <P>We should make a further effort to get this aid from the EEC and next season we should double our oil and gas exploration programme.  This is possible because some of the finds have been encouraging, as the Minister admitted, and there is no reason why that development could not, in some measure, offset his headlong rush towards setting up a nuclear power station here.</P>
    <P>I support the construction of fuel-fired generating stations on the Shannon Estuary and the ESB should consider siting further such stations on the southeast coast.  I am reasonably convinced that with the development of modern coal-fired dual-purpose technology the environmental problems can be very substantially mitigated and that the extent to which the industry was regarded as a very dirty industry, in terms of electricity generating, has also been mitigated to a considerable degree in recent years.  That will assist us in not necessarily having to avail of a nuclear option.  That is an option which we should least wish to avail of on safety, environmental and capital expenditure grounds because in my view the other options are more rational and easier to cope with and far less expensive.</P>
    <P>The Government should promote the development of these interconnected links with the Community electricity grid through the UK network.  The Minister recently replied to a Dáil question put down by me giving some costings, admittedly of a tentative nature, but there is no reason why we should not get over our xenophobia in relation to a direct electricity connection with the UK and thus availing of the connection with the Community.  That would be a very valuable and useful connection and would have a reasonable degree of security and diversification of Irish electricity supply.</P>
    <P>There is need for a sustained and rigorous national conservation programme. <Col N="1741" /> This is primarily the responsibility of the ESB, of the Government, by way of statutory powers, and of the other energy suppliers.  It is a matter of concern that in Ireland at present we hear a great deal of talk about scarce energy resources when the consumption of imported petrol and refined petrol here has rocketed to a phenomenal extent.  This has arisen out of Government policy. We cannot have, on the one hand, a Government whining about the profligate use of energy resources and, on the other, encouraging car ownership and car purchase as this Government did in the last election.  I strongly urge that there is a need for the development of a very rigorous national programme.</P>
    <P>As yet, the Irish people are casual in their use of such resources.  Needless to remark, in the forthcoming budget petrol will probably be £1 a gallon.  This might have some effect on conservation but the growth of petrol consumption here in the past 12 months makes a mockery of any question of a national conservation programme and, of course, in the process that affects our balance of trade.</P>
    <P>The Government should also increase their participation in a financial allocation towards research programmes for the development of alternative energy systems in which there is a great deal of interest.  While in the inmediate future they do not hold out much hope of making a major contribution within the next five or ten years, nevertheless, the Government should make a substantial financial research investment in such alternatives.  This would be widely welcomed by the scientific community and by those who have a particular interest in the area of energy supply.  The Government, therefore, have an opportunity of revising their policy in relation to the development of energy generation.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat our view in relation to the question of the nuclear option.  There is no doubt that the proposal that we should opt for a nuclear power station to meet a major proportion of our expected energy growth is very controversial. Within the extremes of the debate on this issue two-points clearly emerge.  First, <Col N="1742" /> there is a widespread and justifiable public concern about the possible consequences for this and future generations should we proceed to construct a nuclear station in any part of the country.  That concern largely centres around the problems of storage and disposal of nuclear waste products.  Most Members of the Oireachtas and the public at large were not sufficiently well informed on the issue involved to make a reasoned and final judgment on the matter.  That is why I was concerned about the precipitate decision of the Minister not to have a public inquiry but to go blandly ahead and give the ESB initial authorisation.  I think that was a very unwise decision and one which the Minister should not have opted for at this stage.</P>
    <P>The information provided in the discussion document on the costs of nuclear generation is now dated and inadequate. The document&mdash;Energy Ireland&mdash;made clear how rapidly the costs of nuclear plants have risen.  In 1973 it was estimated that a nuclear plant would cost about £120 million. The 1977 cost is £350 million.  I have no doubt that even if the ESB were given construction authorisation to proceed now, by the time we would be ready to undertake such work, the mid-eighties, the cost would be well into £600 or £700 million.  It is not clear in those estimates what associated costs have been included. We do not know the cost of land. Neither do we know the interest charges during construction nor the cost of such items as design, administration, storage and transmission or regulation and security services.  Neither do we know the system reserve margin.  None of these costings has been picked up in any tentative way by the Government nor have they been undertaken to any extent by the ESB.  Therefore, I am very sceptical about the need for such a station. Perhaps other diversification measures would provide the balance we need.  In these circumstances I am calling for a public inquiry into the matter.  Such an inquiry would afford an opportunity both to those in favour and to those opposed to the plan to put their case in the context of reasoned public and democratic debate.  If the Government <Col N="1743" /> arrive at a decision on this issue, and this seems likely, without the benefit of such an inquiry, the consequences could be very harmful.  We witnessed recently the way in which a small group of people, however ill-advised and whatever may have been the exercise of their lawful rights, can undermine major undustrial investment.  If the legitimate and understandable concern of a substantial number of people regarding the nuclear option are brushed aside by the Government and if these people are denied democratic participation in decisions, the planning and construction of any future generating capacity in the years ahead could be jeopardised seriously. The Government should bear our views in mind in this regard.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I am of the firm opinion that it would be most unwise and unjustifiable to proceed to a decision at Government level to construct a nuclear power station because principally of the serious shortcomings in present nuclear waste and disposal technology.  Regardless of who one speaks with, with the exception perhaps of those who are totally in favour of nuclear energy and even they have many reservations, one finds a clear recognition that both within the developed and the developing world the waste disposal aspect of nuclear energy is inadequate in terms of ensuring long-term public safety at an acceptable level of risk.  That is why in so many countries&mdash;Australia, Germany, Canada, and others&mdash;there has been massive opposition to the construction of nuclear stations.  It is a point of considerable importance that that opposition won through.</P>
    <P>There is need for massive research and development expenditure in regard to this issue before a decision is reached. I do not think that even the most committed supporter of the nuclear option would argue that that stage has been reached.  If there emerges a solution to the nuclear waste disposal problem and if at that time the projected demand-and-supply situation should warrant proceeding with the construction of a large, perhaps 650 MW station, and if the design of such a station were deemed to be of rigidly high standards in relation <Col N="1744" /> to public safety and health, the construction could be a viable proposition.  But if these conditions could not be satisfied&mdash;as of now they are not capable of being satisfied&mdash;a decision to construct should be deferred until the conditions could be met.  This would be the sensible approach on the part of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the question of the inter-connection with the EEC electricity grid, I am concerned that the discussion document appeared to dismiss to a degree the possibility of getting a substantial part of our future energy requirements in this way through the main British electricity network.  It is argued in the document that we would risk loss of national control by entrusting to non-Irish utilities the provision of a substantial part of our future electricity needs.  It is argued also that there are practical economic objections to any such proposal although these objections are not outlined in any detail.  It is argued, too, that the importation of a major part of our future electricity requirements would not be a realistic option.</P>
      <P>I accept that these arguments have a quasi-political appeal but I am not convinced that they accord with economic realities.  We have very little by way of indigenous energy resources and it seems that we shall have to depend largely on imported energy for the foreseeable future, regardless of whether that energy is in the form of oil, gas or ultimately uranium and whether it is imported on a primary basis as oil or coal or secondarily in the form of electricity. However, should oil and gas be found off our coast the situation would be transformed overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years we have relied for a large proportion of our needs in this <Col N="1745" /> regard on the import of oil.  Despite the diversification being proposed the Government predict that our dependence on oil will continue to increase up to 1990.  Presumably this oil will have to be imported if oil is not found off our coasts.  Likewise, the diversification proposed by the Minister, namely, to coal-fired generating stations will require increasing imports of coal. The realistic options at present are whether we continue to rely on foreign oil-wells or coal as against the ordinary utilities of the UK or the EEC. Therefore, I hold the view that the option of inter-connection with the EEC grid warrants further consideration and analysis and should not be rejected without good reasons being advanced to diversify seriously our energy supply sources.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is in essence to increase the capital allocation limits to the ESB.  I wish them well in their outstanding work at international consultancy level.  I would also hope that any shackles which the Minister tried to put on the ESB in his speech in relation to domestic consultancy work on the engineering side will be removed and that the ESB get, along with other State-sponsored bodies, full backing to go into the market place, to get work where they can find it, pay a decent wage to the professional staff involved, make a profit for the country and continue to provide a vital service to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It highlights a company who are doing a tremendous job for this country.  The ESB since they were founded in 1927 have vindicated the view that State participation can be very successful if operated by efficient people.  The ESB have always been able to lay on electricity supply wherever it was needed.  The lack of supply was never an impediment for foreign industrialists who wanted to come in here.  They always had in effect an entirely efficient service laid on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question now of raising additional moneys is to ensure the future well-being of this country regarding supplies of <Col N="1746" /> electricity.  The history of the ESB has been one of dedication and of ensuring that this country would be progressive. Some of the ESB generating stations are the most efficient in Europe and that speaks volumes for the technical expertise behind them.  That is borne out by the fact that the ESB have set up their own international consultancy service.  A vote of confidence in the ability of a small and young country in industrial know-how is indicated in that now the ESB are going to advise other countries on how to set up the whole network of electricity.  In addition to giving gainful employment to people within the industry here, the ESB are also providing a tremendous fund of technology to countries of the Third World.  This type of aid is very important and it is something that we as a nation can be proud of as we are making our presence felt in so many countries with our expertise. This development is good from the point of view of attracting industrialists, who will tend to come in because they will see that we have this expertise.  It is important that this be available not for export only but also for here.</P>
    <P>The ESB should be able to get into the business of selling their expertise on a competitive basis and the only way that company should operate is on a competitive basis.  The ESB should be encouraged to do this because it is important that expertise at all levels be given to industry here as well as abroad.  There should be nothing in any legislation which would impede the ESB from competing in any field.  There is a great desire now for conservation.  Obviously when you are dependent on imported fuel it is important to have a policy of conservation and the ESB have a major role here. A big area which is untapped is that of district heating.  The ESB seem rather reluctant to go into the field of district heating, although on the Continent it is very popular and widely used because through it they get maximum value from the fuel they are using.  It is time that the ESB examined this.  There is district heating for domestic use, and I believe there is also the possibility that a glass-house industry could be built around many of the generating stations, particularly those using turf where there is <Col N="1747" /> open space and bogland on which to build such an industry.  There is no doubt that the ESB could sell the water on which they have now to spend money for cooling purposes.  They could cut the cost that people have to pay for it by at least one-half and in doing this they would still be making a profit.  This is the type of conservation we should be talking about.  It is terrible to see hot water being pumped away when it could be used and re-circulated for the good of an industry.  Studies have been done on this but there is not much point in the studies if you cannot use the steam.  In my view this is something viable.  It is simple and I believe they should move on it quickly and rapidly.</P>
    <P>The area of domestic district heating is again a very feasible project.  It operates satisfactorily in other countries and it is reckoned to be roughly 90 per cent efficient.  We could heat whole towns by designing a plant to make this kind of operation vaible.  Before the oil crisis there was a tremendous boom in oil-fired central heating.  Oil has to be imported and we should involve ourselves in district heating in order to conserve energy.  Again, coal is an imported fuel. Both oil and coal are expensive fuels. District heating would be a positive approach and the Minister should ask the ESB to consider the feasibility of such a project.  There should be no reluctance. Growth areas like Blanchardstown, Tallaght and Clondalkin could be used as pilot schemes and, these being successful, the project would mushroom.</P>
    <P>Future energy planning is under fairly severe scrutiny because of the proposed nuclear power station.  Many people are not too happy about nuclear generating stations.  The Minister says he will not hold a public inquiry.  This is foolish.  A public inquiry would allay the fears that exist.  At such an inquiry the dangers and the safeguards could be spelled out.  The Minister should not hesitate.  Eventually public pressure may compel him to hold such an inquiry and the establishment of a nuclear power station should depend on the outcome of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>This is a completely new development for us and there is a risk.  It would be unwise for the Minister to continue his <Col N="1748" /> refusal.  Admittedly we cannot go on depending on imported fuels because our traditional suppliers might find themselves in a position in which they could no longer supply us.  That would be catastrophic.  We must examine into other sources of energy.  We all hope we will be successful in finding oil off our coast and further gas fields.  But we cannot live in hope.  There must be wise planning.  If people are convinced there is no real danger in a nuclear generating station and that the waste can be disposed of safely then the Government can decide to go ahead.  But the people should not be ignored.  They should be met and the problems and the advantages should be explained to them.  In that way objection can be circumvented.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister again to hold an inquiry.  This House should be sensitive to public opinion and to people's fears.  It is not enough for us to say everything will be all right.  A nuclear generating station will obviously cost a vast amount of money.  People are concerned and it behoves us and the Government to bring the thing out into the open through the medium of a proper public inquiry.  We are not experts in this area.  Therefore we would not have the knowledge required to say whether something is safe or whether it would be good for the country in the long term.  The time has come to involve the people in this if we are serious about open Government.  At the end of the day we would possibly have a nuclear station but we should consider harnessing other types of power such as solar energy and the vast amount of power in the sea, and money should be made available for research into this.  Have we fully explored all aspects of turf development, for instance?  We should not consider only nuclear power; we should keep our other options open.  Even if it is expensive initially the jobs created and the fact that we would use native resources, would offset those costs.  We have the expertise within the ESB and outside it to explore these areas and the EEC might give us a grant to develop research programmes.  Nuclear power should be a last resort because the servicing of capital to build a nuclear plant would be <Col N="1749" /> colossal.  experimentation in relation to other fuels and sources of supply should be ongoing.</P>
    <P>The ESB are probably the most progressive of all State enterprises.  The ESB have decentrailised their activities. There are generating stations in Kerry, Cork, Dublin and Portarlington and there are various peat stations, all of which are giving good employment. When everyone else was a bit slow to consider decentralisation the ESB went ahead with a programme of decentralisation. If the ESB became involved in nuclear power they will have to be very careful in relation to where they establish their plant and will have to have regard to the preservation of the environment. The plant will have to be placed where it can do the least damage.</P>
    <P>Turlough Hill in County Wicklow has been a great success in what I would call the storage of electricity.  In the off-peak periods they pump up the water and when it is required they filter it back into the grid.  When we sell electricity for domestic use we tend to create peaks which are very expensive to maintain because expensive plant must be available.  The ESB should consider introducing other programmes like Turlough Hill in an effort to keep costs down, and they should become more involved in commercial activity.  As well as being important from a conservation point of view it would have a high labour content.  The ESB, because of the type of plant they use, is a capital intensive industry but if they had an offshoot it would become labour intensive and would give a substantial amount of gainful employment.  It would also cut out the use of coal fires, thus creating a cleaner atmosphere.  It would also reduce our imports and our dependence on foreign fuels.  We should encourage the ESB to embark on such an operation.</P>
    <P>The ESB are a very progressive concern, not afraid to go into international activity, and for that reason I do not see any reason why they should not be encouraged to engage in new developments at home which would provide much more <Col N="1750" /> employment.  I welcome this measure.  It is a vote of confidence in the country.  In my view one way to judge the progress of a nation is by the consumption of electricity and the fact that our consumption of electricity has increased by 10 per cent means that we are progressing industrially.  By agreeing to this Bill the ESB can get on with further development to meet the needs of our industries.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the three Deputies who contributed but, but in some respects I was disappointed that only three spoke.  One of the matters I dealt with in my opening speech was the question of financing a new type of power station here, a major imported coal station, at a cost of £350 million.  I mentioned some of the problems that exist in regard to this, but coal is not a fashionable topic now.  The fashion of the day directs attention elsewhere. While this station which is dealt with in the Bill is a matter of fundamental importance to the country it is a pity that nobody bothered to talk about it here or outside.  On the other hand most of the discussion related to a topic which, as I specifically stated at the outset, is not included in the Bill.  These are the whims of fashion, and it is not for me to dictate what the fashion should be at any given time.  It may be that fashion will change next year or the year after and that something else would be the topic of conversation for discussion then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the House regards the progress of the ESB as good and is, in general terms, in support of their achievements and efforts.  With one exception about which there were reservations the House supported the plans and ideas of the ESB for the future.  On the question of the first two topics dealt with in the Bill, the question of consultancy, <Col N="1751" /> no reservations were expressed about the ESB's activities abroad, but Deputy Kelly raised the question of how much of the ESB's overseas activities might be described as taking the form of overseas development aid and how much of it was purely commercial.  I should like to tell the Deputy that it is all purely commercial in the sense that it is all paid for commercially, but about £200,000 worth of the turnover in the last two years could be regarded as overseas development aid.  That does not mean, as I understand it, that the ESB did the work for nothing; they were refunded from the World Bank and other such agencies who pay for such overseas activities to less developed countries.  I understand that the three countries involved are the Sudan, Tanzania and Lesotho.  The total spent by this country in overseas development aid in 1977 was £6.3 million while in 1978 it was £10.6 million, making a total of £16.9 million. The ESB's contribution would, in percentage terms, have been small.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, the ESB are obliged not to make a loss from these activities abroad and the same obligation applies to their activities at home. Deputy Desmond and Deputy O'Brien wondered why I made it incumbent on the ESB not to interfere in the traditional fields of consultancy here.  I did so for the good reason that applies to the ESB and any other semi-State body, that competition by them with existing private firms might be regarded, and frequently is regarded, as unfair.  One of the dangers is that a huge semi-State body with enormous resources like the ESB can bury its overheads and it is not truly competing in the sense that a private firm has to meet a great many overheads which are easily absorbed in other areas of the ESB or any other large semi-State body.  That is why there is frequently a feeling of unfairness when they enter into such fields.  It is in order to avoid that that I have made these stipulations.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the present position is that the relationship between the ESB and Irish consultants generally is now very good.  The fact is that the ESB have provided work for Irish consulting firms, architectural and engineering, <Col N="1752" /> as part of their work overseas and it is hoped that the spirit of co-operation will benefit the private and public sectors in securing further work overseas.  As I stated I have obliged the ESB to provide separate accounts for this field of activity to prevent, as much as one can, the possibility of some of the overheads being buried in other parts of the boards finances.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien referred to the question of district heating and of using some of the waste heat which is inevitably a by-product from many power stations. The position in this regard is that district heating in the sense in which that phrase is understood in countries like Denmark and others where they have brought this concept to a fairly advanced stage is not particularly satisfactory in this country. One of the problems is that the heat becomes available in the form of a low grade heat, generally speaking, at a temperature which is too low to make it very useful in itself at that level.  I am advised that it has to be upgraded if it is to be used effectively and that the capital cost involved is very great and in our circumstances in cases which have been studied it has been found not to be commercially justifiable.</P>
    <P>There has been a form of district heating in this country, not by the use of waste heat but the provision of heat for an entire block of flats or a series of blocks of flats.  There are two such instances to my knowledge, one at Ballymun, Dublin, and the other in a number of blocks of flats built by Galway Corporation in Galway.  Both these experiments, if one wishes to call them that, have not been very successful.  Both have given rise to a great volume of complaint and both would be unlikely to be repeated in the form originally designed. That is not to say that if proper adaptations are made and better standards of design and control in particular were now applied they might not be at least more successful than at present.  It is rather doubtful if these are very economic, because a great deal of heat is wasted unnecessarily which would not be wasted if dwellings were individually heated.  It may be possible&mdash;I certainly hope it will&mdash;for the architectural or <Col N="1753" /> engineering profession to achieve a standard of design in this regard suitable for Irish conditions and also economic.</P>
    <P>As regards the use of waste heat for greenhouses and horticultural or light industrial purposes there are possibilities. Some months ago I gave the go-ahead to the ESB to build a number of acres of greenhouses at Lanesboro', County Longford, immediately beside the generating station there.  I cannot remember the area but the project is for about 10 or 20 acres of greenhouses. They have begun building there now I think and I shall await with interest the outcome of this experiment over the next few years.  If it is successful I would envisage, in the first instance a similar operation being carried out in the immediate vicinity of the other turf burning generating stations in the midlands and perhaps some of the other non-turf burning stations might be suitably adapted to something on these lines, although clearly some of them cannot be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the ESB build these greenhouses themselves and go into the horticultural business?  Did the Minister give them any terms of reference on which to operate?</P>

      <P>An Foras Taluntais and the ESB will carry on a joint venture or a public sector venture if you like. The function of the ESB primarily is to supply the heat.  An Foras Taluntais will have to make the tomatoes, or whatever else it is, grow.  The Moneypoint station was briefly referred to in passing by Deputy Kelly in regard to pollution control. The figure which I mentioned to him of £20 million, an appalling amount of money to have to spend for this purpose, is the projected figure.  I understand it will be spent mainly on some apparatus which goes into the stacks to prevent emission of sulphurs and similar potentially harmful emissions from the burning of coal.  Planning permission has not yet been granted: it is being applied for within the next week or two. Hopefully, this will be granted early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke about some <Col N="1754" /> of the alternative energy sources which we should consider.  I should like to say a few words on this subject, although essentially I can only say what I have already said.  We should and I think do regard in the long term some of these alternative energy sources as potentially very valuable for us.  Probably they will be, but we must also face reality and, whether we like it or wish to accept it or not, we must admit that the view of everybody who has studied these matters including those who were in many cases passionately interested in some of these alternative energy sources is summed up in percentage terms in a document published by the Commission on 21 March 1978, No. 2412, new series, page 11, headed &ldquo;The Foreseeable Impact of Alternative Energy Sources on Community Energy Policy&rdquo;.  The view of the Commission is that by the year 2000, assuming all the experiments that are going on now are successful and that these alternative energy sources can be used to the extent expected and hoped for by then, they will on average supply, on the basis that we have economic growth of 4 per cent per annum in the Community up to then, between 4 per cent and 5 per cent of our energy needs. If we have 3 per cent economic growth, they will on average supply between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of our energy needs in the Community.  The percentages will not be significantly different for Ireland.  Realistically, I think that the highest percentage of energy obtained from these alternative sources that we could expect by the year 2000 is about five.  Much as one would like to promote these things&mdash;and certainly it suits us to do so&mdash;we would be very unwise to base any future policy or strategy on an assumption that we could expect anything more than a 5 per cent contribution from those sources by that time.</P>
    <P>From our point of view one of the potentially most useful of the alternative sources is wave power.  In the past two years there has been a considerable amount of research in this area.  The EEC are carrying out research off the west coast of Scotland to which we are contributing.  We pay a percentage of the cost and get the benefit of the results. <Col N="1755" /> The International Energy Agency are carrying out research off the coast of Japan.  We are contributing also towards that project and we are getting the benefit of the results.  As I see it, there is little point in our starting a third separate programme off the coast of Ireland, particularly as the west coast of Scotland so far as wave conditions are concerned is almost identical with the west coast of Ireland.  We have not the resources of the agencies and in my judgment it is better value for us to pay our percentage&mdash;normally it is not a big one&mdash;and get the benefit of what they are doing rather than try to do it on our own on a small scale and in a haphazard way.</P>
    <P>So far as other possibilities of alternative energy are concerned, one that obviously would be of some value to us is biomass in one form or other, but it is not that easy.  The ESB are starting experiments under the aegis of the EEC or the International Energy Agency.  They will start in the small hand-won turf-burning power station at Cahirciveen, County Kerry.  It is calculated that if they could get 30,000 acres of land to produce vegetation for that station, on the basis that they would need 4,000 or 5,000 acres each year and that the turnover would be every five or six years, if they could do all of that, if they could get the stuff to grow and if the conversion process could be brought to the standard of efficiency one would like, then it would be possible in seven or eight years to run the Cahirciveen station at full capacity.  When in full production the station would generate five megawatts of electricity, but by that time our installed capacity will probably exceed 4,000 megawatts.  Therefore, we are talking in terms of a fraction of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is only realistic for us to say here that the prospect of the ESB getting 30,000 acres of land in Kerry at a reasonable price on which to grwo scrub wood or weeds or whatever form the vegetation would take is not great.  I am not mentioning these points to throw water on the experiments or on the ideas but to try to bring some sense of reality into the minds of people who tend to be <Col N="1756" /> carried away by the possibilities that they think may exist in this area.  Even if all matters went well&mdash;a fairly large assumption&mdash;even if all difficulties with regard to acquisition and experimentation were overcome, the amount of electricity that would be generated would be minimal in the context of national needs.</P>
    <P>Another area that has been mentioned and where there are obvious possibilities for us is wind power, but it is not quite so obvious as it might seem at first sight. One of the difficulties is that it can generate electricity only while the wind is blowing and the wind does not blow all that often in this country.  It blows at a reasonable rate considerably less than half the time each day.  It would not be tenable for the IDA to inform an incoming foreign industrialist that he could be given plenty of power in a certain area but that he would have to close his factory when the wind stops blowing.</P>
    <P>At the present stage of development, wind power has a serious environmental drawback, namely, that if it is proposed to build a wind generator or a windmill of sufficient size to give any kind of contribution even on the most local scale it is likely to exceed several hundred feet in height and the noise it will inevitably create when working is such that nobody can live within a reasonable distance. The noise has been described as worse than the noise from a jumbo jet or Concorde taking off.  It is a continuous noise.</P>
    <P>Of course work is being done on all of these matters and one would hope that in the next five or ten years as experiments continue the position will improve. However, there is not a great degree of realism in thinking that wind power will make a major contribution to the national grid.  I could see it making a worthwhile contribution in very localised areas, for example, on an offshore island or where there could be a standby generator, but it would mean that it would be necessary to generate from oil for more than 50 per cent of the time and that would make the operation costly. There is no way the electricity can be stored, except perhaps in batteries, but the amount that can be stored in this <Col N="1757" /> way is very small.  Undoubtedly wind power could make a contribution to individual houses.  One of my colleagues assures me that he heats his house satisfactorily from wind only because where he is situated is not connected to the national grid.  Undoubtedly small local contributions of that kind can be made, but we have to concern ourselves with the provision of electricity on a large scale for the industrial, commercial and domestic consumer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spent some time criticising some parts of the Green Paper which I issued last July.  In fairness to him, he said he found it generally a useful, helpful and clear document, but he took exception to the chapter on energy conservation which he regarded as less than satisfactory.  He also took exception to the rather general terms and the nonspecialist approach of the document.  I should like to refer the Deputy to Chapter 1, section 1, paragraph 1 and line 1 which stated:</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this discussion document is to give general information on current energy problems in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is what the Green Paper does.  It is not purporting to be a specialist document. When we decided to produce the document in January or February this year one of the first things I did in relation to it was to make the decision whether we were going to go for a specialised document, full of the most detailed information, projections, calculations and everything else or a relatively brief, general document that could be useful to laymen who were not engineers or not deeply involved in the whole power energy question.  I took the decision, and so instructed my Department, that we were to go for a relatively simple document comprehensible to the average person in this country.  I think we achieved that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could have taken the opposite decision and produced some <Col N="1758" /> learned document that perhaps not 50 people in the entire country would have read.  It is possible&mdash;if there was sufficient time available to the officials of the Department&mdash;that we could produce a document of the kind Deputy Kelly suggested might be helpful.  I have no doubt it would be helpful to some experts. We could perhaps give it a limited circulation to the 30, 40 or 50 people in the country who would be interested, but I would not see much point in producing it as a Government document for public consumption because it would be of no interest to the great majority of people. It is fair to say that this document has achieved much of what it set out to do.  It has explained certain basic considerations in regard to our energy problems in fairly clear language.  It has set out, in as fair a way as it can, in as open a way as it can, the various possible alternatives open to us.  It has also set out the fact that there are certain alternatives not open to us&mdash;although they may well be popularly believed to be so&mdash;and the document would be failing in its duty if it did not demonstrate through the facts that certain alternatives are not open to us, much as some of us might wish they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly went on to deal with the conservation chapter.  I agree that it is not one of the more stimulating parts of the paper.  But of necessity, at the time it was written, it could not appear as advanced perhaps as we would wish to have it.  One of the areas in which there is the greatest scope for conservation is in the general housing and construction area, as I think was mentioned by Deputies O'Brien, Desmond and Kelly. For that reason I have had fairly lengthy discussions and correspondence with the Minister for the Environment who is more or less solely in charge of that area so far as the Government are concerned. I think it is fair to say I have made a fair deal of progress; I have not yet made as much progress as I would wish to; hopefully I can make more in the months ahead.  The Minister for the Environment will be announcing shortly various measures in relation to housing which will be made compulsory in aid of an energy conservation programme.  As <Col N="1759" /> he has said to me, it does not at this stage go as far as he would wish.  We will continue to work on it and hope to develop it further over the next year or two.</P>
    <P>One example of the kind of things involved&mdash;and I am not going to go into detail about them, give a comprehensive list or anything else because that will be a matter for the Minister for the Environment to do, as I understand he will be doing shortly&mdash;is that I put it to him that if anybody is installing a fireplace in a house, either new or old, in this country at present, is it not the height of lunacy not to put in a back boiler? Could we not achieve the situation in which it would be illegal, in the sense that one would not get a grant, if one did not put in a back boiler?  I am glad to say he has accepted the validity of that argument.  There is a tremendous amount of electricity and energy in various forms wasted in this country heating water in houses where there is often constantly a fire lighting, where the heat of that fire&mdash;which is heating one room only&mdash;could be heating the water that the people concerned are spending £1, £2, £3 or £4 a week heating separately in an electrically-operated cylinder or whatever.  There are quite a number of possibilities of that kind.  I mentioned the back boiler in a fireplace simply as an example of one way we could achieve energy conservation.  Unfortunately one cannot achieve it as rapidly as one would wish because building standards are not things that can be changed overnight; it has to be done over a period of time and in disappointingly gradual steps from my point of view.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the matters raised in this debate other than the one spoken about at most length by the three contributors, that is, the question of the possibility of the ESB building a nuclear power station in this country.  Although I specifically stated in my opening speech that the moneys being allowed for under this Bill did not cover that project but covered Moneypoint and a number of smaller ones like the turf stations at Lanesborough, Shannonbridge, Aghada and Poolbeg, it would be necessary to <Col N="1760" /> promote further legislation of this kind in a few years time assuming that it was decided to go ahead with the proposal of the ESB as approved by the Government on 28 November 1973.  Notwithstanding that, I suppose because of the sort of interest or emotion it seems to engender, a great deal of the discussion of the three Deputies was related to this nuclear proposal.</P>

      <P>We had a very useful discussion.  I listened very carefully to what Deputy Kelly had to say.  While he has a habit of racing away into clouds of unreason at times, he was more objective and basic today and, I felt, had his feet on the ground to an extent that is almost unusual for him.  Deputy O'Brien had some reasonable things to say also. Deputy Kelly probably had no real alternative but to do so, but he made it clear that he personally had no objection to nuclear power.  He sees the advantages and probably, in the Irish context&mdash; although he did not say so in so many words&mdash;feels that it probably is the right or wise thing for us to do and have it available in ten or 11 years time, or whatever.  However, he urges on me the advisability of having what he calls, and what people in the newspapers call, a public inquiry.  He was good enough to go on to define the position, that there is no provision in Irish law for any such inquiry to take place&mdash;there is no precedent for it; he does not know who is going to do it, who could do it, or when, where or how they could do it. Nonetheless he feels we should have some kind of inquiry.  He went on to say that he understood why I cannot view the proposal with any enthusiasm. Indeed he articulated, from my point of view extremely well and fairly the kinds of reservations that I, or any Minister, would have when faced with a demand for something rather nebulous that you know is not going to achieve anything. While accepting my point of view Deputy Kelly still said that he thought we should have one&mdash;I will paraphrase him, I hope not unfairly&mdash;that it would allow people to let off steam, that if an <Col N="1761" /> inquiry was held, irrespective of its result, agitation or fear on the part of a lot of people concerned would die down. Deputy Kelly very readily admitted and accepted&mdash;as I recognise&mdash;the fact that, of course, a lot of the people involved in this, no matter what results were achieved or what facts were proved, would never be satisfied anyway.  He said I had to live with that.  I recognise that I will have to live with it because they are never going to be satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be, as the Deputy is aware, a full and comprehensive investigation of the planning application by Wexford County Council. My experience of Wexford County Council, both elected members and officials, is that they are no less competent or able than their counterparts in Dublin Corporation.  I have every confidence that they can conduct an adequate investigation. The comparison the Deputy draws, if it is valid, can be covered perfectly adequately by the possibility here.  If anybody objects to whatever decision the Wexford County Council comes to they can now, unlike in the case of the Dublin Bay oil definery project, apply to a planning board, who are independent of the Government and the Minister of the day.  That was not open at the time of the Dublin Bay oil refinery proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going through, in a general way, what Deputy Kelly had been saying and I was saying that I appreciate, and that he seems to appreciate, some of my difficulties. He recognised them.  While he agreed that nothing in the real sense could be achieved by an inquiry he suggested that, as a public relations exercise or as a means of getting people to let off steam, some form of inquiry might be generated.  That would be an easy way out for me if we could have some such thing.  I do not know who is supposed to hold it.  Normally inquiries are held by High Court judges.  I do not know whether any member of the High Court <Col N="1762" /> or of the Supreme Court feels himself any more competent than anyone else to inquire into a matter such as this.  There are two possible aspects of what might be inquired into.  One is the whole question of safety of the operation of such a station.  But everybody seems to forget that in 1971 this House passed the Nuclear Energy Act which set up a board to look at and cover exactly those points and to advise the Minister of the day on all these aspects.  In particular the Nuclear Energy Board has a duty to licence each and every individual step in the process of applying for and building a nuclear project whether it is a generating station or anything else; for example, it could be one of the machines in St. Luke's Hospital which use radioactive material and the Nuclear Energy Board would also be responsible in the last resort for its safety and for licencing and installations and so on. They are forgotten about.  I do not want to write them off; they are competent people and they should not be disregarded or ignored or written off as of no consequence.</P>
    <P>There is the other point in relation to an inquiry.  It is a relatively modest, small conventional station which we propose to build here.  There are over 300 of them in commercial operation in the world and another 200 or so under construction.  Is the one we propose in any way different from these hundreds of others?  Will any new information or knowledge be gleaned by a technical inquiry into the operating aspects of a conventional station like that?  I do not think so.  On the other hand a lot of people might think there would be something to be gained by it and Deputy Kelly suggests that even if there is no knowledge gained we should go through the motions of having the inquiry anyway. There may well be merit in that approach although it is not very constructive and it will probably cost a lot of money and will cause all sorts of repercussions.</P>
    <P>As I see it this demand for an inquiry seems to have arisen only in the last 12 months at about the same time as the Windscale Inquiry began in Britain.  Up to that time there was no question of it; <Col N="1763" /> people did not know what an inquiry was and there was no question of it.  Suddenly Windscale started and it went on for three or four months.  It cost hundreds of thousands of pounds if not millions of pounds and it finally ended up with the judge and his advisers or assessors who conducted the inquiry telling the British Government that it was perfectly safe to go ahead with Windscale. Within five minutes of the findings being given the people who had asked for the inquiry in the first place said that the results of it should be disregarded, and that it was all rubbish.  As Deputy Kelly rightly says we would be faced here with the same situation.  One wonders whether one should commit a great deal of public money and a great deal of time to something that is really not going to achieve anything in the long run and which is not going to give us any technical information or safety control knowledge which we do not already have or cannot acquire very easily from abroad.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear in this House and in public on several occasions that I have no objection in principle to an inquiry into this or into any other matter provided it can serve some useful purpose. I have invited those who seek it to tell me what useful purpose it can achieve in the sense of what knowledge can it give us that we do not have at our disposal.  The first answer I have got to that question that I have been asking for, perhaps, six months was from Deputy Kelly today.  I hope I do not paraphrase him unfairly or inaccurately, but in effect what he told me was that I would get no information from an inquiry; I would learn nothing new; it would achieve nothing new and I was perfectly right in saying that the people involved are not reasonable anyway.  Some of them are reasonable, of course, but I agree with Deputy Kelly that many of them are not.  They just have a fixation about this thing, a whim of fashion at the moment, which will move on to some other area in a year or two.  Deputy Kelly said that I would gain nothing in the sense of any knowledge or any new information <Col N="1764" /> that I do not have already to make the thing work better or operate more safely or anything else, but at the same time I would allay public fear or anxiety in some way by allowing people to go in and give evidence and, as it were, get it off their chest.  There may well be some merit in that.  That is the first answer that I have got to this question which I have been posing for six months.  It is not a very satisfactory and compelling answer but it is something to go on and it is something that I will think about.  It is worth thinking about.  Often there have been situations in life, not least in political life, where it can be worthwhile going through the motions of some operation although one knows that it is not going to achieve very much.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of things that might be inquired into by such an inquiry, if one could envisage how to set it up and with whom, would be the question of the general economics of the whole matter and the cost of it.  I can only say to Deputy Kelly or to anybody else who makes suggestions on these lines that neither this Government nor any other Government, whatever party or parties it may be formed by, could contemplate a situation where major economic decisions for this country were, in effect, going to be made by a High Court judge or by a High Court judge and a technical assessor or an engineer or somebody like that.  The making of major economic decisions for the future of this country is a matter for the Government, and if the Government of the day fail to make them they are failing in their duty and should be kicked out.</P>
    <P>Here we have it being suggested that this matter should be the subject of a long public inquiry and that the whole cost aspect of it, the economics of it and the projected demand and all the rest of it should be inquired into by some public inquiry which, in practice here, means a High Court judge.  At the very moment that this request is being made a decision of the most enormous consequences for this country, literally 100 times more important than the matter we are discussing here today, is going to have to be made over the next month or so in relation to the European Monetary System <Col N="1765" /> and there is no question of inquiries there or anything else.  I do not exaggerate when I say from the long-term point of view of the country that it is 100 times more important than the matter we are discussing today.  The matter we are discussing today has roughly the same cost and the same output of electricity as the coal generating station at Moneypoint, County Clare, which I referred to earlier.  That is not the subject of any comment at all other than a passing inquiry as to what the cost of the pollution control mechanisms in it would be.</P>
    <P>I have talked in some detail on my feelings in regard to this question.  I hope I have responded as openly, objectively and fairly as I can to what I feel were reasonably argued and reasonably sound arguments which were put to me. I feel for the first time ever that some form of answer was given today to the question which I have been continually posing over the last six months, that is what would such an inquiry achieve?  I was told that it will not achieve anything as far as knowledge and safety are concerned but it will achieve some lessening of public anxiety which some people here and particularly abroad are trying to generate among ordinary people.</P>
    <P>I accept, as Deputy Kelly said, that at least half, and perhaps more of the people who are voicing reservations at the moment are genuinely doing so.  I am equally adamant that a fair proportion of them are not genuine at all and are not prepared to accept any reasoning or objectivity in regard to this matter. However, for the reason that it was put forward today by Deputy Kelly I am prepared to consider if we could manufacture some means for having some type of inquiry.  As the Deputy said there is no precedent for it and there seem to be no provisions in law under which such an inquiry could be held. Deputy O'Brien made an interesting point that the public anxiety aspect of the Dublin Bay oil refinery proposal was got over because there was a pretty full investigation at the planning level and that there was a public hearing by the planning authority.  There is nothing to stop Wexford County Council following the same procedure if they want to.</P>

      <P>Both of them could do it.  I suggested that at an earlier stage, but I was told by some people that even though there could be full public inquiries at local level and Bord Pleanála level a third and separate inquiry would be needed.  I could not see what the third one would do that the other two could not other than go into the economics of it, which would not be relevant to a planning application although all the other aspects of it would.</P>

      <P>It is not for me to lay down the law to them about how they should conduct their affairs.  I simply say, in the light of what Deputy O'Brien says, that they may well consider having inquiries in relation to those applications heard in public.  It is entirely a matter for them, but in the light of what Deputy O'Brien says it might be very useful and very helpful.  It might alleviate some of the anxieties which exist at the moment. If some form of public inquiry, whether at the planning level, the Bord Pleanála level or any other level which it were possible to create were held we would have trooping over here to give evidence on their solemn oath all the professional evidence givers in relation to nuclear energy who turn up at every inquiry, objection and everything else all over the world and who are guaranteed to come out pat with all the usual stuff they have come out with in every other country and have been overruled.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as we said on a number of occasions, is fundamentally non-contentious.  I hope the Bill will not merely be one for legislators and people who have a particular knowledge of the law but that it will in a very meaningful way protect housewives and consumers in the manner in which they spend their household budgets.  I have spoken to a number of people, apart from my wife, who do their household shopping, in order to have a deeper appreciation of their problems.  I have no doubt that this Bill will help them provided it is not too complex and legal.  The relevance of a Bill like this depends for its success on the degree to which it is seen to be one to which the ordinary man in the street can have recourse.  It is very important that any Bill which is for the ordinary man as against one which is exclusively for areas of commerce or industry should have associated with it literature which need not be a legal document but would help to make the Bill simple and clear to the man and woman in the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average housewife would not find his Bill exciting reading, nor would she find it very clear at first glance.  The explanatory <Col N="1768" /> memorandum, because of its many references to the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, and other legislation, is also a little off-putting.  I would ask the Minister of State to consider having her Department produce a very simple leaflet outlining in clear language what the Bill sets out to do and what recourse the ordinary shopper has if he feels he is getting short change, literally or metaphorically, from anyone with whom he enters into a contract of sale.</P>
    <P>It is very important and timely that emphasis should be put on getting the maximum amount of interest and support for this Bill.  Over the next few months we will see a spate of consumer buying, and a great deal of this will be of imported goods.  Imports are growing and it is very difficult for the shopper to come to grips with many of the problems which buying imported goods can produce.  Some dumping is going on and it is difficult for a Government, but extremely difficult for a shopper, to deal with the problems which arise from the sale of shoddy imported goods. Therefore, it is very important that this Bill makes a telling impact on the public.</P>
    <P>The only way this can be done, in my view, is for the Department to produce a simple leaflet and distribute it all over the country.  Perhaps the National Prices Commission could incorporate in one of their reports a simple breakdown of what is in the Bill.  Even that might not be going far enough because, despite the fact that these reports are supposed to be widely available to housewives, they are not really documents which are purchased by housewives.  If anyone takes issue with this statement the print order of the National Prices Commission would clearly indicate that there is not massive public interest in or a very large scale sale of their reports.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is to make an impact, it is very important that the minds of the people in the Department and the Minister of State consider how this Bill will affect the daily commerce of the housewife and the shopper.  I am sure the Minister of State would not be happy if this legislation were put on a shelf and forgotten.  I would like to see it being <Col N="1769" /> reviewed after one and two years to see what impact it has made and to see if more need be done to put its message across.</P>
    <P>There are two ways in which progress could be made in this area.  We have a number of consumer bodies, foremost among them are the Irish Housewives' Association, the Consumers' Council of Ireland, and the Irish Countrywomen's Association, which represent the consumer interest.  It is regrettable that these bodies have been subjected to a number of stresses and strains in recent years. These stresses and strains normally arise because the bodies are not adequately funded, despite the fact that they seek to do a very good job in the interests of their members.</P>
    <P>There is room for these groups to go a little way towards helping the Minister of State achieve the desired result. Therefore, I would strongly suggest that she provide substantial financial grants to these three bodies and any other organisation representing the consumer interest, to ensure that this Bill, and other consumer legislation which she has implicitly and explicitly promised, will make an impact on the public consciousness and be seen to be relevant and meaningful.</P>
    <P>The truth is that we have more legislation on our Statute Book which is never referred to or invoked than legislation which is used, and none of us would want to be party to a situation where this legislation would join that little-used library.  Accordingly, I would be grateful if the Minister of State would turn her mind to the possibility of giving substantial financial aid to these organisations so that they could structure their activities and employ the necessary officers or executives to ensure that they play their part in making this Bill effective.</P>
    <P>If the housewife is not educated to what is in this Bill, if the consumer organisations are not structured and aided to ensure that this legislation is full and adequate, I cannot see how this legislation, which the Minister of State had already referred to as being a lawyer's Bill, is going to be meaningful. It would be very regrettable if legislation which had the unanimous support of this House were lost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> The Explanatory Memorandum sets out the pros and cons of this legislation and a great deal of it is extremely relevant. There are one or two new developments coming to the fore and perhaps the Minister would consider amendments to this legislation on Committee Stage, or later by introducing another Bill.  Recently we saw a spate of auction-type sales which do not come under this legislation.  There are other types of selling which in some cases are of a slightly questionable nature because it is impossible to trace the person with whom the purchaser is alleged to be dealing.  This would tend to weaken the impact of a Bill like this.  The few people who are involved in nefarious commerce will react to legislation like this by looking for a way around it, even if this means roadside trading, door-to-door selling or direct mail.</P>
    <P>It is important that any Bill which deals with daily or weekly commerce of a nature which is in itself flexible and subject to changes in marketing, selling techniques and so on, should be similarly flexible and easily changed and not, after years of lobbying, drafting, coming too late to meet particular trends which are probably on the way out.</P>
    <P>I spent a great deal of time in the past studying selling techniques.  Marketing and advertising techniques are a science, not a game of chance.  The wiles of that profession, and I use that word in its kindest sense, are such that the Minister of State should go as far as she can to ensure that her Department are sufficiently geared to cope with it.  For example, we have 35 advertising agencies in Dublin city.  Many of them do a very good job selling for their clients and letting the housewife know the wide range of goods which are available.</P>
    <P>However, I have often wondered why these various agencies and some of the marketing organisations who daily promote products vociferously and strongly are allowed to operate without ever having to assess in any scientific way the merits of the products they are promoting.  If, say, a retailer sells a bar of chocolate which is found subsequently to contain a foreign body, the agent who may have promoted the sale of that <Col N="1771" /> chocolate has no responsibility, either moral or legal, for the defect.  The responsibility rests with the retailer although in practice a retailer could hardly be expected to unwrap each bar of chocolate and inspect it before selling. That sort of situation is both unfair and unjust.  Responsibility in relation to the sale of goods should be distributed across the spectrum so as to include the various links in the chain&mdash;the manufacturer, the wholesaler, the retailer, the advertising agent and anybody else associated with the goods.  I am not suggesting that each category should set up a laboratory for the purpose of testing goods scientifically but more thought should be given to the present situation which seems to place extraordinary pressure on the retailer, at least in the legal sense, while there is no pressure on the growing advertising area in this regard.</P>
    <P>Those involved in this kind of advertising are strengthening their scientific guise and technique in bringing to the attention of young people and those who are not so young, the various products coming on to the market.  The volume of literature of an advertising nature is enormous in the sort of consumer society that we have now.  Increasingly, as basic needs are being met there is recourse to products of dubious value which in many cases we would be better off without.  Therefore, the technique in regard to the sale of such products has to be all the more scientific in approach. But I suppose they are a means of keeping some people in employment and are helping in terms of the revenue of the economy.  What is important is that the people involved in selling the various goods should be subject to scrutiny because selling involves more than merely the cash transaction at the counter. Selling can be at a number of levels&mdash;subconscious, pre-conscious and unconscious.  Anybody involved in advertising is very skilled at aiming the selling technique at all three levels.</P>
    <P>There is not much in the Bill in this area but perhaps this is intentional. However, it is an area of selling because in many cases the sale does not take <Col N="1772" /> place within a shop but has been effected long before the consumer goes to the shop.  Consequently, we must ensure that standards of sale, standards of contract and so on are above board in every sense before the shopper reaches the point of parting with cash.  Perhaps the Minister will refer to this aspect when replying.</P>
    <P>There are three pleas I wish to make. The first is that the Minister set about the task of trying to convey in the widest possible sense to the public the impact not only of this Bill but of other consumer legislation which may be about to be produced and to produce in sufficient quantity advisory-type literature, making it available widely and if necessary utilising the schools, since young people now have a good deal of spending power.  It is important, too, that such literature be made available to consumer organisations.  In this way we should be able to get more readily an appreciation of the deficiencies that may be inherent in any such legislation.  From the daily experience of housewives and, indeed, of the growing number of househusbands, if one may use the term, it is evident that there are certain weaknesses in regard to the alleged qualities of some of the products that are advertised.  If legislation of this kind is not circulated widely, its importance will not impinge sufficiently on the public.  In addition, suppliers, shopkeepers and all those involved in commerce in a genuine and reasonable way will not be given the opportunity of appreciating fully what such legislation involves.  That sort of situation would also be contrary to the interests of the people for whom the Minister is concerned.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made through the schools to incorporate some measure of consumer education.  This is not happening in any real sense except in girls' schools in the context of domestic science although there may be some degree of consumer education in civics courses.  Of course it is not the function of this Minister to be concerned with school curricula but it falls within the over-all context of making people aware of the kind of pitfalls that exist in relation to the consumer market.  To this extent <Col N="1773" /> the Minister could co-operate with the Minister for Education in having legislation of this kind made known in the classroom because it is in those earlier years that people are at their most formative in terms of accepting this type of information.  The buying habits of many housewives are now set and there would be some difficulty in changing those habits but every effort should be made to educate the young people in these matters.</P>
    <P>My second plea relates to consumer organisations.  These organisations should be given now the breaks and the finance to which they are entitled.  It would be a very timely gesture for the Government to emphasise to these bodies the role they can play in ensuring that this type of legislation will be effective. I have in mind such organisations as the Irish Housewives' Association, the ICA and the Consumer Association. I am sure that as they have responded in the past, they would respond magnificently to a direct approach from the Minister to the effect that the Government would be prepared to provide sufficient cash for the structure of their organisations in order to ensure that consumer legislation is brought to the attention of members so that weaknesses could be detected at an early stage and rectified.  We must remember that these organisations are doing work which the Government would have to do otherwise in the interest of protecting the consumer.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong if a debate on this legislation were seen to be in some way contrary to the interest of manufacturers, retailers or wholesalers.  Each of these links in the chain need and depend on one another for the successful and fruitful transaction of their business. Consequently, I am sure that this Bill will be welcomed by retailers as much as it will be welcomed by wholesalers and manufacturers apart from the undoubted welcome that the consumers will have for it.</P>
    <P>The only link in the chain that might not be very enthusiastic would be people who have something to be concerned about, but there is no need to shed tears for such people whom I expect are in a <Col N="1774" /> minority although that would be difficult to quantify.  The Bill should be a major step on the way to ridding society for all time of the shady dealer.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of advertising this Bill massively and supporting consumer organisations, I would like to see the Bill open to flexible amendment and to review at an early stage because of the science and modern methods incorporated in selling techniques at present. Legislation by its nature is essentially reactionary.  It reacts usually at a late stage to trends which have emerged. Trends in selling technique change very rapidly and are informed by changing market conditions in other countries.  It would be a pity if our legislation was so inflexible that it could not respond rapidly to new techniques coming on to the market.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister of State to turn her mind to the area of the advertising agencies and the other links in the chain, some of whom do not seem to have any sense of responsibility at all for the goods propagated by them, while the retailer at least is legally responsible if he finds some problem with the products which he sells, and quite rightly so.  The manufacturer, the whoesaler and the advertiser should in some way be joined under the umbrella of responsibility, or there should be some system which will apportion responsibility equally.  It does not seem reasonable that a shopkeeper can be hauled into court because a foreign body has been found in, say, a piece of soap or a bar of chocolate, whereas the advertiser on the television screen the previous evening who propagated the sale of that article, or the wholesaler who sold the article to the shopkeeper or the manufacturer who has produced it, is less legally responsible. That seems to be an anomaly.  The moral and legal responsibility should rest right across the spectrum.  If it does the opportunities which occur daily for transgressions with regard to commercial transactions will simply diminish and the need for recourse to this type of legislation will similarly diminish.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to try to ensure that this Bill in a very simple form&mdash;not as a legal document but as a <Col N="1775" /> four-page illustrated leaflet&mdash;would be distributed to housewives through various organisations so that it will make an impact and will be seen to be something about which we are all serious.  I hope that this legislation will not just gather dust on the shelves of the Library of the Oireachtas or the libraries of other small groups who may or may not be interested in observing it.  I appreciate that the Minister of State has given great thought to this, but I suggest respectfully to her that if these three steps are taken this legislation will be a real step forward in the direction of a consumers' charter.  Everybody on this side of the House wishes the Bill every success and will do everything possible to ensure its successful implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very timely. It is non-contentious and its acceptance by the Opposition as a good Bill is a real indication that such new legislation to give protection to the consumer is badly needed and long overdue.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.  It has been claimed that it differs very little from the Consumer Information Bill circulated in 1977.  That may be so, but most Deputies will agree that the important aspect and the overriding factor is that the Minister has brought in the Bill and the Irish consumer, the housewife and the various groups are very pleased that this has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was correct in describing the Bill as a very complex and technical legal measure.  I hope that by its very nature it will not confuse or baffle the average customer or consumer into feeling that nothing much has really changed.  The old Sale of Goods Act, 1893, in its time was very good legislation and up to this day it is being invoked successfully in consumers' claims against suppliers where complaints of defective goods or services arise.  One of the bigger difficulties facing the dissatisfied and unhappy customer is that of proving that an article was defective at the time of purchase.  Very often the manufacturer or supplier, having examined an allegedly defective article, can <Col N="1776" /> issue a highly practical and perhaps technical report on his findings.  This very likely will leave the consumer completely flat-footed and at a loss with no option but to pursue such a claim through legal channels through the courts.  Most people will not do this for one reason or another.  Therefore, where technical or mechanical goods are involved, whether it be machinery, a car, TV, a sewing machine or whatever, this may continue to be a problem irrespective of what legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>There is the other side of the coin. Fortunately a very great number of manufacturers and suppliers are reputable and from a commercial and business viewpoint they are often very readily disposed to extending goodwill to their customers.  Faults or problems will occur early on in an article, resulting perhaps from misuse or not following the manufacturer's recommendations properly.  It is important that legislation visualise such eventualities and accordingly make provision to ensure that a supplier is equally protected against wrongful or false claims.  Because of the very high level of imports a very large percentage of manufactured products are sold through distribution to the retailer and eventually on to the user or consumer.  By the nature of this chain the consumer not satisfied with the quality of the article and wishing to make a claim on the manufacturer may have a very long way to go before getting to the manufacturer.  Such manufacturers may very well be operating on the far side of the world, such is the extent nowadays of long-distance trading.</P>
    <P>I recognise that sale of goods contracts rests between the seller and the buyer.  I have referred to the situation that can arise under such circumstances, but very often in such a case a third party may settle a claim in order to satisfy a customer and maintain goodwill but may not receive the backing of the manufacturer.  This can be a problem.</P>

      <P>I should mention, however, that some time ago Ireland, together with a number of other countries, was asked informally if it could provide a limited number of civilian police for the UN Transitional Assistance Group which it was proposed to establish in Namibia, South West Africa.  The setting up of this UN operation has, however, been delayed pending the outcome of negotiations at present under way in regard to the future of the territory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the prisoners in question have been convicted of a variety of criminal offences, many of them very serious ones, I cannot accept the inference in the Deputy's question <Col N="1778" /> that they can appropriately be described as political prisoners.</P>
      <P>I will continue to use all the channels open to me to keep myself as informed as is possible on the situation in the prison at Long Kesh which is obviously a cause for concern from a humanitarian point of view.  I must, however, point out that a major obstacle to any attempt to have conditions in the prison improved is the fact that, apart from those motivated by humanitarian considerations, many of those associated with the protest and in a position to influence the situation have shown themselves only too ready to exploit the condition of the prisoners and the anguish of their families in a cynical pursuit of propaganda material.</P>

In the name of humanity, would the Minister get moving on this deplorable situation which exists and which will produce corpses before Christmas arrives?

      <P>The Deputy will be well aware that I made a very definite distinction between those concerned for humanitarian reasons and those who are, and I repeat, cynically using this for propaganda purposes.  If the Deputy finds that cynical then I shall have to record my disagreement with him.  I can assure the Deputy that I have been at all times and at all levels in constant communication because of our concern for humanitarian conditions.  Let not that, however, be misunderstood as connoting any support for those who use the conditions of these prisoners for propaganda material.  May I remind the Deputy, too, that even while this campaign is being promoted those who use it for propaganda purposes have shown a total disregard for the most fundamental human rights.  We have seen evidence of that on more than one occasion recently, and that is what I mean when I talk about a cynical pursuit of propaganda material.</P>

Let me also assure the Deputy that I and my Department have been in constant contact with the appropriate authorities at every level on this matter and I will welcome any further information which will enable me to express the concern of the Government on humanitarian grounds.  But let me repeat again that those who are using this for propaganda purposes are cynically using the prisoners and their families and are proving both by their words and their actions that they are not concerned about conditions about which humanitarian people are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish citizens at present serving prison sentences in Britain have been convicted of criminal offences under British law.</P>
      <P>Where appropriate, the cases of individual prisoners in Britain and indeed other foreign countries are raised with the competent authorities.  General questions, such as the removal of prisoners from association (commonly referred to as &ldquo;solitary confinement&rdquo;) are also kept under continuous review and are pursued with the competent authorities as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The question of whether the conditions of prisoners in Britain infringe the Convention of Human Rights is for the organs of the Convention to determine. Applications have been lodged with the Commission on behalf of a number of prisoners but have not yet been determined. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on these cases at this stage.  Where any prisoner abroad or his immediate family feel that the conditions of imprisonment are such as to warrant intervention on his behalf, the matter should be raised either directly with me or with the appropiate Irish Embassy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

Secondly, is he aware that there is available firsthand information of the abuse some of these prisoners have suffered, the injuries and damage done to them in a personal physical sense, and whether he, as Minister, has <Col N="1782" /> been doing and will do or has any way of doing anything in regard to alleviating this dreadful situation?

      <P>With regard to the sources of information available to me, the Deputy will understand they are necessarily varied.  He will also understand, I hope, that I cannot publicly disclose the exact nature and extent of the information, but I can tell the Deputy that the information is very considerable and the concern of my Department and of our embassy in London has, indeed, been acknowledged to me more than once and, I believe, publicly also by those most directly involved in humanitarian concern for these prisoners.

That would be to assume I had immediate responsibility, something which neither I nor the Government have.  Subject to that, let me say that the nature and level of the information available to us is such as to make me satisfied that we are being kept informed within that qualification.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that these were two old age pensioners who went to visit friends on a special flight, that the woman became dangerously ill, was in intensive care and it was considered that she would not survive? She did survive and then was told that her return flight had been cancelled and they found themselves penniless.  Is the Minister aware of this fact and the fact that she went to the Consul-General who treated her with contemptuous disregard and said it was no business of the Irish embassy nor of the Consul-General to finance their return or to loan them money?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to a question on 14 June 1978 I referred to the financial assistance available from Government sources to Irish organisations in Britain who look after the welfare of Irish <Col N="1789" /> emigrants.  The position has not altered since then.

      <P>Do I take it that the figure of 7,000 is not being substituted for one of 11,000 given earlier this year?  Is the Minister saying that the priest who gave the figure of 15,000 is not stating the facts?  Is it right that what has been described as an alarming number of young Irish people with leaving certificate honours should be left destitute in London?  Is this the way Fianna Fáil are going to honour their promise to give all school leavers jobs here?</P>

      <P>There is no such implication against the reverend gentleman. I have not been able to get any confirmation, through the sources available to us, of what that figure is.  I should like to state that the emigration statistics derived from passenger inflow and outflow from Britain and Ireland and the 1977 figures, the latest available, show that the net excess of outflow to Britain was 7,000.  The matter is under active consideration by the Government.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that this matter was left in abeyance for a considerable time during his period in office.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that net passenger movement figures are established as having no validity for periods in the year later than February and before October because of the distorting <Col N="1790" /> effects of tourism movements? When he gives us the latest figures he means distorted figures.  The figures to February show a net passenger movement of 13,000 and, allowing for the Taoiseach's correct suggestion that they exaggerate by a certain proportion, that indicates a net emigration of 9,000 for the latest period for which there are valid figures.</P>

      <P>The Minister has fallen into my trap, and I should like to thank him for that.  The figure is 15,000. Is the Minister aware that on the last occasion when Fianna Fáil were in Government figures became available as to gross emigration from here, and that the figures that emerged in the census of 1971 showed that 25,000 people on the date of the census had been elsewhere a period of 12 months earlier?  Is he aware that in that period net emigration had been 4,000 from which it is arithmetically evident that a gross figure of 29,000 people emigrated as against 4,000 net, and that, therefore, the figure of 15,000 is, if anything, inclined to be an underestimate? Is the Minister aware of those census figures and of the fact that those figures show that gross emigration can be seven times net emigration?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the allegations of continuing violations of human rights by the British administration in the Six-Counties, the Government is prepared to institute proceedings against the British Government before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The protection of the human and civil rights of all the people of Northern Ireland is a matter which the Government consider to be of fundamental importance and all developments relating to the question are kept under close and constant review with a view to appropriate action whenever this is considered necessary.  The Government are not at present contemplating proceedings of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  The Deputy will of course be aware that it is open to any person in Northern Ireland who considers that he or she may have a case to initiate such proceedings on an individual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Government are satisfied that there is no basis for any such move?  Am I to take it that the Government are satisfied that since the conclusion of the last case which they took there rather successfully, things are worse than they were then?  May I ask the Minister why the Government have come to this conclusion&mdash;to do nothing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Government can move or should move they should be satisfied that sufficient evidence is available from people who have communicated with them.  The Deputy will perhaps be aware that on the last occasion there was a very wide range of information from very authoritative sources who requested this action.  That position does not obtain at the moment.  No such request has been made.  As was mentioned, individual cases are being brought before the Human Rights Court and that is the <Col N="1797" /> position as the Government take note of it at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that from the case which we took in regard to events in Northern Ireland it transpired that there were grave defects in the procedure of the court, both in regard to the length of time taken to deal with it&mdash;the Commission and Court&mdash; five years, and in regard to the fact that there was no power to compel the attendance of witnesses or require them to give evidence and that these defects seriously affect the value of this procedure?  Has he any proposals to improve the Human Rights Court and Commission procedure in the light of these defects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this is a separate question of which I would require notice but I acknowledge that the undue delays on the last occasion were a continuing cause of concern.  The limitations on the compelling of witnesses are also matters of concern.  I recognise that these delays were not always due to the procedures of the court but rather to their lack of capacity to deal with delays such as were involved in the case of one of the parties.  I can assure all Deputies that if and whenever the Government see fit to bring matters as a Government before the Court of Human Rights again in this or any other area, the Government will obviously take that action.</P>

Is he now telling the House that his sources of information are less than they were five or six years ago?

      <P>As a result of his interview the impression was conveyed of a greater willingness to join in a future European Community defence organisation if such were to result from the evolution of European political co-operation. Would the Minister agree that impression was conveyed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not agree.  If there has been any change in policy it has not been on these benches since my last statement.  No such interpretation should be made of my remarks.  I have always made it clear, as I think my predecessor also did, that in the event of political development occurring in Europe and in the event of a situation arising which one would hope never would arise, the Community of which we were a member were under attack, then obviously we would have to face our obligations.  Equally, I have made it clear that at no stage in my experience and I believe in my predecessor's experience has this matter been raised.  The only place I can see it raised as an issue all the time is here by way of suggestion and speculation, that what is not happening is happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the possibility of a future departure, membership of a defence organisation in Europe, does the Minister base it now&mdash;the change in emphasis, our present neutrality and a future change in that policy&mdash;on the evolution of political co-operation? In other words, if political co-operation intensifies, in fact it follows?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Political co-operation does not involve co-ordination of a common foreign policy.  In addition, there is as yet no common foreign policy in the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the steps which are being taken to increase the total funding and number of house loan mortgages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of mortgage loans for houses paid out in 1975, 1976 and 1977 was 21,241, 22,051 and 21,777 respectively.  The number of loans paid in the first half of 1978 was 11,118 and this, together with the increase in approvals during that period, suggests a satisfactory outturn for this year.</P>
      <P>As regards the total funding of house loan mortgages, the Deputy will be aware of the increase in the public capital provision for local authority house purchase loans&mdash;from £17.66 million in 1977 to £39 million in 1978&mdash;consequent on the Government's decision to increase the loan limit from £4,500 to £7,000 and the income limit from £2,350 to £3,500 a year with effect from the 26 May 1977.  The recent decision by the Government to further increase the loan limit to £9,000 is expected to result in increased expenditure next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moneys available from building societies for house purchase loans are dependent on the societies' ability to attract funds from investors.  In this connection, <Col N="1806" /> I would like to point out that the net inflow of funds to societies up to 31 October this year showed an increase over the same period last year.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is having discussions with representatives of the assurance companies with a view to securing an increased input by the companies into house-purchase loans.</P>
    <P>As regards bank loans for house purchase, the number of loan payments made up to 30 June this year was about 12 per cent down on the number made during the same period last year. However, the number of loan approvals during the same period increased by 28 per cent over last year's figure so loan payments should increase in the coming months.  The Deputy will also be aware that bank loans for house-purchase have been excluded from the credit restrictions recently imposed by the Central Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that implicit in the figures he gave us is a clear inability of the number of mortgages being made available to cope with the increased demand, in fact that there is a slump becoming evident, particularly in view of the increasing numbers of people who seek mortgages? Is the Minister aware of this, is he concerned about it, and if so what new action does he propose to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spelled out the action that has been taken in order to make funds available and the increased amount of money available for these loans.  As I said in my reply the number of loans for the first six months of this year&mdash;11,118&mdash;compares very favourably with previous years.  Therefore, there is no falling back there.  It is anticipated that the numbers for the second half of the year will be even greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to explain why it is that the number of applicants for local authority houses has increased in the last six months in the order of 30 to 35 per cent? Why is this if there are sufficient numbers of mortgages available?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, for the first time in years, the term &ldquo;loan famine&rdquo; is current amongst people seeking mortgages from building societies?  If the Minister is so aware does he accept that the dramatic increase in the number of applicants for local authority housing is a direct reflection of the inability of these applicants to get local authority mortgages?  What direct steps does the Minister propose taking with regard to trying to make more money available for people seeking home loans from the building societies? For example, does he propose to give them any more money to subsidise increased rates of interest?  What proposals has he to give more money to local authorities, because the provision about which he spoke is clearly not adequate? For example does he consider making more money available to housing co-operatives, or what other positive steps does he propose taking in view of the clear facts available, despite the gloss he puts on the figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question on what I intend to do, that is a budgetary matter in regard to the amount of money to be made available for next year.  I have seen reference to the term &ldquo;loan famine&rdquo;&mdash;used by the Deputy&mdash;in the newspapers. The number of applicants did increase rapidly, I agree with the Deputy, but I look steps to deal with that by insisting that 60 per cent of the loans made would be in respect of loans up to £13,000 and a further 20 per cent under £16,000; that is a total of 80 per cent.  In general the building societies&mdash;we will come to them in a later question&mdash;have complied with this.  That is having an effect. The imposition of a CRV for a building society loan&mdash;which we will <Col N="1808" /> come to also some time later, some day&mdash;is also having the desired effect. These steps are being taken for a trial period up to 31 March next and we have no reason to think they are not working reasonably well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's earlier replies, he mentioned the question of SDA loans and the increase in applications: would the Minister not accept that the circular sent by his Department to local authorities on 31 August asking that a P.60 tax form be required now before applicants can qualify for a loan has eliminated a lot of people from qualification for a loan and if he will not review his Department's policy in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Very many local authorities were using this procedure already.  However, it is a question of the local authority allocating loans to people who are entitled to them.  If I may point out again, the important fact is that the amount of money made available went from £17 million to £39 million in this year alone.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be able to say if he has received representations from local authorities that people who are earning under £67 per week&mdash;the figure they must earn to qualify for a loan of £9,000&mdash;are unable to pay £22 per week for 30 years on that loan?  Is the Minister aware also that if they have a lesser income than £67 a week, as many of them have, the amount they can borrow is much less than £9,000?  Does the Minister realise that raising the loan to £9,000 for people who are earning only up to £67 a week is just another gimmick which is not doing one damn thing for those who are looking for houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no drastic departure in the manner of measuring an applicant's ability to repay a loan with regard to this £9,000.  With regard to the applicant's ability to repay a loan, the procedure has always been to grant two-and-a-half-times his or her earnings; two-and-a-half-times £3,500 is £8,750 on a quick calculation; anyway it is around that figure.  Therefore, there has been no serious departure, none whatsoever.</P>

Bearing in mind that most local authorities are represented by members of the Minister's party who support this type of thinking does the Minister not consider that having a ceiling of £3,500 annual income means that anything in excess of that deprives anyone applying for a local authority loan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This opportunity should not go without all of us in the House recognising that it is a historic occasion in the Dáil, though not in the Oireachtas. This is the first report of the Joint Committee&mdash;an all-party committee representing all parties in the Oireachtas, and the Independents&mdash;to be debated here or presented to the Dáil.  The Seanad has debated two such reports, one on youth unemployment and one on the EMS.</P>
      <P>Lest the full membership of the House have forgotten, the Joint Committee members are not people who are occasionally taken from buses in Luxembourg or who disappear until they have to come across here from Kildare Street, sometimes in the rain, for divisions: the Joint Committee are a working party of this Parliament and not some extension of the Brussels bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the honour and the duty today to present to the House this report of <Col N="1828" /> that committee.  The fact that we are talking about the cultural sector does not indicate any political priorities as far as the Joint Committee are concerned. Rather does it indicate that the two previous reports which we processed could not be debated in the House because the Standing Orders of the Dáil had not been amended to take account of such reports as this coming before us.</P>
    <P>Recognising the fact that this Parliament is slowly but surely dragging itself into the 20th century, we have made progress to the extent that the first Joint Committee produced 59 reports for this House and the other House, not one of which was debated or reported to either House in the last Oireachtas.  Therefore, in fairness to the development of modern parliamentary democracy, the records would be bereft if these points were not put on the record.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify my own position and that of the other members of the Joint Committee.  The role of any member, irrespective of the side of the political divide he or she may come from, in the context of presenting such a report, is a political role but not a partisan one. Therefore my presentation will be a political but not a partisan one.  I will move quickly through the document.</P>
    <P>This is an opinion of the Joint Committee on a document produced by one of the members of the EEC Commission, Mr. Vouel, at the request of the EEC.  The reference number of the document is R/2982/77.  It was produced at the end of last year and it was presented to the EEC Economic and Social Committee for internal comment, and simultaneously sent out after EEC processing to all European Parliaments, including our own.  The Joint Committee, on behalf of the Oireachtas, undertook to review the document and to comment on how we see it as affecting Ireland.  The report is entitled &ldquo;Report on Community Action in the Cultural Sector&rdquo;, and some definitions are in order as to what we mean by &ldquo;the cultural sector&rdquo;.  I will be referring to the report from now on as &ldquo;our report&rdquo;.  Our report defines it, using the same definition as the Commission, as &ldquo;the socioeconomic whole formed by persons and undertakings dedicated to the production <Col N="1829" /> and distribution of cultural goods and services&rdquo;.  The sector covers not only cultural activities such as drama and painting, and cultural products like books and sculpture, but persons engaged in cultural activities, such as dancers and musicians.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of cultural activity which are not included in the report, not because they are not deemed to be cultural activities but for other reasons as perceived by Mr. Vouel and his colleagues.  I refer specifically to the cinema industry and television, which are major areas.  The Commission were charged with seeing how that sector of European activity can be brought into the framework of the Treaty of Rome, and how those aspects of the cultural sector can be harmonised in accordance with the political objectives of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The report falls into two parts, the allocation of work and the description of how the cultural sector performs as laid out in my earlier definition.  The first part is related to how the Treaty of Rome can be applied to the cultural sector&mdash;how the provisions of the free movement of goods and services can be applied specifically to the cultural sector, and which areas have got to be identified, and how the objectives of the Treaty of Rome can be implemented.  We have identified these in our report as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  Freedom of trade in cultural goods,</P>
    <P>(b)  Combating thefts of cultural goods,</P>
    <P>(c)  Freedom of movement and establishment for cultural workers,</P>
    <P>(d)  Training periods for young cultural workers,</P>
    <P>(e)  Harmonisation of taxation in the cultural sector by</P>
    <P>(i)  the removal of tax barriers to the development of cultural foundations and patronage</P>
    <P>(ii)  the setting up of uniform VAT rates for cultural goods throughout the EEC which should be kept to reasonable limits, and <Col N="1830" /> (iii)  the removal of discrimination in the taxation of cultural workers,</P>
    <P>(f)  Harmonisation of laws on copyright and related rights by</P>
    <P>(i)  the harmonsation of wide areas of copyright to ensure that cultural workers would have the most favourable treatment to be found under the existing laws of any member state.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Community-wide operation of a public lending rights scheme,</P>
    <P>(iii)  measures to improve the remuneration of authors, performers, play-wrights, composers, literary translators, sculptors and painters as well as to encourage the work of craftsmen,</P>
    <P>who, in my personal view should be called &ldquo;craftspeople&rdquo;.  Finally the social aspects:</P>
    <P>The adaptation of social security systems in the Community to the special problems of employed and self-employed cultural workers.</P>
    <P>They are the areas that have been identified by the Commission, and which we support, which can be integrated readily within the provisions of the Treaty of Rome.  There are clauses within that Treaty which can be applied readily to all of those sectors.  I will not go into the details of how they will be applied because we are at an early stage in this entire process.  That is the scope of the document in that area.  It is the specific application of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome to that area of the cultural sector.</P>
    <P>In response to the communication provided by Commissioner Vouel, the second part of our report relates to the broader aspect of the consolidation of European culture.  On behalf of the Committee I should like to talk about the framework of thinking that permeates this area.  It is true to say that the Common Market is simply that.  It has been described by other people as a community of merchants rather than a community of people.  Since the development of social objectives, notably at the Paris Summit of 1972, has given a new <Col N="1831" /> horizon to the European Community, the narrow limitations imposed by the Treaty of Rome have broadened to take on a wider perspective than that of the creation of a European community. Within that objective the question of a European culture and the promotion and strengthening of a European culture has a major role to play.</P>
    <P>The second part of our report and the second part of Commissioner Vouel's report talks about measures and recommendations of a general nature which do not necessarily fall within the context of the treaty of Rome but which certainly fall within the objectives of the EEC as of now, measures which should be looked at and which, hopefully, could be implemented in the near future.  It would be dishonest to describe it otherwise, because in the process of decision-making we are a long way from the stage when any of these proposals will become EEC directives.  Any talk that gives any other impression only serves to devalue the role of the Community in that regard.</P>
    <P>What areas are we talking about when we talk about the broader aspects of European culture?  First, the preservation of the architectural heritage by the promotion of specialist training for restorers and nuclear conservation techniques.  Second, contributing to the development of cultural exchanges involving the evaluation of cultural advance, the organisation of European rooms in museums and exchanges between museums.  Third, co-operation between the cultural institutes of member states.  Finally, the promotion of socio-cultural activities at European level.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee have reviewed the aspects in relation to the first part of the document and have made a number of recommendations.  We believe that these points are the best position that can be adopted at this time by an all-party committee of this House.  We have added a number of proposals to the second part of the report, but before I deal with them one point should be politically underlined: as far as the Joint Committee are concerned, people involved in the <Col N="1832" /> cultural sector of this or of any other member state are, as the report states, cultural workers.  They should have the same rights and obligations as other workers.  The cultural worker community or the artistic community in either the plastic or performing arts has for many years sought that status.  To the extent that the views of the Commission go a long way towards giving effect to that aspiration, we understand that the proposals to harmonise legislation and the treatment of cultural workers with regard to, say, social security have been welcomed by the trade union interests involved and by the Arts Council, who have a statutory obligation in this field.  The proposals made by the Commission and the proposals on which we are commenting have been welcomed in principle by those who are directly involved in the cultural sector.</P>
    <P>Time keeps me from going into detail on these matters, but the essence of what I am saying is correct.  What have we said in extension to that and what have we said in regard to the overall aspiration of strengthening European culture? Two things have emerged which are of direct interest and relevance to this House.  The first is that we are anxious to promote cultural exchange within the nine member states.  As this House has the distinction of being the first parliament in Europe to fund a State theatre, we are particularly anxious that State theatres, such as the Abbey Theatre, should be able to participate in a programme of cultural exchange with their sister theatres in the EEC.  To flesh this out it is envisaged that it would take the form of either directors or back-of-stage front-of-house personnel, as well as actors, participating on an exchange basis in productions in France, Germany and elsewhere, with the declared objective of strengthening European culture by enhancing the understanding within each member state of the culture of other member states.  We are not seeking the lowest common denominator in terms of European culture.  On the contrary, European culture can only be fully understood when the individual richness and value of national cultures which make up the nine member states is fully appreciated and understood by all. <Col N="1833" /> There is a certain tendency to feel that Europeanisation means some kind of levelling down and, therefore, the reduction of national individuality.  On the contrary, the theme of this document and of our report is that you could only start to talk of a European culture in realistic terms if you talked in terms of consolidating and improving national cultures.</P>

      <P>There is no such thing as a European culture without the national cultures that go towards making it up. On that very point it was suggested in our report that we would vigorously promote the idea of European rooms in our museums, that some space should be allocated within national museums which would be devoted to a common understanding of European culture.  As an extension of that point, the Committee saw fit to include in their report the suggestion in the second part of the Commission's recommendations that some means should be found whereby artefacts belonging to the cultural heritage of a member state, which for reasons of history are now located in another country, should be returned to their places of origin if they were central to the understanding of that culture.</P>
      <P>Let me be explicit.  If the Ardagh chalice happened to be located in the National Museum of Denmark largely through the enterprise of some Viking many years ago and if it were considered by all and sundry to be an essential component of understanding Irish Celtic culture, then within the context of this report there would be some mechanism whereby that artefact could be brought back to this country.  The same process would apply in relation to the artefacts of other countries.  This policy will not really take effect for four or five years and in the case of the enlargement of the Community the implications could be very beneficial for countries such as Greece and Portugal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document from the Committee declares that in the narrow confines of the Treaty of Rome there are areas in which the provisions of the application of the principles of free movement of <Col N="1834" /> goods and people can now be applied specifically to workers in the cultural sector.  These are identified quite clearly and have, in principle, the support of the Arts Council, those involved in Irish Actors' Equity and the Musicians' Federation.  In the second part there are aspirations to giving tangible reality to the ideal of the creation of a people's Europe rather than a merchants' Europe and culture is as much a part of that as any other aspect of life.  European culture is built on the solid foundation of the enrichment and understanding of national and regional cultures.  There are more nations than states within the EEC.  There are proposals which must be seen as generalised proposals which suggest that certain measures could come from the Commission as recommendations to national parliaments in order to give flesh and blood to the idea of a European room.  The Minister of State, whose presence here is much appreciated, has specific responsibility for museums and would be capable of responding to that proposal.</P>
    <P>It gives me much pleasure to be here on behalf of the Committee and to present in a political but non-partisan way the opinions of the Committee to the House.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasant occasion and a welcome change to rise here and say I am in almost total agreement with the speaker who traditionally, and for reasons which I cannot always understand, would be described as being on the other side of the House and in opposition to me.  Perhaps on this very important topic we should set a headline which might be copied when other matters are being discussed.  We would then be practising the true spirit of democracy, of debate and of conference where we all assemble, each gives expression to his thoughts and we are all prepared to depart the scene with the essence of the collective and collected contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attention which the Joint Committee have given to the Commission's report on Community action in the cultural sector is most welcome.  It is indicative of the growing interest in increased <Col N="1835" /> cultural contact between EEC countries which follows from the closer relations between them in other areas.  In his 1974 reports on European identity, Mr. Tindemans, the distinguished former Belgian premier, laid special emphasis on the need to make all people throughout the Community aware of our common heritage.  It must be accepted that most of the day-to-day activities of the Community tend to be of a technical nature and the man in the street and the lady also can be sympathised with in feeling removed from the Community. People are inclined to accept that what is happening in Europe has not any vital relevance to them.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the European Parliament requested the Commission to prepare this report.  Very little is said in the Treaty of Rome about culture as such.  The Commission's suggestions relate mostly to the application of provisions of the Treaty to the cultural sector, namely, the people involved in the production and distribution of cultural goods and services. The Commission state that the cultural sector is not in itself culture so that Community action in this sector does not constitute a cultural policy.</P>
    <P>Here I would presume to say to Deputy Quinn and the other members of the Committee that were I a member of the Committee I do not think I would approach the report entirely from a viewpoint of trying to find weaknesses in the Treaty of Rome on which I could work for the advancement of culture. Rather I would take the opportunity of having it conveyed to member states that in the introduction and in the treaty there were certain omissions and shortcomings and it is tragic that the very important matter of culture was neglected to such an extent.  I do not have to remind the House or anybody of the expression &ldquo;not by bread alone&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On my excursions into Europe of late I have detected among people a certain envy on their part of the Irish way of life and of our traditions which, for one reason or another, have given us the opportunity of continuing to hold dear matters which are not always economic. It is unfortunate that we are now in a situation where one would think we <Col N="1836" /> could view culture only as an adjunct to economic or other considerations and not for its own sake.</P>
    <P>I know that the members of the Committee must operate within the confines of the regulations which govern us, but it is a pity we are not maximising the lead which has been given in their definition of the treaty and their interpretation of the treaty as quoted by Deputy Quinn.  I hope the Committee will continue to operate from that point of view. Naturally we would be concerned to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by the treaty.  As I have said earlier, we should remind all concerned of the inadequacies and shortcomings of that treaty in that it seems to regard culture as something which might be attended to when everything else is satisfied, but as not having the importance which, fortunately, we know it to have in the lives of every human being.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to my responsibilities in the matter of museums and other centres in this city.  Latterly I have been applying myself to an examination of the situation so that I can accommodate all the interests, the cravings and the views of all the people of Ireland in relation to the centres.  If we are truly in earnest in what we say and in our concern for the man in the street, including all the people, the time has come when museums and art galleries must go to the people rather than the people coming to them.  We cannot continue to treat these centres as areas of scholarship and research.  They must be put to the use for which they were intended but which is often overlooked, that is, providing enjoyment, entertainment, study and interest for the people whose property they are.</P>
    <P>Unwittingly at times we are inclined to assume when we mention the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; that it pre-supposes a certain élitist interest.  In every walk of life there are people who remind me of the Irish seanfhocal: Is fánach an áit in a bhfhaighfeá gliomac.  People living in what are described as corporation estates have a very deep and active interest in symphonies, in art, in drama and in literature.  Perhaps this is the fallacy in the approach of the EEC.  When they <Col N="1837" /> have economic or other problems, they are not interested in matters cultural. They forget there is a balm and a soothing process they can enjoy which could help them to overcome their problems.</P>
    <P>We should never overlook the perpetual craving and longing on the part of all the people of Ireland and of other countries to pursue matters which are not solely of the body or cold economics.  I agree generally with the views expressed in the Commission's proposals and in particular with the reference to simplifying procedures for cross-frontier movement.  Having regard to our special position, there is no need to elaborate on that.</P>
    <P>I want to mention also the reference to improved opportunities for young cultural workers to undergo training in other EEC countries.  I should like to give expression to a personal opinion. The report seems to treat that aspect as if it were solely for the benefit of the cultural worker whether he be dramatist, dancer, writer or sculptor.  We must also bear in mind the enrichment to the culture of another country from the input of visiting workers.  Apart from the benefit to the artist, we must also highlight the desirability of having this mobility so that all the individual cultures could benefit from it.  We are moving towards the ideal of the different elements improving the totality of European culture.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue in the magnanimous attitude which invariably arises when one is discussing matters of culture, and if we are thinking in terms of the European scene, and if we claim to be speaking in deference to the European culture, notwithstanding our membership of the Community we must be mindful of the fact that in Europe today there are countries and cultures which are not part of the Community.  It would not be in the true spirit of culture, to say the least of it, if we were to think exclusively in terms of the Nine, or Ten, or Twelve.  We must think in terms of the total European culture.  We must accept that, even though other countries are not members of the Community, they have a very significant contribution to make in the matter of European culture.  We cannot <Col N="1838" /> dismiss them because they do not enjoy membership of the Community. There are Nordic countries with whom we have a very definite relationship in the matter of our heritage who are not members of the Community.  There are central European countries from which our Celtic heritage really springs who are not members of the Community.  We must remind ourselves that we in the Nine are not the sole custodians of the great European culture.  We must have consultations with other countries and provide the necessary liaison so that all can join in that to which all claim to aspire.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn, Deputy Keating and I enjoy membership of a cultural committee of Dublin Corporation.  I was very pleased some years ago when we were able to assist Nora Lever in bringing a Dublin group to a drama festival in Brussels.  Certain commercial concerns helped in that production, &ldquo;The Importance of Being Ernest&rdquo;.  Students from St. Brigid's School in Finglas in my constituency were selected to go to Belgium last year to take part in a choral festival. They acquitted themselves very well and won one of the few medals presented.  I mention this to remind the House that we have indigenous cultural movements. I am not one of those who would dismiss it as a folk culture.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on us while funding the Arts Council and other agencies&mdash;where we see the people themselves as we have for instance in Siamsa i gCiarraí and in Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann which are volunteer movements, expressing an interest in any aspect of our culture and our heritage&mdash;to immediately give recognition to that and to nurture it and to foster it.  While here we are speaking in terms of what might come from Europe from the top down we must never forget that all the while there are efforts being made in certain parishes, in certain counties, in certain regions by the people themselves to identify with certain aspects of our traditions and of our heritage.  There is an obligation on us, not just in the interests of the people themselves, but in the interests of the spirit of what is being discussed here, to <Col N="1839" /> foster those movements in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to my viewpoint that, although we will feel constrained, we should not accept the constraints of art trying to find in the Treaty of Rome accommodation for the position which we know culture should have.  We accept these constraints at such times as we have to because we cannot operate outside the provisions of it.  But we should disregard them forthwith I suggest.  This would be in accordance with expressions of concern made by heads of State at meetings recently about the position of culture.  We should be giving the lead to Europe in trying to rectify the omissions of the Treaty of Rome in this respect.</P>
    <P>Under the exchange which has occurred under the Commission which has been set up, the European Foundation, we are involved in the youth orchestra and I read in today's paper that at the moment auditions are taking place.  I would hope that many of our young and talented musicians will find a place in this orchestra.  That alone is not sufficient for me.  It is only part of what I would regard as a token of the association that should exist between this country and all other European countries in the matter of the arts, the performing arts, the visual arts and anything which is connected in any way with the great European culture of which we are all the proud inheritors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is heartening that an Irish national parliament has an opportunity to debate the issues implicit and explicit in the document put before us. Indeed our thanks to the committee for drawing our attention to the many important issues underlying its submission. It is heartening in particular for an Irish Parliament because no one really needs to spell out the outstanding contribution which this nation has made to European culture long before the concept of European culture and European cultures was commonplace and commonly talked about.  Therefore the trail-blazing tradition in that area should not be lost and it is right and fitting that this country should lay emphasis on the question of culture in our community. <Col N="1840" /> Although we may on occasions refer to culture and discuss it in a fairly sympathetic manner it is important that we stress that culture is not, as some would seem to have it, merely a peripheral area of part-time interest indulged in when the mood possesses one or when it is fashionable and popular.  If we are going to talk truly about culture then we have got to talk about it as being a system of ideas, of thought, of outlook, of modes and values which permeates our daily work, our daily life and our environment in all its facets.  It begins in the home and works through the school, through the work place, through the place of leisure and through all levels of life.  Sometimes this vision of culture as being an all-pervasive dimension is not sufficiently appreciated.  Accordingly it is heartening that the report of the all-party committee does clearly try to be very comprehensive in the proposals it sets before us. Nevertheless it could be said that in certain areas, allowing for the fact that the committee had to take its fount of inspiration from the Treaty of Rome and was, if one likes, extracting under the general aegis of the Treaty of Rome for the points it puts before us, there are other issues with wider international implications beyond mere EEC limits of cultural matters which should be stressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the youth orchestra to which the Minister of State has rightly drawn attention is one.  There are other areas.  It would be most fitting that the EEC dimension be crystalised most clearly in relation to matters of tax, to legislation governing workers' rights and so on but that the culture should not recognise any national boundaries.  It is a movement with a sense of international identity which transcends mere geographical boundaries.  That point should be made because it is important and we have much to learn from cultures and groups and bodies outside the EEC as well as those from within Europe.  It is also very important that young Irish people should have the benefit of gaining knowledge and inspiration from other cultures.  I would like to think that we could work towards a situation where, as part of the curriculum in our schools, every child would be enabled to visit <Col N="1841" /> other countries.  I admit that in the present economic climate that may be difficult but it is an aspiration towards which we should aspire.  As an offshore island off an offshore island off the coast of Europe I strongly feel that we suffer deprivation with regard to understanding and appreciating the contribution which other cultures and other communities can give us and which we can give them. Therefore any move which tends to focus our attention and our minds on other nations, on other cultures and on the finer aspects of these peoples is a good thing.  Accordingly it is useful to have the opportunity of looking at the sort of suggestions which the Joint Committee have put before us.</P>
    <P>I mention the word education because I frankly believe that so much of what will be right about the future of this country will depend on what we do right in our classrooms and not merely in our classrooms but in the areas of education which I believe will be more and more outside our classrooms, in areas which will become perhaps increasingly unstructured but which will nevertheless be educational.  I would include here leisure activities and informal education of a nature which we are going to have to discuss more and deal more with than we have been doing so far, if we accept the thesis of some that the classroom is perhaps not a very natural educational forum.</P>
    <P>The points which the committee put forward relating to the advantages which we have to gain by close attention to tapping the well-springs of other cultures can find an appropriate and important response in our educational system, both formal and informal.  I would like to think the Minister of State&mdash;and I notice he will certainly be ready to accept the suggestion&mdash;would give some consideration to some sort of curriculum reform or review which might include greater emphasis on these areas.  I would like to think that the Minister of State would consider some sort of curriculum reform which might include greater emphasis on those areas, because the traditional curriculum has not dealt with culture in any real way except as a subsidiary subject.</P>
    <P>I know that laying emphasis on <Col N="1842" /> culture today, particularly with the increasing economic and monetary emphasis of our daily concerns, is a slightly hazardous business. Nevertheless, if we believe that culture is fundamental to our well-being as individuals and as a nation, it cannot be ignored. It can only be ignored at our peril.  The growing emphasis in the context of international unemployment, the need to strive towards monetary achievement and the almost enshrining of monetary self-sufficiency as a core value in our social system does a disservice to the emphasis of what might be called the softer areas of civilisation. That is a loose interpretation of what a culture could be, but it would be very sad if culture were to be put into this backwater on account of the day to day striving to fill the stomach and not just the soul and the mind.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that to a degree parliaments and people see discussions and debates on culture as something which is pleasant to indulge in but which has a certain amount of double-thinking about it.  Recommendations such as those contained in the document before us will fall on barren soil unless they are pursued and implemented in legislative terms where necessary, but certainly by some sufficiently strong-willed group. One way of achieving progress in this regard is to make a particular body responsible for making progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the committee and the Commission and for reviewing progress on a regular basis.  Otherwise, there is a danger that, having chatted generally about this we will just allow the Committee to continue their work in a nebulous way without getting to grips with the day to day issues of what culture means in the life of our people, whether that be the issue of the alleged growing export of national monuments or the concern of the people about the preservation of a site like Wood Quay. A document such as this can only be fruitful if it can bear meaningfully on such day to day issues.</P>
    <P>We are all equally guilty of this double thinking, but it should come to an end.  That can be done by ensuring that those proposals and ideas are reviewed <Col N="1843" /> after six months or 12 months by a group of people who can come to us and say: &ldquo;This much progress has been made.&rdquo;  There should be no second place given to matters of culture.  I appreciate the political problems of a cultural programme.  It seems to me that courageous politicians who seek to extend the frontiers of cultural experience could very well find themselves being sacrificial lambs, because there is a train of thought in the political philosophy which says, if it is a question of changing modes of thought or producing long-term results, then it is not really the kind of ground which political parties involve themselves in too readily.  The reason is that there is not an obvious, tangible result to display to the average interested electors within the cyclical election system.  Therefore, one runs some risks.</P>
    <P>We should be clear about this.  If we are to make progress in those areas it must mean commitment now of manpower and financial resources for gains which will not be immediately evident except with regard to the working conditions of what are called in this paper &ldquo;cultural workers&rdquo;.  A major impact on our society, on our way of thinking&mdash;the kind of cultural prevasion fundamental to the work and thought behind this paper&mdash;will take some time to achieve. Politicians should not be afraid to take up this challenge.  They should not be afraid to say to people that short-term wants certainly have a place but that long-term needs in areas like this, and in other areas which need commitment now for gains which are not immediately obvious, are matters which politicians and Governments must pay attention to. If that kind of courage permeates the work of Governments and committees, such as the committee which produced this document, I believe that their efforts will be crowned with success.  I would be concerned in case we found ourselves in a year's time discussing a similar document with as many aspirations and high hopes but with little achievement in the meantime of the results of this paper.</P>
    <P>The points put forward in part I of the communication of the Commission deal with the application of the provisions of the EEC Treaty to a number of <Col N="1844" /> headings.  I believe that very few of us would disagree with the appropriateness of each of these proposals.  The difficulty is in their implementation.  Some of those areas I believe will find a more ready response in us than in others.  The movement of goods and the freedom of trade is a matter which is fundamental to any growing international and mutual appreciation of the cultures of various nations. We must welcome any move which breaks down the barriers of inhibitions in this area.  I know that the Government at the moment have a very impressive exhibition on display in the USA.  This is a pioneering effort and the kind of work which sets a very good headline and is a symbol of the spirit embodied in this paper.  I hope that the proposals for the growing freedom of trade in this area are satisfactorily implemented.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this paper which are very important and could do with further attention.  The question of the employment of cultural workers is of immediate concern to many people.  The idea of the artist in the attic and the writer scribbling fine books but only being appreciated posthumously is something we should dispense with.  We should deal with cultural workers, artists and creative people of all types, more flexibly.  We have got to be able to tell those people that they are making a valid contribution not just to the peripheral areas of our activity but to the central areas of what makes us great as a nation or not so great.  It is time to try to compensate for the omissions of the past.  I know of some people who have striven for years under the most arduous conditions to produce works which are as important as the works which are carried on in many of the industrial centres, which are very generously aided by the State.  This dichotomy should not exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to stress one matter in connection with our membership of the EEC in the course of this debate.  Since we joined the Community, debates here and outside concentrated in general on the material aspect of our membership.  For the past few months we heard a lot about the new European Monetary System and the ad-This <Col N="1845" /> debate concerns another aspect of our membership, the cultural aspect.  If the Community is to become a full Community there will have to be greater cultural co-operation between the different members.  If European union is ever to be achieved aspects dealt with in this report will have to be given greater prominence and member states will have to make available greater financial aid for this purpose.  We have our own culture which binds us as a nation and makes us distinct from others.</P>
      <P>The direct elections to the European Parliament should help in this regard.  As a member of the Joint Committee I met other European parliamentarians in Brussels and discussed various problems affecting member states.  That was a worthwhile exercise.  The report is a practical one because it covers a wide range of subjects and puts forward good suggestions to encourage greater cultural activity.  It states that, notwithstanding the material success of some individuals, the highest proportion of underprivileged according to the Commission, was to be found in the category of workers constituted by cultural workers.  As I said before about other workers, while the air is beautiful its nutritional value is nil.  A cultural worker who might be the greatest painter in Ireland cannot survive unless he is properly remunerated.  If that does not happen he must find another source of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with taxation aspects dealt with in the report.  As a result of the Finance Act, 1969, cultural workers here are in a privileged position because there is relief from income tax in respect of certain earnings from original and creative works of writers, composers, painters and sculptors.  Since that Act was introduced people have expressed the view that it should never have been brought in.  I do not agree because it has put us in a special place.  We are ahead of many other countries in that we help those who are gifted as writers, composers, painters or sculptors and the Minister responsible for introducing that provision is to be congratulated.  The Revenue Commissioners have been liberal in their interpretation of what <Col N="1846" /> constitutes a creative work of art and that has encouraged many artists and writers to live here.</P>
    <P>However, there are other aspects of the income tax code which could be altered in order to encourage those in the cultural sector.  The question of irregularity of earnings come to mind.  In this regard we made the suggestion that earnings be spread over a number of years.  The report also deals with the question of detecting theft and fraud. The Joint Committee suggested the introduction of a record card system which would enable an owner in the event of theft to make the card available to the police and custom authorities. That would be a worthwhile step.  The Joint Committee also suggested the harmonisation of national laws relating to the disposal of stolen cultural goods. They felt that the proposed record system could be useful in preventing fakes and assisting in tracing stolen works of art.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee, on the question of copyright and related rights, suggested harmonisation of the laws of member states in this regard.  Unfortunately, the sponsorship of cultural and sporting events here is done mainly by the State and the suggestion was made that our tax laws be amended to allow companies who sponsor such cultural events a concession.  We felt that if that occurred we would have greater sponsorship of such events.  We also dealt with exchanges between members of the Community of works of art and people. We asked that more be done in this respect and that the Community give greater financial incentives.  The Commission put forward many practical steps and the Joint Committee considered ways in which we could implement those suggestions.  It is a great change in the attitude of the House that more than an hour is being devoted to a matter concerning culture rather than spending all the time debating money matters.  I welcome the report and I am glad to have had the opportunity of contributing to it.</P>

      <P>This debate affords us an opportunity to discuss <Col N="1847" /> a subject which unfortunately does not engage the time of the House to any great extent and, regrettably, this debate on culture had of necessity to be left over until this Thursday evening.</P>
      <P>As one who is not a member of the Joint Committee I came to the House in the hope of listening to and learning from those Members who are on that Committee, but I am a little disappointed that there has not been more participation by those Deputies who are on the Committee and who could have educated us as to the requirements in the cultural sector.  Reports of this kind tend to be elaborate and detailed and, apart from being somewhat difficult to assimilate, are time consuming from a Deputy's point of view.  That is why I had looked forward to the House being given at least a brief outline of what is involved.</P>
      <P>Under the various headings the report gives us an assessment of the communication sent by the Commission to the Council 12 months ago with a recommendation that the Joint Committee endeavour to report back.  I am surprised to find how advanced we are here. Deputy McCreevy spoke specifically of the reference in the report to the harmonisation of taxation in the cultural sector and was able to pinpoint the advance made by this country in 1969 when the then Minister for Finance offered special tax concessions to people engaged in cultural activities.  In addition there are the social aspects and in this respect I would refer to the communication from the Commission to the Council in which attention was drawn to the fact that cultural workers as such throughout the nine member states are at a tremendous disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> any opposite number and that they are among the lowest paid people in the Community.  Our social services system overcomes the type of differentiation that is referred to in this overall report.  I am very disappointed at not being able to get enough information here this evening, but in a way this is what led me to read the specific recommendations of the Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under another heading in the communication certain recommendations <Col N="1848" /> were made in relation to taxation and on an overall basis in relation to VAT.  The Joint Committee suggest that the Commission should be more active in promoting specific cultural exchanges between member states.  I understand that the reason given for this activity being minimal up to now is that there is not provision for it in the Treaty.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education referred to this and said that for too long concentration had been on the monetary aspect.  Therefore, there is a need for the Nine to build into the Treaty some means of overcoming that tendency.  However, I gather that a certain amount of progress has been made during the past 12 months because the European Foundation, to which the Council agreed in April this year and which is shortly to come into existence, is likely to provide more scope for cultural exchanges in the future.  In addition, there is the EEC Youth Orchestra which is perhaps the most outstanding practical example of cultural co-operation at Community level so far.  As the Joint Committee suggest, we have a responsibility to follow up that sort of activity.  If we have a cultural fame it is in the sphere of the theatre.  We should concentrate on endeavouring to work towards a joint theatre.  The EEC Youth Orchestra is funded jointly by the Nine. This orchestra have been acclaimed greatly for their performances in the nine capitals.</P>
    <P>The Committee's suggestion regarding Community patronage for the theatre and for the visual arts generally should be followed up by us.  The Minister of State commented on the suggestion that there be a European Room at the National Museum.  We should concentrate, too, on exchanges of members of national theatre companies and on European theatre festivals and we should encourage the display of art works in public buildings.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to scholarships for persons involved in architectural restoration and preservation work.  I was not aware of there being scholarships of this nature but I note that paragraph 47 of the report reads that:</P>
    <P>While accepting that many of the suggestions made by the Commission <Col N="1849" /> are to be commended the Joint Committee shares with the Arts Council its disappointment that the Commission does not see the Community adapting and promoting a precise programme of cultural exchanges...</P>
    <P>This is a matter also that we should concentrate on.  If we were to do nothing else during this debate but to draw attention to the absence of information in this regard who would have done a good day's work.  In paragraph 51 the Joint Committee express their surprise on learning from the Arts Council that they were not aware of the scholarships available to architects, engineers, town planners and craftsmen to which the Commission referred in their report.  The Joint Committee express the hope that the Government Department concerned will look into the matter in order to ensure that information about these scholarships is available to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Possibly, one of the reasons for the lack of information in this sphere is that there has not developed yet a proper system for the dissemination of this type of information.  It may be very difficult to find a single source from which such information can be gathered but, regardless of which Department are involved, we have the responsibility for collecting such information and ensuring that it is passed to the people who are interested.</P>
    <P>I was rather proud as an Irishman when I read in the overall report about the harmonisation of taxation and the complaint that the arts as such were overtaxed.  This Joint Committee report, on page 11, paragraph 23, stressed the fact that the Irish income tax laws provide for exemption from income tax in the cases of certain bodies who could be described as promoting cultural activities and it goes on to deal with those bodies.  It would appear that all over the European scene that type of facility is not available and we are very much ahead of the rest in that regard.</P>

      <P>In section 2 of the <Col N="1850" /> Finance Act, 1969, we took another great step forward in the creation of that tax relief.  Europe is now ten years behind the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, in asking the other eight member states to provide those facilities.  It was a move that was heavily criticised then, and still is.  I am pleased to find Deputy Quinn, representing the Labour Party, encouraging us not alone to continue with that but suggesting that Chancellors of the Exchequer of the other eight countries unify and fall in behind the present Minister for Social Welfare in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply briefly to some of the points that concern this House now.  I will start where the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach left off.</P>
      <P>A precedent was indeed set in 1969 and the person who set it now has an opportunity to enlarge upon it.  I will take the position of cultural workers in the social welfare field as an example.  If a cultural worker is employed by a State organisation like the Abbey Theatre Company and becomes unemployed, because he has regular employment he qualifies for pay-related benefit.  If, however, he is not in such a category, and the majority of cultural workers here are not, he does not receive pay-related benefit.  The social welfare system here is very ambiguous on the status of cultural workers.  In fairness to all parties involved, the position has not been ignored and there are people directly studying the matter in the Department, in the Arts Council and in the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to think that the concern for those members of the cultural sector who are in the minority position of being able to pay income tax would be joined <Col N="1851" /> to a concern for the majority of such people who constitute the worst section of any work sector in the Community. I am glad to say that there has been consensus on the overall aspirations of this report.  In so far as there is consensus the opportunity for this House now would be to identify the areas within that consensus upon which we can move speedily and directly.  The lead has been set by Deputy McCreevy, as a member of the Committee, and reiterated by his senior colleague in the Fianna Fáil Party in the area of the treatment in taxation terms and in social welfare terms of workers in the cultural sector.  I hope that we will give a lead in advance of any directive from the Commission in extending to all workers in the cultural sector the generosity that was extended to the minority workers in the cultural sector who had problems of surtax in the past.</P>
    <P>Cultural workers, like any other workers, not only want to be well, reasonably and regularly paid so that they do not have to maintain some kind of romantic fiction, but also, like the rest of us, they want to retain some kind of control over the work produced by them.  In so far as the Community are moving along the road of industrial democracy, the principles of industrial democracy apply to workers in the cultural sector.  Workers who produce material which is recorded, or put on tape want, not a veto, but some say in the way and the location in which that material is used or shown.  It is not of much consolation to workers in the cultural sector who form some part of the international trade union movement to find that material which they have provided and been paid for is subsequently put on film and used to fill the gap when their fellow cultural workers in another part of the community go on strike for legitimate trade union reasons. It could be argued that they are being used to break pickets.  The democratic right of cultural workers in terms of controlling their material is another aspect that concerns this House at this time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I share part of the concern of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with <Col N="1852" /> regard to the response of members of the Joint Committee in not actively participating in this debate.  However, it is Thursday afternoon and this has been for many people a busy week.  I would like to thank the staff of the Joint Committee who helped us in preparing this document.  I thank also the Arts Council and Irish Actors' Equity, who have come to us with some observations on this point, for their assistance.  I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education for coming here and speaking on this.  There is no disagreement in general terms about the importance of culture.  Some of us, however have a statutory responsibility, by virtue of the democratic decision of the people of this country, for implementing cultural policies.  In the context of this report I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Education to have due regard to the proposals concerning a European room, museums and exchange of artefacts.  I hope that he will at some stage either communicate directly with the Joint Committee on what progress, if any, can be made on the comments made by the Joint Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the habit of asking questions on the adjournment because when the House has finished its business most people want to get away. Therefore, it is with great reluctance that I have raised this matter this evening.  I have done it for a number of reasons, the main reason being that I am interested in finding out certain things about the selection of the site.  I submitted my question on last Wednesday week and in some mysterious way it took from 12.00 noon on Wednesday until six minutes <Col N="1853" /> after 11 o'clock on the following Monday morning to move from one side of the corridor in Leinster House to the other.  Had it reached the other side of the corridor six minutes earlier the question would have been answered by the Minister or the Minister of State last week in the normal way.  When I found that something had happened I let the matter rest for two or three days and then I explained what had happened in the House and asked the Ceann Comhairle for permission to raise it by way of private notice question.  The Ceann Comhairle said he would request that this be done and he informed me later the request had been refused.  Having gone as far as I could to try to accommodate the Department I felt there was only one way by which to get an answer to my question and that was by raising it on the Adjournment.  If I did not get a reply this evening I would not get it until next February or March, the way questions are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two mines in Navan, one is in operation and the other will, I hope, be in operation in the not too distant future.  There is a good deal of employment and there is a great deal of technical work.  There is also a great deal of unemployment in the area, in east Meath and in Central Meath and into County Louth.  It was hoped that a smelter, which was a condition on which the agreement was made, would be established and go into operation in 1981. It was hoped the smelter would be in or around Navan, somewhere in the area, providing employment itself and providing employment in spin-off industries sited in the area as well.  There had been certain negotiations and subsequently one company, together with the IDA, carried out a detailed examination of all potential sites to decide where the smelter should be sited.  That was a rather unusual procedure.  Having examined 27 or 37 sites, Ballylongford on the Limerick-Kerry border was eventually decided on.  In Meath three sites were examined. The strange thing is Meath County Council were not informed the examination was taking place and were not consulted, and neither was the development officer.  This may appear <Col N="1854" /> commonplace to some but to me it appears a very remarkable decision because the only people who would know all about the sites in the area would be the local authority and the development officer. But they were not consulted.  Not alone that but they were not told what the sites were or if any sites were being examined. They were told nothing.  The situation was similar in Louth.</P>
    <P>This was a high-handed decision and many wondered what was happening. We discovered later a decision had been made to site the smelter in Ballylongford and the decision was announced in what presumably the Minister would consider the appropriate place.  It was announced in his address to the annual general meeting of Limerick City Fianna Fáil Comhairle Ceanntair on Friday, 5 May 1978.  He gave the meeting the great news that the smelter was to be sited in Ballylongford and the IDA had been instructed to apply to the county council for permission.  This is all rather extraordinary. The Government and the Minister could not by a miracle take the ore bodily out of Navan and set it down in Kerry or Limerick and so they decided to do the next best thing.  The decided they would take the weight of the jobs out of the area.  Having made this announcement, the Minister said at the end that no one should think the final decision had been taken, or words to that effect, and there might be other matters which would come up and Ballylongford was not, in fact, so far ahead of the other areas and there were areas that might be considered better.</P>
    <P>I think the general idea being spread at the time, which some people, particularly the Minister's supporters in County Meath, swallowed for a while but, after a while, decided it was not good enough, was that this was a dirty industry and one which would have to be sited away somewhere else and, if you wanted to site a dirty industry where better than down in Ballylongford in County Kerry?  Now the type of smelter, and the Minister mentioned this in his address, was an electrolytic process which is not a dirty industry and so there was no need to put it away out in the wilds. Secondly, it is a smelter which deals only with zinc.  The element of lead involved <Col N="1855" /> is about one-fifth of the element of zinc and at present prices it would not be worth while processing the lead.  Even if the vertical retort type of smelter was put into operation it is claimed the new version is much cleaner.  There is also, of course, the element of cost involved, the cost of the electricity being used.  An enormous amount of electricity will be used and the cost of it has a bearing on the type of smelter.  I am sure this is being taken into consideration but I cannot understand why it should be decided to mine ore in Navan, turn it into concentrates, thereby reducing substantially the amount of material being handled, and then bring it across the whole country a couple of hundred miles down to County Kerry for final processing. Assuming the concentrates would be carried by rail there would have to be a considerable length of additional rail laid in Kerry to bring the concentrates to the proposed site.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that Ballylongford is on the Shannon, a deep sea port.  There is an excellent port within 16 miles of the mine in Drogheda. There is already a rail running into Drogheda and only a very short addition would be needed to extend it to the docks.  If a deep sea port were required, and I do not believe it is, we know there is one relatively close to the mine, Green-ore. For the life of me I cannot understand why it is proposed to bring the product of the Navan mine over 200 miles to County Kerry.  In my opinion&mdash;I could be wrong and I hope the Minister will correct me if I am&mdash;the object appears to be to provide jobs there for roughly 500 people with the smelter itself plus the spin-off industries which will now be sited in Kerry rather than in Meath or Louth.  I think that is the idea and, if it is the idea, I can only describe the decision as both petty and mean and one that should not have been taken by the Minister.  The amount of ore involved is very big.  I understand that the smelter will have a capacity of 120,000 tons and will cost roughly £120 million.</P>
    <P>The next problem is, who will provide the smelter?  Are the Government and the IDA limiting the number of firms <Col N="1856" /> who would be interested in the smelter instead of saying to them that we want a smelter quickly?  The people involved in the survey have literally pulled out of the job and they are not interested in doing it.  I am quite sure many other companies are interested.  Will the Minister when he is replying say whether he or the IDA have consulted with the many firms concerned to know if they have any interest in it?  Are the two hefty mining giants involved in this interested in doing something in relation to providing a smelter?</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea of some group doing a survey about which nobody knows anything, and on foot of that the Minister deciding to instruct the IDA to apply for planning permission on some property which is not even owned by the IDA.  I am told that a substantial amount of road must be erected into the site and this will add additional costs. For that reason it seems as if somebody had not the best interests of the country at heart when the decision was made. The decision was made to site the smelter at a certain place without regard to any other costs and it did not matter if that decision ultimately put back the erection of the smelter for a considerable number of years.  This is one of our biggest complaints about this.</P>
    <P>As I asked in the question, why was it decided to site the proposed lead and zinc smelter in Kerry instead of in Meath?  What proposed sites in Meath were examined by the IDA before the decision was made?  I would also like to know if a cost analysis was carried out, and if it was, the result of it.  There is no reason why it should not be possible to have an answer to those.  If the Minister looks back at the way in which this was handled and the way in which this decision was announced he will agree that it seems that the decision was taken wrongly for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of a party political issue.  The Navan Urban Council on which the Minister's party is represented and the Meath County Council requested that this matter be looked into because they were not satisfied that the decision was in the best interests of the people they and I represent.</P>

      <P>The reply is that the decision to apply for planning permission for the proposed zinc smelter at Ballylongford, County Kerry was made following a comprehensive evaluation of 16 potential sites throughout the country.  The consultants found that the Ballylongford site met the requirements for a zinc smelter to a greater degree than any of the other sites considered. Two representative sites in County Meath which were considered to meet the minimum requirements for a zinc smelter were included in the study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the list that they looked at and it says two.  The reply continues that a full cost evaluation including transportation costs involving the use of the various sites was carried out and formed part of the overall study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will briefly go through some of the history and background to this matter. The New Jersey Zinc Company, an American company selected by my <Col N="1858" /> predecessor to operate the smelter commenced studying the project in April 1977.  They engaged Kaiser Engineers of the USA to advise on the technical and economic aspects including site selection. That study was completed in February 1978.  Kaiser Engineers were assisted by the IDA.  The IDA regional managers sought the views of county councils with a view to identifying the most suitable representative sites.  Kaiser also consulted with organisations such as CIE, the ESB, the IIRS and various shipping firms.  They engaged Irish consultants and had extensive discussions with local representatives.  Sixteen possible sites were identified, two of them in County Meath.  Kaiser then carried out a comprehensive evaluation of each site under the headings of cost, operational factors and facilities, demography and aesthetics, and environmental.  Each head was broken into subheadings and rankings were accorded to each site.  The key requirements for a suitable site were cost, including the sensitivity of cost to further expansion, proximity to a suitable harbour, to rail facilities and to a power station, labour availability and suitability from an environmental point of view.</P>
    <P>Kaiser found that the Ballylongford site met its requirements to a greater extent than any other.  Ballylongford received the highest aggregate marking on a combination of aspects.  It is neither desirable nor possible for me to set out the merits or demerits of all the sites evaluated but Ballylongford scored well particularly on the question of proximity to major power facilities, deepwater harbour possibilities, effluent disposal and ground and foundation conditions.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy said, the Meath sites offered transportation savings, but other cost areas including transmission line construction, development cost for berthing facilities, site development costs and so on combined to outweigh the savings on transport.  Kaiser's evaluation was thorough and comprehensive.  It was independently based on the company's criteria assisted by considerable local guidance.  It is clearly desirable in the national interests that some particular site should be reserved for a smelter. There are good possibilities for siting <Col N="1859" /> near this site zinc using industries for which the harbour facilities concerned are a real and positive attraction.</P>
    <P>After consultation with the IDA I therefore insturcted them to seek planning permission in respect of this site.  I authorised them to acquire whatever extra land was needed.  We were fortunate that they owned most of the land involved and they are in the process of acquiring the balance necessary.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made the point that this decision was announced first in Limerick at a Limerick City Fianna Fáil Comhairle Ceantair.  It would not have mattered where I was that night, I would have announced it.  The location of the smelter is immaterial to me because I regret to say that it has no bearing on my constituency because as far as I can estimate the site is more than 42 miles from the nearest point of my constituency, but I suppose it is not immaterial to people like Deputy Spring.  I presume therefore that Deputy Tully in raising the matter this evening is doing so purely on a personal basis and not as a matter of Labour Party policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Spring will be as angry with me as the Fianna Fáil supporters in Navan were with the Minister when he made the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation I was faced with in the earlier part of the year was due to the arrangement made with New Jersey Zinc and their suddenly pulling out of the proposed arrangements.  Because of this there was a delay of close to a year which might otherwise have been avoided.  That meant that the provision of a smelter for which necessarily a good <Col N="1860" /> deal of forward planning must go on, was put back a year longer than it need have been.  After the departure of New Jersey Zinc from the scene and their statement to me that they were no longer interested, I felt it was necessary to make a decision at an early date to try to get ahead with this matter, particularly as at that stage we were without any private sector interest in it.</P>
      <P>Having consulted the IDA I made that decision and I think it was the right one.  Having gone to a great deal of expense, as the IDA did because they partly funded this study by Kaiser to get a very detailed evaluation of sites all over the country, one was not likely to disregard the site which was indicated by the consultants concerned as the most favourable.  As I said, it is immaterial to me where the smelter is sited as long as we are getting on with the job, something that was done in the past.  If this job had been tackled in earlier days we might not be faced with the prospect of several years of exports of concentrates.</P>

      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  The 1978 figures relate to 31 October, 1978 and exclude firms hauling for reward under exemptions.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Except as shown above, the numbers relate to licences rather than vehicles; the licences included authorise 6,868 vehicles, increased under the Road Transport Act, 1978 from a previous figure of 1,158, but the number at present operated is probably under 2,000.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Under exemptions and subject to conditions, both of which have changed within the last year under EEC and national legislation, Irish non-licensed hauliers are free to haul at home and subject to permission from the other States abroad also, but their numbers are not known.</P>
    <P>(B)  Licences for International Haulage</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>(a)  Permits for international haulage are normally <i>per vehicle</i> and valid either for a <i>number of journeys</i>, usually one toten, <i>or a period</i> of a few days to a year.  The numbers current cannot, therefore, readily be given and the basic data resources are spread over many Governments e.g., foreign Governments which grant licence to Irish hauliers.  The figures available are not valid for comparisons with the preceding figures relating specifically to Irish hauliers.</P>
    <P>(b)  It is the general rule that a haulier in international haulage may not perform point-to-point haulage with a foreign country; e.g. foreign hauliers are not permitted to perform point-to-point haulage in Ireland.</P>
    <P>(c)  There are 2,835 vehicle authorisations available to hauliers of EEC member states to haul between those states in 1978; very few holders would visit Ireland; Ireland's own share of this number is 60.  Ireland holds 13 of the 385 similar authorisations <Col N="1813" /> available to hauliers of member states of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) to haul between these states (EEC plus 9 other countries); very few holders would visit Ireland.  Ireland has 50 EEC authorisations out of 2,363 for 1977 and 13 out of 385 ECMT authorisations.</P>
    <P>(d)  Under the bilateral agreements with France, Belgium and the Federal Republic of Germany, the total reciprocal quota of permits for the year is 13,400; the number of permits issued to date by France, Belgium and Germany to their hauliers is not known, Irish hauliers have had 8,326 permits in the 10 months to 31 October 1978 for journeys to, from or through France, Belgium and the Federal Republic of Germany; the corresponding figure for 1977 was 4,978 but only the French agreement was operative for the full period.</P>
    <P>(e)  Irish hauliers held 326 vehicle licences for cross-border haulage in the year ended 30 September 1978, as against 279 in the previous year; Northern hauliers held 1,946 and 1,494 licences respectively in the same periods.  Licences are granted freely by both administrations.</P>
    <P>(f)  From January to October, 1978 other outside hauliers were granted 4,131 permits against 3,423 in the previous corresponding period; no information on permits granted to Irish hauliers by other administrations is available.</P>

The suggestion that specially adapted toilet facilities for disabled persons should also be provided is proper in the first instance to the gallery authorities but, in the circumstances, I have requested that the Commissioners urgently consult the gallery director on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> It is unlikely that the question of an appropriate ramp and toilet facilities will be definitively settled before 1 January 1979 but the Commissioners have undertaken to provide a temporary ramp at the gallery entrance on that day.</P>

      <P>There are 65 applicants for service, the oldest application dating from October 1974.  Provision of service for applicants in these two areas is dependent on completion of a cabling scheme.  It was not possible to do this cabling work when cabling the remainder of the Broadford estate in 1976 because the necessary ducts had not been laid at the time by the building contractor.  There are many cabling schemes awaiting attention now, the programme for attending to them having been disrupted by industrial action earlier this year.  For this reason I regret it is not possible at present to give a reliable estimate as to when the cabling scheme in question will be completed but I shall communicate with the Deputy when an estimate can be given.</P>

    <P>The average length of periods listed above is 4.2 years.</P>
    <P>(2)  The practice is to release a person serving a life sentence after a number of years, which varies according to the circumstances. Among the factors taken into account in determining the date of release are the circumstances of the offence and the general character and stability of the offender.  The progress of all prisoners serving life or other long-term sentences is monitored.  Regular review meetings are held in the relevant institutions at which the cases of such prisoners are discussed.  These discussions are attended by custodial and Department staff as well as by welfare, medical and psychiatric personnel. While there are a small number of prisoners whose detention for a longer than average period appears to be essential in the public interest, it is generally found possible to begin a long-term, <Col N="1817" /> phased programme for the offender's release from custody after he has served about five years.  The final phasing-out is achieved by the system of temporary releases&mdash;daily and full-time&mdash;under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 (No. 27 of 1960).</P>

      <P>The funds in question represent bequests, donations or subscriptions provided from private sources for educational purposes and administered by my Department under various legal trusts.  The list of trusts, together with relevant statement of their aims and objectives as set out in the terms of the trust is as follows:</P>
      <P>Killury or Nelan Fund: The income is applied towards the maintenance of Killury national school, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>The Henry P. Mullock Charity: The interest is paid in augmentation of the salary of the teacher in the Charleville national school, Tullamore, County Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carlisle and Blake Fund: The income is applied to the award of four premiums of equal value to lay students who distinguish <Col N="1821" /> themselves at the final examination in the training colleges.</P>
    <P>Reid Bequest Scheme A: Awards are made to six of the most efficient boys' national schools in County Kerry&mdash;the schools being selected triennially&mdash;and the amount allocated to each school is calculated in accordance with the average attendance of boys for the previous school year.  The distribution of money allocated to each school is entrusted to the manager who with the teachers selects the pupils to whom the awards are made.</P>
    <P>Reid Bequest Scheme B: The scheme provides for the award of prizes of £20 each payable to each of the five best male candidates from County Kerry competing at the leaving certificate and successful at the entrance to training examination.</P>
    <P>Reid Bequest Scheme: The scheme provides for the award of exhibitions tenable at a university to male students from County Kerry, who are or were in a recognised training college and have matriculated.</P>
    <P>The Father O'Halloran Memorial Fund: The income of the fund is applied annually to the provision of two prizes for the boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 14 years residing in the district of Grane and attending any national school therein who shall show the greatest proficiency in all the subjects forming the ordinary national school programme.</P>
    <P>The Michael Joseph McEnery Memorial Scholarship Fund: The object of the scholarship was to enable deserving boys who were pupils at Mahoonagh national school or Raheenagh national school, County Limerick in whose case certain prescribed conditions were fulfilled to attend a secondary school, vocational school or other school approved by the Minister for Education. Since the introduction of free post-primary education the application of this fund as heretofore has become irrelevant and a new scheme is being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Lismore Endowment (Earl of Cork's Scholarships): The income is applied in providing annually, subject to certain conditions, two scholarships of <Col N="1822" /> equal value one for the boy and one for the girl who have answered best at the intermediate certificate examination from the candidates qualified as to residence and so forth in the Lismore district.</P>
    <P>The Charleville Endowment: The income of the endowment is distributed to those of the secondary schools situated in the Charleville district which, receive capitation grant, and the distribution is made in the same proportions as such capitation grant has been calculated.</P>
    <P>The Burke Memorial Fund: The annual income of the fund is expended on prizes awarded on the results of the intermediate certificate examination.</P>
    <P>Ciste Shéamais A. Mhic Shuibhne: The income of the fund is used for the purpose of awarding annually a silver medal to the candidate who obtains the highest marks on the honours course paper in Greek, answered through the medium of Irish at the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>Erasmus Smith Endowment: The objects of the scheme are: (a) to provide for the reconstruction, equipment, reopening and maintenance of the Abbey School (formerly the Tipperary Grammar School) as a secondary school for boys including in its curriculum a special course in agriculture; (b) to provide scholarships for poor boys residing within a radius of seven miles of one of the grammer schools at Drogheda, Galway and Tipperary and for boys residing in any of the districts set out in the schedule to the scheme as being those in which the former Erasmus Smith estates were situated.  The provision in regard to the reconstruction etc. of the Abbey School has been fulfilled.  A sum of £580 of the income is allocated for the payment of the annual subsidy for instruction in agriculture and £1,720 for scholarships.  The annual subsidy is still being paid.  Since the introduction of free post-primary education no scholarships have been awarded and the introduction of a new scheme is under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Mary A. Hardiman Bequest: The bequest is devoted to the promotion and support of vocational education. <Col N="1823" /> The Murphy Bequest: The income of the bequest is used for the general purposes connected with and for the benefit of the museum.</P>
    <P>The schemes under which most of the funds are administered do not require applications for aid as payment is made to the persons or bodies entitled to benefit from the funds when the conditions of the schemes have been fulfilled.</P>
