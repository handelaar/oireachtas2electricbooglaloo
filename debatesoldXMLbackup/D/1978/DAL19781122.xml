      <P>I should like to raise a matter of the same kind as the Taoiseach frequently raised in the last Dáil on the Order of Business.  The quarterly industrial inquiry was published in the newspapers this morning.  I understand that it reached the newspaper offices late yesterday afternoon.  It has not yet reached me either in the post at my own house or in the post at Leinster House.  I would regard that as something requiring explanation.  Yesterday afternoon the House resumed debate on the Industrial Development Bill.  As I still had the major part of my speech to make, I especially inquired last week and again yesterday whether this survey would be available in time for the debate.  I was told first by the Statistics Office that it would be ready on Tuesday but when I inquired on Monday I was told that it would be ready on Friday, not before Friday, and even that could not be guaranteed.  I hope I will not be thought self-important in raising this matter. That situation in which an Opposition spokesman on an important Bill especially inquires about a statistical document from the responsible office several days before it appears and is then given a run-around of that kind is disgraceful. Unless I can get some proper explanation from the Government&mdash;I know I am taking the Tánaiste short by raising this matter now&mdash;I am going to ask my party to put down a special motion on this matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy indicated, he appreciates that I have no notice of this matter and therefore cannot respond immediately.  I will have inquiries made into the matter.  Until it is <Col N="1481" /> proved otherwise, I will assume that the procedure followed is the procedure that is normally followed.  Even though the Deputy did not get a copy of the document I am sure that he was glad to note the good news contained in it from his newspaper reading.</P>

      <P>This section provides for a progressive reduction in the rate of tax payable in respect of assets disposed of according to the length of the period of ownership.  It exempts certain other items.  Subsection (3) lists those exempted, such as development land, minerals and the exploration or exploitation rights in a designated area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Section 4 (3) (i) reads:</P>
      <P>land in the State the consideration for the disposal of which exceeds what the market value of the land would be if, immediately before the disposal, it had become unlawful to carry out any development (within the meaning of section 3 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963) in relation to the land other than development land of the kinds specified in section 4 (1) of that Act;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention behind this subsection is that what is commonly called development land should not be given relief in the payment of capital gains tax.  A great deal of property in Ireland is in rural towns.  A house, shop and yard may be attached to a small piece of land which in the strict sense is not development land but it would always be open to the <Col N="1484" /> Revenue Commissioners to say that because there was no planning restriction on it, this land was more valuable. Could the Minister find some way of dealing with this?  When we speak of development lands we are thinking of large tracts of land adjacent to towns.  I am talking about pieces of land, attached to properties, which are disposed of but which, if they were held for 21 years, would not be liable to capital gains tax, unless the Revenue Commissioners decided that that piece of land, which might be as small as a quarter of an acre or even smaller, could be developed and termed as development land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;development land&rdquo; is taken from paragraph 17 (1) (b) of Schedule 1 to the Capital Gains Act, 1975 which excluded such land held on 6 April 1974 from the benefit of time apportionment.  I will make inquiries but I am not aware of any difficulty having arisen heretofore under that definition on the basis indicated as a possibility by Deputy Barry.</P>
      <P>I have a note here which might be of help to the Deputy in regard to the manner in which this operates.  Where property, say a retail shop and residence with a yard and garden, is sold for continued use as a similar retail outlet, it will fetch no more than its open market price.  In that event the disposal would be outside the scope of section 4 (3) (a) (i) and any gain made would get the benefit of the tapering rates of charge.  If, however, the property was sold to, say a developer who in anticipation of obtaining planning permission for a new development, such as an office block, is prepared to pay, and does pay, an enhanced price for the property, then the disposal would be regarded as a disposal of land with development value and the gain would be charged at the rate of 30 per cent without any tapering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in computing the chargeable gain the cost price of the property or its market value at 6 April 1974, if the disponer owned it at that date, would in common with other gains be adjusted for inflation.  The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of any <Col N="1485" /> specific case where land has been treated as development land in the circumstances outlined in certain representations made to them on this matter.  If any cases are brought to their attention where it would appear to Deputies that the operation of the section is contrary to what the intention was, the Revenue Commissioners would be pleased to look into the situation, but, as I said, they are not aware of any such case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to properties which are sold at enhanced values.  If they were sold at the normal market value and if that represented a capital gain on the 1974 value and if the Revenue Commissioners decided that this property had been bought for development purposes, the person who had received the money would have to pay capital gains tax without getting the benefit of the profit the developer would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says would be correct except for this fact.  If the price paid is the normal market value, then that does not arise and the tapering rates are available.  I cannot visualise a situation in which the purchaser of the property intends to develop it and pays only the normal market price and there is a liability for capital gains without tapering rates.  The real test for the Revenue Commissioners is whether the price paid is in excess of the normal market price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is only a little in excess this would mean there would be full liability for the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated we are not aware of any case in which this complaint has been made.  If one takes a valuation of property in relation to its current value, there could be some room for argument above or below the figure the valuer puts on it.  If the Revenue Commissioners were to say that because there was a slight increase over the valuation put on it and the value of the tapering rates was to be lost, this would not be in accordance with what is intended. <Col N="1486" /> I repeat that I have no evidence that any such case has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification on reading the section: I understood the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; was the relevant word and settled the type of tax to be paid.  Now the Minister mentioned the price of the house&mdash;if the price paid for this land, which was not developed, was over the normal price.  Is that the relevant word now?  I understood planning permission had to be got for development land.  Nobody is foolish enough to sell land without finding out whether planning permission can be obtained for development of any kind.  I should like further clarification.  A person selling land in an area where development is likely to take place would get much more money for it if he could obtain permission for the building of houses or for industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any great problem regarding the sale of property in respect of which there is planning permission for development, although if it were sold in such a case at the ordinary market price there might be some room for argument; normally it would not be sold at the ordinary market price.  The only case in which a difficulty arises is where the land is sold without planning permission and the purchaser intends to develop it.  If he pays the ordinary market price a problem does not arise, although the price becomes very important.  The test to be applied in identifying land which is development land within the meaning of the section will, in effect, require a comparison of the price received for the land with the ruling land values in the locality based on current use value.  The mere fact that an abnormally high price is obtained will not necessarily mean that the subsection will apply.  It must be clear that the price obtained would have been smaller if development had been prohibited by law.  <i>Prima facie</i> the inspector will look closely at any case where a price in excess of current use value is obtained.  In many cases it will be clear that the land has been sold for development purposes, an example being where farm land is sold to a developer for development purposes. <Col N="1487" /> Where it is not quite clear what is involved, then the price comes in and comparison is made with the going rate in the locality.  Even if there is a substantial excess on the going rate it does not automatically mean that it is treated as the sale of development land, but a transaction of that kind would be looked at closely to determine whether or not it was to be treated as development land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That clarifies it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of a small country town in which a man has for eight or ten years owned a business to which a yard extending over a quarter of an acre is attached.  Suppose some local person buys this business at a price somewhat in excess of market value with the intention of building an office block for an insurance company or building society.  The person who then sells it above the market price becomes liable at a rate of tax depending on the length of time he has owned the property.  The tapering rate applies.  Is that correct?  If the Revenue Commissioners decide that this is development land and has been sold without planning permission, there is no restriction on planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners decide that it is the sale of development land, then the tapering rate is not allowed but there is indexation for inflation.  I find it difficult to visualise a situation of the kind described by Deputy Barry and the sale of the kind of yard he described where the purchaser intends to build an office block.  In such a case it is very unlikely that the price paid would be simply in or about the price which would be given if the purchaser intended to continue the existing business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The owner would not know that this was the intention of the purchaser and would be very pleased to get a price 10 per cent above the market price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The case described is unlikely to arise but the Revenue Commissioners are extremely unlikely to treat it as the sale of development land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1488" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know the position regarding the next of kin.  If the owner of land does not make a will, the property passes on his death to his wife and family.  Title may be complicated and there may be a dispute among the family, one member claiming his or her part of the property or its value in cash.  There may be many legal difficulties and it could take up to three years before probate is taken out and the title is in order.  The wife who may have helped to build up the farm or business is caught for gains during those three years, though if the original owner had disposed of the property he would not have had to pay anything at all.  I am sure Deputy Callanan would agree that the farming community are very reluctant to hand over to younger members of the family.  It is an old tradition and they like to hold on as long as they can. It is not fair that the members of the family should be caught in this net. Under the Family Home Protection Act a financial institution from whom a husband is seeking a loan will not grant any money unless the wife signifies her agreement.  Even if he wants to dispose of the land, or the property, or the house, she must sign the deed.  If she does not, there is no deal.  I am not too happy with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have another look at this section to see if any provision could be made to cover the wife, the son and the daughter.  I am excluding nieces, nephews and other next of kin.  I have strong views on this.  The wife who is a partner has equal rights to the place.  If the husband disposes of the property after 21 years, he does not have to pay capital gains tax.  If he does not make a will, and after his death there is a dispute in the family, and it takes three years or longer to decide on the title, and a son or daughter wants £10,000 or £20,000 which is not there in liquid assets, the property has to be disposed of and the wife, as the administrator, has no option but to dispose of the property. She has to pay capital gains tax from the date the husband died until the date of disposal of the property.  I am not happy with that.  I hope some provision can be <Col N="1489" /> made to cover the wife, the son and the daughter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations on this matter from Deputy Connolly and from some other people as well.  I want to give notice to the House that it is my intention on Report Stage, probably by way of recommital, to introduce an amendment that would do what Deputy Connolly is suggesting in respect of the surviving spouse.  I am afraid I cannot agree to go beyond that to other members of the family.  There is a good case to be made for the surviving spouse and I intend to introduce an amendment to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister.  I do not want to be awkward but I should like the son and the daughter to be included with the wife.  I have known men who worked with their parents for years.  They may be 50 years of age before the father transfers anything to them.  The fathers are afraid they would be put out on the road and have to go into a home.  This was the great fear, and the father held on as long as he possibly could.  I should like the Minister to give very serious consideration to including the daughter and the son as well as the wife.  I think I have made a reasonable case.  I am excluding nephews, brothers, brothers-in-law, and so on.  The three people I mentioned should be covered in some way in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go over the ground covered by Deputy Connolly. Knowing the situation in the country, I am delighted the Minister has decided to provide for the wife.  I appeal to him to include the son or the daughter.  What Deputy Connolly referred to is quite common.  The son could have worked with the father for 40 years and he would not get any relief.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to providing for the son or the daughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>In regard to the son or the daughter, under this Bill if, as Deputy Connolly visualised, the property passed <Col N="1490" /> on the death of the father to the son or the daughter no liability for capital gains tax arises.  Secondly, as far as the son or daughter is concerned, the value of the property they get&mdash;and this is one of the big changes in this Bill&mdash;is as at the date on which they get the property, not including any increase in value over the period the father held it.  Therefore, the son or daughter will get it at whatever value is put on it when they get it.  No charge for capital gains arises until they dispose of the property.  Anything they have to pay is in respect of a gain in its value from the time they got it.  It does not relate back to the father's time.  It is a different case, and I do not think it is doing any injustice to a son or daughter in view of the other changes in the Bill which I mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The kernel of the matter is that the property may have to be disposed of due to unforeseen circumstances, or to the fact that there was no will or no agreement, and a number of the family are involved.  They would have to pay capital gains on the difference between the value say three years ago and the value now.  I hope I am making this clear.  It is quite complicated. The son has worked with the father since he was four years old and carried a hammer and staples for his father to erect posts in the fields.  The father died having made no will or no agreement and the son had to say reluctantly to the other members of the family that he did not want to sell.  Because property and land are so valuable today the other members of the family wanted their share and the son had no option other than to put a mortgage around his neck which would choke him.  I deal with business people, shopkeepers and farmers who worked hard and paid taxes.  I believe they should get some little concession.  I want to see the wife, the son and daughter covered.  I exclude the rest.</P>

      <P>What is relevant to this matter is inflation.  If, say, a son inherited a farm four or five years ago but was forced by circumstances to sell it, on what does he pay tax?  Very often title is held up for as long as five years.  In <Col N="1491" /> such circumstances would he have to pay on the difference, having regard to inflation, between the time he sold and the time of the title going through?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that there is no tax involved on a straightforward passing of land from father to son.  But if the son finds subsequently that he must sell, is he taxed on the value of the land at the time he inherited it or on its value at the time of disposal?  This is where the question of inflation arises because since 1974, for instance, the price of land has almost doubled.</P>

      <P>In the case outlined by Deputy Callanan the base value is deemed to be that of 1974 and the difference between that and the price at which the land is disposed of subsequently is deemed to be the gain.  Deputy Callanan put his finger on the matter when he referred to inflation.  There is provision in the Bill to index for inflation so that in the case described by the Deputy the value of the holding between 1974 and 1978 would be adjusted to allow for inflation during those years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not thing that would take care of the full problem.  The figure mentioned in the Bill is 81.4 whereas land prices have increased far greater than the inflation level.  A Member of this House who is an auctioneer told me the other day that he brought in five farmers nearest to a parcel of land of almost 60 acres that was being disposed of and that the price realised was £230,000 or almost £4,000 per acre.  In 1974 the price per acre would probably have been less than £1,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>At £1,000 per acre the value in 1974 would have been £60,000. That would be increased now to about £107,000 but the person selling would be liable for capital gains on the difference between that amount and the £230,000 that was realised.  In other words, he would have to pay tax on £123,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>The relevant section indicates that the multiplier to be applied in the type of case outlined by Deputy Callanan is 1.8, that is, between 1974 and 1978.  That means that the base cost&mdash;the value at 1974&mdash;would be almost double for the purpose of calculating the gain.  If the value of the land has increased substantially in excess of that level all I can say is that the person disposing of the property is very lucky.  He is doing very well on the deal and why should he not pay capital gains tax?</P>

In addition <Col N="1493" /> there is the other aspect whereby in the country, for instance, a wife works very hard with her husband.  If they are farmers she may do such jobs as milk cows and if they have a business she usually works behind the counter.

      <P>If, say, the son who has worked on a farm of 40 acres must sell out in order to divide the estate among his brothers, his livelihood is being taken away.  It is all right to say that he will be lucky to get a high price for the land.  It looks great coming into his hand but he has to give out so much of it.  He must try and buy something again and he is stuck with inflation.  It is the very same as selling a bullock at present, when one gets £300 or £400 but when one goes to replace him one has to pay perhaps within £50 of the price received.  That man must seek some way of livelihood. He appears lucky on paper.  But the point I am making is that he must make a living if, through unforeseen circumstances he must sell the farm and gets a big price for it.  He earns on the gains on the period from, say, 1974 to 1978, excluding the amount taken care of by inflation. But that man is not selling his farm and saying &ldquo;I am going to live on the few pounds I have for the rest of my life&rdquo;.  He has to buy another farm, when he is again subject to inflation. Therefore, he is stuck with inflation all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite clear to me what Deputy Connolly is seeking.  Either he is seeking that the son or daughter should get the benefit of the period of ownership of the deceased father, or he is seeking a special indexation rate in respect of land because it has increased in value more than the consumer price index.  I do not know if that is what he is seeking, but let me say it just would not be feasible&mdash;and I doubt if it would be justified&mdash;to apply a different indexation rate for different kinds of assets.  The Deputy may not appreciate some of the problems that would rise even if I were to agree to what he is urging.  For instance, if the son or daughter were to get the benefit of the father's period of ownership for the purpose of calculating the tapering rates then correspondingly, <Col N="1495" /> if they were getting the benefit, they would have to be taxed on the gain in the value of the land during the father's lifetime.  This could be a serious imposition on them whereas now the only gain on which they can be taxed is the value at the date of death and then that gain is indexed, as I have indicated, in accordance with the movement in the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside any other questions, on balance they would probably do better under the present arrangement than under the one Deputy Connolly is suggesting, although I know he was not suggesting the full taxation of the gains during the father's lifetime.  I am sure if he thinks about it he will see that one cannot give them the benefit of the period of ownership and not attribute to them the gain in the value of the property during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they will be acquiring the liabilities too.  There is this special tax status for a married couple. The existing position is that in the case of a gift the receiving spouse can obtain the benefit of the donor spouse's period of ownership.  That is at present applicable only in the case of gifts, not in the case of inheritance.  That provision in regard to gifts is a special concession.  It seems to me logical to extend it from gifts to inheritances&mdash;if it is there in the case of gifts then it should apply in the case of inheritances&mdash;but it does not apply in the case of gifts to sons or daughters.  I do not think an adequate case has been made for extending it to sons or daughters.  A very cogently argued case has been made but it is not a sufficient case.  I have to sound the warning note that it is not all entirely a <Col N="1496" /> benefit.  It can be a disadvantage in some circumstances to give this concession.</P>

I can see the point about the son or daughter who was away and came back, coming in, selling the property, gaining by it and not spending any time on it.  I wonder could there be any consideration given to the case of a person who died at, say, 60 years of age, who had been married at 20 years of age, whose eldest son lived all his life on the farm, worked it, who was there only a year short of the wife, and she is considered with the husband. Could there not be the same concession given for the person who had spent all his life on the land.  Indeed, I must thank the Minister for bringing in the spouse. The case I am making is in respect of a person who had spent all his life in a business or on a farm.  I am not advocating special concessions at all for farmers only, because inflation has affected <Col N="1497" /> businesses as well.  I am taking everyone into consideration.  Could there not be some concession given along those lines?  I am not now referring to people who would have been away on business somewhere, who come back and get possession of their father or mother's place.  I do not believe there should be any concession to those people because they had not spent their life there.  I am speaking about the people who had spent their life either on a business or working a farm.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might deal first with the point made by Deputy Callanan, I would say that in the case he described&mdash;and I agree with the kind of sentiments he expressed&mdash;normally the son who had been on the farm all his life would continue and intend to continue on the farm and no question of liability to capital gains tax would arise.  It could only arise where he had to dispose of it. He would then get indexation.  It is true that he would have to pay a higher price when he would have to buy somewhere else, but he would have got a higher price.  If people are ever to be liable for <Col N="1498" /> capital gains tax it has to arise at the time when they make the gain.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by Deputy O'Leary, the way in which the CPI has been operating is that we take the base adopted by the Central Statistics Office, 100, and we go on from there.  The midFebruary figure is fixed because it is closest to the commencement of the tax year.  It is worked on a yearly basis.  The question of dividing the tapering into three-year periods rather than taking a one-year period or a six-year period is a matter largely for decision on what is the most equitable way to do it.  The 21-year period is clearly designed to ensure exemption from capital gains tax in respect of somebody who has been building up a business or a farm during a working lifetime.  How we divide it is a matter of trying to get a reasonable reflection in the division of the period during which the person owned the asset.  One could argue for a division into smaller or larger periods, and perhaps one could make a tenable argument either way, but it seems to me that it is not unreasonable to do it on the basis of a three-year period.</P>

Therefore, in the case of a delay in administration, which is what Deputy Connolly apparently has in mind, if that delay exceeded three years, if it was between three years and six years, it would be 25.5 per cent, but if it were less than three years it would be 30 per cent.</P>

      <P>Although this is purely a technical amendment, I am afraid the explanation is rather complex.  Section 5 (1) concerns the disposal of the whole of the original assets under compulsory purchase procedures.  If there is reinvestment in replacement assets, it is provided that the disposal of the original assets is to be disregarded and there is to be no acquisition of the replacement assets.  The original assets and the replacement assets are to be treated as the same assets, having the same date of acquisition and the same base costs as the original assets.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) is concerned with a case where an amount in excess of the consideration received is invested in replacement assets.  It provides in effect that relief is to be given only in respect of the part of the replacement assets represented by the amount of the consideration reinvested.  The final part of the subsection, which is concerned with applying subsection (1), so that the part of the replacement assets referred to as the original assets will be treated as the same assets, does not contain any reference to the original assets.  The purpose of the amendment is to remedy this defect by inserting a reference to the original assets at the end of subsection (2).</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 39, after &ldquo;granted&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, whether before or after the commencement of the Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that where relief was granted under the existing version of section 27 of the 1975 Act in respect of a disposal made prior to 6 April 1978 by a parent aged 55 years or over to a child of his, the charging provisions in paragraph (a) (4) of the new version of section 27 will apply.</P>
      <P>These provisions will come into play when the child, within the ten-year limit, makes a disposal on or after 6 April 1978 of the assets transferred to him by the parent.  The text of the amendment makes it clear that the charging provisions of the new subsection will apply whether the original disposal was made before or after 6 April 1978, the proposed date of commencement of the new Act.</P>

      <P>There is a little problem there because in the last ten years there has been considerable acquisition by farmers of additional pieces of land to give them bigger and more viable holdings.  A farmer may have acquired about ten acres, which is not very valuable by itself, but added to the 40 or 50 acres makes a holding which is very much more valuable in total than the bits put together.  So, when he decides to transfer his 60-acre holding to his son, the ten or the 30 acres&mdash;whatever has been added to make it a viable holding&mdash;becomes at a very enhanced value liable to capital gains tax if acquired in the last ten years.  Does the Minister understand my point?</P>

      <P>If he is under 55 this would not apply to him.  It is a special provision for retirement.  Deputy Barry is correct in saying that the gain on the additional portion of land which had not been held for 10 years would be liable. But of course the other portion in the case he described and I think in most cases, the main portion of the land, <Col N="1502" /> would have been held for more than ten years and would therefore be exempt.</P>

      <P>I think the kernel of this is that you would have to pay the tax where it would fall to the spouse inside the period you are on now.  It would mean that the value of the property had gone up so high that payment of capital gains tax would be very high and it would be very hard for the spouse to meet that if, say, it was a farm of £150,000.  Because of the way land and all property has gone up one would be heavily caught in that case.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if we are talking about the same thing.  If the Deputy is talking of the additional portion added on&mdash;the only part which would be liable&mdash;being worth £150.000 then the remainder of the farm must be worth a great deal of money.  That would be a very significant value for &ldquo;a small addition&rdquo; to a farm which I think is what Deputy Barry is talking about.</P>

      <P>I am talking about much more ordinary people than those in the rich midlands of Laois and Offaly. I am talking about the man who has 40 acres which obviously is not viable.  In the last five years when land jumped in price he bought an additional 20 acres and he now has 60 acres.  He is over 55 and wants to transfer the land to his son. He would have no capital gains tax liability on the 40 acres but because the 20 acres has been added to make 60 acres it becomes much more valuable and the 20 acres then has an enhanced value which, even with the allowance for inflation of 81 per cent, it has probably quadrupled in price rather than gone up by 1.8.  The son then or the father is liable for the tax on the difference.  This is another thing that may tend to discourage what Deputy Connolly and Deputy Callanan were advocating, the handing over of land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;sections 3 and 4 of the Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;section 3 of the Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978, or for the purposes of determining the period of ownership under section 4 of that Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of section 9 is to ensure that where section 28, that is roll over relief, of the 1975 Act applies so that a chargeable gain is treated as accruing at a date later than the date of disposal on which it actually accrued, the deferment of the charge to tax will not provide any basis for a claim by the owner of assets that indexation under section 3 and tapering rates under section 4 should be applied by reference to the combined period of ownership of the old assets and the new assets, that is a period commencing with the date of acquisition of the old assets and ending with the date of cessor of use for trading purposes of the new assets.  The reference to section 4 in the new subsection (2) (a) of section 28 inserted by this section, section 9, requires to be restricted so as to ensure that section 28 will be overridden only in so far as it might be held to extend the period of ownership of a rolled over asset for the purposes of section 4.  It is not the intention that section 2 (a) of section <Col N="1504" /> 28 should have any effect as respects the rate of tax at which a deferred gain will be charged.  In accordance with the general scheme of roll over relief contained in the 1975 Act this rate will be the rate appropriate to the actual period of ownership of the asset at the time when the deferred gain on the disposal of those assets accrued&mdash;that is, emerges for charging purposes under section 28 and not necessarily any of the tapering rates operative at the date of disposal of the old assets.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment removes any doubt on this score.  It also secures that the amount of the chargeable gains computed in accordance with section 3 by reference to the date of disposal of the old assets, that is by reference to the actual period of ownership of those assets, will be frozen at that date.  The overall effect of the proposed amendment is to freeze in relation to old assets both the amount of the chargeable gains on the disposal of those assets and the period of ownership of those assets but not the rate of tax at which those gains will ultimately be charged when the new assets into which the old assets were rolled over ceased to be used for trading purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in respect of the old assets the amendment would freeze both the amount of the gain on disposal of the assets and the period of ownership of the assets.  That is so that they could not be given the benefit in respect of the old assets when they are disposed of.  But it would not freeze the rate of tax at which the gains would ultimately be charged when the new assets would cease to be used for trading purposes.  That is when the tax becomes liable for payment. When the assets cease to be used for trading purposes then the liability for capital gains tax will arise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 30, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in such circumstances that if a gain accrued on the later disposal it would be a chargeable gain&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment to prevent a charge being imposed on a genuine charity where they sell an asset which had been received by them as a gift or at a low cost.  Under the existing version of section 39 of the 1975 Act, where a charity disposes of an asset&mdash;for example, an asset received as a gift or at a low cost in relation to which relief from capital gains tax was granted to the donor under the section&mdash;the charity's base cost is the donor's cost of acquisition. <Col N="1506" /> If the charity later disposed of the asset while remaining a genuine charity, the charity's base cost as thus fixed was immaterial because under section 22 of the 1975 Act no chargeable gain arose on the later disposal by the charity.</P>
    <P>Under the new version of section 39&mdash;the relevant provision is subsection (1) (a) (ii)&mdash;where the charity dispose of the asset, the capital gains tax which would have been chargeable on the donor if the asset had been disposed of by him to the charity at full market value is to be assessed and charged on the charity even though their own gain on the later disposal would not be a chargeable gain under section 22 if the charity had retained charitable status.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment prevents an unintended charge in relation to the earlier disposal to the charity by providing that a charge on such disposal would arise only where, if a gain arose on the later disposal by the charity, that would be a chargeable gain because the charity had ceased to enjoy charitable status.  Accordingly, if the charity continued to enjoy charitable status at the time of the later disposal by them, no charge can be imposed on them in relation to the earlier disposal by the donor to the charity.  Therefore, it is to relieve charities, in effect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is analogous to that contained in amendment No. 3 in relation to section 8.  The purpose of this <Col N="1507" /> amendment is to ensure, where relief was given under the provisions of the existing version of section 39 of the 1975 Act on a disposal made to a charity prior to 6 April 1978, the proposed date of commencement of this Bill, and there is a disposal on or after that date by the recipient, that the changing provisions in subsection (1) (a) (ii) of the new version of section 39 will apply to withdraw the relief given on the first disposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 11, line 55, paragraph 2 (4) to delete &ldquo;subsections (1) and (2) of <Col N="1508" /> section 3 apply&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;subsection (1) of section 3 applies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 contains provisions relating to the ascertainment of the rate or rates of tax which will apply to a chargeable gain made by a person to whom section 4 of the Bill regarding tapering rates applies.  It provides for the apportionment of the chargeable gain computed in the normal way under section 3 where any enhancement expenditure was deducted in computing that chargeable gain.  The apportionments so provided for are made for the purpose of assigning separate periods of ownership to separate parts represented by the apportioned parts of the chargeable gain of the assets disposed of so that the appropriate rate or rates of tax may be determined.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (4) to which this amendment relates provides that the required apportionments are to be made on the basis of relevant items of deductible expenditure as adjusted for inflation by the application of the provisions of section 3 (1) and (2) of the Bill&mdash;that is indexation and for assets owned on 6 April 1974 mandatory base evaluation at that date.  As cases will increasingly arise where the assets were not owned on 6 April 1974 so that section 3 (2) will not be relevant it could be argued that subparagraph (4) would not apply to such cases because both subsections (1) and (2) of section 3 do not apply.  To remove doubt the amendment substitutes a reference to subsection (1) alone.  In a case to which subsection (2) does apply&mdash;that is, assets held on 6 April 1974&mdash;the reference to subsection (1) is sufficient because if subsection (1) applies then subsection (2) must also apply in such a case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 15, paragraph 6, lines 46 to <Col N="1510" /> 56, to delete subparagraph (5) and to substitute the following subparagraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  This paragraph shall not have effect in relation to a disposal of shares or securities in a close company by a person who was not, at the date of the disposal or at any time within three years prior to that date, entitled to more than 50 per cent of the voting power in the company or would not, on a winding up of the company on that date or at any such time, have been entitled to more than 50 per cent of the assets of the company, unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the disposal by that person (or, if there is a series of such disposals made by him to the same person, any such disposal) is to another person who, in consequence of that disposal (or of all or any of those disposals) would become entitled to more than 50 per cent of the voting power in the company or, on a winding up of the company, to more than 50 per cent of the assets of the company, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the disposal by that person is part of a series of disposals of shares or securities in the company, made by him and by persons who, in the terms of section 33 of the Principal Act, are connected with him, to another person who, in consequence of all or any of those disposals would become entitled to more than 50 per cent of the voting power in the company or, on a winding up of the company, to more than 50 per cent of the assets of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to take out of the ambit of paragraph 6 certain cases where tax avoidance by means of the device dealt with in paragraph 6 is unlikely to arise.  The amendment substitutes a new subparagraph for subparagraph (5) of paragraph 6 and is in relief of taxpayers. It has the incidental advantage of reducing administrative costs.  Subparagraph (5) of paragraph 6 provides that the paragraph as a whole is not to have effect where broadly the shareholder has <Col N="1511" /> no more than 10 per cent interest in the company unless he and the connected persons dispose of sufficient shares to another person to enable that other person to obtain control of the company.</P>
    <P>The amendment raises the threshold where exclusion from paragraph 6 from 10 per cent to 50 per cent arises because it is considered that, in the absence of collusive arrangements which are negatived by clauses (a) and (b) of the proposed new subparagraph, it would be unlikely that a tax advantage would be obtained by manipulating the provisions of the Bill in relation to tapering rates on gains derived from the disposal of shares in close companies unless at least a 50 per cent interest in the close company were involved.  It is considered the amendment will substantially reduce the number of cases in which it will be necessary to operate the procedures provided for in paragraph 6.</P>

      <P>In page 15, after line 62, to insert the following subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) (a)  The reference in subparagraph (1) (a) (ii) and in subparagraph (3) (a) (i) to a company shall include a reference to a subsidiary of that company.</P>
      <P>(b)  The provisions of subparagraph (3) (a) shall apply for the purpose of determining the period of ownership of shares or securities in a subsidiary as they apply for the purpose of determining the period of ownership of assets owned by the person referred to in subparagraph (1) (b), and so much (if any) of those shares or securities as are shares or securities in relation to which those provisions determine the period of ownership shall be relevant assets; and the provisions of this clause shall apply where the shares or securities in the subsidiary are owned by another subsidiary of the company and so on through any number of subsidiaries of that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> (c)  In this subparagraph &lsquo;subsidiary&rsquo;, in relation to a company, means a 75 per cent subsidiary of that company within the meaning of section 156 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The anti-avoidance provisions of paragraph 6 as it now stands could be circumvented if assets, broadly relevant assets which are expected to appreciate in value, were acquired not by a close company owned by a shareholder eligible for tapering rates but by a subsidiary owned by the close company.  In these circumstances the assets held by the close company would not be the relevant assets but rather shares in the subsidiary and paragraph 6 would be negatived.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment ensures that on the disposal by the shareholder of the shares in the close company the assets, including the relevant assets, held by the subsidiary will be deemed to have been sold.  A period of ownership by reference to the period of ownership of the relevant assets can then be attributed to all or part of the shares in the subsidiary held by the close company. These shares will be deemed to be relevant assets of the close company.  This, in turn, will enable a period of ownership for tapering rate purposes to be assigned to the whole or part of the shares of the close company which are disposed of by the controlling shareholder.  The amendment is so worded as to achieve the effect I have outlined even if a chain of subsidiaries is interposed between the close company whose shares are being disposed of and the subsidiary which owns the relevant assets.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 16, after line 36, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Rate of capital gains tax applicable to chargeable gains accruing on the disposal of qualifying units</P>
      <P>9.  Section 32 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1977) of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, is hereby amended, for the year 1978-79 and each subsequent year of assessment, by the substitution for subsection (3) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3)  Chargeable gains which derive from the disposal of qualifying units and which accrue to a person who is chargeable to capital gains tax shall be chargeable to tax at one-half of the rate at which they would be chargeable under the Capital Gains Tax Acts apart from this subsection.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment which is a relieving amendment is to enable certain holders of units in registered unit trusts to obtain the full benefit of the provisions in the present Bill under which losses and the £500 exemption may be set off first against chargeable gains which attract the highest rate of tax, then against chargeable gains which attract the next highest rate of tax and so on.  Under subsection (3) of section 32, inserted by section 35 of the Finance Act, 1977, of the Capital Gains Act, 1975, the chargeable gains of unit holders on disposals of their units in registered unit trusts are charged at one-half the normal rate.  For technical reasons, namely, because losses in the £500 exemption had to be set off against the total amount of chargeable gains, the relief was given in terms of tax.  The relief was given by computing the amount of tax at the normal rate and then reducing that amount by 50 per cent, in case the chargeable gains were solely unit gains, or by 50 per cent of the tax attributable to unit gains in case there were other chargeable gains.  The formula adopted in the latter case to arrive at the tax attributable to unit gains is no longer appropriate because the existence <Col N="1514" /> of the half rate for unit gains is not recognised in the formula.  Accordingly, losses and the £500 exemption fall to be deducted from unit gains chargeable under the formula at, say, 30 per cent before any balance is deducted from other gains chargeable at, say, 21 per cent.  The reverse order should be adopted to give the unit holder maximum relief since the effective rate for unit gains is half the rate otherwise applicable, that is, 15 per cent and not 30 per cent.  The proposed amendment terminates the formula and secures instead that all unit gains are to be charged to tax at one half of the rate whether it is the basic rate of 30 per cent or any of the tapering rates which would otherwise apply.  As a consequence, losses and the £500 exemption can be set off in the correct order of priority by reference to the rates effectively chargeable on unit gains and other gains.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 16, after line, 36, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Part disposal before the 6th day of April, 1978.</P>
      <P>10. (1)  Where, on or after the 6th day of April, 1974, but before the 6th day of April, 1978, a person made a disposal, to which the provisions of paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the Principal Act applied, of an asset which was held by him on the 6th day of April, 1974, and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the amount of the chargeable gain which accrued on that disposal was determined under the provisions of paragraph 18 of that Schedule, and</P>
      <P>(b)  any property derived from that asset remained undisposed of on the 6th day of April, 1978,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>then, for the purpose of determining the balance of the expenditure which, under the said paragraph 6, is to be attributed to the property which remains undisposed of, it shall be assumed that, on the disposal, the amount of the chargeable gain referred to in clause (a) had been determined, <Col N="1515" /> not under the provisions of the said paragraph 18, but on the assumption that the asset was disposed of and immediately reacquired by the person on the 6th day of April, 1974.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, on or after the 6th day of April, 1974, but before the 6th day of April, 1978, a person made a disposal, to which the provisions of paragraph 6 of the Schedule 1 to the Principal Act applied, of an asset which was acquired by him on a death which occurred on or after the 6th day of April, 1974, and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the amount of the chargeable gain which accrued on that disposal was determined on the basis that the asset had been acquired by him on a date earlier than the date of that death, and</P>
    <P>(b)  any property derived from that asset remained undisposed of on the 6th day of April, 1978,</P>
    <P>then, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (1), for the purpose of determining the balance of the expenditure which, under the said paragraph 6, is to be attributed to the property which remains undisposed of, it shall be assumed that, on the disposal, the amount of the chargeable gain referred to in clause (a) had been determined as if section 14 (1) of the Principal Act, as amended by section 6, or, as the case may be, section 15 (4) (b) of that Act, as amended by section 7, had applied at the date of that disposal.</P>
    <P>(3)  Nothing in this paragraph shall affect any liability to capital gains tax or to corporation tax in respect of a disposal made prior to the 6th day of April, 1978.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a technical amendment concerned with providing amended computational rules for the purpose of determining the base cost of the remainder of the assets, where there was a part disposal of the assets in the period from 6 April 1974 to 5 April 1978 and the remainder of the assets is disposed of on or after 6 April 1978.  The present Bill <Col N="1516" /> does not disturb the general position established by the 1975 Act, that the base cost of assets disposed of on or after 6 April 1978 is to be the cost of acquisition, including enhancement costs, incurred by the disponer.  However, the Bill introduces two exceptions to this rule.  Any assets held on 6 April 1974 including assets acquired in consequence of a death before 6 April 1974, and therefore held by the successor on that date, are to have as their base cost market value on that date.  Secondly, if the assets were acquired on a death on or after 6 April 1974 the base cost is to be the market value at date of death.  The proposed amendment applies one or other of these two bases of valuation, whichever is appropriate, in relation to part disposals of assets in the period from 6 April 1974 to 5 April 1978 where the base cost of these disposals was determined by reference to cost of acquisition or, in the case of a death after 6 April 1974, by reference to market value on 6 April 1974.  This will avoid the distortion which would arise if cost of acquisition, including the deceased's cost of acquisition, were used in relation to part disposals of assets prior to 6 April 1978 while, in relation to the disposal of the remainder of those assets on or after that date a different basis for determining the base costs, namely market value of 6 April 1974 or at date of death, is required to be used.  This amendment does not contain an element of retrospection since it is expressly provided that it is not to affect liability to tax on part disposals effected before 6 April 1978.  The notional recomputation of the base cost in relation to the part disposal is made solely for the purpose of determining the appropriate balance of the base cost which will be used in the computation of the gain on a disposal of the balance of the assets.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> In page 17, in the reference to the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, column 3, to delete &ldquo;Section 6&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Second Reading I said that the Bill has been largely made ineffective as regards tax on capital gains and that the amount collected under it would be negligible.  There was one exception to this that I could not understand.  This amendment seeks to repeal something that was of use to the very small investor who made a small capital gain.  My amendment seeks to ensure that this is not repealed, so that the half income relief will be available to the man who makes a small capital gain.  A small investor who finds that within a relatively short period it is necessary to realise his asset so as to spend his capital will be brought under the normal terms of the Bill.  He would be liable to 30 per cent if he disposes of the asset.  I gave an example of a married man with an income of £1,800 per year who makes a capital gain of £5,100 in less than a year.  On his income of £1,800 his income tax liability&mdash;he would have a married person's allowance of £1,730&mdash;would be £70 at 20 per cent which would be £14. His capital gains tax liability under the present Bill on the £5,100&mdash;he would have an exemption of £500&mdash;would be 30 per cent on £4,600 which is £1,380, giving him a total tax liability of £1,394. Under existing law his capital gains tax would be on half of the £5,000 which would be £2,500 with an excess of £100, plus his income of £1,800 which would give him a taxable income of £4,400. From that is deducted the married person's allowance of £1,730 leaving him with £2,670 taxable income.  The first £500 would be at 20 per cent, the next £1,000 at 25 per cent and the balance at 35 per cent which would mean that under existing law his liability with an income of £1,800 and a capital gain in one year of £5,100 would be £760 as opposed to £1,394 when this Act becomes law, which would mean that this man would be £634 worse off. By definition he is a small investor. When replying to the Second Stage debate the Minister said at column 231 of the Official Report dated 12 October 1978:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> Deputy Barry queried the abolition of the alternative charge provided for, I think, in section 6 of the 1975 Act. That section provided for an alternative basis of charge to income tax. With the introduction of indexation and tapering rates we consider that section 6 would produce an unnecessary additional complication necessitating additional complex calculations. That is the only reason for the change.  I understand, for what it is worth, that in Britain they have also done away with this provision.</P>
    <P>I am not closing my mind to it. Perhaps we could pursue it a little further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have a change of heart about this and when I did not see an amendment down in his name I tabled my own.  The point has been made that this has hardly been availed of but one of the reasons may be that it had to be claimed.  The Revenue Commissioners did not automatically grant it and that could have been one of the reasons why it was not availed of. The Minister should reconsider his decision to repeal this section and allow the half-income relief to stand in the current Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxpayer in the kind of case visualised by Deputy Barry does not have to claim this relief.  The Revenue Commissioners have to determine whether he is entitled to it or not. That is one of the reasons but not by any means the main one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that under the 1975 Act it had to be claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Revenue Commissioners have the obligation to apply it if it is applicable to the case.  That means that there is very considerable administrative cost and difficulty involved when, as I believe to be the case, under the present Bill it is largely irrelevant. The Deputy will appreciate the relevance of what I am saying about the Revenue Commissioners being obliged to examine each case for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from this administrative difficulty <Col N="1519" /> adding considerably to cost because of the time spent in preparing computations very often without any ultimate advantage to the taxpayers concerned, and having regard to the introduction of indexation and tapering rates, the computation involved would be substantially increased for the Revenue Commissioners if we were to allow section 6 to stand.  The computations would be more complicated if we allowed that section stand.  In addition, the retention of this relief under section 6&mdash;I am referring to the old section 6&mdash;would be inconsistent with the principle underlying the tapering relief.  For example, if an individual makes a chargeable gain of £5,000 which attracts the 30 per cent rate of tax the tax payable, taking into account the £500 exemption, will be £1,350.  If section 6 were to apply and he had no income for tax purposes in the year of assessment in which the gain accrued he could set his income tax allowances against half the chargeable gains, that is £2,500, and reduce his tax liability to nil or to a negligible amount.  An example of such a case would be a sole trader whose actual income is quite high but who in that year had no income for tax purposes due to accelerated capital allowances and stock relief.</P>
    <P>A taxpayer, that is a married man with no allowances or reliefs other than the married allowance, will also benefit to some extent under section 6 with an income of up to about £7,000 or considerably higher if he is entitled to child allowances and relief for mortgage interest or bank interest.  The retention of section 6 could lead to the wiping out or the reduction of the tax, the £1,350, payable on an individual gain of £5,000 which attracts a capital gains tax of 30 per cent.  Such a gain would be either a gain on the disposal of land with development value or mineral assets or, in the case of other assets, a short-term gain, that is on a disposal within three years of acquisition.</P>
    <P>Where the gain is considerably less than £5,000 or is liable to capital gains tax at one of the lower tabling rates section 6 would afford relief only where the <Col N="1520" /> taxpayer's income was comparatively small.  For example, where there is a chargeable gain of £5,000 liable at 16.5 per cent so that capital gains tax after allowing the £500 exemption would amount to £742.50, a married man with no other relief than the married allowance would get no benefit from section 6 unless his income was less than £2,000 approximately.  Accordingly, the principal beneficiary if section 6 was retained would be the individual in the middle-income bracket who realises a chargeable gain of about £5,000 which is liable to tax at 30 per cent or near it. This would mean that such short-term or speculative gains would fall to be relieved to a greater extent than some long-term gains and that would be at variance with the principle which we introduce here where by and large the shorter the period of ownership the greater is the charge to tax.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage Deputy Barry quoted an example in support of his point.  He was referring to a married man with an income of £1,800 making a gain of £5,100 having held the asset for less than one year.  That person does not qualify for indexation or tapering rates because his period of ownership is too short.  He would be charged £1,380 capital gains tax if section 6 was repealed as against only £746 if section 6 was retained.  The example chosen by Deputy Barry is an extreme case and the retention of section 6 could not be justified on the basis of that kind of an example.  If such an asset was acquired by way of a purchase the transaction might have been for speculative reasons and if obtained by way of gift or inheritance I do not think the owner can be considered to have been hard done by since he would have a net gain on the disposal of a windfall.  While I kept an open mind on this matter and examined it, for the reasons I have outlined I cannot agree with the basic proposal contained in Deputy Barry's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the inclusion of the section in the original Act was in recognition of the fact that there are people&mdash;Deputy Connolly referred to <Col N="1521" /> such people earlier&mdash;who have small incomes and must sell assets occasionally to pay ordinary bills or because of sickness.  The Minister said the example I gave was an extreme one but I am not so sure if that is true.  If a husband has something which he purchased one year before he died and if his widow's income drops to something like £1,800 she will obviously have to dispose of assets, until the Minister brings in the amendment on Report Stage which will allow the property to be treated as one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct because he would not have owned it for the 21 years.  This happens more frequently than we imagine.  The Minister, as a solicitor, must understand that there are many such people, particularly around Dublin.  One of the justifications the Minister gave for abolishing it was that it had been abolished in the United Kingdom but at the time it was abolished there the exemptions were raised from £500 to £1,000 and the half-rate applied then from £1,000 to £5,000. Considerable exemptions were given at that time in the United Kingdom and the same excuse, that it was administratively very difficult, was quoted there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill may have gone too far in one direction.  I am thinking particularly of old people, retired people and widows who may have to sell an asset and make a capital gain because they have to live.  The State should not within three years take back 30 per cent of that gain which was necessary for them.  There is not an enormous number of people in this category but section 6 certainly was of some help to quite a sizeable number of people according to some solicitors I have spoken to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way to get over that is to limit the value of the asset. I would suggest a figure of less than £20,000.  If it was a small amount and the person had to dispose of it owing to financial circumstances then it might be possible to limit the amount that would be free of capital gains tax.  That suggestion might be open to consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In a way Deputy Connolly may be getting close to what I was about to say.  First of all, there is an exemption on the first £500 gain so that small cases of the kind visualised by Deputy Barry would be exempt anyway and that £500 is after indexation.  It surely must be unusual to have a case to take the kind of thing Deputy Barry visualised, where a man dies and his widow has to dispose of the asset to live; the case where she is confined to disposing of assets which have been acquired by her husband less than 12 months before his death must be fairly unusual for a start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute that.  It applies all the way up to the 21 years. Because it was an extremely easy example and easy to calculate I gave the first one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important, if one is talking outside the range of acquisition within one year, to remember that the alterations being made in this Bill would have the effect of substantially increasing the value of the £500 exemption in most cases.  Certainly, it would do so in cases where we are not talking about development land or mineral rights or if we exclude short-term gains.  In such cases the effect of the Bill is to increase, fairly substantially in many cases, the value of the £500 exemption because it is the gain calculated by way of indexation and reduced to take account of the indexation that is the relevant figure in relation to the £500 exemption.  There cannot be any substantial number of cases which would be as extreme as the example given by Deputy Barry.  If one goes back to what I was saying about the kind of case that would be involved, takes account of the relief that is being given by way of indexation and tapering <Col N="1523" /> rates and considers the additional cost of administration that would be involved if section 6 were to be retained, it is difficult to sustain a case for the retention of section 6.  I am not saying that there is no case to be made for it.  I can see there is some case to be made for it but I am saying that on balance, when one takes account of the various factors involved, I must come down in favour of not retaining section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that one of the reasons for doing away with section 6 is because indexation has been introduced here but we all agreed on Second Stage that indexation was necessary because only real gains should be taxed and not illusory gains which were there because of inflation so that argument cancels itself out.  Of course if the asset is disposed of within the three-year period the person, on a comparable basis between the existing position and after this Act is passed, will be 4 per cent worse off.  I still think that there are a number of small people&mdash;I do not by any means pretend that they are a significant body&mdash;who would find a relief such as this an advantage if it were retained.</P>

By indexing it it is possible, depending on the period concerned, that it is brought down to less than £500.  So effectively, that figure of £500 is being increased where there is a long period of ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If one accepts the principle of indexation for the value of goods on 1 April 1974 and on 5 April 1978, if on 5 April 1978 one accounts backwards the value of £500 there is obviously less than there was in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy would not contend that I should index both the exemption limit and the gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be giving relief on the double.  The mere fact that one indexes the gain is taking account of inflation and restoring the position to what it was in 1974 or whenever this was introduced.  If one also indexes the £500 one is actually improving the position of the taxpayer.  One would be doubling the benefit to the taxpayer as against what it was when the Bill was originally introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>But if there was a case for exemptions set at £500 in 1974, outside any other changes made in the Bill, the £500 should be indexed as well and it should be now about £900 or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that if there were not indexation of the gains but I certainly could not accept the proposition that one should index both the gain and the exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that the fact that the Minister indexes one is an argument in favour of indexing both because the Minister accepts the principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair with regard to amendment No. 23 but I think it is based on a false premise. I should like to discuss the general principle of it with the Chair again because I should not like it to be established as a precedent.  I do not think it constitutes a potential charge on the revenue.  I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where it is proposed to make regulations to prohibit sponsorship of an event or activity, where such event or activity is considered to be of a sporting or cultural nature and where such sponsorship was in operation prior to the coming into force of this Act, the Minister shall endeavour to arrange such alternative financial or other assistance as is considered necessary for the event or activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Nothing contained in subsection (1) of this section shall be operated in such a manner as to have <Col N="1528" /> the effect of imposing or increasing a charge upon the people.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind this amendment is that, where sponsorships are in existence before this legislation is passed, whether in the sporting, cultural or any other sphere, and where the Minister subsequently decides he would like to see that sponsorship by a tobacco firm removed, before a regulation is made prohibiting the continuation of that sponsorship he should try to arrange for alternative financial assistance.  The amendment has been phrased deliberately to ensure that it could not be suggested it constituted a potential charge on the revenue by the addition of subsection (2).  The idea was that the Minister would use his good offices to approach other commercial and presumably non-health damaging operations or other groups that want to give sponsorship to participate in order to replace the tobacco firms.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is putting forward a good idea.  I cannot accept the amendment and write it into the Bill but I give the Deputy the assurance that I have asked the Health Education Bureau to try to make this a matter of policy, that in a general way in especially desirable cases they would take up sponsorship themselves.  Where they have no funds to take up sponsorships I have asked that they consider acting as an honest broker and try to promote commercial firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): There are a number of points which I should like to raise on section 1, which is the definition section. Before coming to these points, I should like to say that it is practically impossible to put down an amendment which would be meaningful or which would seek to improve the Bill because it would be ruled out of order as imposing a charge on the Exchequer.  The Chair has already ruled out of order a number of amendments in the name of Deputy Quinn for the reason that they seek to impose a charge on the Exchequer.  For that reason we have to go through the Bill section by section and make our case without putting down amendments.</P>
      <P>The first matter I want to raise is on the definition of &ldquo;community hall&rdquo;.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;community hall&rdquo;, subject to subsection (4) of this section, means any hereditament, other than a hereditament exempted from rating under either section 63 of the Act of 1838 or section 2 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1854, or the premises of a club for the time being registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904, which consists wholly or partly of a hall or similar building, is not mainly used for profit or gain and is occupied by a person who ordinarily uses it, or ordinarily permits it to be used, for purposes which both involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are recreational or otherwise of a social nature;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position of a property which is used by a voluntary community <Col N="1532" /> credit union for a few hours a week and as a community information centre for a few hours a week?  What is the position of a building that is used for non-profit-making social purposes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Community hall&rdquo; means a premises consisting wholly or partly of a hall or a similar building which is not mainly used for profit or gain but for purposes which both involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are recreational or otherwise of a social nature.  This definition is qualified in two ways by subsection (4) of section 1: (a) a rating authority or a District Court, on appeal, are not permitted to grant a premises community hall status solely on the grounds that it is used for sporting purposes; (b) the fact that a premises is normally used by persons of a particular age group&mdash;for example, a youth club or an old folks social centre or a particular religious denomination&mdash;will not count against its being a community hall.  It must be open to the public.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked about a credit union held in a community hall.  It would be up to the local authority to decide if that comes within the definition of &ldquo;community hall&rdquo;.  When I said they were to determine the use being made of it, that it is not used for profit and is open to all denominations of the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not think it has to be used by all denominations of the public. Subsection (4) reads:</P>
      <P>(a)  The fact that a hall is used or is designed for use for one or more particular sports or games shall not be a ground on which a rating authority or a Justice of the District Court may determine a hereditament to be a community hall.</P>
      <P>The fact that it is designed for the use of games or sport alone will not qualify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  a premises shall not be regarded for the purposes of this Act as not being a community hall by reason only of the fact that it is only or is ordinarily used by persons of <Col N="1533" /> either a particular age group or a particular religious denomination.</P>
    <P>Under the definition on page 3, I am asking about a hall in Bantry.  I got a letter from Bantry Credit Union which read:</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Local Government Financial Provisions Bill a small point has arisen on which I would like your advice.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, community halls will be exempt from rates.</P>
    <P>What is the position of a property which is used for a voluntary community Credit Union?  The specific case I have in mind relates to Bantry Credit Union.  They own a premises at Main St., Bantry.  In 1977 they qualified for a 25 per cent remission. In the 1978 year they were again assessed for the full rates.</P>
    <P>In 1977 every hereditament qualified for a 25 per cent remission.  It was not confined to private houses or domestic premises alone.</P>
    <P>The offices are open to the public for two hours on Friday nights for Credit Union business.  The other use of the building relates to the Bantry Community Information Centre which has the use of the building for a number of days in the week.</P>
    <P>There is a specific case.  While I would not expect the Minister to give a definite decision in relation to it, I would like to have his views on whether he thinks that building would meet the criteria laid down for a community hall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that the 25 per cent applied to more than the domestic side.  It did not.  If, for instance, part of the premises is used for credit union purposes and the remainder is used for the general activities of the local community, it could be defined as a mixed hereditament and the qualifying area would be derated.  If the main use of the hall is for community activities and it is utilised rarely for the credit union, as its main use is for community purposes, it would qualify as a community hall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Credit union purposes would appear to be community purposes because I understand that credit unions are not profit making organisations and serve the community at large.  The fact that the hall is used as a credit union premises should not disqualify it. Whatever the position was in 1977, this building appears to have qualified for the 25 per cent remission but in the following year was again assessed for the full rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is worth considering. The effect of this enactment and the granting of rates relief to unregistered guest houses while it is not granted to registered guest houses will mean that more and more guest houses will become unregistered or will not register under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1975. That is a move in the wrong direction. Guest houses registered under the Tourist Traffic Acts, subject to a certain limit in size, should be entitled to rate exemption in the same way as unregistered guest houses.  If we allow this section to stand we will discourage people from registering because in so doing they will lose rates relief.  That is not in the interests of the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism is one of our major industries. It reached an all-time high in 1969 and an all-time low in 1972, but it <Col N="1537" /> has developed very much since.  It is desirable that people who provide tourist accommodation should be encouraged to register and enjoy the benefits entailed. In this way they will be subject to inspection and this will lead to better standards in guest houses.  I feel very strongly about this and the Fine Gael spokesman on Tourism and Transport also has some thoughts on this matter. The effect of what we are doing here is to discourage the registration of tourist accommodation and encourage non-registration.</P>

      <P>The Government have no function in relation to the selection or rejection of prospective jurors.  As far as inquiries by the Garda are concerned, the law provides that, in criminal cases, both prosecution and defence are entitled to challenge a specified number of jurors without cause shown and an unspecified number where cause can be shown.  It is clear, therefore, that to enable it to exercise its statutory right of challenge, including challenge with showing cause, the prosecution may take steps to inform itself of any matters which it considers relevant to prospective jurors.  In practice this means that the prosecution can look to the Garda Síochána for assistance in making inquiries. The precise nature of the inquiries <Col N="1539" /> which the Garda may make in particular cases on behalf of the prosecution is a confidential matter and one on which I am not prepared to comment.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that, apart from the aspects raised by Deputy Horgan, from his own reply to the question it would appear that the law is heavily weighted in favour of the prosecution?  They can avail of the services of the Garda to get background information about jurors who may be challenged by the prosecution.  Apparently the same facility is not available to the defendant.

      <P>I am anxious that education should be available throughout the summer holiday period and every effort is being made to make this possible.  However, I am sure that the Deputy appreciates that working through the summer months would involve a significant change in the conditions of teachers and that any development in this regard in the prisons and places of detention could have wide-ranging repercussions in other areas. Protracted negotiations have taken place with all the parties concerned&mdash;the teachers themselves, their union, the vocational education committee and the Departments of Education and Finance. I am hopeful that the problem will be resolved.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that my concern is as deep and as sincere as his about providing educational facilities for the inmates of these institutions.  We have had a number of discussions with the people involved.  We thought we were on the verge of a breakthrough and that we would be able to provide this teaching service, but unfortunately that has come unstuck, not because of any fault of mine.  As recently as last May we approached the Dublin Vocational Education Committee with a view to making some agreement with the teachers, who number about 62 and the majority of whom are part-time, to work for us during the months of July and August but unfortunately that was impossible because many of them had made other arrangements.  Long term, the best hope seems to be that part-time teachers would give of their services for which we would gladly pay the cost.</P>

      <P>For fear that the wrong impression might be created I would like to emphasise that, as was the position when my immediate predecessor was in office, every effort is being made to improve considerably the educational facilities being provided in prisons.  The emphasis is on remedial education but some offenders are prepared for group certificate, intermediate certificate and leaving certificate examinations.  The range of subjects taught includes English, history, geography, mathematics, arts and crafts, woodwork and building construction, civics and home economics.  It is no secret that there are a number of students who are not capable of taking these higher courses.  I have found on visiting prisons that some of the prisoners are not able to read or write. Therefore, it is not fair to those involved in prison education work to accuse them of having low standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the steps taken since he took office to review the Intoxicating Liquor Acts; the bodies, if any, he has consulted; and the form of any review body he proposes to set up to examine the Acts and recommend changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Various proposals for the amendment of the licensing laws, many of them conflicting, have been received by me and my predecessors over the years.  Since I took office the following are among the bodies that have made written or oral submissions: Vintners' Federation of Ireland; Irish <Col N="1544" /> Restaurant Owners' Association; Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland; Pioneer Total Abstinence Association; Irish Ballrooms Bands Association; Dublin Education Council for Secondary Schools and Knights of St. Columbanus.</P>
      <P>I have also agreed to meet a deputation from the Irish National Union of Vintners, Grocers and Allied Trades Assistants and am at present endeavouring to arrange a suitable date.</P>
      <P>I am examining all the proposals that have been made but, because of other more pressing matters, I am not yet in a position to say whether a review body will be set up, or what recommendations, if any, I will make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the recommendations made to the Minister will he accept that the licensing laws are in a mess and that there is a morass of legislation dating back for more than a century in some respects in relation to this matter?  In these circumstances would the Minister not accept now the proposal I put forward about a year ago regarding the setting up of a commission to examine the difficulties in that area and also the problems in our society relative to such matters as under-age drinking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right regarding there being many Acts in this area.  There are more than 40 Acts dealing either directly or indirectly with the sale of intoxicating liquor.  Obviously, therefore, any review would be a major and long-term undertaking.  Regarding the Deputy's suggestion that a commission be established, I am not convinced that this will resolve the differences between the interested bodies regarding possible amendments of the law.  If a commission were representative of those bodies as was the commission set up in 1956, they would report undoubtedly in much the same fashion, that is, with contradictory recommendations being made by way of minority reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publicans, the restaurateurs and the hoteliers hold opposing views as to how the law should be amended while the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association <Col N="1545" /> and those who advocate more severe curbs on teenage drinking have their views.  Also, the off-licence sale of drink in supermarkets will be both attacked and defended.  The holders of restricted licences will look for relief. Therefore, it would seem that the report of a commission comprised of all these elements would merely highlight the conflict that exists but if, on the other hand, a commission of disinterested parties were established they would be likely to be unanimous in their recommendations. Such a report, though, would be bound to be the subject of criticism and comment by the various interested bodies so that in the final analysis the decision would rest with me.  In view of all these factors I am not convinced that the setting up of a commission would be the answer to this complex problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty outlined by the Minister but would he not accept that there are some areas in which change could be effected by common consent?  Admittedly there are other areas in which there are conflicting views but should these conflicting views be the justification for not doing anything?  Obviously, it is a matter that needs to be tackled and if the Minister is not prepared to establish a commission, comprised either of vested interests or of independent members, is not some other form of action necessary?</P>

      <P>I have a few, actually. Would the Minister agree that while those headlines may be conducive to the sale of this paper they constitute a very grave injustice to the governor and the management of the prison and to the visiting committee of which I am a <Col N="1559" /> member?  I abhor such glaring headlines for the sake of publicity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that such a report could have been believed to have been a true and accurate account of how that prisoner was treated in Mountjoy Prison, and could incite people to take action of one sort or another that could cause a loss of innocent life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be correct for me to place on the record that the treatment accorded to all prisoners is in compliance with all reasonable requests and that due regard is always given to the observance of the law and that this prisoner in common with every other prisoner in Mountjoy had the right at all times to go before the visiting committee and air his grievances?  Will the Minister also agree that the committee have at all times forwarded any grievances and made suggestions as to the improvement of conditions where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what the Deputy says, that the prisoner together with any other prisoner who has grievances can voice their grievances through the recognised channels.  Our prison system now, in the past, and I suppose in the future will be constantly under attack from certain sections who wish to knock it for one reason or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the raising of this question and the provision of an opportunity to answer it has been a useful service.  There are two points in the Minister's reply on which I would like to press him further.  One point relates to the availability of newspapers and the right to purchase them in the <Col N="1560" /> prison shop.  Are Ulster papers available there?  Secondly, can the radio, as distinct from having certain wavelengths, receive from Northern Ireland?  I understand there could be a difficulty about that in view of the location of a prisoner in the prison.  These two things have been left outstanding by the Minister's otherwise very comprehensive reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to Deputy Belton for giving me an opportunity to put on the record the situation as it genuinely is because of the many allegations that have been made for perhaps political reasons in other parts. With regard to the type of reception the radio has, I am assured that it has long and medium wave and that it is receiving on the long and medium waves.  I am assured that it would receive BBC stations Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  With the change in frequencies that is going on at present I cannot say what the situation is there.  I can have it checked out but the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible from a security aspect to allow a short wave radio into any prison.  I know the Deputy did not suggest that.  With regard to the availability of newspapers from Northern Ireland I have no information as to whether or not newspapers from Northern Ireland are available.  I will inquire into that.  If they can be supplied and if the prisoners want local newspapers we will try our best to get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister very much for his reply.  It is worth inquiring into the latter point because in this House it has proved impossible to get Northern newspapers for periods as long as seven weeks.  If that is the case in Dáil Éireann, what the case is in Mountjoy Prison I would hate to think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

There is no doubt in any mind that in reply to the Deputy's letter to me, a copy of which was sent back to him, and others, because more than the Deputy were in touch with me in this matter, it was made quite clear to the prisoner that if he wanted any periodicals or educational books we would order them for him from the Dublin Vocational Educational Committee through their library system.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first two points raised by the Deputy is in the negative.</P>
      <P>However as regards tobacco advertising the Ministers for Health of the Nine discussed health education policies with particular reference to smoking, drug abuse in sports and nutrition when they met in Council for the first time last December.  The Ministers requested the Commission to compile basic documentation on the measures taken by the member states in the field of anti-smoking campaigns and to draw up suggestions with a view to further action, where appropriate, at Community level. The Commission drew up a report based on this documentation and this was discussed at the meeting of Ministers for Health which was held on 16 November 1978.  After the discussion at which the Minister for Health, Mr. Haughey, took part, the Ministers agreed to establish common methods by which to compare the results and to assess the effectiveness of health education campaigns on smoking, to carry out health education campaigns of an experimental nature in order to determine the main features of cigarette smoking and to seek a common attitude on advertising.  Progress in the field will be reviewed at the meeting of Health Ministers which is expected to take place in the New Year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the third point&mdash;the Council of Ministers adopted on 9 February 1976 a directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment and to vocational training and as regards working conditions.  The Employment Equality Act, 1977 which became law on 1 June 1977 and came into operation on 1 July 1977 brought the terms of the directive into effect here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the number of applicants <Col N="1564" /> for passports who have been refused passports in each of the past five years; the reasons for such refusals; if his Department maintains a list of persons who will not be given passports if they apply; and if he will make a statement about his policy in relation to the right of Irish nationals to travel abroad, other than those who have surrendered their passports as a result of a court order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the number of applicants refused passport facilities is quite insignificant the need to maintain a register of such refusals does not arise. Apart from the situation in relation to applications for passports from Irish residents in Rhodesia, which has been the subject of a separate question to which I replied on 11 October 1978, passports are refused on legal grounds, such as a court order or refusal of parents' consent in the case of minors.  A passport may also be refused to an applicant who, in the experience of the Passport Office arising out of passport facilities granted in the past, is an unfit person to hold another passport at the time of application.  A list of persons falling into these categories must necessarily be maintained in the Passport Office.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have regarded the right of Irish nationals to travel abroad as a personal right of each citizen subject however to the limitations I have just mentioned.</P>

      <P>The Passport Office only apply the law as well settled.  The Passport Office do not make the law; they apply it.  There are other cases which I should like to mention.  Applicants who are subjects of court orders one way or another are also included. People who are resident in Rhodesia and apply for Irish passports are also included. People who are recognised Departmental debtors, who have been advanced money on the basis of travel on previous occasions which was not refunded to the Department are also included but the Department can use their discretion in that case.  The list also includes people who have lost three or four passports and approach the Passport Office for a fifth.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that a question of discretion arises there also.  I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases the passport officer goes into great detail and, in the final analysis, if he thinks fit, he reports to me and I make the decision.</P>

      <P>The ones I mentioned under court order are clear in themselves.  For one reason or another a court may impound a passport and refuse it under an order.  The Deputy is aware that under the Guardianship of Infants Act parents have rights and to that extent that is statutory.  What is or is not a matter of common law is not of any particular significance but, generally, the question is based on the law as it stands.  I have mentioned the cases where the Department must use discretion. I am sure that the Deputy, from his own experience, will recognise this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is of such a nature as to require a lengthy reply and, therefore, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are of course aware the role of the conference is to review existing international law relating to the sea, to establish rules for those areas <Col N="1569" /> where none exist already and to incorporate these into a generally acceptable international convention.  This is a daunting task and in view of the number, variety and complexity of the issues it is not surprising that there already have been seven sessions of the conference and that the work has not yet been completed.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is possible to say that at each session progress has been made. After the second session the main trends of the proposals put forward at the conference were identified by the appropriate chairmen of the three main working committees.  After the third session each chairman produced a single negotiating text which provided the basis for the negotiations at the fourth session and these texts were revised after that session in the light of the negotiations thereat.  The fifth session concentrated in each committee on those issues on which agreement was proving most difficult and in particular those dealing with the international seabed regime with a view to resolving these and the chairmen reported on such progress as was made on these issues.  Although progress slowed somewhat as the more difficult issues came to the fore in the negotiations a degree of agreement on some of the more important issues was apparent. A number of topics were not even discussed and were assumed at that stage to virtually command a consensus.  An informal composite negotiating text&mdash; (i.c.n.t.)&mdash;was produced at the end of the sixth session and this document still forms the basis for the negotiations at the conference.  Copies of the i.c.n.t. are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The session which has just ended was the seventh session which in fact took place in two parts.  It convened for eight weeks in Geneva in the spring and resumed for four weeks in AugustSeptember in New York.  The length of this session was due primarily to problems concerning the Presidency of the conference which was in dispute and which resulted in lengthy procedural debates before being resolved.  Commencement of negotiations on substantive issues was therefore delayed.  For this session open-ended informal <Col N="1570" /> negotiating groups were set up to deal with what are now accepted by the conference to be the hard-core issues.  These issues are: (1) the system of exploration and exploitation and resource policy for the international seabed area outside national jurisdiction; (2) the financial arrangements for the International Seabed Authority, for its operating arm the enterprise and for the contractors who will be operating in the international area; (3) the organs of the International Seabed Authority, their composition, powers and functions; (4) the right of access of landlocked states and certain developing coastal states in a sub-region or region to the living resources of the exclusive economic zone; (5) the question of the settlement of disputes relating to the exercise of the sovereign rights of the coastal states in the exclusive economic zone; (6) definition of the outer limits of the continental shelf and the question of revenue sharing; and (7) delimitation of maritime boundaries between adjacent and opposite states and settlement of disputes thereon. Other issues which the conference agreed required further consideration were (1) regime of islands, (2) enclosed and semi-enclosed seas and (3) preamble and final clauses.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory resolution of the problems relating to the international seabed area while not of immediate interest to this country, is essential if the conference is to succeed and produce a generally acceptable convention.  The hard-core issues which are of most importance for Ireland relate to the definition of the continental shelf, delimitation, the regime of islands and access to the living resources of the exclusive economic zone.  Since these issues are currently under consideration a full detailed statement on progress to date is not possible at this time.  However a general outline of the present situation follows.</P>
    <P>The present provision in the composite text relating to coastal state jurisdiction over the continental shelf gives jurisdiction to the outer edge of the continental margin or to a distance of 200 nm. but it does not define the continental margin.  It also provides that the <Col N="1571" /> continental shelf comprises the seabed and subsoil that extend throughout the natural prolongation of the land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin or to a distance of 220 nm. from baselines.  The problem with this provision is that it does not define what is meant by the continental margin and thus provides no clear indication as to how the outer edge of the continental shelf of a coastal state may be delineated.  Ireland has a wide expanse of continental shelf area and thus we have a direct interest in ensuring that a satisfactory and unequivocal provision regarding the location of the outer edge of the continental shelf is included in any future convention.  Landlocked states and others with differing interests at the conference seek to curb the extent of the shelf coming within coastal state sovereignty so that as much as possible of the seabed will fall within the international area.  Ireland has taken a leading role both in the wide-margin states group and in conference negotiations on the continental shelf with a view to rectifying the position regarding an acceptable definition.  The Irish amendment to the present article, which was put forward informally at the fourth session of the conference, provides an identifiable limit to the continental margin and seeks to allay the fears of those delegations who see the existing provision giving rise to exaggerated claims by coastal states.  The amendment contains a formula which proposes how the outer edge of the shelf of a coastal state may be identified by reference to sedimentary thickness and the Irish delegation at future sessions of the conference will be endeavouring to ensure that the amendment has sufficent support to permit of its acceptance by the conference as a whole.  This amendment is already supported by other wide-margin states at the conference.</P>
    <P>It appears that in return for agreement on definition of the continental margin coastal states must be prepared to share with the international community a certain proportion of the revenue earned from exploitation of the resources of the area of shelf beyond 200 miles.  No <Col N="1572" /> detailed discussions of revenue sharing took place during the seventh session and this will be one of the crucial issues to be negotiated during forthcoming sessions as we continue to seek support for the Irish amendment.  At present there are two other variably supported proposals concerning the definition of the continental margin.  Firstly the Arab group proposal which states that jurisdiction should not extend beyond 200 nm.  This is also the formal position of the landlocked and geographically disadvantaged states.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is a proposal by the Soviet Union tabled during the first part of the seventh session.  This would restrict coastal state jurisdiction to within 300 nm. from their baselines.  It is an arbitrary method of delimitation which takes no account of the natural prolongation concept of current international law.</P>
    <P>By including it among the hard-core issues it appears that the conference recognises that a definition of the outer limit of the continental shelf should be included in the convention and every effort will be made by the Irish delegation at the next session to ensure that the Irish amendment has sufficient support to permit its inclusion in any revised or formalised text that may be produced. This will involve renewed negotiations over revenue sharing.</P>
    <P>At the third session the Irish delegation joined with other delegations in making informal proposals to the effect that delimitation of maritime areas should be effected in accordance with equitable principles.  The opposing delegations proposed re-enactment of the provision in the 1958 Geneva Convention on the continental shelf that the median line, equidistant from the nearest points on the opposite baseline, should be the normal method of that division.  The i.c.n.t. reflects our proposal in that it provides for delimitation in accordance with equitable principles but it also mentions the median line as a method of division.  The two opposing sides still maintain their positions by proposing appropriate changes in the text.  The issue was hard fought at the seventh session at which there was more <Col N="1573" /> support for the Irish and like-minded position than for the opposition, but no single proposal for a change in the text had general support.</P>
    <P>A related topic to delimitation is the regime of islands.  The Irish delegation again joined with others in submitting informal proposals on this subject which are partly reflected in the i.c.n.t. provision. This provision is broadly to effect that islands shall have the same maritime zones as other land territories except rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own.  These would have no economic zone or continental shelf.  The delegation has opposed deletion of that exception.  It has also supported proposals which would expressly provide that the role of any island in a delimitation situation would be determined in accordance with equitable principles.</P>
    <P>There is already provision in the i.c.n.t. for a 200 nm. economic zone for the costal state but acceptance by the landlocked and geographically disadvantaged states is subject to satisfactory provision for rights for them in these zones.  They do not accept that the i.c.n.t. provisions as presently drafted are satisfactory.  Ireland adheres to the Community position that such states have a right to participate only in the exploitation of any surplus fish when the coastal state does not have the capacity to harvest the total allowable catch.  A compromise formula which offers improved prospects for eventual consensus has emerged and will be the subject of further negotiation at the next session. The question of dispute settlement procedures relating to the exercise of rights in the economic zone has been virtually resolved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the regime to be applied to exploitation of the international sea-bed area, that is outside national jurisdiction, discussions on the hard-core issues are proceeding within three negotiating groups.  The conflict on this issue is between the industrialised states with the technology to undertake exploitation and the developing countries <Col N="1574" /> which hope to be the main beneficiaries from the exploitation of the area which is accepted as the common heritage of mankind.  Considerable progress has been made in these negotiations and the hard-core issues identified by the President were the most recent topics for discussion in relation to the regime to be established for the international sea-bed area.</P>
    <P>The first of these groups has been considering the conditions to be attached to a contract for exploration and exploitation and it dealt with items such as title to minerals, the qualifications of applicants for contracts, the selection of applicants to get such contracts and the transfer of the relevant data.  Given the wide divergence of views between the industrialised countries and the developing countries the chairman of the group has not yet succeeded in bring the positions close together.</P>
    <P>The second group considered the financial terms of contracts for exploitation of minerals in the international area. Discussions in this field have reached the stage where concrete financial proposals have now been made by the chairman and these will be examined in detail at the next session of the conference.  The main difficulty arises from the fact that this type of mining has never before been undertaken with the result that it is very difficult to forecast accurately conditions which would be such as to encourage exploitation by giving an acceptable rate of return to the contractor and yet provide substantial funds for the International Seabed Authority which will distribute these among developing countries in the form of development aid.  The revenue the International Seabed Authority derives from its own mining operations will also contribute to this end.</P>
    <P>The third group considered the question of the powers, functions and composition of the organs of the International Seabed Authority.  It is agreed that there will be an assembly which will be representative of all the parties to the convention and an executive, called the council.  The composition of the latter which is likely to include representation of the main interest groups is proving extremely <Col N="1575" /> difficult to agree.  The conference has also considered the question of the subsidiary organs without coming to any conclusion.</P>
    <P>Other issues, not listed among the hard-core issues, still remain to be agreed but it is generally thought that once the more difficult issues are resolved agreement on other items and on a final text may be achieved more quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When we reported progress I was dealing with the definition of lodgings which is given in section 1 as affected by subsection (3).  I was pointing out that the net effect of the definition and of subsection (3) is to provide that registered guest houses will be subject to <Col N="1600" /> rates and people providing lodgings or keeping paying guests in houses or buildings which are not registered pursuant to the Tourist Traffic Acts of 1939 to 1975 will be liable for rates.  I said then, and I want to say now for greater clarity, that I entirely agree with the thinking behind the Bill and with the provision in the Bill that derates unregistered tourist accommodation known as town and country house and farm house accommodation.  I am in entire agreement with that: it is a good idea.  To do otherwise would be to put out of business a great number of these people, who are doing a very excellent job in providing farm house accommodation and town and country accommodation if they were to attract rates simply and solely because they engage in this business.  But I also believe that the small registered guest houses should also be exempt from rates.  A registered guest house may have as few as five bedrooms set apart exclusively for guests, but it would be subject to rates under the Bill. Those listed as town and country accommodation or farm house accommodation may have as few as three bedrooms set aside for guests.  Therefore, we are differentiating between establishments with three bedrooms set aside for guests and establishments with five bedrooms set aside for guests.  We are exempting the former from rates and imposing the rates on the latter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said this morning that I feared that the effect of this would be to discourage the registered guest house.  From some little research that I have made since I find that 25 guest house proprietors who were registered for 1977-78 are not registering for 1978-79.  Presumably this is because they were influenced to a considerable extent by the knowledge that by ceasing to be registered they would be free from rates.  There are not too many of these registered guest houses in this country.  There are only somewhat more than 300.  There are innumerable registered hotels but I am talking about registered guest houses and I am told there are only something like 300 of those in the country.  It would be a mistake to encourage these people to cease to be registered and to go one step further down the ladder.  I do not know <Col N="1601" /> whether the Minister has considered this definition of lodgings in subsection (3) and its effect.  I do not know whether he has discussed it with his colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, or Bord Fáilte but would certainly like to have his views on the remarks I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this matter, during the period following the Government's statement in regard to rates and following the abolition of rates on private dwellings after the change of Government, the position in regard to rates on tourist accommodation was a matter of concern to me.  As the Fine Gael spokesman for Tourism I would like to make clear our view on this matter as it arises in this Bill.  The position is that Bord Fáilte issue booklets each year.  I have them here with me.  One of the booklets is <i>1978 Hotels and Guest Houses</i> and the other is <i>1978 Irish Homes Accommodation</i> which deals with farm houses and town and country homes.  The position is that the houses registered in <i>Irish Homes Accommodation</i>, farm houses and town and country homes, are exempt from rates while the hotels listed in <i>Hotels and Guest Houses</i> are liable for rates.  It is important to see how Bord Fáilte describe their guest houses in this booklet.  Page 8 of the preface states:</P>
      <P>Guest houses which provide a very high standard of comfort and personal service.  A very good standard of cuisine including a full meal service for resident guests.  Hot and cold running water in all bedrooms and some premises have rooms with private bathrooms.</P>
      <P>It goes on then:</P>
      <P>Guest houses that are well furnished offering very comfortable accommodation with limited but good standard of food and service.  Hot and cold running water in all bedrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes on then to deal with the other types of accommodation in regard to hotels and so on.  It could be quite <Col N="1602" /> serious if we have a situation where hotels which are registered with Bord Fáilte&mdash;and the word &ldquo;registration&rdquo; is important&mdash;are deregistering their property.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; or &ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo; cannot be put up outside a premises unless it is registered and approved by Bord Fáilte.  This is laid down by law under the Tourist Traffic Act.  Once hotel or guesthouse owners comply with the most stringent regulations laid down by Bord Fáilte they are granted the right to use the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; or &ldquo;guesthouse&rdquo;. People registered with Bord Fáilte as guesthouse owners who are providing good services for tourists and who are registered with Bord Fáilte are now being penalised by being asked to pay rates.  I hope that after the Minister has given this matter some consideration and has listened to what we are saying about it he will reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this particular instance is going against the best interests of the tourist industry.  He is going against the strict regulations laid down by Bord Fáilte.  He is looking for people to provide something less than the best, which is a great mistake.  There are people who criticise and others who praise Bord Fáilte.  I believe they are contributing a lot to our tourist industry.  We should not bring in a regulation whereby the standards set by them are lowered.  If we bring in such a regulation we will encourage people to de-register.  The Minister should ensure that guesthouses are derated.  It is in the best interests of our tourist industry to encourage people to register.</P>
    <P>A vast number of guesthouses in every part of the country are set out in the booklet issued by Bord Fáilte.  A premises can become a guesthouse once it has five or more bedrooms.  If the Minister penalises somebody who is providing a full meal service, breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday, hot and cold running water and all the services required by Bord Fáilte, by compelling that person to pay rates it will be a poor day for our tourist industry.  Tourism, following the difficulties in Northern Ireland, took a serious knock for many years.  In the last two or three years it <Col N="1603" /> has got back on its feet.  Now increasing numbers are coming here and we should ensure that we give every possible encouragement to guesthouse owners.</P>
    <P>There are some people who will say that the small family hotels should also be granted rates relief.  There is a lot of merit in this suggestion.  Hotels in general are competing in a commercial enterprise and people will make the point that there are a lot of other enterprises where people are entitled to rates relief just as much as hotels are.  Consideration must be given to granting rates relief to the family hotels.  There is a lot to be said for the small family hotels which are open seven days a week and are providing a service for the community. The Minister must be aware that they have gone through a very lean period because of the troubles in the North.</P>
    <P>Some people because of spiralling overheads have not been reinvesting in their hotels.  They should be granted every relief possible.  Family hotels, in particular, should be granted rates relief as well as some of the hotels along the coast which close for six months in the year.  It is a great hardship on those people to have to meet rates which have been struck on their hotels for a full 12month period.  Hotels which depend completely on tourists and have no commercial trade such as weddings and functions during the winter to keep them open, should be given rates relief.  We must encourage the expansion of our tourist industry.</P>

      <P>You are right and I would not dream of going against you.  I will make sure that I comply with what you have stated.  Many of our hotels because of their size, the number of bedrooms, diningrooms, bars and so forth are already heavily rated.  If the owners of these premises improve them or build on to them their valuations will <Col N="1604" /> be increased.  The knowledge that valuations and rates can be increased prevents people from carrying out necessary extensions to their buildings.  The types of hotels that I have mentioned should be given rates relief.  The Minister is bound to agree that the encouragement of all types of hotel accommodation is necessary for the tourist industry.  I compliment the Minister on granting reliefs to the owners of farmhouse accommodation. These smaller holiday homes are listed by Bord Fáilte.  For the sake of the tourist industry I must ask the Minister to ensure that all registered guest houses are included in this Bill.  All family-owned hotels should also be exempted from rates.  Those who provide accommodation on a seasonal basis should also be exampted.  Anything that would seem to be against the strict requirements of Bord Fáilte must be changed immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I missed the beginning of this debate but there was no disrespect intended to the House or to the Minister.  Section 1 deals with the definition of properties exempted from rates.  It seems that there are a number of contradictions in the attitude of the Minister in giving exemptions to some categories of properties and not to others.  I understand that my amendments have been ruled out of order because they would have involved direct expenditure on the part of central government.  I am not quarrelling with that ruling but would like to point out that we attempted to redress the balance in our amendments.</P>
      <P>The first division that exists is the one between the emphasis on promoting private affluence at the expense of community wealth.  In other words, discrimination against certain types of community halls and guesthouses, as Deputy Enright instanced in some detail, puts the benefit of the abolition of rates into the pockets of the individual owners.  As amendments from this side of the House cannot be accepted at this stage, we can only ask the Minister to consider what I would regard as internal contradictions and to see if he could meet us on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> Let us consider the first point made by Deputy Enright in relation to guesthouses and small hotels which are owner-occupied.  The argument <i>vis-à-vis</i> their benefit to the tourist industry can be taken as read, as can the responsibilities of the Minister in relation to tourism.  Surely there is a contradiction in disallowing any benefit of rates exemption to persons who use a part of their premises as a business, that is, a family hotel or a guesthouse, and at the same time allow relief on rates on what is described as a mixed hereditament that is, for a business which combines a house and shop.  It seems a contradiction that somebody who combines a business activity of a specific kind with a domestic residence can be given the benefit of partial rates relief on the portion of the premises that is used as a residence.  Surely the same logic should apply to family-run hotels, guesthouses and small hotels.</P>
    <P>In all fairness the Minister should look at the implications in cost terms of such an extension and see if he can meet us on this point.  The Second Stage of this Bill has been passed in principle.  It is now the task of this House to try to make good and effective legislation.  The issue of principle can no longer be contested. Therefore, it is in the interests of good legislation that this inequity be removed and that the contradictions be amended by the Minister at the relevant stage.  I should like the Minister to give us an estimate of what the additional charge on the Exchequer might be of such an exemption because it must have some bearing on the matter.</P>

      <P>The reference to lodgings in subsection 3 does not include premises registered under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1975.  These premises are hotels, guesthouses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, holiday camps, motor hotels, caravan sites and approved holiday cottages.  They are registered under the different Acts, starting with the 1939 Act.  It is not lawful for the proprietor or occupier of a premises to use any of these descriptions unless the premises is registered with <Col N="1606" /> Bord Fáilte.  There are fines for those who are found to be in contravention of this rule.  Premises registered under the Tourist Traffic Acts are therefore excluded from full domestic status for the purpose of the new rates relief.</P>
      <P>I can justify this exclusion on the grounds that, first, premises become registered under the Tourist Traffic Acts because their proprietors seek this registration wishing as they do to benefit from the prestige of a preserved description, and, second, the regulations and other rules under which premises are registered make it clear that their primary use should be other than domestic.  For instance, the rules applying to registered guesthouses state that the premises shall be used for the lodging or sleeping of travellers.  Rules applying to approved holiday cottages provide that the cottages shall be used primarily for letting to and occupation by tourists with or without prior arrangements.</P>
      <P>There is a distinct difference between registered guesthouses, hotels and so on, which are not exempt, and what are known as farm guesthouses and B. &amp; B. places, which are exempt.  The emphasis seems to be on registered guesthouses. In all, there are 307 registered guesthouses here.  About 75 of those are licensed premises and others are associated with grocery shops and other types of businesses and 150 could be described as of modest size, 12 to 15 rooms, and they would not be associated with any other business.  Of course, the size of these premises varies upwards and they may have as many as 80 rooms in some instances.  Deputies said this could interfere with tourism.  If it does the Minister for Tourism and Transport and Bord Fáilte should and will review it.  Deputy Enright maintained that all hotels should be excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said &ldquo;hotels and particularly family-run hotels&rdquo;.  We are all interested in promoting tourism and trying to get more tourists to come here but there is no way anybody can <Col N="1607" /> say that a very big percentage of our hotels are solely dependent on tourism because that is not so.  If one has not booked in advance one would find great difficulty in getting a room in a hotel in this city.  There is no way that these hotels are filled by tourists because when I go into any of them I do not see very many tourists at this time of year. Therefore, I cannot see any justification for including hotels which are commercial enterprises.  Many of these hotels are licensed and if they are excluded we will have to exclude a great many business premises and industries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn was not correct in his assumption.  Any place which provides living accommodation as well as a business will be treated as a mixed hereditament and will be treated in the same way as a grocery shop with living accommodation.  I have had representations and deputations about this matter. Some people feel aggrieved if they are not excluded when a reasonably sized unregistered guesthouse down the road is excluded.  There is an element of competition there but the registered guesthouses enjoy a certain amount of prestige because they comply with the regulations set down in the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939-75.  If we exclude one group we will have to exclude them all and where do we stop?  As I said, if this has an adverse effect on tourism the Minister for Tourism and Transport and Bord Fáilte will review the situation but at the moment there is no question of singling out one group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that I spoke about all hotels but I tried to be specific.  I mentioned family-run hotels and hotels that open on a seasonal basis. They are the type of hotels I had in mind, not hotels in general.  There are some very wealthy people running fantastic hotels who are making a great deal of money but there is no need to grant them exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his full outline of the type of premises that will be affected, that is, registered businesses.  He was very open about this and I would like to discuss it.  What he said causes me a great deal of worry.  The following <Col N="1608" /> will not get rates relief&mdash;hotels, guesthouses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, motor hotels, caravan sites and approved cottages for letting to tourists. In those areas people have to conform to certain standards.  Many of us holidayed around Ireland this year and called in on some of these caravan sites.  I was delighted to see the standards maintained in some of them, which I am sure are registered with Bord Fáilte, and will not qualify for rates relief, but I was appalled at the standards of other sites which will probably qualify for rates exemption simply because they are not registered.  This is a very serious situation. It is absolutely essential that the Minister reconsider this situation.</P>
    <P>Recently one of our top hoteliers attacked us for our litter problems, untidiness and so on.  One of the ways to remedy this situation would be to encourage people, through exemption from rates, to conform to certain standards. Now, because a person is complying with the stringent regulations laid down by Bord Fáilte and has a registered caravan site, he is debarred from rates relief.  That is not common sense.  He sees his neighbour breaking every rule in the book.  He may not have planning permission, sanitary accommodation or running water and he gets away with a certain amount because he is not registered and nobody has a record of his business.</P>
    <P>I will deal with youth hostels.  Bord Fáilte do not want the &ldquo;fish and chips&rdquo; type holidaymaker here.  They want affluent tourists.  However, we must encourage young people such as students to come here and they should be accommodated in registered youth hostels.  It is ironic that registered youth hostels conforming with Bord Fáilte regulations are to be compelled to pay rates.  The number of youth hostels is limited and they provide reasonably priced holidays for young people who are not well off.  It is difficult enough to meet the running expenses without having to pay rates as well.</P>
    <P>Our future in tourism lies in the goodwill we can generate among young people coming here.  If they enjoy a good holiday they will spread the good news and may return again.  It is only the best <Col N="1609" /> youth hostels which will be hit by this Bill.  We must aim to provide best possible accommodation and I admire people who take pride in their work and believe there is prestige in a job well done. However, prestige cannot be lodged with the bank in order to pay the rates bill, nor will prestige obtain an overdraft from the bank.  It is not true to say that people register with Bord Fáilte just for the sake of prestige.  They register because they believe they are working for the good of tourism in general and they have the interests of the industry at heart.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House make a formal call to the Minister to remedy this situation.  Youth hostels and caravan sites are facilities used by holiday makers who are not too well off and Bord Fáilte set standards for such accommodation. Hostels which are not registered may qualify for rates relief.  The only way in which Bord Fáilte can maintain standards is by ensuring adherence to their rules and regulations.  Through the provisions of this Bill the Minister is almost compelling people to deregister.</P>

If the Minister's motivation was to confine the abolition of rates to a number of confined properties, essentially domestic residences, on the basis that an extension of the exemption rate would be an undue expense on the Exchequer, could he give us any estimate of what the loss of direct revenue to the State would be for the list of non-exempted buildings and properties he read out?  Would he comment on whether my guesstimates are reasonably accurate or not?  He stated there were 107 guesthouses registered under the relevant Act and some of these were large and some were small.</P>

      <P>I am talking about family hotels.  I accept that a hotel is a business and qualifies for tax concessions as a registered legal company.  None of the other properties, with the exception of possibly some guesthouses, is operated and run by a registered company.  We <Col N="1611" /> are talking about properties which are family concerns of one kind or another. Was the decision to exclude these properties from the benefit of the rates exemption made on the basis of cost and, if so, what was the Department's estimate of the cost per annum to the Exchequer of such an exemption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): On the definition of &ldquo;lodgings&rdquo; as it affects subsection (3), the Minister is encouraging people to operate unregistered guesthouses.  It cannot be denied that is the net result of the Minister's definition.  From the point of view of rates, it will pay people to run unregistered guesthouses.  These are people who provide as few as five bedrooms and up to eight mentioned by the Minister.  Now, 10 per cent approximately of the guesthouses on the register last week are becoming unregistered.  This Bill has been published for several months.  The evidence is there that the Bill makes it more profitable for people to run unregistered guesthouses and that they are taking steps to become unregistered.</P>
      <P>Year after year, Bord Fáilte issue reports, and invariably they point to the complaints received by them from tourists during the year covered by the report.  Year after year, the most common complaint is substandard hygiene and lack of cleanliness.  Those are the facts and we must face up to them. Therefore, we want more registration and more inspection, rather than less registration and less inspection.  I have no doubt this proposal will damage the tourist industry.  There is no use in the Minister saying that if it becomes apparent in the future that this is bad for Tourism the Minister for Tourism and Transport will have a look at it.  That is not good enough.  Now is the time to think about it and to consult with his colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Director General of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, some of the places affected have as few as five bedrooms.  Such establishments are obviously part-time businesses.  Many of them are open for part of the year only.  During that time <Col N="1612" /> they give a good service.  I appeal to the Minister not to do anything that would lower standards.  Since 1939 the policy has been to encourage people to register their guesthouses and to have them inspected. It is appalling to see that policy being thrown by the wayside and a situation being created in which it will be more profitable to run an establishment which is not registered and not subject to inspection.</P>
    <P>This Bill was conceived in a hurry to implement an election promise.  As a result we see this type of flaw coming through.  If a Minister came into this House a few years ago with his tourism and transport hat on him and said: &ldquo;We do not want as many inspections of hotels as we have had before.  We do not want as many inspections of registered guesthouses.  We believe people should be allowed to operate in a free-for-all situation and provide accommodation for tourists and holidaymakers without having to comply with any standards,&rdquo; he would have been laughed out of this House.  He would have been told he was damaging the tourist industry.  The Minister does not realise that is what he is doing.  He is encouraging substandard establishments which will not be subject to registration and inspection.  The evidence is there because 10 per cent of them have already opted for nonregistration since the Minister's Bill was published.  I have made my case as clearly as I possibly can.  This is a deplorable step in the wrong direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify the purpose for which we are here.  We are not here to derate tourism which is our third largest industry, and we are all proud of it.  We did not make any commitment to derate tourism.  We made a commitment in our manifesto to derate domestic dwellings, secondary schools, community <Col N="1613" /> halls and farm out-offices and out-buildings.  What we did is based on that commitment in our manifesto.  Lest anybody be under any illusion, we are not bringing in this Bill solely for the purpose of putting on the Statute Book what we did when we derated these hereditaments on 6 July 1977.  We are legalising also what the previous Government did when they reduced the rate bill by 25 per cent.  When the Coalition made that change they were not concerned about the position of guesthouses, registered or unregistered, or about hotels.  There was no question then of the partial derating of those establishments. For Deputy Enright to argue as he did in this regard is tantamount to his arguing that rates should not have to be paid by any tourist interest. I wonder what the people generally would think of any such proposal. Our purpose in relation to this Bill is to comply with the commitment in our manifesto in respect of derating.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright made the point that rates still have to be paid in respect of a registered caravan site while the unregistered site on which there are not proper standards is free in this respect. The Deputy is not correct.  A caravan site is not a domestic dwelling in any form.  It is valued by the Valuation Office in a totally different manner from that in which a domestic dwelling is valued.  The caravan site is valued on a turnover basis and, consequently, has no relevance so far as domestic ratings are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been inferred that I am driving people out of the registered category of guesthouses.  That is not so.  Indeed, I am not driving anyone out of tourism or doing anything to lessen the standards of tourism.  There was the implication on the part of Deputy Enright in particular that non-registered guesthouses are of an inferior standard compared with those that are registered.  That is not so.  Bord Fáilte do not think they are inferior. They have a list of all non-registered accommodations and bed-and-breakfast places apart from those that are registered.  If the unregistered places are listed by the board they can hardly be <Col N="1614" /> deemed to be inferior.  Of the 307 registered guesthouses to which I referred, 75 are licenced premises.  Would anybody suggest that these should be derated or even that the others which are very large should be derated?  We have never said we would derate such premises.  We are sticking to the commitment with which we went before the people. The people voted for us on the basis that we would derate domestic dwellings but not on the understanding that we would derate tourist interests also.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Quinn's question.  I do not have specific figures in the area to which he referred but some of the guesthouses, for example, are very highly valued as are some of the other properties listed.</P>
    <P>All registered hostels are included, some of which are exceptionally large and operate on a commercial basis in accommodating students and other categories of persons.  They are commercial operations and all are treated similarly for rating purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister's objective in this legislation is clear.  I appreciate that there was no commitment to derate tourist interests, regardless of the merits or otherwise of any such change but would the Minister not accept that in this draft legislation he is providing a financial incentive for people to have themselves de-registered? Therefore, between now and Report Stage would the Minister consider redrafting the definition of &ldquo;lodgings&rdquo; so that the incentive to de-register is avoided.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said rightly&mdash;I have checked the figures for myself&mdash;10 per cent of the categories of guesthouses we are talking of have not been included for registration this year. On the basis of a valuation of £30 per year which perhaps is low, that works out at only £92,000, but if the cost is £200,000 directly to the Exchequer in the event of exemption, the real cost in terms of circular transfers and the ineffectiveness of Bord Fáilte's promotional campaign in attempting to get registration of such properties would be much higher.  Therefore, within the total  <Col N="1615" /> of Government there must be a more efficient way of achieving the objective that the Government have set themselves legitimately.  The Minister has produced what is a patently bad piece of legislation which contains the proven incentive for people to opt out so far as registration of their premises is concerned.  Either the Minister's Department are doing their job well or the Minister for Tourism and Transport is not doing his job but if one compares his inactivity in regard to telephones, for instance, with his apparent inactivity in opposing the section before us when it was circulated within the Cabinet, this is not surprising.  Without going into the benefits of tourism the Minister for the Environment by virtue of having some residual responsibility in this area, should bring forward on Report Stage a new definition section that would meet the reasonable requirements being made from this side of the House.  Nobody is asking the Minister to do anything that would involve extra expenditure or to increase the volume of direct expenditure in which the Department will be involved by way of compensation.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that some of the guesthouses are operating licensed bars and that some of them have up to 80 bedrooms.  Those two matters can be dealt with quickly but I am concerned with the five- to ten-bedroomed type of non-licensed guesthouse that operates for part of the year.  I see no reason for the Minister not redrafting the section so as to exclude such houses from rates so that they will not be disadvantaged compared with the unregistered establishments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): On the next definition which deals with mixed hereditaments I was very glad when it was proposed to abolish rates.  But this was part of the policy of the National Coalition who planned to phase out rates.  We started this programme by removing health charges and housing subsidies from rates and later we abolished 25 per cent of the rates on private houses.  That was an instalment on the way to the ultimate abolition of rates but our intention was to abolish rates totally in an orderly way and as the economy could afford that.  I regard as inequitable and unjust the system of raising local finance by way of rates.  That system took no account of the capacity of people to pay and worse still did not ensure that buildings of like size and description paid like rates.  It was a hit and miss operation.  For instance, a person could improve his buildings but if the improvements did not come to the notice of the rate collector or if, having come to his notice, they were not brought by him to the notice of the local authority, he could be paying rates on a £10 valuation, whereas his neighbour down the street with a building exactly the same in all respects could be paying rates on a valuation of £30 or £40.  That was unfair, and I had hoped sincerely that when rates on private houses were being abolished the inequity that went with the rating system would go along with them.  I regret that the definition of mixed hereditaments will continue the hit and miss system of collecting money.  Mixed hereditaments mean hereditaments which consist wholly or partly of a building which is used <Col N="1617" /> partly as a dwelling to a significant extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): &mdash;&mdash;and partly for another or other purposes to such an extent. How are we to get uniformity out of that?  How is any rate collector to know whether he should in the first place list the building for valuation purposes? How is the county council, the corporation or urban council to decide when it comes before them whether the building is being used for another purpose to a significant extent, as a dwelling to a significant extent or for some other purpose? If the matter has to go before the court how is the court going to make up its mind?  This is a crazy definition that can lead only to a perpetuation of the injustice that was inherent in the rating system down the years.  It was a hit and miss system.  I could put down an amendment to this.  Indeed, I considered putting down many amendments to this Bill but they would have had the fate of Deputy Quinn's amendment: they would have been ruled out of order one after another as imposing a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It would be better to abolish altogether the category of mixed hereditaments than to have this crazy definition here which will lead to some people being rated and other people with similar buildings or buildings which should properly be rated not being rated at all.  That has been the system in force here for years and years.  People added to their houses substantially and the rate collector never heard about it.  Other people maybe only painted their houses and they were listed for revaluation. That has been going on ever since I had occasion, either in my professional capacity or my political capacity, to notice these things.  I had hoped fervently that the abolition of rates would have meant the abolition of this injustice and inequity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will say &ldquo;There is the definition and it means what it says.  If a <Col N="1618" /> house is being used to a significant extent as a dwelling and to a significant extent for other purposes, then it is a mixed hereditament and it must bear some rates.&rdquo; That is lovely and it is an answer that the Minister would expect to get away with.  But I put it to this House that if the whole 148 Deputies were here from all over Ireland with their huge amount of common sense, whatever else we may say about them, they would know and accept that that would lead to a hit and miss system of rating, that it would mean that some people who are entitled to be rated would be rated and that many others who are entitled to be rated would not be rated.</P>
    <P>There must be some thinking in the Minister's Department behind this definition and the Minister must have some intentions as to how he hopes to operate this.  I would like the Minister for the Environment to give us his views on this.  By way of supplementary question here one day I named a list of people whom I thought might be partially rated under this Bill.  I mentioned people like rate collectors, insurance people and many others whom I will not list here. The Minister's colleague, the present Minister for Defence, shouted back at me, &ldquo;It is that kind of thinking that has you in Opposition&rdquo;.  That led me to believe that the Minister and the Government intend that there is going to be a very liberal interpretation of this section in regard to imposing any rates on houses in which people live.  If that is so I would like the Minister to say it.  If that is the intention of the Government they should clarify it by giving a proper guide to it.</P>
    <P>I regard this definition as very serious. It goes to the very root of the proposal to exonerate dwellings from rates but to impose rates on buildings in which some people live and carry on other occupations. I would like the Minister to list 20 or 30 occupations that he considers might or might not incur liability for rates.  This is just a passing of the buck by the Government and the Minister to the rate collectors, the local authorities and others without any proper guidance. I would like the Minister's views on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the qualification &ldquo;significant&rdquo; is to give flexibility to local authorities in the administration of relief.  As an example, rather than taking rate collectors in this instance, we will take a housewife who carries on a small amount of dressmaking or such like.  The local authority will be able to ignore this as a non-domestic use.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the inequality of the valuation system down the years and he always maintained that it was not very just and there was victimisation. He is quite right, but the cure for that lies in the hands of the local authorities.  It is the local authorities who submit the annual list to the Commissioner for Valuations for revision.  The councils always had this option open to them.  If, for instance, one ratepayer felt that he was being victimised and his valuation was too high he always had the right to have it submitted for revaluation.  That machinery was always available.</P>
      <P>With regard to this mixed hereditament, or whatever we are going to decide to call it, a person is entitled to relief if it is mixed up to one-third of the total valuation subject to a maximum of £18. If the person feels aggrieved and if the £18 bears an unjust relationship to the total amount of the building which is used for domestic purposes, that person can appeal to the Valuation Office and the Commissioner for Valuations in the ordinary course of his duties will send somebody along during the following months and have the building properly valued between the two or he will treat the applicant in a just manner.  I know instances of where this has happened already and in some instances the people did very well.  That right is there for the ratepayers and I hope that if they feel aggrieved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In instances which have occurred, and I have heard about them, no cause of complaint against the Valuation Office has been experienced.  Inequalities which exist can be put right, as they have always been put right, by the local authority.  All that has to be done is for the local officials and local rate collectors to submit properties for revaluation. I do not see that there is any new problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to appear unduly argumentative but the core of much of this Bill lies in section 1 and, once we get the definition right, the rest will be purely procedural.  We have to go through the definitions one by one.  According to the Bill, &ldquo;mixed hereditament&rdquo; means &ldquo;a hereditament which consists wholly or partly of a building which is used partly as a dwelling to a significant extent and partly for another or other purposes to such an extent.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;to a significant extent&rdquo; seem to me to be in the nature of a double-edged sword.  If a family running a guesthouse occupy 20 to 25 per cent of the accommodation is that &ldquo;a significant extent?&rdquo;  There is provision elsewhere for the specific valuation of the residential and non-residential content of all property.  The provision says it will be one-third the total valuation, or £18, or less.  Why complicate matters? Quite frankly, this will mean more work for Deputies because constituents will be appealing to them for an interpretation of &ldquo;to a significant extent&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister would have another look at this.  Would he tell us how he visualises his Department and the Valuation Office implementing this or arbitrating on the interpretation of the words &ldquo;to a significant extent&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for the Valuation Office or say how they would react but from what little experience we have we know they have treated people very fairly when apportioning existing valuations as between commercial and domestic.  We will depend to a great extent on the local authorities for their interpretation <Col N="1621" /> and, if that is not satisfactory, the ratepayer will have the right to appeal.  It is quite flexible and the &ldquo;significant&rdquo; qualification makes it more flexible still.  There is no way in which my Department could know how much of a building is used for commercial purposes and how much for domestic purposes but the local authority will know and if things are not satisfactory, then there will be the right of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it is bad law to resort to the defence of saying that, if the law does not work, people will have the right to appeal either to the courts or to the Valuation Office?  There is a section which provides for apportionment quite clearly so why introduce this phrase &ldquo;to a significant extent&rdquo;?  This phrase could be used to prevent people living in mixed hereditaments benefiting from domestic rates because one person's interpretation may differ from another's.  The Minister has covered the matter adequately elsewhere where he says one-third the total valuation, or £18, whichever is the less, or two separate valuations.  That covers all the options.  Why complicate it?  The result could easily be that this would be interpreted to the benefit of the local authority and not to the benefit of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a definition of &ldquo;mixed hereditament&rdquo;.  Take again the example of a private house in which one room is used for dress-making. Flexibility permits the local authority to treat that as a domestic dwelling instead of putting the lady affected through all the necessity of apportionment and so forth.  I would have more confidence in our local authorities than Deputy Quinn seems to have with regard to the way in which they will interpret this.  I believe we can trust them. This is not bad law.  If it is then every law passed the operation of which depended solely on local authorities was bad law.  I trust local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The obligation rests on this House to make good law.  We would <Col N="1622" /> be abdicating our responsibility if we were to trust in the wisdom and common sense of local authorities.  I am not now casting any aspersions on local authorities but it is my job to ensure we make good law, law which is not open to misinterpretation, and I suggest that, if the Minister removes the phrase &ldquo;to a significant extent&rdquo; from the definition he will remove a phrase which could be interpreted to the detriment of the individual at the receiving end.  Our obligation is to make good law.  Administering it is someone else's problem.  If we make laws that can be interpreted differently by different people, then that is bad law. I cannot see what the Minister would lose if he took out this phrase.  We are not talking about a handful of properties or 307 guesthouses.  We are talking about thousands of properties all over the country and this could cause untold problems for people who do not have the resources, the power or the time to go arguing, apportioning and all the rest of it.</P>

      <P>About four or six weeks ago I put a question to the Minister for Finance in relation to the increases this year and last year in valuations on non-domestic hereditaments, and in the form of a written reply I was told that it would be too costly to provide that information. I was taken aback at this, because when a Deputy tables a question the regulations of the House are that the information is furnished after three working days.  I asked the question because I received information during the summer that approximately 70 people worked in the Valuation Office and of that 70, 69 of them were travelling around the country revising valuations.  As far as I was aware and as far as the people in the Valuation Office were aware there had never before been such a large number of people carrying out valuations.  It also came to my notice that the valuation of one person who had a domestic portion on his premises was increased 400 per cent.  This businessman had carried out improvements.</P>

In another area a person in a business premises who had made a minor renovation to his mixed hereditament property had his valuation raised by £30.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I made a strong case against the definition of &ldquo;mixed hereditament&rdquo; as it appears in section 1. In my view it will be impossible to operate it in a fair way.  In defending the definition the Minister said it was drafted in such a way as to give flexibility but that is what is wrong with it.  What I am afraid of is that we will have flexibility to such an extent that some will be in and others excluded.  That has been the position down the years.  Valuations could not be revised unless they were listed by the local authorities but there was flexibility there to the extent that some were listed and others which should have been listed were not.  As a result some valuations jumped up dramatically while others were left unchanged.  Some people had a valuation of £10 while others for identical premises paid on a valuation of £50.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us on several occasions that these premises could be listed for apportionment and if there was trouble between the local authority and the ratepayer as to the apportionment put on the dwelling portion, which is exempt, and the business portion, the matter could be referred to the Valuation Office. I am sure the Minister is aware that as a result of that a valuation of £20 which is referred to the Valuation Office for apportionment between a domestic and business section of a premises could be increased to £50 with £40 on the business portion and £10 on the dwelling. The Minister cannot deny that because he must have had a lot of experience of it.  Once the Commissioner of Valuation is asked about a dormant valuation, a valuation that has not been revised since 1920, the inevitable result is a dramatic increase in the valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition is unworkable and will lead to injustices and inequity all over the place.  I accept, as the Minister said, that there was no new problem but I understood we would be endeavouring to get rid of problems.  We are having a perpetuation of a problem that has existed since the rating system was introduced. We will have the same old system whereby if one is lucky one is not listed.  I will go further and say that if <Col N="1628" /> one is friendly with the rate collector and if he is unscrupulous enough to keep quiet one would not be listed.  In that event such a person would be treated as having a private dwelling while somebody else down the street would be listed and have to pay rates.  We should not stand over that system.  I have been dealing with this problem for many years and I am aware of what has been happening.  This definition is a recipe for injustice in the future.  I urge the Minister to redraft it so that it will be fair all round.  I invited the Minister to list a number of businesses or professions he thought should attract rates and the only one he gave me was dress-making.  In that case that person would not be liable for rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister is afraid of this; it is a hot potato for him.  This is drafted so as to pass the buck from the Cabinet table and the Custom House.  The Minister should give us a fair example of the type of business or profession that should not be liable for rates.  This buck-passing when it is going to mean that some people will be paying a lot of money in rates annually while others in similar circumstances who are lucky enough not to be listed pay none is unfair.  It is a system which should not be condoned or tolerated.  We should get rid of it.</P>

      <P>I have not forgotten the point made by Deputy Quinn and I wish to tell him that I am prepared to have a look at this with a view to improvement, if that is the case.  I wish to clarify these business valuations.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has a wrong conception of them and Deputy Quinn seems to agree with him. When these valuation lists are submitted by a local authority they see if they want a place revalued.  We are talking about an apportionment for derating purposes. It will be listed for apportionment and not for revaluing.  Buildings will not be revalued if they are not listed for revaluing.</P>

      <P>The expression is &ldquo;revalued&rdquo;.  I have seen this.  I have written <Col N="1629" /> to local authorities, believe it or not. This is how it happens.

      <P>Would the Minister not accept from his own personal experience that, if he or I were involved in a local authority and had the opportunity of sending up a list for either apportionment or revaluation, we both know what we would opt to do?  Whether it was in the Town Hall in Ennis or elsewhere, if the option was there we would opt for a revaluation and not a simple apportionment. I accept the legal distinction between the two.  But the question is: are we going to get a legal definition of what portion of property is residential and what portion is for other purposes?  Is this going to be done in the context of the 1978 valuation and not the 1910 valuation, because most local authorities if they had any sense would go for revaluation?</P>

Once the valuation people are brought on a premises it is up to them, in my opinion, to regularise the whole valuation.  If it is the Minister's intention that an application to apportion a valuation could not result in an increase in a valuation, he should write that into the Bill.  Would the Minister write that into the Bill on the Report Stage?  Will he introduce an amendment which will say that on an application to apportion a valuation it shall not be open to the Commissioner of Valuation to increase the valuation submitted to him for apportionment?

Some of these valuations will be submitted to the county council.  Some of them will be apportioned as between private and business occupations.  Some of them will simply be treated as private occupations and will not be interfered with at all.  I asked the Minister on a number of occasions to give us an idea of his thinking on occupations or business professions that should attract rates and he refuses to do it.  He has been less than frank with us not to give us the benefit of his departmental knowledge on this.

We all know of the innumerable businesses, professions or occupations that are carried on gainfully in residences.  I want to know are all these going to be subject to rates or are we going to have a case where some person in a huckster's shop is making a few hundred pounds and his premises are rated and some other person practising some other totally different occupation and earning several thousand pounds in a similar building is going to be free of rates?

Take, for example, the question of a music teacher who gives lessons in his or her house.  The house is a private dwelling but that may be his or her main occupation.  How, in regard to that case, would the Minister see that person's house being defined?  Would it be a mixture since it is being used for business purposes or, to use the phrase, &ldquo;for another or other purposes to such an extent...&rdquo;?  From everybody's point of view, including that of the Minister whose backbenchers will be plaguing him to make exemptions, he should sit down and produce some list along the lines suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It would go a long way to clarify this.  It certainly is necessary because it is a matter that could cause a lot of trouble. It is incumbent on the Minister to clarify it.</P>

If the <Col N="1632" /> Minister would keep in mind exactly what I have said in regard to the apportionment of domestic as distinct from business sections, I would be happy.  I would be happy if he would bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  I do not know whether Deputy Quinn and myself are at cross-purposes in regard to what the Minister has said.  I understood the Minister to say that if he found the law unsatisfactory in this area he would consider introducing legislation.  I do not think the Minister quite said he was going to bring it in on the Report Stage.  In cases where improvements were carried out, when those properties went to the Valuation Office for apportionment they decided to increase them.  I understand that the criterion the Valuation Office use to value property is the current market letting value of a premises, that is what the person letting the property on the open market would get.</P>

I want to ensure that we do not have a situation where local authorities submit those lists for apportionment and the staff of the Valuation Office revalue the properties upwards.

      <P>All sides of the House have agreed and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle also agreed that once the definition section in this Bill is clarified the rest of the Bill will go through quickly. It is absolutely essential that business premises do not find that the officials of the Valuation Office inspect their properties for apportionment purposes and then increase their valuations.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out when a valuation of £20 goes to the Valuation Office for apportionment it could come back with a total of £40, that is £30 on the business and £10 on the domestic dwelling, an increase of £20.  I have two particular towns in mind where there have been sizeable increases.  I can show the Minister the figures for County Leitrim where there have been increases of up to £1,000 on non-domestic properties. The Minister may not be aware that this is happening.</P>

Never before, as far as I am aware, have so many people been out doing valuations. I believe that if those apportionments are carried out in this way they will hit the business community very hard.  Some people will get benefit but there will be an imposition on others.</P>

      <P>I know we have probably spent a lot of time on this section but there is a lot of doubt in this area.  I am not sure if I am in order in asking this question on a definition section.  Could the Minister now or at some other time during the passage of this Bill tell us if there will be any communication between his Department and the Valuation Office on the way in which valuations are made as a result of the interpretation of this particular clause? Would he be at liberty to talk about that area of his administration?  The Department and the Government have assumed responsibility for the direct reimbursement to local authorities of revenue which local authorities are now forfeiting as a result of the abolition of rates.  One way in which the Government can save themselves revenue is to allow non-residential property valuations to be revalued upwards to a scale similar to the one referred to by Deputy Enright.  If this happens, the rateable valuation base of local authorities is going to rise. Therefore, the amount reimbursed to local authorities will be somewhat reduced.  In many cases small businesses will have to pay increased rates.</P>
      <P>My concern is for those with small operations who are not registered as companies and who frequently cannot get the benefit of a tax write-off.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Chair has been indulgent, but this matter requires clarification.  If the Minister gave us some indication of how he is going to deal with the matter and told us the connection between his Department's interpretation of this section and the interpretation of the Valuation Office, our analysis and interpretation of the situation would be more accurate.  It is open to the interpretation that the tax base of small businesses will be raised without reference to publicised statements or policy and this could have a detrimental effect on small operators.</P>

      <P>As well as the commitment on derating, there was also a commitment that the non-domestic sector would not be called up to bear any part <Col N="1637" /> of the derating, nor has it been called upon to do so this year.  Local authorities should list properties for valuation.  It is in their interests to have new domestic properties valued in order to get an increased share of the grant. This should not endanger the commercial and industrial sectors in any way. The same guidelines for listing new properties will apply.  It was always easy to list new houses as they qualified for grants and it is still necessary to apply for planning permission.  Both lists are at the disposal of local authorities when compiling annual records for the Valuation Office.</P>

I wanted those figures because this Bill was coming before the House and I wanted to quote them.  There appears to be a conscious effort to hide information dealing with this matter.  What is there to hide?  I think it is what I said earlier: there have been savage increases in the valuation of business premises.  This has occurred because the local authorities are sending to the Commissioner of Valuation a list of premises for apportionment. Instead of being apportioned they are being revised upwards.  It is my contention that there have been sizeable, savage increases on business premises. All this comes under the heading of mixed hereditaments.  This is simply a way of levying on the business community sizeable increases by way of rates.  The local authorities are anxious to obtain any information they can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are one or two other items to which I want to refer.  The next definition is that of a municipal rate.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me and tell me if I am right in assuming that in some local authorities this does not include a water rate.  People are presently getting bills from local authorities for water rates because water rates are not covered by the abolition of rates in general.  If this is the case, would he consider broadening the scope of the definition of municipal rates to include water rates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he not agree that citizens in one part of the country are being exempted from paying water charges while others are not?  Does he regard this as being equitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason separate charges for domestic water supplies are permitted in county council areas is that while virtually all urban developments are served from local authority water systems 16 per cent of rural dwellings have not as yet any piped water supplies and only 40 per cent of rural dwellings are connected to county council water mains.  It is considered that the minority of rural residents with public water supplies should pay charges towards the cost of the service rather than have the entire cost fall on the rates.  Rural householders, including members of group schemes, who take water from private sources are not liable for water charges.  Dublin County Council have what is described as a water rate and Dublin Corporation include the charge in the rate.  This is the way it has been done.  Certain local authorities in boroughs and urban areas include the charge in the overall rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government decide to exclude water charges?  Could the Minister give some estimate of the net saving to the Exchequer as a result of this exclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The saving to the Exchequer is £1.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a particular kind of service provided by local authorities among all the others, such as refuse collection, library services and the &ldquo;lollipop&rdquo; men and women who take children across the road.  The provision of water supply has been singled out simply because it was charged under a different system.  The Minister and the Government are being niggardly in saving this £1.2 million by taking advantage of this legal definition and in so doing they are discriminating against householders in one area as against those in another area.  This definition will result in inequity if the Minister is not <Col N="1644" /> prepared to broaden it to include water charges.  He has already given the cost of such inclusion.  Would he not consider that the logic of his argument with regard to the provision of water services could equally apply to other things like public lighting or the provision of tarred roads in certain rural areas?  Why single out the provision of water services from the normal range of services provided by local authorities?  Why make the distinction between urban and rural in this regard?</P>
      <P>There was not, to my knowledge, any statement in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to the effect that rates would be abolished but people in the countryside would not get the full benefit because of the water charge.  The spirit of the political commitment made in May 1977, on the basis of which Fianna Fáil received a mandate to govern, is being broken by this miserable clawback of £1.2 million.  It is a contradictory clawback which could be applied in other areas and it is discriminatory to some sections of the community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn has drawn attention to a very important matter in relation to the adequacy of the definition because it does not cover water rates.

It is not possible for Deputy Quinn or anybody else to put down an amendment to extend that meaning because you would rule it out of order as imposing a charge on the Exchequer.  As a matter of fact, you have done so.  Surely in dealing with a definition section we are entitled to put forward an argument that the definition should be changed and enlarged so as to include water rates.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We could be ten and a half hours on it and we must have patience.  I was a member of Dublin County Council long enough to know what was being done there and there was an even more peculiar aspect.  In county council areas adjoining the city there was a water rate and no other water charge but further out in the county there was a separate water charge.  There were endless problems about this because in the county they were paying <Col N="1646" /> two rates, a water rate and the ordinary rate, whereas in areas adjoining the city there was a water rate only.  Where there was a water rate they now get water free, whereas the water charge must still be paid.  It is appalling if the definition does not cover what was known in some areas as the water rate and in others as the water charge.  It is very inequitable and should not be let through easily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Water charges are sometimes called water rates.  They are a direct charge for a service and are not, therefore, part of the domestic rate.  We gave a commitment in the manifesto regarding domestic rates, rates on community halls, farm out-offices and buildings and secondary schools.  This Bill complies with that commitment.  We did not give a commitment about water rates, nor did the Coalition Government when they removed 25 per cent of rates.</P>

      <P>One of the means is to put down an amendment.  Unfortunately, the amendment I intended to put down was ruled out of order.  Therefore, all I can do is talk about the definition of the municipal rate.  There is a certain amount of poetic licence about political promises which is not peculiar to any side of the House.  If the Minister says <Col N="1647" /> there was no firm political commitment to abolish water charges or water rates, there can be no argument with him.</P>

Does he seriously propose to institute legislation which will discriminate between one part of the country and another, between one section of the community and another, on the grounds of the administrative hotch-potch there was in the past about how the charge was made for the provision of water supplies? Does he intend to freeze this into law for the future for £1.2 million?  Is this the price of inequity and discrimination? Bearing in mind the hardship this will cause to some families, is there not a very strong argument for looking again at the definition of the municipal rate?  Is there not a very good argument in terms of equity and justice for ensuring that a water supply is available on the same basis up and down the country?</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister did not add a little PS to the manifesto saying that they would be looking for water rates. What is the position in regard to malicious injury charges?  They are now limited to 25p or something like that. Where an award is made for malicious damage and a charge is put on the rates, will it continue to be paid, or will it be abolished by the abolition of rates?  In an area where a malicious injury award has been placed on the rates, will the owner of a private house have to contribute to that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Surely there is no difference between that and the question of the water charge raised by Deputy Quinn. The Minister should have another think about this.  Surely the spirit of the manifesto was that payments to the county council for local services would be abolished.  That is what was meant by the abolition of rates on private houses. In order to implement that, the Minister must amend this definition of the words &ldquo;municipal rate&rdquo; and include this miserable little charge of a few shillings or a few pence in the £ amounting to £1.2 million.  As Deputy Clinton and Deputy Quinn said, it is outrageous that the water supply should be free in one area and should be charged for in another. That does not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Two previous Acts govern the municipal authorities we are speaking about.  They could not charge for water service.  No commitment was given about water charges.  Dublin Corporation and urban authorities still have to supply the service and include it in their overall estimates.  There is no change whatsoever.  They will still have to find the money to give the service. Two previous Acts govern the fact that the municipal authorities do not make a separate water charge such as county councils do.  It is not just a matter of changing a word in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister has more experience than I and he has the benefit of advice from his Department. Would he agree that if this definition of the municipal rate goes through unchanged, people who lived in one part of the country in a property which has not sought an extension of the water system from the local authority and then moved into a house with an existing water supply will have to make a direct financial contribution on an annual basis to their local authority for that water supply, whereas other people will not, even though they are benefiting from a very similar if not identical service.  Does the Minister not feel this is creating an <Col N="1649" /> injustice in the allocation of local authority services?  If he feels that is the case, as any reasonable person must, could he not see his way&mdash;at a cost of £1.2 million; and one hesitates to think what the administrative cost is of gathering that sum&mdash;to tidy up the legislation identified with this Bill.  This Bill impinges on a whole range of other Acts.</P>
      <P>It was long enough being drafted for this anomaly to have been recognised and costed.  When I asked the Minister the cost he got it very promptly from his advisers, £1.2 million.  If the Minister is not prepared to change this definition, we must come to the conclusion that the Government are worse off for money than we thought since they are clawing back £1.2 million in such a miserable and mealy-mouthed fashion.  I do not want to get into the abuse business.  The Minister has an opportunity to tidy up the Bill and to provide equal treatment for everybody.  Perhaps more is involved than simply amending and definition. Consequential amendments may be necessary in other legislation.  That would be for the experts to decide.</P>
      <P>My amendment to this definition was ruled out of order on the grounds that it would impose an extra charge on the Exchequer. We believe that if this definition becomes law there will be discrimination. On that basis would the Minister not be prepared either to indicate now or on Report Stage that he will equalise the treatment for people availing of like water services?</P>

      <P>All of them with the exception of Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation and the urban authorities. Regarding Deputy Quinn's argument, if one can call the situation discriminatory, that has been the situation for a long time.  The provision is governed by previous Acts, Acts that were in existence long before either my time or the Deputy's.  What is involved is a water charge, not a water rate.  This situation existed long before there was any question <Col N="1650" /> of derating.  It is not my intention to make any change in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the situation has always been as it is proposed here.  I would argue that what has happened is that in some local authorities the cost of the provision of water services has been identified as a separate item and charged separately but in essence the domestic householder has had levelled on him by way of rates a direct charge for the use of local authority services.  The rates vary from one local authority to another.  As a result of the definition here becoming law, some householders will have to pay a direct charge for the provision of a service which they would not have to pay for if they were in a different local authority area.  If that is not discrimination, I do not know the meaning of that word.  If the Minister is not prepared to indicate his willingness to review the situation between now and Report Stage we shall have to conclude that the Government are so hard up for money that they must have this clawback of £1.2 million.</P>

They will be completely derated while all the owners of private houses in towns such as Bailieboro, Belturbet and Cootehill will continue to make some small payment to the rate collector, call it rates, water charges or anything else.  I say this because the Minister tells us that the £1.2 million will be contributed by all local authorities other than those in Dublin and Cork and the urban authorities.  The towns I have mentioned are not in urban authority areas so <Col N="1651" /> householders there will be liable to pay rates.  The owners of houses throughout County Cavan and other counties who are in local authority areas and who are supplied with water by the county councils concerned will pay a water charge.

I understand the Minister to say that these local authorities, who are all local authorities other than Dublin and Cork and the urban authorities, can get rid of this <Col N="1655" /> liability by ceasing to have a water charge and having a water rate, and he says that that is at their discretion.

I have been accused of that often enough in recent weeks.  The Government commitment and my commitment is that we will be responsible for the domestic portion of rates.  This is what we have been responsible for.</P>

      <P>Could I have a little more information from the Minister?  Is it a fact that in 1972 a circular issued from the then Department of Local Government advising local authorities who had not separated their water rate from the general rate to do so and to update the charges for water?  Did this happen?  It may have been earlier than 1972 but my recollection is it was pretty late in that year.  It had the effect of making people pay a considerable amount.  I do not accept that there is anything discretionary when it comes to the question of laying <Col N="1657" /> down a concession for the whole country.  If it is laid down for every ratepayer in the country and we are told that rates are to be done away with completely, it is not right to say that rates are to be done away with completely but some people will still have to pay rates, which is what water rates amount to.  It is just not good enough to get out of this by saying what the Minister has said.  If it is discretionary it should not be discretionary. This is one case where the Minister could say &ldquo;Look, you must relieve these people&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that the water rate is collected as a rate, not as a charge per unit of, say, 1,000 gallons of water. There are cases where that is done but not where houses which are affected by the rates remission are concerned.  In their case it is referred to on the document issued as a demand for payment for water rate and the rate is laid down at so much per valuation of house.  Since some local authorities have tied it up with the general rate all local authorities should be instructed to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is at the discretion of the ones who still charge the water charge, and some of them do term it the water rate.  They are empowered to do that if they want to.  There are certain municipal authorities and boroughs who because of previous legislation cannot make an extra charge or separate it from the ordinary estimates which we have <Col N="1658" /> been discussing here this evening.  It is not for me to dictate or direct local authorities as to how they should raise their finances.  If they see fit or at their discretion decide to make an extra charge for a service such as a water charge, that is at their discretion and they are empowered to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  Either they can or they cannot and the Minister has put his finger on the whole thing.  It is a question of money and the money involved is where local authorities making this charge are not carrying out what was laid down in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to the effect that rates were to be abolished.  Rates have not been abolished in County Meath.  There is a water charge and the occupier of the house or cottage as well as the occupier of the farmhouse or castle was paying a rate in proportion to the size of the dwelling on the rateable valuation before rates were done away with.  I do not know how the Minister would be able to stand up to a local authority, which required money for something and asked for permission to raise an overdraft, and say &ldquo;You cannot raise an overdraft&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a reply the other day from the Minister's office which stated that in specific cases it was a kind of block overdraft that would be required and specific instances would not be laid down.  Therefore, if a local authority applies for an overdraft and does not get permission to raise it, is it not a fact that the local authority, according to what <Col N="1659" /> the Minister has just told the House, can have a rate within its own local authority area to raise local finance&mdash;that is the term the Minister used&mdash;and if they can do that for water does it not follow that the local authority can also do it for other things?  Can they not then increase the water rate very substantially?  Where is the limit?  If rates are being abolished they are being abolished and, if the water rate is not abolished, there is just no point in saying rates have been fully abolished. There is a special charge for public houses and a special charge for farmers watering cattle at so much per gallon. That is not what we are talking about here.  We are talking about a rate on occupiers of certain dwellings.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's question was very relevant. If the local authority decide that the £20,000 it is raising by way of water rate is no longer to be collected because it is tied to the general rate and the water rate is abolished, is the Minister prepared to guarantee that money will be made available or must the local authority go short?  Will the local authority be penalised for falling into line with what they thought was the thinking of the present Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only interested in one interpretation and that is the interpretation of what rates are.  If rates are abolished, then they should be abolished but, according to the reply we got, there are rates and rates.  Because local authority A lumps its water rates in with general rates nobody has to pay water rates in that county whereas because local authority B puts down the water charge as a separate item, the people must pay.  It is not just a matter of trying to hold up a section in the House.  The point is that people have been complaining bitterly about this and this is the first opportunity we got to try to get the position <Col N="1663" /> clarified.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked a question in four or five different ways. I will put it in a simpler way.  In the event of Meath County Council, which charges a water rate, deciding that from 1979 onwards they will not charge that water rate but will include it in the general rate, will the Minister be prepared to give the extra money which is covered by the water rate, or will he allow the local authority, in addition to whatever percentage increase he proposes to allow in the rate, to increase the rates by the amount or in what way will it be dealt with?  That is a simple question and the Minister could clarify the situation by giving a straight answer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>For the last time, it is a water charge, although it is sometimes called a water rate: it is strictly a charge for a service rendered by the local authority.  As I have already said it is at the discretion of the local authority under the 1962 Act whether they make that a separate charge or not.  I assure the House that the Government will continue to pick up the tabs for the domestic rate and the other headings embodied in this Bill in accordance with our commitment. I will not attempt to dictate to the local authorities as to what they should do.  For three weeks I have listened to accusations of interfering with the autonomy of the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to do away with domestic rates to the tune of £80.77 million, and here we are arguing about a definition of a water charge or rate. There is no commitment about a water charge.  There was a commitment about the domestic rates which we have honoured.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We will find some section on which to come back to it.  Subsection 5 of section 1 which is part of the definition section, says:</P>
      <P>In determining, in relation to a particular local financial year, whether or not a hereditament is a domestic hereditament, a mixed hereditament, a secondary school or a community hall, regard to the purpose for which the hereditament is used shall be confined to the purposes for which, immediately prior to the making by the rating authority of the rate for that local financial year, the hereditament was ordinarily used or, where appropriate, was last ordinarily used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is wide open to all sorts of abuses. It seems that whether a house is to be regarded as a dwelling house or a business house will depend on what use was being made of it immediately before the rate was struck.  It seems that there is nothing to prevent somebody moving into a house that was a mixed dwelling as a dwelling house a week before the making of the rate.  Surely, the house will as of that day ordinarly be used as a dwelling house and that is the only time that will count.  This could occur on the day immediately prior to the making by the rating authority of the rate for that local financial year.  If ordinary language means ordinary language it means that if the place is a business house or mixed hereditament and it is occupied solely as <Col N="1666" /> living accommodation immediately before the striking of the rate it will be rated as a domestic dwelling which will mean that it will be exempt from rates.  I would like the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection 5 provides that generally, apart from the case of farm buildings entitlement to rates relief under the Bill will depend on the use ordinarly made of a premises at the time of making the rate or if no use is actually being made, on the use last ordinarily made of the premises.  No account will be taken then until the following rating year of changes of use which will take place after the making of the rate.  This may seem inflexible but it is no different from the situation obtaining under the valuation rates in regard to the revision of valuations.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Boland on Tuesday 21 November 1978:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to establish a Commission of Inquiry into the remuneration and conditions of employment of the nursing profession in relation to other categories of employment in both the public and private sector, bearing in mind (1) the educational requirements on entry (2) the period and degree of training (3) the responsibility (4) the professional proficiency (5) the dedication and nature of service required of members of that profession.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on following amendment:</P>
    <P>1.  To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;approves the measures taken by the Government to date to improve the pay, conditions and status of <Col N="1667" /> the nursing profession and welcomes the recent decision to establish a Commission of Inquiry&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to get a copy of the Minister's amendment which I unfortunately have not got?</P>
      <P>I covered a fair bit of ground last night in a fairly short time.  It would appear that the amendment by the Minister will probably indicate that the motion now before the House has been superseded by the Minister's action in his meeting with the INO on Monday last.  The amendment seeks approval of the measures taken by the Government to improve the pay, conditions and status of the nursing profession and welcomes the recent decision to establish a commission of Inquiry.  The only thing that counts in this amendment is the recent decision to establish a commission of inquiry.  Will the commission report quickly having throughly investigated the entire spectrum of the nursing profession and all of its aspects?  Will it be assisted to any degree by the information already gathered by the work study group that has been in operation since 1965?  If it ties in with that it would appear that the commission can report with such haste that commissions will get a new complexion far removed from what I mentioned last night.</P>
      <P>If the Minister can assure the House that the Commission will report within a matter of six months, and if it is intended that the report will be a comprehensive one, I join with him in the latter part of his amendment which mentions the commission.  In the event of the commission not reporting for any reason beyond our control, or their control, in that time I suggest that the Minister give us an assurance that an interim pay increase will be awarded at the end of that six months, particularly if it is obvious that the report will not be forthcoming for a considerable time.</P>

      <P>While it would appear on the face of it that the claim recently settled by the Minister with the INO was one which dated back to 1974 and that the 15 per cent claimed has been conceded it is short-changing the profession in the circumstances to back-date it to June last and put it on a phased basis, not all of which will be paid until June 1979.  The Minister could, without being accused of generosity, have conceded the entire 15 per cent and should have gone back nearer to the date of claim. That would have been a holding operation while the commission was being established and pending their report within six months, as is expected.  Even if that 15 per cent was conceded and backdated for the last three years it would not meet the situation if the commission does not report, like commissions in the past, for many years rather than months.  In spite of the Minister's best efforts to have it report quickly I am afraid of the commission.  I hope his expectations are fulfilled and that the commission will report within six months.</P>
      <P>If it is obvious that the commission cannot report within that time the Minister should, in lieu of it and a reasonable final satisfactory settlement on the whole pay structure, conditions and a charter for nurses arising from it, make a commitment to make an interim pay award.  There should be a commitment that if the commission does not report within six months claims of the nursing profession will not be dealt with by an answer that the commission are considering all these matters and nothing can be done until it has reported. The Minister should give us an inkling on that matter and help allay the well-grounded fears of the profession who have been badly done by over the years. Admittedly, a lot of this may have been because nurses were too mild in their approach and were too kind and committed to their professional calling, but as is obvious from to-day's demonstration, they can deliver.  Now that the no strike clause has been deleted from the association's articles it is clear to all concerned that this body can and will deliver the goods on behalf of its members in future, something which it has not done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> There are some details which I did not mention last night concerning the way nurses are short-changed at present.  One is what is called the overlap in my part of the country.  That relates to the change in day and night staffs.  That change takes on average about 20 minutes but it is not included in the hours of work attributed to the profession. There should be recognition of this in a definitive way.  During that time the nurses involved sort out what is to be done and exchange reports.  That is a very necessary part of their operation but they are not given any recognition in time or money for that.  The Minister could give the nurses compensation for that without waiting for any commission to report.</P>
    <P>To a large degree what we spoke about last night, and what the INO demonstration today was directed at, concerns the problems of nurses in hospitals and in homes but there is another body of nurses who are at loggerheads with the Department, the public health nurses.  That row has been going on for too long and, in view of the situation which obtains in that service, the Minister should do something to help them, apart from setting up a commission.  He might set a pattern for a more amicable situation in the future than may develop if the nursing profession are continually short-changed in relation to meal times, overlapping times, the various holidays and half-days which the staff to which they are now tied, the clerical staff and health boards, enjoy.  It is not necessary to establish a commission to set those matters right.  I will be happy if the Minister tells us that the commission is obliged to report within six months.  I hope he will tell us that in the event of that report not being presented within that period an interim payment will be made to the nurses.  I congratulate the Minister not for changing his mind but for changing the minds of the members of the Government in this regard.  I do not think the Minister's mind had to be changed because he was in sympathy with these demands. However, he had to use his best persuasion to encourage his colleagues in Government to make the offer that has been made by way of a commission.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a former member of the nursing profession&mdash;and indeed as a patient too at one time after a serious car accident&mdash;I feel I am fairly qualified to speak on this matter.  The nursing profession has been looked upon as the cinderella profession of this country.  Dedication and vocation are being exploited.  Nurses have to work non-social hours.  Any of us who were in hospital will realise that nurses come on duty at 8 o'clock at night when other people are either preparing for bed or for a night out.  They work from 8 o'clock at night until 8 o'clock in the morning, and I mean work.  Very often during that period they hardly get time for a meal.  It depends on whether they have busy nights or not.  They are not even sure of their mealtime.</P>
      <P>Every section of the community, without exception, are high in their praise for nurses and the nursing profession. Nurses are said to be considerate and compassionate and must be in a position to reassure their patients at all times.  Yet when it comes to translating this praise and appreciation into financial reward for good services rendered, the praising community is found wanting.  Do we realise that the salary for nurses does not measure up to the responsibility of their profession?  We must remember the nurses have not taken this action lightly.  They have taken it not so much from a selfish point of view as from their concern for the patients under their care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" />
      <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 September 1978 published a report in regard to overcrowding in hospitals.  It was urged that committees be established to examine overcrowding.  The report said that serious overcrowding in Irish hospitals led the Irish Nurses' Organisation to resolve, at its annual meeting in Bundoran, that special committees should be set up immediately in all hospitals to examine admissions and discharge policies and to ensure adequate space and staff for the proper care of patients.  This is very serious, much more so in geriatric homes than in hospitals.  I was speaking to some nurses from a geriatric hospital and they tell me there is one nurse to every eight patients.  If this is patient care I do not know what to say because we all know the type of patient to be found in geriatric hospitals.  They may be heavy patients; they are aged and possibly suffering from strokes and various other ailments and they need a good deal of nursing care and attention. This cannot be done with one nurse for every eight patients.  As a result the wards are understaffed and nurses attend extra patients without any increase in staff levels.  Then people talk of productivity deals.  How can one count the work of nurses?</P>
    <P>I will give one instance where nurses are exploited.  Good Friday is an official bank holiday with all the health boards and with local authority offices with the exception of the nurses.  Nurses too have a 40 hour week but sometimes they may be in their place of work for at least 48 hours per week.  Their mealtime is counted as off duty time whereas in other walks of life mealtime is included in the working hours.  This is very unfair.</P>
    <P>I am sure too the Minister recognises the educational qualifications and the standard requirements on recruitment, the long period of training and the final qualifications.  The high degree of responsibility and the professional proficiency often exceeds that of the doctor.  By virtue of the fact that the nurses are always on hand they are the strongest link in the health services here. The large amount of money provided by the Exchequer for the provision of health <Col N="1672" /> services would in no way serve as a substitute for the vocation and the dedication of the nursing staff.</P>
    <P>Why on earth did the Minister have to-wait to be pressurised?  Is it because of dissention within the Cabinet or in his own party?  Why was this commission not set up before now?  Over 200 nurses from the North Western Health Board area held a meeting in the region on 7 November 1978 and the meeting called on the Minister for Health to respond to the Irish Nurses' Organisation's demand for the establishment of a special inquiry into nurses' pay and related conditions. Unfortunately, the Minister left this noble profession no alternative but to take the distasteful step of organising this protest march here in town today. The nurses, in their time off, came from north, south, east and west carrying banners of all kinds.</P>
    <P>Patients are never neglected; nurses are.  Some of them carried banners with &ldquo;Overworked, underpaid&rdquo; and others carried &ldquo;Action now, less talk&rdquo; while more carried different references to &ldquo;Charlie's Angels&rdquo; and so forth.  We have now the spectacle of a reluctant Minister being forced into something which he is obviously not in favour of. He is supposed to have made a comment after one of the nurses's rallies throughout the country that they could walk and wear the soles off their shoes but he was not giving in one inch to the nurses.  It is only fair that the Minister should be given a chance to deny this statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> I want to sound a word of warning at this stage.  Though the proposal to establish the commission of inquiry, which I hope will deal with the findings, is welcome, I earnestly hope that our nurses will not have to wait three or four years before the findings of this commission are acted on.  Will the Minister now tell us when the commission will sit and when he expects to have the report of their findings?  Perhaps, as Deputy Blaney said earlier, an interim report might help to expedite the implementation of some of the findings.  I cannot emphasise strongly enough that this is a very urgent matter and nothing less than urgent treatment of the nurses' complaints will suffice.</P>
    <P>I hope the proposal to establish a commission will not meet with the same fate as another proposal which emanated from this Department concerning my constituency.  At the moment a working party are dealing with general nursing, but apparently they cannot discuss salaries or pay claims.  This is disgraceful at this time when nurses should have some way of determining their salaries.  Their work is so close to the medical profession that I feel their salaries should be tied to that profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I need to say that it is my belief that one of the most valuable assets we have in the country in providing a health service for our people is the unrivalled qualities of our nursing profession. It would be grievously irresponsible for any Minister for Health or any health administrator at any level not to recognise that central fact.  The standards, traditions, devotion and the competence of our nurses are matters whose value to the health and welfare of our people now and in the past cannot be measured accurately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be an important element of health policy in this country to ensure that the spirit, the tradition and the standard of excellence of the nursing profession will be maintained and strengthened and that the profession as a whole, and each individual member of the profession, is encouraged, helped and sustained in every way to preserve those <Col N="1674" /> qualities.  Any assistance we can provide for that important task must be awarded a priority in the administration of our health services.</P>
    <P>When I assumed office as Minister for Health I set myself a working principle, a guideline, which was that I would try to administer the health services in partnership with the medical, the nursing and the para-medical professions, that I would try to run the Department on the greatest achievable level of co-operation with those on whom the practical operation and implementation of health policies would devolve.  That, to me, seemed an essential thing for success. Indeed, it seemed to me to be the only way to achieve the best results.  Following on that principle I arranged meetings with the organisations which represent the different professions working in the health services.</P>
    <P>Among the very first I met was the Irish Nurses' Organisation.  I wanted to hear from them at first hand an outline of their situation as they saw it, what their problems were, what their possibilities were, and a general indication of the situation as it confronts the nursing profession in Ireland today.  I met the Irish Nurses' Organisation representatives on 6 October 1977 and I had a very full and friendly discussion with them.  In the course of that conversation I asked them to tell me about the matters which were of concern to them.  They raised the following matters; the need for more expert nursing advice inside the Department of Health, the need to have a nursing presence in the planning of our new hospitals, in particular Beaumont hospital, the need to maintain the impetus in the development of the public health nursing service and training programme for public health nurses, the appointment of a nurse as a member of the Hospital Joint Services Board, an expert nurse in midwifery nursing to the working party on general nursing, and the need to give an impetus to the establishment of the advisory committee on nurse training under the EEC nurse directive.</P>
    <P>Those are the five main issues they raised and discussed with me on that occasion as being of concern to them. Every one of those matters has been at <Col N="1675" /> tended to.  In particular the three extra posts in the Department of Health will be filled in a matter of weeks.  I believe that possibly now and in the long term, though it might not appear of any real value or significance to the young nurses who marched today, those who are in charge of the profession see those appointments in the policy formulating sections of the Department of Health as the most important thing to arise out of the meeting of 6 October.  We also discussed in a general way the question of overcrowding and understaffing.  Since that meeting I have appointed 750 extra nurses to the health service.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the subject of pay and to refer briefly to a number of things that were said here last night. There is only one phrase that comes to my mind in this connection and that is &ldquo;crocodile tears&rdquo;.  When I hear Fine Gael Deputies weeping for the nurses, demanding this and that in the area of pay, I am very conscious of the fact, as is every other expert in the staff relations field, that the major cause of trouble to-day, the major cause of the backlog in the nursing profession today, is the restriction on any special salary increases imposed by Deputy Richie Ryan as Minister for Finance throughout 1975 and 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to this moment the debate has proceeded without interruption. Towards the end of 1977 it became clear that the case which the nurses had put forward for equal pay was not going to succeed.  My advisers and I immediately <Col N="1676" /> foresaw that that was going to give rise to a great deal of trouble within the profession.  It was going to come as a serious disappointment to them.  We immediately went to work.  We invited the Irish Nurses' Organisation to come and see us and in co-operation with them we embarked on a process whereby a new claim was immediately submitted to the conciliation and arbitration machinery, expedited through that machinery and eventually agreed at 15 per cent, which was to have effect as to half from June 1977, a half of the remainder from January next and a half of the remainder from June next.  Although I understand his sympathy in this matter, Deputy Blaney is not correct when he says that this 15 per cent was the result of a claim which had been submitted many years ago.  This 15 per cent arose out of positive action on our part in co-operation with the INO to provide some measure of compensation to the profession for the failure of their claim for equal pay.  Deputy Blaney also referred to the possibility of interim increases. There will be another part of that on 1 January and another on 1 June.</P>
      <P>Following my meeting on 6 October and the agreed settlement, I was justifiably under the impression that in so far as the general nursing profession was concerned the decks were clear, that there was nothing outstanding on my plate.  When the INO went to their annual general meeting in Sligo on 23 September there was nothing outstanding between the profession and me at that time.  However, that meeting made it clear that there were strong feelings in the profession about pay and conditions.  It is my belief that the strength of that expression on the floor of the meeting in Sligo took many people by surprise, apart from myself.  However it will have to be recognised that it was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feeling has been expressed, in this House, at the meeting in Sligo and has been building up ever since, that nurses are underpaid, underprivileged, overworked and exploited.  Many people feel that they are overworked and underpaid but nurses are probably more highly thought of than the rest of us. How often do we hear the feeling expressed <Col N="1677" /> that we are not giving our nurses a fair deal, that they are not being paid commensurate with their responsibilities and the general exigencies of the profession? I know that that feeling exists.  It is impossible to resist that feeling, but how are we to decide levels of pay for the nursing profession.  I do not think that anybody in this House could attempt to decide them.  How are we to compensate nurses for their responsibilities in the long hours of the night when a crisis arises and they have no one to turn to and have to rely on their experience and training?  How are we to compensate a nurse for suddenly being asked to work another five or six hours at the end of a long tedious tour of duty?  How are we to compensate a nurse for dealing with difficult patients?  How are we to decide the appropriate level of remuneration for this profession?  Fortunately, I do not have to decide these things because I am not in a position to do so.  There are procedures for deciding them.  There is conciliation and arbitration machinery and the Labour Court.  I believe that these procedures are regarded as satisfactory by some officials and some experts on the staff relations side of the health services and the profession.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the sequence of events, because Deputy Boland made an effort last night to indicate that I had been patronising or discourteous to the INO.  Following the telegram, I received a long reasonable letter from the general secretary of the organisation.  I replied to that letter indicating that, in my view and in the view of the Government, the best way for the nurses to pursue their legitimate interests was through the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  That is a legitimate point of view to hold.  I know that some representatives of the staff association in the nursing profession hold that view.  I was not patronising to the nurses.  Anybody reading the general secretary's letter to me and my reply would acknowledge that it was a friendly, courteous and co-operative exchange of views.  However, the general secretary of the INO wrote to me that, despite the fact that the conciliation and arbitration machinery was there&mdash;the nurses organisation had supported the conciliation and arbitration machinery <Col N="1678" />&mdash;they felt that in the present circumstances there was a need for a commission of inquiry and that they wanted to discuss the matter with me.  I immediately arranged to meet the INO and discuss their proposal with them.  I do not think by any terms of industrial or staff relations or public administration that that series of exchanges could be described as anything but friendly, helpful and co-operative on my part.</P>
    <P>Last Monday I met the representative of the Irish Nurses Organisation.  We had a long discussion and I proposed that we would establish a commission of inquiry which would deal with the basic fault they found in the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  The fault they found was that when they went to pursue a claim for the profession through the conciliation and arbitration machinery, there were no standards to guide them.  I proposed that we set up an independent commission immediately to establish standards which will be the basis on which all future negotiations for pay and claims can be considered and which at the same time will look into all the relativities inside the general nursing profession and relativities between general nursing and the other professions involved.  I believe that this proposition is receiving favourable consideration from the nurses.</P>
    <P>There is one difficulty about this and it is in regard to the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  At present before the conciliation and arbitration process there are ten matters of importance to the nursing profession in process of discussion. Those matters are working hours, incremental credit for service, responsibility allowance, standardisation of annual leave, increased annual leave, student nurses' salaries, general nurses' salaries, shift pay, rostering and career structures.  The problem is to set up a commission which will endeavour to establish and identify the standards, criteria and principles for the nursing profession for future negotiations which will not interfere with these legitimate claims which are before the conciliation and arbitration procedure at the moment and which are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Another aspect has to be teased out. There is a working party going on at the <Col N="1679" /> moment which was established in response to the demand of the nursing profession.  Their terms of reference were in effect written by the nursing profession. Perhaps they have been slower in their operation than many people might have wished but they have done an enormous amount of good work since their establishment.  That work and the results which they have produced so far have to be co-ordinated with this new commission.</P>
    <P>These matters have to be teased out in consultation and discussion immediately between myself and the Irish Nurses Organisation but there are other bodies which represent our nurses.  There is the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, the Workers' Union of Ireland and the Local Government and Public Services Union.  I indicated to the Irish Nurses Organisation on Monday that I would have to discuss this proposal for a commission with these bodies too, because they have a legitimate interest on behalf of their members on anything that is proposed for the nursing profession. I met the representatives of those bodies this morning and we had a long and useful discussion about the problems, and in particular about the problems of overlapping between the conciliation and arbitration claims which are going through at the moment and the work of the working party.  From that discussion I can be reasonably confident that these problems can be ironed out and that this commission can go ahead and do the job I proposed for them.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference put forward by me for consideration at this stage are as follows: to investigate and establish the standards that apply to general nurses, psychiatric nurses and para-medical staffs in the areas of educational requirements and recruitment, training and final qualifications, responsibility and professional proficiency; to examine the relative grading levels obtaining within these professions and to make recommendations in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>In response to particular questions put to me from the House I want to say there will be no delay about establishing this commission.  I visualise that its establishment would be a matter of weeks. <Col N="1680" /> The nurses suggested that the commission be given a period of six months in which to report.  I would expect them to report in a much shorter period&mdash;within three months.</P>

      <P>My objective would be to get this commission established with satisfactory terms of reference to the different staff organisations concerned within a matter of weeks and to give them an outside deadline of six months, as suggested by the nurses organisation, but with very strict indications that we would prefer them to report much sooner.  I know the matters which are of concern to the nursing profession&mdash;hours of work, overcrowding, accommodation, changing techniques and evolving responsibility of the nurse&mdash;that is something the commission would have to look at very carefully. The whole basis of the nursing profession has changed.  Nurses are now being asked to undertake responsibility which in the past was quite unknown to them.  They are being asked to take responsibility for increasingly complex equipment and machinery in hospitals. There are 101 small things in the routine running administration of a hospital that upset nurses and cause them inconvenience, frustration and anger far out of proportion to the matters concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to continue to maintain amicable, friendly co-operative relations with the nursing profession.  I place a very high value on that relationship.  I want to reject as a gross travesty of what has happened any suggestion in this House that I have either by act of omission or commission done anything to impair that relationship.  Exactly the opposite is the case.  I have placed myself entirely at the disposal of the Irish Nurses Organisation and the other staff relations organisations.  So far I have met every demand they have made.  That is something to be able to claim, and I will continue to do that.  I deeply resent any attempts by Deputies, for party political purposes, to try to upset the good friendly, amicable working <Col N="1681" /> relationship which I have with the nursing profession.  I have far too high a regard for the nursing profession to let anything like that happen.  It is not going to happen.  I did not have to become Minister for Health to develop an appreciation and regard for the vocation of nursing.  I was aware of it, I appreciated and developed that understanding long before I became Minister for Health out of my own personal experience.</P>
    <P>I know that the general body of nurses are agitated, upset and angry. That is a perfectly legitimate mood for any profession to be in and they are entitled to give expression to it.  I accept that.</P>
    <P>At this stage we have to go back to the drawing board and look at all the procedures which are there to enable nurses to give expression to their grievances, complaints and legitimate demands.  I want to reiterate that the establishment of this commission will in no way impede any claim before conciliation and arbitration for an increase in pay.  Any of the organisations in the nursing profession can go tomorrow morning and lodge a claim before conciliation and arbitration for any amount they wish.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, by the time that claim came to be processed, the report of this commission would be available to assist everybody concerned in processing the claim.  This commission will be established immediately.  It will settle the criteria, the basis, the principles on which these matters can be dealt with for the foreseeable future.  It will report quickly.  I think the report will be satisfactory and will enable us to deal comprehensively and <i>de novo</i> with pay scales, grades and conditions and all the things worrying the nursing profession and causing them to be angry and agitated.  That is my intention and if this does not work we will try something else and I will keep working at this problem until appropriate machinery and solutions are provided for the nursing profession because, as much as any Deputy on the other side of the House, I believe they are entitled to that.</P>

      <P>The necessity for action of the sort we have seen today by this very highly-skilled professional body providing the single most important service human beings can provide for each other serves to underscore and bring into focus the very strange set of values which govern our lives in society.  This set of values is tolerated by governments, politicians and leaders of public opinion.  It highlights the hypocrisy in our society which, while professing to cherish and stand in awe of the wonderful service performed for humanity by nurses, persistently refuses to reward that service by paying salaries in proportion to and providing conditions of employment commensurate with the values they profess.  This situation did not begin or end in 1975 or 1976; it has been continuing right throughout life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By any reasonable assessment of the <Col N="1683" /> relative value of individual jobs, nursing must rank very high indeed.  We have all had enough personal or family experience of the need for nursing care and skills which nurses possess to set our priorities right in that regard.  It is to the eternal shame of all concerned that nurses have had to engage in actions culminating in the march today in order to highlight their plight.  As Deputy O'Connell said last night, nursing is predominantly a female profession.  We have tended to treat nurses in particular as we have treated women in general; we have placed them on a pedestal.  Irish society makes very unreasonable demands on those it places on pedestals. We might all recall the attitude towards nurses which we faithfully reproduced in essays at school.  Our image of the nurse was that of a person with total dedication, who was self-sacrificing, constantly cheerful and who had no personal needs of her own&mdash;if she had, she was careful to keep them very much to herself.  We looked upon her as a quite extraordinary human being and to the eternal credit of our nurses they have lived up to that image. That does not discharge us from our responsibility to pay them a decent salary.</P>
    <P>Nurses are victims of the marriage bar which applied regarding female employment generally up to 1974.  The marriage bar placed considerable limitations on all female careers and on the expectations and salary attendant on such careers.  The intervening four years have by no means wiped out that legacy and special action is needed now to do so. This is part of what the nurses are bringing to our attention today.  We are not far enough removed from the mentality which led to expressions like &ldquo;A good wage for a girl&rdquo;.  How often we have heard that in our society, regardless of the skills a girl might possess or the value of her job to society.  The case can truly be made that positive compensation is needed to make up that defect towards girls in general and in this instance towards the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>Nurses are part of a profession which was very hierarchical in its structures and traditions.  We are not too far away from the time when bells tolled the arrival <Col N="1684" /> of a hospital surgeon, the number of bells in proportion to the importance of the great man arriving.  There was a visiting line strictly in order of rank. That ridiculous position might well be said to have resulted in the situation to which Deputy Blaney referred where, in monetary terms, one doctor equals 12 nurses.  Nurses made their first monetary claim in 1972.  Doctors have never failed to flex their industrial muscle.  The fact that theirs is a vocation has never clouded that fact that it is also a highly-skilled, vital profession and should be paid accordingly.  We can take it that from now on nurses will be treated in the same manner.</P>
    <P>The basis on which a nurse's salary has been built was the amount needed to sustain a nurse.  There has been no regard whatsoever for the skill involved. The ultimate to which a nurse might aspire today is to become matron of the average hospital.  I spoke to a matron whose take-home pay is £284 a month, less than £70 a week.  I spoke to a sister in charge of a vital kidney unit whose take-home pay is £60 a week.  Indeed, the matron of an 800-bed hospital has a maximum salary of £6,000 a year and I am not now talking about take-home pay.  That is the salary at the top of the scale and the most to which she might aspire.  We must compare that with the wages and salaries paid in top positions in industry.  What industrial job can be compared with the control of an 800-bed hospital and the lives and destinies of 800 sick people?  Ample reference has been made during the debate to salary scales right through the nursing profession and they are totally inadequate.  The Minister has accepted that.  He said that any assistance he can provide to maintain the excellence of the nursing profession must be awarded priority.  The assistance he can provide in this instance is to pay them a decent salary and he can do it now.</P>
    <P>Apart from salaries, what other group would tolerate the situation where post-graduate work must be done in their own time and at their own expense? They study in their own time and pay the fees themselves and it is their own responsibility.  At the end of that, there is no financial recognition unless they are <Col N="1685" /> utilising the particular skill or graduation qualification in their daily work.  What other group would tolerate a situation where there is no recognition of the time spent on midwifery or any other post-graduate qualification for pension purposes, unless they are employed in health board hospitals?  There is no recognition for pension purposes of the three-year training period, nor for English training and service outside the country, possibly in Third World countries.  None of these factors is taken into account for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>There is no credit in holiday allowances for the seven-day week and the round-the-clock service they provide. There is no laundry or uniform allowance. They are given something like a £75 a year tax free allowance which works out at about £25 per year in hard cash.  There is no provision for occupational diseases which must be a real hazard in this profession above all others.  Nursing is not taken very seriously by any of us as a life career. There is no incentive to improve qualifications in an era when nursing has become a very highly specialised and sophisticated profession.</P>
    <P>Reference was made this evening to county hospitals.  The Minister referred to an additional complement of nurses, but county hospitals are still grossly over-crowded and under-staffed.  The ratio of nurses to patients is calculated not so much on the individual needs of patients as on the number of patients per nurse, regardless of the nursing needs of the individual patient.  The ratio of tutors to sisters is one to 30 in Ireland and, in one hospital in Cork, it is something like one to 100, whereas the ratio in other EEC countries is one to 15.  The wage structure in all other countries is far better than it is here.  We might take England as the exception.  In England there has been a tendency to exploit Irish nurses and Third World nurses and that is not the pattern on which we want to model our pay structures.  We are very much behind the type of facilities and wage structures provied for nurses in the other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> We have tended to downgrade, under-value and under-rate the work done by nurses.  The daily routine for nurses is very demanding.  There is the assessment of patients' needs, the planning of the daily care of patients, the execution of doctors' orders, the teaching of students on the wards, and nurses also have to deal with the public.  The Minister quite rightly made the point that nurses have public goodwill but, strangely, we do not put our money where our mouths are all the time.  The public do not really see what nurses do. They usually see the wards during visiting time which, by arrangement, is the time of least activity in the wards.  It has been organised that way to facilitate visitors.  While having a high appreciation of the service nurses are providing, the public do not really see the work they do.  Visiting is organised to facilitate visitors and the comfort of patients.</P>
    <P>A case has been made for a considerable immediate improvement in salaries for nurses.  It has been made by all speakers and I think it has been conceded by the Minister.  I do not think the commission the Minister has promised, and which he has told us this evening he intends to set up, meets the case.  The Minister mentioned roughly the terms of reference of the commission which I jotted down as he was talking.  He talked about education, training, professional proficiency, grading levels, but is there any reference to pay structures or pay relativity?  If there is, the Minister did not mention it this evening.  I want to ask the Minister across the floor of the House will this commission deal with pay structures and pay relativity?</P>

      <P>We have been highly sceptical about the setting up of this commission.  Up to a point, it was accepted by nurses as a step in the right direction, but they too expressed the scepticism we all feel.  It is merited by the Minister's silence.  Our scepticism is very well founded indeed.  The least the nurses expected was that the Minister would put a six months' limit on the commission. In my capacity as a politician I do not think six months is adequate as a limit on the time in which this commission should report.</P>
      <P>A commission set up in December would report in late June and the reality from a politician's point of view is that the elections will be over and the political pressure will be off in late June, and the Minister will be let off the hook. We are all politicians and we realise the strength and force of political pressure and that will be off in late June.  The Minister said he hoped the commission would report earlier.  That is no guarantee.  It might not report earlier unless specifically charged by the Minister to do so.  We have a sorry history of commissions.  Somebody talked last evening about reports of commissions piling up in the Library.  Since this Government took office 18 months ago, we had the following commissions: a commission on industrial relations, a commission on Garda pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This commission does not seem to deal with pay which puts it in a different category from the others which will all sit for longer than six months. That is the reality.  I am challenging the Minister across the floor of the House <Col N="1688" /> this evening.  He has accepted the case the nurses have made.  He has accepted that their pay scales are not commensurate with the value of the work they do.  I am asking the Minister to substantiate that by giving an interim payment on account to nurses now, not in six months' time.  There are several aspects which must be dealt with by a commission. There are several anomalies which must be dealt with by a commission, but the need for more pay has been substantiated and there was no answer to that.  I am asking the Minister by way of supplementary budget in 1978 to give us the money to pay the nurses now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to underline the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's response.  We know from long political experience in this House, and I know from watching Deputy Haughey over the past ten years, that he is a consummate political manipulator in the <Col N="1689" /> parliamentary sense.  We had a classic example this evening of a rather delicious and charming double bluff. That bluff has been called by my colleague, Deputy Desmond.  I took very careful note of the Minister's statement when he referred roughly speaking to the terms of reference of the commission or committee&mdash;this peculiar hybrid animal. We do not even know who the members of the commission are; we do not know whether the INO or the ITGWU or the WUI will be represented on it.</P>
      <P>Apparently the consultations about the commission are not yet completed. The Minister has said it may include training, that it will probably include education and that it will certainly deal with professional proficiency.  Then he used the words &ldquo;and grading levels&rdquo;. What precisely is meant by those words?  Do they mean merely a structural analysis in terms of job description and appropriate relativities with, say, psychiatric nursing levels or with other levels in the public service or do they mean a real in-depth examination of the actual pay relativities and pay structures of the nursing profession within the context as understood by the Department of Health advisers in the personal division of the Department.</P>
      <P>If that is so, the Minister should confirm this but if it is not so we would implore him to include at least in the terms of reference the request of the INO that their pay levels be investigated and that a recommendation be brought forward. The Minister has said that the report may be used in subsequent conciliation and arbitration negotiations.  As a former trade union official who had contact for a long time with the Public Services Committee of the ICTU I know exactly what the Minister means when he uses that vocabulary.  Therefore, I ask him to clarify precisely during the next few days what is meant by the terms of reference of this commission.  If pay relativities and structures are not included the Minister will have to do something more than merely giving nurses a few cups of tea and some biscuits in his room.  We want bread not circuses of either commissions or committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> The Minister has been very critical of both Labour and Fine Gael.  I agree that successive Ministers having responsibility for the public service down through the years have been hypocritical in this area.  Indeed, this is an accusation that can be levelled at all of us in that we neglected to ensure that the nursing profession were remunerated sufficiently for the services they rendered.  I note that the Minister for Finance has been absent during this debate although in the final analysis he will be the one to foot the bill.  We failed to recognise duly the conditions of employment to which nurses were entitled.  Perhaps they were more entitled to reasonable conditions than were other groups, ourselves included. Therefore, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare must discharge his responsibility in this regard.  I am not convinced that he has done so this evening. I have no wish to score political points but I urge the Minister to broaden the terms of reference and to appoint to the commission representatives of the trade union, and of the public service as well as conciliation and arbitration people as was the case in relation to the Garda.  In that way we would at least get the commission off the ground in the best way possible rather than having them begin in a cloud of ambiguity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had occasion before to refer to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare as being similar to a three-card-trick man.  If ever there was an example of a public audience being invited to find the lady, the lady being pay, we have it here this evening in the Minister's speech because nowhere in that cleverly disguised and adroit use of words by which we have come to know the Minister, has there been any undertaking or even any hint that the nurses would be one penny better off as a result of the establishment of this so-called commission of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening Deputy Gerard Brady, speaking for Fianna Fáil, said that this debate is not just about conditions and pay.  It is about conditions and pay as our motion states clearly in calling on the Government to establish a commission of inquiry into the remuneration and conditions of employment of the <Col N="1691" /> nursing profession.  Set out are certain criteria by which those levels of pay should be judged.  Yesterday the Minister tabled his amendment asking merely that the Dáil welcomes the recent decision to establish a commission of inquiry, the terms of reference of which we heard nothing until the Minister read them quickly into the record during his statement to the House this evening. There is no mention whatever in those terms of reference of pay, of cash on the table, the issue which this debate is all about.  It is what the nurses' request for a commission is all about and they will not settle for anything else.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that he understood that prior to the AGM of the INO this year the decks were cleared.  As a result of the Minister's contribution, not only have the decks not been cleared but the scene has been set whereby the Minister has invited himself to walk the plank because he has clearly and deliberately engaged in a cynical exercise in public relations, an exercise designed to convince the nursing profession that he was setting up a commission to improve their pay levels and conditions of service.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference are to investigate and establish standards that apply to general nurses, psychiatric nurses and para-medical staff in the area of educational requirements and recruitment, training and final qualifications, responsibility and professional proficiency, to examine the relative grading levels obtaining within these professions and to make recommendations in relation to these matters.  There is not a word in those terms of reference of pay, of cash.  The reference to educational requirements, to training and qualifications and to grading levels are exactly the same as the terms of reference of the working party on nursing set up more than three years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister has taken the criteria from our motion and from the petition of the INO on which it was requested that pay levels and conditions of service be based and has set <Col N="1692" /> them out in the terms of reference of the commission but he has scrubbed all reference to money or to conditions of service.  In other words he is rendering powerless the commission in terms of their making specific recommendations as to how the pay and conditions of service of nurses are to be improved. Further, he expects the nurses to agree to that.</P>
      <P>In addition the Minister went on cleverly in his general wrapping of the candy floss around this insubstantial core, to make vague generalities about how he would like to see improved the pay level of nurses.  He did this in the hope that nurses would be deceived into thinking that they would have an opportunity of seeing their relevant and real position improved in relation to other groups as a result of this commission. There is no way that this commission will be in the position of delivering the goods.  They will not be in a position to recommend cash on the table.  Yesterday we saw the likelihood of this when we read the Minister's amendment and, consequently, Deputy Burke tabled another amendment suggesting that the commission referred to by the Minister should have written into their terms of reference an enquiry into the remuneration and conditions of employment of the nursing profession.  Is the Minister prepared to accept that amendment?</P>

      <P>There are only three cards.  It is a question of &ldquo;find the lady&rdquo; but there is no money involved.  I said that this has been a cynical exercise in public relations.  We all accept that the Minister is an expert practictioner in the art of public relations.  I warned yesterday that he is operating the politics of brinkmanship as far as the nursing profession is concerned.  You can go only a certain distance along that road <Col N="1693" /> and then the harsh reality meets you. The harsh reality was in Molesworth Street and Kildare Street to-day.  It came from every part of Ireland and it was the voice of the Irish nurses&mdash;not just the young nurses to whom the Minister condescendingly referred&mdash;which was heard outside the House to-day.  There were the young and the young in heart.  They were all there and the Members of this House met them, which the Minister did not.  Obviously the entire matter seems to be a source of humour to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also blandly, in his reformist way, said that his letter to the nurses was helpful.  They asked for a commission of inquiry and he replied to them in a letter dated 31 October the final paragraph of which said: &ldquo;I cannot see that an inquiry of the nature demanded is necessary.  I would suggest that you should continue to work for the well-being of your members through the medium of the established and well-tried procedures available&rdquo;.  Is that helpful and not condescending?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not teaching your grandmother how to suck eggs?  Is that not telling the general secretary of a national organisation how to go about her business?  The Minister says the letter was not condescending.  The Minister's letter is clearly in the tones of somebody speaking down in schoolteacher fashion to a group of unruly pupils who were annoying him and who are not prepared to accept what he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says there is no problem. If there are no problems how is it that resolutions filling an entire page were passed at the annual meeting of the INO relating to the conditions of nursing? The Minister's amendment asks the House to note the improvement in the conditions and status of nurses since this Government came into power.  Yet the <Col N="1694" /> nurses are deploring the overcrowding, calling for a solution to the problem of escort duties, suggesting that facilities be made available to nurses to attend refresher courses, suggesting that nurses who undertake special courses should not have to revert to first year staff nurse salary level, suggesting that a realistic pay policy be formulated, and recommending that the present practice in some hospitals where staff nurses are allocated theatre duties without adequate training be eliminated.  I could go on and on.  The journal <i>Nursing</i> of November/December 1978 devotes the whole of page 5 to these resolutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister tabled an amendment asking the House to accept the idea that the status and the working conditions of nurses have been improved.  That is as big a con trick as suggesting that the commission of inquiry is going to make recommendations into the levels of pay and conditions of service of the nursing profession.  This is just not on and it is not going to work.  This party made it clear some weeks ago that we had examined the nurses' case and that we were in favour of their call for a commission of inquiry which would recommend on proper levels of pay and conditions of service in recognition of the work which nurses perform, their unsocial hours, the basic and post-graduate training they have to undergo, and their contribution to society.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues would do well to heed that this is one of the few groups remaining in Irish society where there is still a spirit of public service, where people are still prepared to give above what they are obliged to give.  This spirit has been leaving Irish life largely because of the &ldquo;I am all right, Jack&rdquo; attitude fostered by the Minister's party. That spirit still obtains on that Public Gallery tonight but it is not going to continue in the face of the cynicism that we heard this evening with the attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of 14,000 people&mdash;14,000 people who are providing an invaluable service for Irish society&mdash;in relation to a valid claim for recognition of their work and service and for treatment as equals in comparison with other people who do less work for more pay in shorter hours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> This has been nothing but a whitewash operation.  There is no commission here who are going to improve the lot of the nurses.  In this, as in his earlier attempts to deal with the nurses, the Minister has displayed the politics of brinkmanship.  The joint agreement went to the arbitrator two days before the nurses threatened to march.  The Minister agreed to the arbitrator's terms two days before the annual general meeting of the INO.  Ostensibly, the Minister changed his mind&mdash;now we discover that he did not really change his mind at all&mdash;about the setting up of a commission of inquiry two days before the nurses marched here today and the day before our motion was taken here in the House.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the INO and the fact that their members are prepared now to see this matter through to finality are at last going to ensure that the Irish nurse and her role in society will be recognised.  <i>The Irish Press</i> in its editorial today said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...while the edge has already been taken off their protest by the decision of the Minister for Health, Mr. Haughey, to set up a special commission of inquiry into their claims,</P>
    <P>I wonder if they will say that in tomorrow morning's editorial&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> the march will still serve the very useful purpose of allowing the profession to put before the general public its deeply felt sense of grievance.</P>
    <P>If I were a nurse I would feel a deeper sense of grievance, having marched here today and attended in this House and heard the Minister's cynical attempt to deceive the members of the nursing profession in what they were getting. This party have endeavoured, since we first discussed and decided on our attitude to this matter, to see that the legitimate claims of the nurses were pursued in the fairest possible way.  Last Sunday night I issued a statement calling on the Minister to accept the claims and the terms of the INO prior to their march as an indication of his good faith. I warned that, if he did not, the consequences must be his responsibility.  I warn again that the responsibility for the consequences of deciding here this evening to set up a whitewash job and not a commission to award more money and better conditions of service to the nurses rests upon the shoulders of the Minister for Health and his colleagues in Government.  We are not prepared to let them away with it and we intend to indicate that through our voting here this evening.</P>

One of the children is at present accommodated on the service to Ballykilmurray on a concessionary basis, but as the bus in question is carrying a capacity load it is not possible to give similar facilities to the other children at present.  The position is being kept under review and every effort will be made to facilitiate them as soon as possible.</P>
