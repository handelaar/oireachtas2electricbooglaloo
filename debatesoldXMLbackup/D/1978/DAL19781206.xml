      <P>Could I ask the Tánaiste, as I did yesterday, is it intended to sit in Christmas week and if not what <Col N="716" /> arrangements will be made?  As well as a debate on the disastrous results of the EMS negotiations will there be the normal Adjournment Debate?  Apart from the difficulties which we are now in, internationally, in connection with the EEC, there are very many matters of Government responsibility of a domestic nature which need to be debated in the House before the recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Ignoring the Deputy's instant reaction and comment on an episode which is not yet finished, he will be aware that it has been planned to have a debate which, as of now, I understand would include an Adjournment Debate and a debate on the EMS.  I am not quite sure what the current state of play is in regard to discussions between the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there was any agreement that there would be an Adjournment Debate that could include discussions on the EMS. As I understand it, and as has been confirmed by the Tánaiste in his reply to Deputy Barry, the Government are offering a separate debate on the EMS.  I am concerned that that will not exclude the normal Adjournment Debate which could deal with matters of Government responsibility in the domestic, economic and social field.</P>

The real issue is that we will have adequate time to discuss separately the EMS outcome and the Adjournment Debate.  What time is fixed for that discussion is a matter for the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the adjournment of the debate the last day I was replying to a point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick on subsection (5) of section 1 which provides that in the case of domestic and mixed properties, secondary schools and community halls the determining use as regards eligibility for rates relief in any year shall be the use ordinarily made of the property at the time of the making of the rate.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was concerned that this might be open to abuse. He felt it might be possible for the occupier of, say, a mixed property to use it entirely as a dwelling for only a week or <Col N="720" /> two before the striking of the rate and in this way he might qualify for full rates relief.  The advice available to me is that the force of the qualification &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; will not allow this advantage to be taken by anyone.  The relevant use of the property at the time of the making of the rate must be its ordinary or established use.  If it can be demonstrated that a use was only temporary, this will not count for the purposes of assessing the entitlement of a premises to rates relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am obliged to the Minister for his explanation and I am glad to see him back hale and hearty and ready for the day's work.  I appreciate what the Minister says about the use of the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo;, but it is the ordinary use at a particular time and the subsection contains no mention of temporary use.  It would be very hard to dispute that a building was not being ordinarily used for the purpose of a dwelling house if it were so used for a month or several weeks before the striking of the rate and if the entire building were occupied.  It would clearly qualify for rate exemption because that would be the ordinary use of the building at the time.  The subsection states &ldquo;immediately prior to the making by the rating authority of the rate&rdquo;.  That is the time at which the test is to apply.  If it were used as a domestic dwelling for two or three weeks before the striking of the rate I think it would qualify.  I am fairly satisfied that this definition is open to abuse and I would go so far as to say it is wide open to abuse.  The Minister and his advisers should take another look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis should be on the use of the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; because the ordinary use of a building is not the use made of it for a week or two before the striking of the rate or any time during the year.  That could not be interpreted as the ordinary use of a particular premises.  It could not be misinterpreted. The advice available to me satisfies me that the possibility of this kind of abuse is eliminated.  The emphasis is on the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I wish to refer to subsection (6).  This provides that a person can build a house, which may be as big or as expensive as he likes, and have as many out-offices or garages as he desires, provided it is all part of the same hereditament and provided all the buildings are rated together.  A person owning an old house may decide to build a new one, retaining the old buildings for garage purposes or for use as domestic out-offices.  If the original buildings were separately rated, as they would be if not built at the same time, then if the valuation exceeds £2 they will not qualify for exemption from rating.  I should like the Minister's observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be a limit of £2 valuation.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister does not get the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about when they are separately valued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): If a person builds a house costing £100,000 and has very elaborate out-buildings and a garage, all the buildings would be rated at the same time and would be described as &ldquo;a dwelling house, garage and out-offices&rdquo;.  In an extreme case the valuation could be £200 and it would still be exempt from rates.  If a person avails of an old building or erects a second building some years after the original dwelling, unless the valuation of the second building is under £2 it will be subject to rates.  That is not equitable.  A much more elaborate building could escape rates because it was rated as one unit.  If out-buildings are built some time after the dwelling house and for that reason are separately rated they will be subject to rates if the valuation is in excess of £2.  I think that is not the Minister's intention and he should change this provision. <Col N="722" /> In a city or town a building can very easily attract a valuation in excess of £2.  I hope the Minister understands the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Deputy refers to a case in which a man extends his premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The additional structure need not be part of the original.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be built near the original structure.  There is nothing to stop a man applying to have his existing valuation extended to cover that and if it is a reasonable case the Valuation Office will possibly comply.  He can apply to have his valuation revised in view of the extra structure and he would be exempt if the Valuation Office put it in the one hereditament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The subsection as drafted visualises a dwelling house and separate building.  It visualises in some cases the separate building being used in conjunction with the dwelling house and if that building is to escape rates the valuation must be under £2.  As the definition stands, if the building, however elaborate, is built at the same time as the dwelling or is included in the valuation of the principal hereditament, then it will escape rates.  That is unfair and the Minister should consider changing it. The test should be whether the building which is not the dwelling is used as a domestic out-office.  If it is used as a domestic out-office or a domestic dwelling it should be exempt.  Recently, I read about houses costing £60,000 each which are to be built in the city and the families who would occupy these were referred to as two-car families.  These houses will have elaborate garages, and probably houses for garden tools and so on and they will all be exempt because the out-offices will be built at the same time.  If somebody builds a dwelling house and uses the old dwelling house as an out-office he may not be exempt, so that is not a fair test.  The test should be if the ancillary buildings are being used as domestic out-offices, and if they are they should be exempt.</P>

    <Col N="723" />
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases such as those referred to by the Deputy if the out-offices are very extensive and do not appear as belonging to or usually enjoyed together with the existing buildings the practice is that the Valuation Office values them separately.  Usually extensions such as out-offices in an ordinary house are not very large, but if they are exceptionally large the Valuation Office puts a separate valuation on them in order to ensure that they are not derated where a person is not genuinely entitled to derating.  We believe the system will work this way but if it does not we will see what can be done about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Fitzpatrick's arguments and I wonder if the Minister could explain why subsection 6 is there in the first place.  If a hereditament is defined as a dwelling and if any extension such as an out-office is put on to it which is clearly benefiting the dwelling as a dwelling, I cannot see what the purpose of this section is. Perhaps the Minister would clarify why subsection 6 and indeed subsection 7 are there, in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Because in many places in the cities and towns as the Deputy is probably aware garages belonging for instance to terraced houses are far removed from the dwelling house and they would require a separate valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled.  I understood that in relation to business premises the domestic end is exempt and the business premises are rated.  Would not the same thing apply in this case? Unless the house had a business of some sort is it not derated?  Because out-offices are derated, whether there is a valuation on them or not, if they are not used for a business of some sort, are they not derated?  I wish to be clear on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right about the business of the mixed hereditament. The business part will not be derated, but in relation to the out-offices or garages that the Deputy refers to, if <Col N="724" /> they have a separate valuation up to £2 they are derated.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): There is unfair discrimination against the person who because of lack of capital does not build his house and his out-houses at the same time.  If a man finishes the job in one act, irrespective of the extent of the garage or the outhouse, provided that the dwelling and the garage and out-buildings are all used for domestic purposes, the whole lot is derated.  But if a person builds a dwelling house and then builds a garage and out-houses, because they were not built at the same time the out-buildings are separately valued and he will have to pay rates on them if the valuation exceeds £2.  That is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why this test is applied I do not know, because what the Minister wants to ensure is that the buildings are all used in connection with the dwelling.  In the case where all are in one hereditament and all are valued together it does <Col N="725" /> not matter if there is a £1,000 valuation, they will all be rate free, under the Act, but if a person is unfortunate enough to have his valuation separated, then even if his entire valuation is quite modest he will pay rates on the garage and out-buildings. This could occur in the very case that the Minister mentioned where a man living in a terraced house with no room for expansion takes a garage down the road and the valuation of the garage is over £2 which means he will have to pay rates on the garage.</P>
    <P>That is not the spirit of this Bill or of the Minister's proposal and he should take it away and have it redrafted.  In the last subsection we were dealing with, the Minister said that because the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; was used there was no danger of abuse, there was no danger of a person changing the use of a house from a mixed premises to a dwelling in order to qualify for derating.  If the Minister believes that, he should carry that advice on into this subsection and say that all buildings ordinarily used as domestic out-offices or a garage would be rate free.  That would be a simple way of getting over the difficulty.  It is no answer for the Minister to say that the thinking behind this is to exclude elaborate buildings, because that is not the thinking or the policy behind it.  The premises may be as elaborate as one likes but as long as they have the same rating it does not matter if they should attract a valuation of, say, £200 or £500, they are rate free.  I think that some test such as &ldquo;ordinarily used&rdquo; as domestic out-offices or garage should be carried forward into subsection (6).  If that were done it would get over the problem I have in mind.</P>

      <P>We are attempting to see what loopholes may exist and how they could be closed.  Take the circumstances where a domestic garage is attached to a house in terms of ownership but not necessarily physically attached&mdash;which is really included in this section&mdash;and if that garage is subsequently rented&mdash;and therefore not ordinarily used by the residents of the primary dwelling&mdash;to another resident in the area, would rates <Col N="726" /> be then paid on it and if so would the person benefiting in terms of rent have to pay the rates or would the person paying the rent get some relief of rates in a manner equivalent to flatdwellers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with Deputy Fitzpatrick's point first, if somebody building a new house is not financially in a position to complete a structure such as a garage or fuel sheds which would be included in the original plan of almost any house and if the house is valued before he completes the buildings and he later gets a further valuation, it is usually amalgamated with the existing valuation. The buildings the Deputy speaks about are usually beside an existing house.  At most, a man would be building either a fuel shed or garage.  If he were building something more expensive say, to be let as a flat or flats, that would still be a domestic property which would be exempt from rates.  Very few garages of which I know exceed £2 in valuation even if separate.  These would be amalgamated according to the usual practice but if they were extraordinary, elaborate buildings that could not be said to be used in conjunction with the domestic purposes of the existing building it would be open to the Valuation Office to give them a separate valuation.</P>

      <P>We are talking about possible loopholes and this is the place where they should be cleared up rather than have the courts cluttered with claims as a result of them.  If somebody erects a building, a squash court or swimming pool or whatever other fad may be in the country in another few years, the point Deputy Fitzpatrick is making is that if it is all built at the one time there is no problem; if it is built subsequently and its valuation is more than £2 it is conceivable that rates will have to be paid unless&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the point I am coming to.  If the Valuation Office take it on themselves in the revaluation to amalgamate the two at the request of the owner there is no problem but as regards this legislation the Minister has no say with the Valuation Office which is not included in his ministerial functions and so is not mentioned in this context.  It is a technicality that has arisen in section 1 and perhaps now that the Minister's attention has been drawn to it he might <Col N="728" /> consider between now and Report Stage if there is any way of tightening up this so that the Valuation Office would be obliged to accept reasonable applications for the incorporation in the general valuation of projects such as this.  We are talking of minority cases but there is potential injustice involved as regards treatment.</P>

      <P>This year's experience has shown us that these problems have not arisen so far.  As regards ensuring that the Valuation Office would amalgamate the increase in valuation, that would not be a matter for this Bill but it will be necessary to amend existing valuation legislation and this matter is being examined by the Department of Finance.  If it is necessary, that will be the time to copperfasten this and that would be the Bill under which it could be done.  The practice has been to amalagamate the valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am against this on the basis that it is a hit or miss section. Some people may be completely derated; others may not.  It is not certain that it is the big buildings that will attract rates but rather the man who is not financially in a position to do a job in the first instance and has to rent a garage down the road or something like that. This is the man who may be hit, not the man who can build regardless of expense in the first instance and make an excellent job of it.  So long as he is building a dwellinghouse and domestic buildings, no matter how elaborate or expensive or extensive, they are certain to be rent free. But if another man builds a dwellinghouse and adds to it later on he may&mdash;I do not say he will&mdash;be involved in rates.  All through the discussion on this section so far we have heard too much talk about the Valuation Office being relied on to do this and that they will have this, that or the other approach. The Valuation Office should have guidelines.  I do not envy the Commissioner of Valuation and his staff their job under this Bill because they will be expected to do the work we should be doing in this House now.</P>

It may come up, but in practice it has not been a hit or miss arrangement before there was any derating.  The matter will be kept under review and the forthcoming Bill amending valuation legislation will be the opportunity to copperfasten the arrangement or ensure that nobody will be victimised as has been envisaged.  As I have said, the matter will be kept under review.  If we find that it is not working out, or that it is necessary to make sure that it works properly, it can be dealt with in the amending legislation.

      <P>In fairness to the House, we are not telling any secrets out of school if we refer to the fact that there was considerable confusion in regard to what the Valuation Office should have been doing for a part of last year. Because it was the first year of the implementation of this, the Minister was enacting legislation after a particular measure had taken effect.  Drafting legislation on the basis of the first year's experience is not the right way to make good laws.  The Minister has heard Deputy Fitzpatrick's arguments.  In so far as this Bill can introduce an element of certainty, the Minister should consider this section again and see if it can be tightened up on Report Stage. Perhaps the Minister would explain why subsection (7) has been included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (7) qualifies the definitions of &ldquo;domestic hereditament&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary school&rdquo; to provide that where a separate hereditament of land is associated with either it will be regarded as forming one hereditament with the domestic hereditament or <Col N="730" /> the secondary school, as the case may be.  This is a drafting device designed to make it easier to express in section 2 the limits applying to relief of land valuations, a £1 valuation in the case of domestic land and £40 in the case of secondary schools.  These apply whether the land forms part of the same hereditament as the buildings or is separate.</P>

Ownership of land has nothing to do with rated occupancy. People who are not the owners of land can be the rated occupiers.  It appears that a secondary school that is the rated occupier of land will be free of rates up to a maximum valuation of £40 on land.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would regard some colleges as being more fortunate than others because they have farms.  The limitation of £40 ensures that they will not enjoy derating benefits in respect of large farms, which many of them have.  There is not anything from which to exempt colleges which are not the rated occupiers of land whose valuation is not more than £40. They would have to be the rated occupiers. The Deputy is making the point that a college might be sharing its sports areas with a club which would be the principal user of the land.  Any exemption in that way would apply to the club, not to the college who are paying a rent for the use of the ground.  Within the county borough of Dublin there is a reduced rate on land and the rates on a sports field, a football ground, would not be very much anyway&mdash;it should not be worth considering.</P>

If a club rented out land on a regular basis to a school&mdash;I know of circumstances where this happens&mdash;and if they charge a rent plus a proportion of the rates, and if the school applies for relief on the portion which is the rates, would the school not make use of such a relief if it were there?

If I am the head of a college and I am renting land with a £20 valuation from somebody over, say, a period of three years, I can change the name of the rated occupier but that does not give me any right to ownership of the land. The moment I lose the right of occupation I have no other right.  This is a matter I would not worry too much about.

The subsection states, &ldquo;In case any land entered as land in the valuation lists....&rdquo;  It does not refer to the name, whether it be a college or the trustees on behalf of a college.  Then there is use of the phrase &ldquo;belong to&rdquo;, an extraordinary and clumsy phrase which seems to denote a halfway position between ownership and something else&mdash;at school we used to use a phrase &ldquo;That belongs to me&rdquo;.

      <P>Further to the point the Minister was making about the use of such land, we will say, owned by a sports club, by a school, is there the possibility of a loophole emerging in subsection (7)?  Let me put a hypothetical case to the Minister and his advisers because it would be a clear evasion of the intention of the Minister if this was the case. There are a number of sports clubs in this city comprised of past pupils of various schools, for example, St. Mary's Rugby Club, Blackrock, Wesley, or any of the other rugby clubs, with extensive land and property that is of considerable value.  I am concerned with the words &ldquo;is usually enjoyed&rdquo; in line 29.  It is frequently the case that the secondary school pupils &ldquo;usually enjoy&rdquo;, or it could be argued that they enjoy the lands of the club?  On that basis, if they met that <Col N="735" /> first condition in the normal tradition could they then simply change the listing of the ownership of the land in the rating authority in order to benefit from this provision?  In other words, does a loophole exist there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly the local authority would have a say in this.  First of all, the college would not get a demand note for rates unless it was the rated occupier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am not expressing my point sufficiently clearly.  I am not a lawyer but, as the section stands, the English is fairly explicit.  It says:</P>
      <P>In case any land entered as land in the valuation lists belongs to and is usually enjoyed with a secondary school....</P>
      <P>If there is a situation in which land is usually enjoyed by a secondary school, in other words, the sports ground of a separate club comprised of the past pupils of that school, and if that land is usually enjoyed, as of now&mdash;and that is the case in some instances&mdash;is there not the opportunity for the board of management of the club to say: &ldquo;if we change the land entered in the valuation lists as belonging to the club to land as belonging to the college&rdquo;&mdash;and there is usually a close connection between the two; if they were to make that subsequent change, having met the first condition, i.e. &ldquo;usually enjoyed&rdquo;&mdash;would they then be eligible for exemption from the payment of rates?  It is a possible evasion with which I am concerned.</P>

      <P>If the primary use is that of the secondary school, or the college and they become the rated occupier, they will be exempt.  If it is, let us say, a rugby club, or a GAA club, and they enjoy the primary use of it, it could not be exempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The effect of subsection (1) is to provide that a secondary school and up to £40 valuation land is derated. Now a domestic dwelling and land up to £1 valuation is derated.  This is designed to deal with Deputy Quinn's amendment which was ruled out of order.  I think a valuation of £1 in respect of land is too small particularly nowadays when planning authorities encourage a lesser density of house building.  I think this figure should be increased.  Perhaps £5 might be too high but there should be something in between £1 and £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a difficult Bill to deal with in Committee in that practically every amendment put down by the Opposition will be ruled out of order as imposing a charge on the Exchequer.  For that reason I did not put down any amendments. Dealing with the Bill has not been <Col N="741" /> made any easier because it is being taken in the dying days of this session and I understand the Minister wants the Bill into the Seanad before Christmas.  I do not believe that will be possible and I think it is unreasonable to ask us to deal with this Bill in this way remembering that it was introduced 12 months ago, almost to the day, on 14 December 1977.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Yes, but there are a good many sections and we could be here for a good while yet.  I say this because I fear the Minister would be slow to accept amendments and that is why I argue it is difficult to deal with this Bill in Committee because we could not put down any amendments and, even if the Minister wants to get the Bill into the Seanad before the Christmas recess, the likelihood of his accepting amendments is, to say the least of it, very slight.  He has, of course, a fair majority in the House and the situation is compounded by the fact that the Bill is being rushed and the Minister has such a majority.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is not likely to want a proper Report Stage because I think there are many things requiring amendment.  It is a very complicated, technical Bill introduced to implement promises made by the Government party prior to the last election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I agree it covers the 25 per cent remission provided by the National Coalition in 1977.  As I say, I do not think a valuation of £1 in respect of land is sufficient.  It is certainly not sufficient when there is no limit on the size of the house that is to be derated.  The house can be as big as one likes and it will still be derated.  If we are going to have fairly large houses derated then it is only reasonable that the derating should also apply to a reasonable area of land as an <Col N="742" /> amenity with the house.  Some figure between £1 and £5 as a maximum I would suggest but, if the Minister thinks that is too big, I would go so far as to say £3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A limit had to be set and wherever one sets a limit there will always be people who will argue that it should be greater and include them.  The £1 was set after consultation with the Valuation Office.  It was not just decided in my Department.  With regard to £3, there are parts of Ireland where £3 could almost be a small farm.  That is true of my own county.  I agree it could be poorish land but it could be as much as ten to 20 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be but £5 or £3 could vary from the point of view of the amount of land.  One pound would be the usual amount.  If it were more than £1 one would nearly have to employ someone to keep the grass cut or dig the garden and people do not like having to do that any more.  Most people cannot afford it.  One pound would appear to be adequate to cover the amount of land with any dwelling house.  It could be up to one acre or it might be down to half an acre.  After consultation with the Valuation Office it was decided this was the fairest approach.</P>

      <P>If one could change the name of the Minister on the Order Paper to my name the fact is the Minister has made the best argument yet for the amendment tabled by me which was ruled out of order.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  Now the Minister has a golden opportunity to reduce the discrimination implicit in that valuation system which is based on factors, as the <Col N="743" /> Minister and I know, that no longer apply.  Certainly in the context of enjoying land as part of a domestic dwelling the valuation process has nothing to do with it, it was for that simple reason, quoting the Minister's own words that it is approximately one acre, that I attempted to equate the two.  I know the Chair is bound by certain rules in these matters and there was no discretion involved but the Minister could accept the spirit of the proposal on Report Stage. The amendment is not on the Order Paper but does the Minister consider it fair that a situation could readily arise&mdash;indeed, he put the words into my mouth&mdash;where a £1 valuation could amount to half an acre in one part of the country and an acre in another part.</P>
    </Speaker>

It devalues the process of law when you discriminate in fact between one part of the country and another and any Minister who has the opportunity to make it clear and unequivocal and equal for anybody enjoying this benefit should avail of the opportunity to do so, whether it be poor land in Clare or rich land in Meath so that all would have the same area apportioned to their houses.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  There is a certain tendency in the Minister's response to this and to other measures to rely on other Acts which are outside the context of this.  The fact that land outside urban areas is derated at present could conceivably change in the next four or five years and the Minister for the Environment will not have any say over whether it does or not.  As this is a piece of draft legislation going through the House there is a responsibility on us all to try to make it consistent, clear and unequivocal in the eyes of any court that may have to adjudicate on it.  The inclusion of one statute acre or £1 does not seem to pose enormous difficulties. Unless there is a special reason why the Minister is limiting this to valuations I cannot see why my proposal is not accepted.</P>

      <P>Such towns are treated as county and enjoy the same as any part of the county.  If we accepted Deputy Quinn's suggestion the valuation officials would have to remeasure and we would have readjustments to make. Rates are based on valuations.  The figure of £1 will in most cases cover the piece of ground that goes with houses. Very few will carry a valuation greater than £1.  I do not think there will be any difficulty with regard to £1.  If I accepted the Deputies suggestion I would be creating a big problem and a lot of extra work.  The figure of £1 is fair.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is another example of the absurdity of the rating system.  Many big towns do not have urban district councils and they are larger than some towns that have such councils.  A person who builds a house on a piece of land which carries a valuation of £2 in the urban districts of Naas or Ballinasloe&mdash;two towns which have a lot of land inside their urban boundary&mdash;will have to pay rates on the land because those towns have urban councils.  If that person built his house adjacent to such towns but outside the urban area on a similar piece of land he would not have to pay any rates.  That is absurd and unfair. There is a precedent for taking a £5 valuation.  Under the Act of 1965 the sale of land to foreigners is subject to the consent of the Land Commission, except in cases where the poor law valuation of the land does not exceed £5, or five acres.  The Minister is being unduly restrictive in confining this to £1.</P>

A person in Ballinasloe who builds on a piece of land which has a valuation of £3 will be exempt for the first £1, in accordance with the Bill, and a two-fifths reduction of the remaining £2 in most urban areas.  Nobody will be hurt very seriously if they have a valuation in excess of £1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point which is referred to throughout the Bill which contrasts the attitude of the Minister and of this side of the House. <Col N="746" /> The Minister seems to be satisfied as long as he hits 95 per cent of the likely categories of people who would normally benefit from this.  He has told us that the number of people who will fall in the 5 per cent category will be small and will not cause much concern.  The fact is that there will be a legal obligation on the local authorities to collect these rates. We have had the nonsense with the water charge where £1.2 million was collected from all local authorities.  The cost of the administrative charge of collecting that kind of money is mind-boggling to say nothing about the time delays.  We have an opportunity now to close off those minor bits and pieces and reduce such anomalies.  Why is the Minister reluctant to accept my proposal?  We cannot table amendments but we can draw his attention to possible loopholes. We could make better progress if the Minister was to honestly tell us that matters of reasonable accuracy brought to his attention as a result of scrutiny on Committee Stage will be dealt with on Report Stage to meet our points.  We are not attempting to prolong the proceedings of the House but this is important legislation and we have not got close to the meat of it yet.  The Minister should sincerely take honestly intended points brought to his attention here and decide to clear them and not respond by saying that his proposal will clear 95 per cent of the cases and he is not worried about the minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not confine it to 95 per cent.  It will probably clear most people.  The Deputy wonders why I cannot accept what appears to him to be a reasonable increase in the valuation.  I think the £1 is reasonable as it stands. Wherever a limit is set there will be a percentage of people outside that limit. The same kind of argument could be made irrespective of where the limit was set.  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to areas such as Naas or Ballinasloe.  A £2 valuation in either case could be in respect of two acres or even more.  An area of half an acre attached to a house is quite a lot of land to look after, even to the extent of keeping the grass cut.  If a person has two acres of land with a <Col N="747" /> valuation of £2 in an urban area, surely he will make some commercial use of it? If he plants apple trees he will have apples to sell.  Even if he puts a few cattle or a horse on the land, that is putting it to commercial use.  It is farming on a small scale.  Even more beneficial to the owner would be to engage in market gardening in an urban area.  That would be a commercial use.  I see no reason why a valuation of £1 should not be considered very reasonable.  It could be in respect of one acre of land in many instances.  We set the figure after consultation with the Valuation Office.  We did not pull the figure out of the sky.  Deputy Quinn's proposal made reference to &ldquo;up to an acre&rdquo;.  That would mean measuring land and excluding those parts that are in excess of one acre which would have come under the £1 valuation.  People could be victimised in that way.</P>
      <P>I should like to correct something I said some time ago.  I was wrong when I said that where a valuation is more than £1, for instance £3, that the first £1 would be exempt.  That would not be so.</P>

That is why it is necessary to spend so much time on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I wonder if that was the intention? The Bills dealing with capital taxation excluded dwelling-houses with a certain area of land around them.  We should be uniform here and give exemption on the first £1 valuation.  That would be more equitable.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister is faced with a choice of equalising the amount of land irrespective of its valuation that would be exempt from rates to any domestic dwelling and saying that if a person has land up to a certain area he will not have to pay rates either on the land or the house. Instead he has opted for the use of the valuation, on the grounds that it would cause less administrative trouble and disruption by opting for a £1 valuation rather than opting for one acre.  In that simple choice it seems to me that the Minister is making a choice in favour of administrative convenience as distinct from some kind of equity before the law. On the basis of his own earlier argument that we are talking about minimal numbers of people, certainly less than 5 per cent, it seems to me to be an extraordinary choice.  The Minister has stated that he is confining the basis of measurement to valuation, but in this instance he has a chance to introduce a degree of equity that is absolute&mdash;in other words, the physical area of land with a dwelling to be constant irrespective of whether the person is an Irish citizen living in Inisboffin or an Irish citizen living in the middle of a town.  The choice is self-evident and should be taken and the administrative inconvenience should not be a factor particularly when it is so small.</P>

      <P>The figure of £1 is reasonable and compares fairly well with the one statute acre mentioned by Deputy Quinn.  As far as I know, the average land valuation is in <Col N="749" /> the region of £1.0.10d per acre&mdash;I am using the old currency.  The £1 would equate fairly well with the one statute acre in Deputy Quinn's proposal.</P>

      <P>In 99 per cent of the cases.  If we went on an acreage basis it would give rise to disputes, conciliation and arbitration and there would be numerous appeals.  The Valuation Office, Departments and the various councils would have to engage additional staff to remeasure plots of land attached to houses.  The £1 figure meets reasonably well the vast majority of cases, particularly the category that would give rise to the greatest concern and which would cause administrative difficulties, namely, in relation to plots and parcels of land attached to local authority houses, whether purchased or non-purchased houses.</P>
      <P>Under the present proposals regarding the £1 limit I do not see any of these being liable for any rates whatever.  The valuation on most of the plots is in the region of 10p to 50p maximum and that would entail the plotting of rates and the collection of rates on these plots.  Possibly the collection would lead to a loss of revenue to the councils by reason of the procedures local authorities will have to go through in order to collect these rates.  The £1 here equates reasonably well with the one statute acre in Deputy Quinn's proposal.</P>

In the instance quoted by the Minister of State, the more beneficial of the two would be picked.  In that instance it would be the £1 valuation and not the one statute acre if it was less than the area of the plot attached to the local authority dwelling. The case I have made is self evident. Despite the arguments, the Minister is coming down on the side of administrative convenience.</P>

    <P>The purpose, intention and spirit of this was and is to exempt people who have small gardens attached to their dwellings from paying rates.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on the first part of section 2 and there are many subsections I want to mention.  The Explanatory Memorandum states that:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Subsections (2)</i> to <i>(6)</i> are concerned with domestic valuations which are subject to a phased reduction for rating purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding of the situation is this. In a local authority area where a house enjoys the normal valuation of £36 and is on a phased reduction over nine years, in year four its actual valuation in terms of generating rates to the local authority is effectively £16.  The revenue the local authority would get from that house in year four is £16 multiplied, say, by £10, giving a total of £160.  At the end of the <Col N="754" /> ninth year reduction, using the same valuation of £10 to the pound, the local authority would get £360.  The implications of that for local authorities that have large new estates is absolutely astronomical.  The Explanatory Memorandum, tongue in cheek, recognising the implications of this states:</P>
    <P>As a <i>quid pro quo</i>, rating authorities would have benefit of the full valuations of new and improved domestic property which materialise in later years and which would otherwise have been subject to a temporary reduction.</P>
    <P>That is great news for later years but it is not good news for today.  In suburban areas of large local authorities, such as Dublin, Limerick, Galway, Kilkenny, Waterford and any fast-growing area, there is a great demand for the kind of services which only local authorities can provide and the servicing of which must come out of the revenue from rates.  This proposal is cutting the legs from under the natural tax base of local authorities now and, as a <i>quid pro quo</i> moryah it is suggesting that in later years you will get the benefit of new houses.  The reality is that local authorities that need the benefit of the full revenue now are going to be deprived of it because, as I interpret this, the Minister is going to freeze these valuations.  Instead of the house being valued at £36 it will be valued at £16 forever.  This means we will have an unequal tax base comparing one set with another.

      <P>The position is that subsection (2) provides for the making of an order by the Minister under which all the provisions mentioned in subsection (5) would cease to operate.  The first effect of the order would be that new house valuations would no longer be reduced for rating purposes.  This would mean a substantial gain for local authorities in future in their effective valuations deriving from new houses. This gain would in turn be in compensation for the freezing of existing reduced valuations which the order would affect under subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> In the past there was always a deficit in the valuation base of local authorities as a result of the provisions of the Housing Acts.  The components of the deficit changed from year to year but the deficit itself was permanent.  What the order will do is simply freeze this deficit at a certain point in time, thus making it unnecessary for local authorities to calculate it anew every year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words I have correctly interpreted the provisions of this subsection.  While talking specifically to this section I would like to have regard to another aspect of this legislation, that is the way the rate itself is to be established for each local authority.  I tried unsuccessfully on the Adjournment Debate last night to unravel this Chinese puzzle.  It seems clear that when this legislation becomes law there will not be a differential rate for separate local authorities as there was in the past. In so far as we can judge to date, a percentage increase nationwide would be established if the Cabinet finally decided how much money was available, and that would be equalised and proportioned throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you combine that procedure with the provisions in this subsection, I strongly hold the view that the position of growing local authorities, which are desperately in need of funds to provide services <i>de novo</i> which other local authorities by definition already have or had the opportunity to provide, will be seriously damaged.  That introduces an area of discrimination that has social implications of enormous proportions.  The order will provide all the normal local <Col N="756" /> authority services that we take for granted in built-up urban areas, but which have not yet arrived in new suburban estates, which in many cases have not been taken into charge by the local authorities because the builder has not met all the obligations of the planning permission.  The impact and the potential impact of this order is such that it will penalise permanently these areas while the natural tax base, as based on valuation, will be distorted permanently.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister wishing to do something about this phenomenon because if he were to go to the other extreme and simply to let subsection (5) of this section stand, there would be a wiping out of all the phased reductions.  The tax base would jump immediately from, say, 50 per cent to 100 per cent.  One does not have the figures and in an attempt last year to get this information from the Department we were told that the figures were not readily available. Consequently, we do not know fully what time bomb we have buried in this section but it is reasonable to assume that it is way beyond the cost of what the incoming financial year could afford. Allowing for that, and I am trying to be objective with regard to the Minister's difficulties, one would have expected him at least to have allowed some way whereby the tax base would not be distorted permanently and that on a contrary tack he would have allowed the phased reduction to continue, in other words, starting from this year with no more nine-year reductions but that those houses in the process of benefiting from such reductions would be allowed to follow the natural process so that a house generating rates multiplied by four years, that is £16 in this year, would generate an income rate multiplied by five years which would be £20.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain why this decision has been taken because it is not possible to do what the explanatory memorandum attempts to do, to palm off today's needs with tomorrow's promises of goodies. Whatever about election promises we are dealing with legislation now.  What is being done here is both unfair and unjust. Indeed, there is running through all of this legislation a degree of arbitrariness <Col N="757" /> that is frightening. Disregarding, then, that explanation I should like the Minister to state if possible what would be the additional cost to the Exchequer, the increased sum valuation, in the event of taking up to full valuation those domestic dwellings that are currently in the process of enjoying any of the benefits of remission of rates as identified in section 5.  Has that sum been done and, if it has not been done, may we have some indication of the figure, so that we may know the magnitude of the problem with which the Minister has had to deal.  Having established that problem perhaps we could consider some ways of coming to terms with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last point first, there is no figure available regarding the increased cost to the Exchequer. In these circumstances, it would not be proper for me to venture a guess because any figure I might give could be very much in error on one side or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a variant of this question in May last.  The Minister has stated now that a figure is not available but is he implying that somebody in the Department is doing the sum and that a figure will become available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but if an order is being made under subsection (2) we would set about preparing an estimate. We would like to have the figure as accurate as possible and to have the estimate available in order to be able to inform the House as accurately as possible during the course of discussion on the order.  I assure the House that there is nothing sinister in the provision in subsection (2).  The Bill provides simply the legal framework for later decisions on this whole question.  The provision cannot have effect unless brought in by way of ministerial order.  Not alone is a ministerial order necessary but the draft of such an order would have to be brought before both Houses.  A resolution of both Houses approving of the draft is essential before the order can be <Col N="758" /> made.  This stipulation will afford all parties an opportunity of discussing practically all the points to which Deputy Quinn has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reassuring to know that the House will have such opportunity but we are talking about the tax base of local government.  Irrespective of who happens to be the incumbent in the Custom House, after this Bill has been passed a directive will issue from a principal officer in the Department of Finance to the effect that that kind of hatch must be battened down in times of economic difficulties.  We would be naïve to refer to it in any other terms. Therefore, the Minister's reply that although the provision is in the Bill it might not necessarily come into force until such time as the Minister might decide to bring in an order, the full details being made available then, is not satisfactory because it would then be much too late for the implications to be understood by the local authorities or indeed by us who have responsibility with regard to the drafting of legislation.  We have gone well beyond the position of deciding whether the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings was a good or a bad move.  As I have said repeatedly we are talking now about the tax base, about the system of taxation for local government.  There will always be times during the term of office of any Government when money will be tight.  Indeed, money will never be as flush again as it used be.  Therefore, we must assume that once the provision is in the Bill for an order, it will be implemented at some stage.  But what is the net effect of that in the event of it becoming law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it means that in the case of an estate built three years ago in one part of any suburban area of the country and which has a valuation frozen at three times its full value&mdash;here again I give the example of the £36 valuation which admittedly relates to an expensive house&mdash;the valuation for three years would be £9 per house whereas a similar house in an estate down the road to be built next year and having the same valuation would have a valuation of £36 per house.  Therefore, the revenue that a local authority would get as a <Col N="759" /> result of this legislation becoming law would be infinitely more from exactly a similar estate to be built next year than from one built three years ago.  This is introducing a new form of distortion and inequality into the tax base of local government.  If, for all practical purposes, the requirements of the people in the new estate are to be identical with the needs of people in the older estate, what we are discussing here is nothing less than a device to deprive local authorities of moneys they need badly.  I cannot see any justice in that.  I have suggested that I can understand the implications of disregarding altogether the rates remission proposal.  In other words, if we simply let subsection (5) stand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was nothing but subsection (5), if all rates remission were to be repealed and the full valuations brought into the taxation base, it would generate a lot of new income for local authorities on a once-off basis.  I am not proposing that.  Why is it that you cannot let the remissions run their course so that the tax base, artificially depressed for local authorities in some instances, would naturally rise to the level which the Valuation Office and the valuers had assigned to them in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already in this debate talked about the irrationality and inequality of the old valuation system.  Irrespective of that, I presume that all Members of this House on either side of the divide, have some kind of commitment to equality.  If this order becomes law, as I must assume it will, you are going to introduce a new form of inequality in the taxation base of local authorities.  I find that totally unacceptable.  I have not heard any adequate argument as to why that should be so other than financial embarrassment on the part of the Government. I can conceive that there would be some degree of financial embarrassment and therefore I ask why you cannot let the remissions run their natural course so that at the end of what presumably would be a minimum of eight years the taxation base would at least be equalised <Col N="760" /> and you would not have depressed valuation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The proposal here is to freeze the valuations at the present effective valuation by virtue of the provision in subsection (5).  It is argued that the loss of revenue incurred by local authorities as a result of that operation will be made up by the coming into operation of the full valuation on new houses immediately.  That is the proposition as I see it, but it is not as simple as that.  Those of us who are familiar with urban authorities know that a very peculiar and difficult situation arises there.  Most urban authorities have become built up in recent years; in other words, there are no more building sites available and the existing building sites have all been built up in the last few years.  Any further building is now taking place outside the urban areas.  The result of that is that these urban areas, like Cavan town and Cork city as far as they are apart, will suffer an immediate loss of revenue in so far as the effective valuation of the houses enjoying remission will become a permanent valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): We are told that to compensate for that, in the case of the new houses being built in the years to come the Minister will reimburse the local authority on the basis of the full valuation. In so far as Cavan town is concerned every inch of available land within the urban area has been built up, and if what I call the remission valuations are frozen the urban area will suffer substantial loss of revenue.  That is not the only place where this difficulty exists.  The Finance and Planning Committee of Cork Corporation have appointed a sub-committee.  This sub-committee includes such names as the present Lord Mayor of Cork city and Councillor A.A. Healy, a man who frequently occupied the Chair now occupied by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in this House.  The sub-committee have reported and they request that the Minister be asked to amend section 2 of <Col N="761" /> the Bill so that the loss of revenue empowered by this section would be evaded.  Under this section the Minister proposes to take power to freeze the valuation on domestic houses, to allow the rate remission stand at the 1978 figure and to regard new houses at whatever figure they are valued.  The sub-committee state that this would present a financial problem to Cork Corporation as there is only a certain amount of land left for private house building.  Accordingly, from 1979 onwards Cork Corporation would find themselves in a loss situation.</P>
      <P>That report is very helpful because it is typical of what will happen all over the country in many urban areas; they will suffer a permanent loss of revenue.  The valuation will be permanently cut back and the reasonable thing to do is to let the remission work itself out as it was doing year after year.  This is simply a proviso by which the Minister will save money.  We see many things creeping into this Bill that certainly were not spelled out in the manifesto about which we heard so much and are hearing less as time goes on.  The example that this sub-committee of Cork Corporation have spelled out is typical of the situation prevailing in many urban areas and certainly in my own urban area of Cavan. There are only a few urban areas that have plenty of land left.  I spelled out a couple of them this morning: Ballinasloe and Nass are typical examples of urban authorities who have building land to spare as far as one can see into the future.  But they are very much the exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urban areas all over the country need to be revised and extended but the present procedure is so cumbersome and difficult and the obstacles in the way of extending them are so effective that members of urban authorities, having tried to extend the urban areas, simply become frustrated and do nothing about it.  That is why this proposal in the Bill is so serious.  I know that it does not come into operation unless the Minister makes an order.  I know also that the order must come before this House, but it is then on a take it or leave it basis, a yes or no.  We saw yesterday that an order <Col N="762" /> brought in cannot be amended and it is up to the House either to accept or reject it.  If a Minister makes an order and brings it into this House for approval it becomes a matter of principle with him and we know that it will go through as a matter of form, especially in the present Dáil.  That is why this matter is so serious.  The Minister should have second thoughts about it or seek to justify it with a better argument than has so far been put up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (2) the Minister may make an order.  There is no obligation on him to make it; he may make it.  No decision has been taken yet as to whether or when an order will be made.  Existing arrangements will continue unless the order is made, and the order will then be debated in full in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn naturally is concerned about the urban areas but these are the very areas which may be presumed to continue on a substantial housing output over the coming year and the corporation or the council will benefit under the existing arrangements.  They will, therefore, derive the greatest benefit from there being no reduction in future on their new house valuations.</P>
      <P>All that is involved at the moment is a provision to clear the way for a simple streamlining of administration at some future date.  With the abolition of domestic rates the idea of rates remission for new or reconstructed houses makes little sense.  People are no longer paying rates on their dwellings so the idea of giving them as individual ratepayers a remission of rates has no meaning.  The only purpose the remission arrangements now serve is as a factor in the calculation of the State grant. All these housing remissions taken together at any one time give a certain reduction in the amount of what would in past years have had to be paid by the domestic ratepayers as a body but which is now paid by the State grant in place of domestic rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As things stand the amount of the reduction would have to be adjusted each year as the remission on each house moves from nine-tenths to eight-tenths to seven-tenths and so on.  This <Col N="763" /> adjustment would have to be made for both existing houses entitled to the remission and for new houses coming into the valuation list.  The thinking behind the Bill and this subsection is that at some particular time the remissions relating to houses already built and valued could be regarded as frozen at whatever point they have reached, be it 1/10th or 9/10ths or anywhere in between.  This would mean a loss to local authorities unless some further action is taken.  The further action provided for in the Bill would be to allow the valuations of all new houses to be added on as effective valuations without any remission. My Department estimate that this situation would, on an overall basis, balance out any loss which local authorities might otherwise suffer through the freezing of existing ratings although, as I said before, we have nowhere near an accurate estimate because this estimate will be prepared if and when an order is about to be made.</P>
    <P>We should not quarrel unduly with the thinking behind this section.  It is a sensible attempt to tidy up the situation which arises because domestic rates are being fully, finally and permanently abolished.  With no rates payable on houses the fairly elaborate legal arrangements for giving special relief by way of rates remission to the individual occupier of new or improved domestic property are obsolete and should be got rid of.  Deputy Quinn seems to be concerned in case local authorities would lose out because certain statistics about value of existing remissions are not available.  He is quite right to raise the matter but he need have no worries.</P>

      <P>On the overall basis the losses and gains will balance fairly well.  I realise that the balance could be upset in the case of individual local authorities.  It is my intention to have the effects on individual local authorities examined in detail before I bring forward any draft order to implement these provisions and this includes urban and <Col N="764" /> county relationships.  Both Houses will have an opportunity at the appropriate stage of going fully into whatever is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanations given so far by the Minister of State do not really satisfy the points I have raised.  The first point is that it is stated in the Bill, and repeated by the Minister of State, that there is only a provision in this section that would enable the Minister to come in and make an order and if such an order were to be made it would have to be debated in the House.  Am I right in assuming that, once this legislation becomes law, there will be no remission for any new houses constructed after the date on which this legislation is signed by the President?  If I am right in that assumption we are talking anyway about a fixed time period of no more than ten years at the very outside so that the provision in which an order such as the one we have talked about could only be made within a period of ten years.  That is the first thing.  After a certain length of time new houses constructed from the time this legislation becomes law do not benefit in any shape or form from remission on rates.  That is my understanding of it.  There is an inbuilt time limit when this thing goes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister of State is seriously suggesting that the temptation to use this provision in that period is going to be resisted at all times and it is only a minor matter why bother to have it at all?  We on this side of the House must operate on the basis that once the provision is there it will be taken up.  It is not an unreasonable assumption to hold the view that there will be the suggestion that it will be taken up on the basis of economic saving.  There is an element of swings and roundabouts in all this because if the taxation base of a local authority is, say, £100,000 and they prepare their estimates and come up with £8 in the £1 rates and they say therefore that they need £800,000 of which 50 per cent would come from a direct grant for the purposes of this provision, that amount of money will have to be paid by the State.  If the tax base is lower than that the costs presumably are still going to be the same <Col N="765" /> so, while the tax base may be only £50,000, as a result of the freezing of rates, they are going to need double the amount of rates in order to generate the same revenue.  Therefore the State is going to have to pay the same sort of money at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>Frankly what amazes me is that here we have a clear provision put into the Bill.  Leave to introduce the Bill was sought on the 14 December last year. The Bill itself was circulated in the spring of this year.  Questions in relation to this particular provision were asked by myself and undoubtedly were asked within the confines of the Custom House.  The Minister of State is still saying officially on the floor of the House that he does not know the full cost of the implementation of this provision.  With the best will in the world, either he is not doing his job or he is simply sitting back and relying on the 84 seat majority to run this thing through and not bothering to do this kind of necessary work until such time as he decides to bring in an order.  While that may be acceptable to the Government's own backbenchers I can assure the Minister of State that it is highly unacceptable to this side of the House.  The Minister of State is making a proposal with major costs implicit in it and he is not giving us one single statistic or fact in relation to what it actually is.  That is sloppy management at the best of times, to be honest.  It indicates a certain lazy reliance on the fact that the Government have an overwhelming majority that does not require them to do this kind of work.  The Department have resources and the time to do the kind of sums that can answer these questions and not have us speculating here on the floor of the House at two minutes to one.</P>
    <P>The fundamental point I was making still applies and the Minister has not dealt with it.  If this order is taken up&mdash;-and we must assume for the purposes of this Committee Stage that it becomes law and it is taken up&mdash;is it not true at the end of the day that within a given local authority one estate is going to have a <i>de facto</i> lower tax base than another and that there is going to be a new distorted valuation introduced into <Col N="766" /> the tax base of local government finances on top of the already existing distorted valuations?  If that is the case&mdash;and I am subject to correction on this and the Minister does have resources which neither myself nor Deputy Fitzpatrick have&mdash;is the Minister seriously happy that he is going to introduce an additional distortion to an already distorted system of valuation by virtue of taking up this provision?  I cannot understand why this should be and why he wants to do it because at the end of the day the amount of money expended by the Exchequer is a multiplication of the tax rate by the rate in the £1 and if one goes up, the other by definition must come down because the revenue required at the end of the day is approximately the same so we are arguing something less than cash at this stage.  We are talking about the principle of valuation.  We have no idea what may arise in the future with regard to valuations of properties for other purposes of legislation, for conveyancing and all sorts of other things and we can have the crazy anomaly where a house built three or four years ago would have half the effective valuation as another house built at exactly the same time.  That is bad law.  It is introducing an unequal valuation into this process and I simply do not understand why the Minister is proposing to do it.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When the enactments in subsection (5) are appealed it will affect <Col N="767" /> them.  The Minister of State, when he intervened, seemed to recognise that there is a difficulty in regard to urban areas when all the new house development that can take place within the area has taken place and future development will take place outside it.  He did not say how he proposed to deal with it beyond saying that he would look into individual cases. Does the Minister concede that that difficulty exists?  Many urban areas have been built up recently and many of them still enjoy rates remission but there is no land left for further housing development. This will take place outside those urban areas and in the areas of other local authorities and other local rating areas.</P>
      <P>We do not have to leave Dublin city where much of the development is now taking place in the county.  The effect of what the Minister is doing might seem to result in the revenue for the city proper being run down while that of the county would increase dramatically.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It would balance out if the whole country were one but when you have completed all the development that can be done in an urban area and when development in the years to come will be in the county how will that balance out? Does it not simply mean that the urban area will suffer a loss of revenue and will not get any compensation on account of new buildings because the future building will take place in the county area rather than in the urban area?  How will that balance out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We mean outside the urban area when we refer to the buoyancy in certain areas.  Buoyancy can be important, apart from the benefits which would appear to flow to a particular rating authority.  If we take Dublin city against Dublin county, if they are building outside the urban area it means that the infrastructure will cost a lot more to provide for the new buildings so they will need more money for that purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Yes, but the Minister is saying that when his order is made the loss of revenue incurred by an authority <Col N="769" /> will be made up by the coming into operation of the full valuation of new houses immediately without any remission. When the Minister was absent from the House I read out a memo from Cork Corporation saying that there is no more land for development within Cork Corporation area and that if the Minister brings in an order they will lose out because the valuation of existing houses under remission will not grow and they will get no compensation in the city because the development will take place outside the city.  That is happening in urban areas all over the country.  What views has the Minister on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is saying will happen in relation to Cork Corporation will apply only in the event of an order being made.  At the moment there is no question of making an order. There is provision made if it is necessary in the future to make an order, having examined the effects all over.  At the moment there is no intention of making an order so what the Deputy is saying is very hypothetical.  An order is necessary before it has the effect the Deputy is worried about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister is now running away from the subsection and saying that we should not worry about it, that it will never happen.  This is an enabling section and I have pointed out the effects of it in some places like Cork, Dublin and Cavan.  This is a typical example of what will happen all over the country.  The Minister's reaction is to say that this will happen only if an order is made, I know that, but we must, presumably because this is in the Bill, proceed on the basis that the order will be made.  Is the Minister now telling us that a uniform order will not be made and that if he makes an order it will apply to some parts of the country and will not apply to others?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I assume it will be uniform. If it is uniform how will the Minister <Col N="770" /> compensate the urban areas who will lose with no possibility of gain?  The Minister and the Minister of State have pointed out that this thing will balance out and that what one loses on the swings one gains on the roundabout.  In certain areas there are only swings and there will be no roundabouts.  What is the thinking of the Department and of the Ministers on this?  It is not good enough to tell us not to worry about it, that it will not happen.  If it will not happen it should be taken out of the Bill and the Minister should come back in with an amendment when he has done his homework and he knows what it is all about.  As Deputy Quinn said, it is a dangerous thing to have in the Bill, because we know the power of the Department of Finance and we know that the Minister will be simply told to operate section 2 or whatever the section is as from next year and he will do it. There will not be time then to think how to make up the loss these local authorities will suffer.  What is the thinking of the Department on this topic?  If they have not given it any consideration this section should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an enabling provision. It is to a certain extent hypothetical but nevertheless enables it to be done.  In the event of reaching the stage where an order would be under consideration we would know the effect it would have on the different types of local authorities to which the Deputy has referred and consideration would then be given to the detrimental effects in certain areas.  We would not know until such time as serious consideration would be given to the making of an order and the other side of the coin would be the way in which we would deal with the local authorities mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

That is not our fault.  If we must re-phrase questions lest they were not understood the first time, it will occupy the time of the House.</P>
      <P>We must assume this order will be implemented and any suggestion to the contrary will not be entertained.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has already given an adequate response to that.  I want to know clearly and unequivocally whether it will result in a situation where valuations of similar properties will be different by virtue of the fact that one property was built after the coming into effect of the order and the property built prior to that will enjoy the remission.  Will that happen? Is the Minister happy with that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are referring only to the rates liability and valuations will not be affected.  This deals with the rates liability and the remission of rates.  We are bringing in a Bill which gives statutory power and effect to derating of domestic dwellings and the other matters involved.  I appreciate that it is our duty to try to bring in the best possible legislation. The two Deputies are assuming that an order will be made anyway.  An order can be made but there will be changes from year to year.  There could possibly be extensions of the Cork or Ennis boundaries or any other boundaries&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's clarifications.  It is quite clear now that the actual valuation of the property will be as originally set but that the tax base for the local authorities will be different from one estate to another. It was stated that in some local authority areas there are simply swings and no <Col N="772" /> roundabouts.  Where is the provision in this Bill whereby the Minister can differentiate between the increase in the rates for one local authority as against another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming this order becomes law, in some built-up areas where there are swings but no roundabouts the tax base as distinct from the valuation would be reduced in absolute terms.  The Minister stated that he would be in a position to compensate for that if such a situation arose.  Where is the enabling mechanism for that compensation? It could be that the percentage increase for Cork city would be somewhat greater than the percentage increase allowed for Cork county, where there are both swings and roundabouts.</P>

The Deputy wants to know where there is provision in the Bill to compensate those who would suffer.  If we reach the stage where it is necessary to make an order, there is nothing to prevent the Government, through me, making the necessary compensation available to those who would suffer.  At present there are no grounds for saying that anybody is suffering.  It may well happen and it will be considered then. Even though it is not embodied in the Bill, there is nothing to prevent us from making compensation.</P>

I agree it is an enabling proposal but it will place authority in the hands of the Minister.  It is not good enough to tell us that Cork Corporation could set up a sub-committee to isolate their problems in a month or two.  The Minister has now been in office for 18 months and this Bill was introduced over 12 months ago. This is a very important section and it is clear that neither the Minister nor his Department have given any thought to what the effect of this power will be if it is operated.  The least that a Minister in charge of a Department and asking for powers like this should do is to tell us what effect the exercising of these powers will have and to say that if these powers are put into effect any hardship inflicted on a local authority will be relieved in this way.</P>

In the event of an order being made to deal with these matters the compensatory element would have to be seriously considered in relation to areas that would be seen to suffer or would suffer.

I and Deputy Fitzpatrick specifically asked that question and we were told that no assessment had yet been made.  In view of what has been said and in view of the fact that no detailed assessment has been made, could we reasonably infer from the Minister that no such order will be made under this enabling section when this legislation becomes law for at least a period of two years?  If the Minister is not in a position to give such an assurance, <Col N="776" /> the least we should have when we come to Report Stage is a detailed assessment of the impact of this, because the figures would reasonably relate and could be very accurately updated from year one to year two, if we are talking about a period of two years.  If the Minister is not in a position to give us the statistical implications of an order taking up this enabling section for 1979 and 1980, could he give us an assurance that this order will not be implemented before that time?  If the Minister is not prepared to give such as assurance, will he on Report Stage give us the benefit of the resources of his Department and give us an assessment of the statistical implications of this order?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme has been successful since its extension to the services sector.  The total figure up to 24 November was 9,140 as compared with a total of 2,698 for the ten months of 1977.  Of the youth job seekers in that 9,140, approximately 3,528 are school leavers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, I should point out that the extension of the scheme to the services sector, the building construction industry and the hotel and catering industry has meant a tremendous improvement in the assistance of this scheme.  For example, the figures on the youth side for the period 1 January to 24 November 1978 are 3,528, whereas the comparable number of young people assisted under the entire scheme for the ten months of 1977 was 682.  That proves the importance of the extension to the services sector in the assistance of youth employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring in the first part of his question to the employment incentive scheme and the employment maintenance scheme.  As I already indicated in my reply to a previous question, I am at present involved in an overall review of manpower policy.  An examination of these two schemes forms part of this review.  The recent favourable decision reached in regard to the use of the European Social Fund to stimulate youth employment is also relevant to this review.</P>
      <P>Despite some difficulties which arose in the early stages, I am confident that the youth employment programme will meet the targets set for it by the Government for 1978.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not be able to give the Deputy the breakdown of the average life but I should like to give him some of the figures that are available in relation to the youth employment schemes as an indication of the Government's commitment to aid youth employment.  On the environmental schemes, the number of young persons in employment at the end of October was 1,935.  As of last Friday, the number of people employed in the work experience programme was in excess of <Col N="781" /> 1,300.  In addition to that, a census of the Ballyfermot area to highlight the problems of that area has given short-term employment to young people.  As well as that, additional employment in the local authority sector encouraged by the employment action team and their survey of that time led to the employment by the end of October of about 60 extra apprentices.  In the community youth training programme the throughput from January to October, the latest date for which figures are available, was 1,561, representing an increase of approximately 100 per cent over the same period for 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not helpful to include in job creation figures for this year jobs created in the youth sphere, the duration of which may be as short a period as two months?  Would the Minister agree that it is unhelpful to include these figures in the general aggregate of new jobs created this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the general aggregate of new jobs created there was always a difference between the permanent employment created through the various efforts of the Government and the employment created under the youth programmes.  As the Deputy will appreciate, an important aspect of the youth employment programme is the training of young people and their induction into employment.</P>

Bhíodh Erbil Teo. ag gabháil do phróiseáil éisc tráth agus b'fhéidir go mbaineann an cheist leis an monarcha nach bhfuil aon phróiseáil ar siúl inti le tamall.  Fuair Gaeltarra seilbh na monarchan sin i mí Márta 1976 tar éis i <Col N="783" /> a cheannach ó Erbil.  Ligeadh ar cíos í le cúpla comhlacht eile: Rón Geal Teo. a d'éirigh as próiseáil inti i mí Feabhra 1977, agus Kingdom Sea Foods a d'éirigh as próiseáil inti i mí Aibreáin 1978.  Tá Comharchumann Forbartha Chorca Dhuibhne ag súil le próiseáil ghlasraí a chur ar siúl sa mhonarcha agus tá togra uathu á bhreithniú ag Gaeltarra.  An bhfuil an t-ainm ceart luaite ag an Teachta?

Ó tharla nach bhfuarthas moltaí uathu is cosúil nach raibh rátaí na ndeontas ag cur as dóibh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá athbhreithniú á dhéanamh ar an <Col N="787" /> scéim faoi láthair agus, má thig leis an Teachta tuairimí ó aon nuachtán a sheoladh chugam, beidh áthas orm iad a chur san áireamh.  Seo a leanas cóip den scéim:</P>

    <P>(a)  nuacht nó cúrsaí reatha i nGaeilge a fhoilsiú go rialta, agus</P>
    <P>(b)  duine a ainmniú le bheith freagrach, faoi threoir an eagarthóra, i mbailiú agus in eagarthóireacht nuachta Gaeilge don nuachtán sin.</P>
    <P>2.  Is de réir na rátaí seo a leanas a íocfar deontais faoin Scéim seo&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  don nuachtán (faoi mhír 1 (a) thuas):</P>
    <P>(i)  neamhní i leith ábhair Ghaeilge faoi bhun 1 cholúin,</P>

    <P>Ní rachaidh an deontas faoi (a) den mhír seo thar £21 sa tseachtain i gcás nuachtáin ar bith; colúin timpeall 1,000 focal atá i gceist.</P>

      <Col N="788" /> (c)  go ndéantar an t-ábhar Gaeilge a scaipeadh go maith ar cholúin nuachta an nuachtáin.</P>
    <P>4.  Is go dtí an Rúnaí, Roinn na Gaeltachta, 1 Sráid na Mórchanála Iocht., Baile Átha Cliath, 2, ba chóir iarratas ag lorg cabhrach faoin scéim a chur.  Má bhíonn an t-ábhar céanna á fhoilsiú ar níos mó ná nuachtán amháin (mar shampla, ar dhá nuachtán de chuid aon ghnólachta áirithe) ní cóir cabhair ina leith a lorg ach do nuachtán amháin díobh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My final ambition is to reduce all classes to 32 pupils but there is a difficulty in that we may have a school in which there is, for example, a large infant class of 40 to 45 children and another class of ten pupils.  That is an organisational and structural problem which is difficult to solve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of pupil-teacher ratios generally does the Minister see any case for a regional approach or positive discrimination as regards certain areas as opposed to the apparent desired achievement of a national figure applied right across the board?  Does the Minister see a case for considering a particular approach in certain areas in order to compensate for other educational cum environmental deprivations, for example?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that we have only 50 per cent of the percentage of the appropriate age group in higher or third-level education that exists in other EEC countries?  In the light of that and of the fact that there are places undersubscribed in UCD and the immense waiting list for places in the technological area, would the Minister agree that now is the time for a crash programme to remedy this deficiency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is related to the Dublin area and I am confining my reply to that area.  The appropriate people to consult are the members of the Higher Education Authority and I have asked them to look at the situation.  I am aware that they have engaged consultants in this matter to find out how many third-level places are needed and how they fit into our accommodation. I have already set on the way the development of the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin and third-level places will be provided by the technological sector there in the existing building and in the business studies building on the Ballymun site.  I agree that there is a problem in that certain places may not have been taken up in the universities.  Our neighbours in Britain have made provision for third-level places that are not being taken up. We have to balance it but I am committed to the development of the technological sector which was mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult thing to balance.  When one trains people in the art of self-defence some of them want to get the opportunity of practising it.  This can cause as much trouble as anything else.  The new curriculum in the primary school does not encourage very much of what are called combat sports.  We may be getting a little too sensitive in these areas but the teachers' handbook states that while many boys will participate enthusiastically in combat sports such as wrestling, judo and so on, care must be taken to ensure that physical or psychological damage does not occur. There is no mention of self-defence in the handbook.  In general people try to equip themselves as best they can to defend themselves when it is necessary.  With regard to the specific question I would not be competent to give a judgment.</P>

      <P>In spite of all the difficulties inherent in this problem, does the Minister not agree that approximately ten years is much too long in this context? Further, is he aware of the fact that his predecessors gave firm undertakings many years ago regarding the deadline by which the deeds would be available? Thirdly, in the circumstances of the deeds not having been effected, will the Minister state if the staffs employed in all such schools are secure in their jobs?</P>

      <P>I have not answered all of Deputy Blaney's questions.  The Deputy mentioned that because there was no deed of trust signed that the staff may be in some kind of never-never land with regard to their jobs.  One of the big problems has been that there has been too much detail written into the original proposed deed of trust.  If the contractural clauses were left out it would simplify the deed of trust and help us on the road to a consensus, which is what I am aiming at.</P>

      <P>Part of Deputy Blaney's question referred to the delay.  Would the Minister not agree that there has been considerable delay?  One of the major points on which there is a difference is the question of reserved posts.  There is a possibility of that point going before the <Col N="796" /> courts and further unlimited delay.  In the circumstances would the Minister not agree that it is his responsibility to take a position&mdash;either for or against&mdash; in regard to reserved posts and end the controversy?</P>

My own opinion is that it would be better if we could get a consensus. There are two views.  There is the view of the ukase, of forcing the decision, and there is the view that it is better to work towards a consensus.  I am working towards such a consensus and I intend to achieve it.</P>

On his assurance that teachers need have no fear about the security of their jobs, might I ask the Minister who is their employer in these schools?  Not the Department surely.  If not, does not the lack of a deed of trust mean that they have a phantom employer until such time as a deed of trust is effective?  Only if this matter is dealt with retrospectively can the security of their jobs and their service be maintained.  Is not the continuing delay aggravating the situation as between the terms of employment of the vocational teachers who were taken over and the secondary teachers when they were put together to form an amalgamated community school?  Is that not worsening all the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney expressed some kind of doubt about the position of the staff.  We can get too legalistic about this.  Many people are employed by <i>ad hoc</i> organisations.  Take the National Council for Educational Awards.  That was set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  We have not put statutory legs under it yet, but we have a very fine team employed by it and they are acting in the technological sphere in the same way.  Although we have not got a duly signed document or deed of trust, the schools are in existence. They are giving a very good service. The teachers are employed there and are being paid and, generally speaking, as schools, which is my main interest, they are making a very fine contribution. The Deputy asked was this not aggravating relations between two groups of teachers.  As of now I am not aware that it is.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>I have received replies from all those organisations of management authorities and teachers from whom I invited views on the use of corporal punishment in schools.  Their views were as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO)</i>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Central Executive Committee of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation has considered your request for observations on school discipline, and they have instructed me to say that the membership of the Organisation is quite happy with the terms of Rule 130, Rules for National Schools, on the matter of school discipline. They consider that the Rule is very wisely structured, and contains adequate safeguards for pupils, and at the same time it upholds the reasonable authority of teachers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Association of Secondary Teachers (ASTI)</i>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the ASTI condemns the use of any form of corporal punishment in post-primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of corporal punishment and possible alternatives is being investigated by the Association and <Col N="801" /> our views on this matter will be conveyed to you as soon as possible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Teachers' Union of Ireland</i>
    </P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letter concerning corporal punishment in schools, I am to state that this Union is opposed to its use.</P>
    <P>However, the Union does recognise the real disciplinary problems which can arise and the Executive Committee will draw up a document on school discipline for your consideration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Association of Principals of Community/Comprehensive Schools</i>
    </P>
    <P>&ldquo;I must apologise for the delay in answering your query re corporal punishment.  I have been waiting for a reply from all the Community and Comprehensive Schools on current practice in each school.</P>
    <P>The general picture from the replies I have received, is that, as a policy, corporal punishment is not an acceptable form of discipline and is not used in our schools.  In two schools Principals stated that on a very rare occasion it was used with boys for offences of vandalism, bullying or gross insubordination.  It was administered by the Principal, in the presence of a second teacher and to a maximum of four slaps.</P>
    <P>In practically all the schools contacted no corporal punishment is permitted.</P>
    <P>Various other sanctions are employed, withdrawal of privileges, restriction from participation in games, report cards which students get signed at the end of each class for a period of a week.  If these are ineffective, parents are called in and suspension by the Principals may be imposed if this is thought to be the most effective way of dealing with serious cases of indiscipline.</P>
    <P>My apologies again for the delay&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Catholic Primary Managers' Association</i>
    </P>
    <P>&ldquo;Regarding your letter of 31st January, 1978, I asked the Diocesan Secretaries of our Association to ascertain the views of boards of <Col N="802" /> management on the use of corporal punishment in our schools.  Of the replies I have received the majority are in favour of having some form of corporal punishment for mis-demeanour on the part of pupils. Other comments the Association wish to make are:</P>
    <P>The Rule on Discipline&mdash;No. 130&mdash;is fair and reasonable and if acted upon in the spirit and in the letter there should be no serious demand for its abolition.</P>
    <P>A Clause might be introduced into the Rule stating that the Boards of Management have authority to decide whether or not corporal punishment should be administered for mis-behaviour in schools under their charge.</P>
    <P>Consideration might be given to the question of omitting the word &ldquo;corporal&rdquo; from the Rule.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;A high standard of discipline and good behaviour is absolutely necessary in schools if they are to fulfil their educational purpose. How this is to be achieved is a matter for each individual school and each school must develop its own policy, taking into account the general directives of the Department of Education as well as the circumstances obtaining in different areas and even in individual classes.</P>
      <P>The school policy on discipline should be the result of discussion not only between the teachers and the Board of Management but it should also take into account the attitude of the parents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Conference of Convent Primary Schools</i>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our Association strongly adhered to Rule 130, (1), (2), (3), (4), page 74 Rules for National Schools.</P>
      <P>The terminology Corporal Punishment is unfortunate since it has overtones of physical brutality and we feel that these words should be deleted from Rule 130 of Rules for National Schools and Disciplinary Correction inserted.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Rule 130 should read:</P>
      <P>Disciplinary correction should be administered by the principal teacher and other members of the school staff authorised to do so by the Board of Management.</P>
      <P>We consider it uncomplimentary to the image of the principal teacher in the school if he is given the sole responsibility of administering correction.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Necessity for Disciplinary Correction:</i>
      </P>
      <P>It is a deterrent when pupils cause deliberate injury to other children or damage property.</P>
      <P>It may be needed to instil in children a sense of responsibility for their misdemeanours and in some cases to counteract anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>Education is a preparation for life in an orderly, organised community where there are rules written and unwritten, the infringement of which call for disciplinary correction.</P>
      <P>In a home where self-discipline, obedience and respect for authority are encouraged, children will generally follow this pattern in the classroom; the converse is also true.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>
        <i>National School Boards of Management&mdash;Chairmen's Association</i>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>General:</i></P>
      <P>Reports from the Dioceses indicate that the present Rules are satisfactory and are observed in all our schools: Corporal punishment being administered only by Principals as and when permitted.  There have been discussions at some Meetings of Parents on this subject and parents in general seem satisfied with the present position.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Causes of Indiscipline:</i>
      </P>
      <P>The home attitude is of vital importance; if discipline be non-existent there how can the school impart it? Conversely if excessive physical punishment is common in the home, Corporal Punishment in schools is ineffective in enforcing discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> Overcrowded homes can also cause unruly behaviour at school. Some children may have health problems, mental or physical, and we value the work of the Medical and Welfare Authorities in this connection. Some teachers may have difficulties in keeping order in class and may need advice from Inspectors.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Observations:</i>
    </P>
    <P>We approve of the traditional Irish position that Teachers, along with Parents, feel responsible for general training for life; we would deplore the continental view of the teacher as purely an Instructor in specific subjects. We would welcome further reductions in class numbers.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I seem to have heard that before somewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>We believe the role of the parish clergy to be very important especially when there are problems in the home. We believe regular visits of the Chairman to the schools have a valued part in retaining discipline.  The work of Attendance Officers and Garda Junior Liaison Officers is noted and appreciated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sanctions:</i>
    </P>
    <P>Withdrawal of privileges can sometimes be effective.  Detention during school hours works well for minor infringements.  In some few cases of extreme and persistent indiscipline, following consultations with Parents, Inspectors and other school authorities, a recognised system of Suspension or Referral to remedial classes or Special Schools would be desirable.  It is believed that the very existence of such a system would in itself be salutary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Aontas na mBraithre Teagaisc&mdash;Bunscoileanna</i>
    </P>
    <P>&ldquo;Discipline and good order are an integral part of a child's formation. No child can develop socially, academically or morally without the support of sound and constructive discipline. Children appreciate order as can be seen from the behaviour of normal children; they play games with very strict rules; they are unhappy if <Col N="805" /> others break the rules.  Children from good home environments find support in the rules laid down by their parents. On the other hand, children from a disorderly home will feel insecure and look for the attention they do not get in the home from the school. Therefore, constructive and sensitive discipline ought to prevail in schools and classrooms.</P>
    <P>The Members of our Association adhere to Rule 130: Teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affection and reason and not by harshness and severity.  Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine the pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only in cases of serious misbehaviour and should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only by the Principal teacher or other members of the school staff authorised by the manager for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>Rule 130, properly administered, is fair and just.  We see no particular reason for changing this rule except to satisfy the wishes of a very small minority opinion.</P>
    <P>We realise, indeed that the issue of Corporal Punishment is a very live issue of debate but we do not regard it as a major problem in modern education. Other problems such as class sizes, remedial and special classes, maintenance of schools, adequate equipment and many others are of far greater importance.  However, these problems have not got the emotive value of the so-called corporal punishment issue.  Emotions can easily be whipped up in arguments which conjure up extraordinary pictures in some <Col N="806" /> people's minds.  Some readily confuse corporal punishment with birching and flogging.</P>
    <P>We contend that corporal punishment is fast becoming a non-issue in practice in modern education.  We are extremely happy to note that the use of corporal punishment has diminished greatly over the past number of years.  We submit that the following are the reasons for this:</P>
    <P>1.  Reduction of numbers of pupils per Teacher: 20 years ago 60+ pupils per teacher was common, ten years ago 50+ pupils per teacher was common&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Even now 40+ pupils per teacher is common and this number is not acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>Has the Minister reached a decision with regard to corporal punishment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;With the decrease in class size there has been an obvious decline in the use of corporal punishment</P>
      <P>2.  Reduced pressures on teachers: With the advent of the New Curriculum and the freedom given to the teacher to teach children at their own level according to their various abilities and backgrounds there is far less pressure on either pupil or teacher than there was before when set standards were demanded by a subject-centred curriculum.</P>
      <P>3.  Since the abolition of the Primary Certificate and local scholarships there is less pressure on schools from the system, from parents and society to see that certain standards were met and maintained. These standards, we contend, were often quite false and gave an artificial picture of the abilities of schools and children.  They also put pupils and teachers under severe and unnecessary psychological pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  Under the old system school inspection was often very severe and <Col N="807" /> could put a school under an amount of strain.  Children were warned &lsquo;the cigire is coming&rsquo; or even after the days of H.E. teachers competed to get &lsquo;an mhaith&rsquo; or even the coveted &lsquo;sár mhaith&rsquo; as such marks helped in no small way to advance promotion.  The cigire bogey-man syndrome is happily no longer with us and this has relaxed teachers in no small way.  Inspection is now carried out in a positive and helpful manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>&mdash;&mdash;It was not uncommon up to ten years ago to have two classes of 50 sharing the one room.  Under the old curriculum which gave little room for <Col N="808" /> flexibility this demanded extremely strict discipline which taxed pupils and teachers alike.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that with the introduction of the New Curriculum and the removal of many of the pressures on schools there is now a far more relaxed atmosphere in Primary Schools.  Discipline is not so rigid. Rules are not so sacrosanct.  Children have more scope for their abilities. Interesting and enjoyable subjects are more to the fore.  Children like coming to school.  Staffs are more relaxed and at ease among themselves.  Principals view themselves as leaders of a team. Neither is it a coincidence that with these improvements children are more interested and the use of corporal punishment has diminished greatly.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that in any organised grouping there have to be rules&mdash;written or understood&mdash;and that infringements of these rules normally call for sanctions of some sort or other.  Schools are no exception to this rule.  Schools must be orderly places in which children can learn. Disturbances of the good order of a school or class normally affect the whole school or staff and disorderly or unruly children can and do prevent other children from learning.  Most normal, healthy children will be disorderly from time to time and if they are not checked can and do become uncontrollable.  No teacher can teach and no pupil can learn in a disorderly situation.  Therefore, it would seem logical that to maintain a reasonable order in schools and to check unruly children, certain sanctions may be considered necessary and useful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>All forms of punishment and sanction depend upon the relationship between parent and child or teacher and pupil.  Most misdemeanours can be, and are dealt with by a verbal reprimand or a word of advice.  Also, it must be borne in mind that discipline is more and more geared to the individual child, his development and personality.  Pupil/teacher relationship can be improved with smaller class sizes in which the teacher, besides having a more manageable group of children, has the opportunity of knowing each child at a personal and social level and is able to deal <Col N="810" /> with each at an individual level. Stories of sanctions taken outside the context of pupil/teacher relationships can be, and often are misunderstood&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This amendment is necessary in order to tie apportionments under this section to the position obtaining in 1977, the last year in which rates were a cost factor in rents.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is the section which purports to pass on rates relief in respect of the years 1977 and 1978 to tenants of rented dwellings.  I believe this section is wholly ineffective.  It does not effectively pass on to tenants the relief given by this Bill to landlords.  It is significant to note, before considering how effective the section is, that it really applies only to those who were tenants of private rented accommodation in 1977.  There is a free-for-all situation for those who for the first time become tenants of rented accommodation after 1 January 1978.</P>
      <P>The Bill presumes that the fact that private dwellings are not subject to rates will, in some way or another, reduce rents.  As far as I am aware this section affects only those who were tenants of rented accommodation in private dwellinghouses before 1 January this year. Of the thousands of tenants occupying rented accommodation, hardly any have had the benefit of this rate relief which the landlords enjoy.  The effect of the Bill is to provide a bonanza for landlords of private dwellings, who under the terms of letting agreements were obliged to pay the rates for their tenants or to indemnify the tenants against the rates.  The landlords are being relieved of the obligation to pay rates but the Bill fails hopelessly to ensure that this relief is passed on to the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until such time as the Bill becomes law the Minister cannot even pretend that the machinery was there to pass on rate relief.  The Minister says this Bill contains the machinery to enable the <Col N="847" /> tenant to recover from the landlord the rate content of the rent.  Tenants of flats in this city and throughout the country have been deprived of approximately £30 a year which they should have received if the Fianna Fáil manifesto meant anything.  As far as tenants are concerned, it meant nothing.  It was effective in one respect only, that is, to get their votes in the election on the promise that they would be relieved of rates.  That has not happened.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage, the Minister seemed to be convinced that the tenants had rights under this Bill which they could enforce.  The only tenants who have any rights under this Bill are those living in controlled premises.  I understand the number of controlled premises forms a very small percentage of dwellings let by private landlords.  The tenants of such premises have rights because the amount payable in respect of rent and payable in respect of rates is clearly spelled out and the rent is increased each year as rates go up.  Tenants can now refuse to pay that.  However, there is nothing at all to prevent landlords in these cases from terminating tenancies which existed before this Bill became law.  It has not yet become law.  A landlord may serve a notice to quit and negotiate a new tenancy which would provide for a higher rent.</P>
    <P>As from 1 January this year there appears to be a free-for-all situation.  The market is supposed to operate in favour of the tenant but we know that young married people are being forced more and more to rely on rented accommodation in the private sector.  The Minister is forcing people off the local authority housing list by insisting that those with incomes of more than £70 per week are not to be considered for local authority housing.  That forces people to search for flats and other accommodation in the private sector.  Furthermore, since the Government came into power it has become impossible for people of modest income to provide housing for themselves because the price of houses has greatly increased.  The latest bulletin from the Minister's Department shows that the price of a private house has increased <Col N="848" /> by more than £2,000 since 1 January 1978.  The mortgage interest rate has also increased dramatically this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The effect of this is to push these people onto the private sector with the result that competition has become keener and rents will soar.  This Bill does not provide for the passing on of the rates, with which the Minister bought votes in 1977, to the tenants.  Having made that statement, I challenge the Minister to tell me how tenants who were in occupation before 1977 and tenants who had taken up residence during 1977 and before 1 January 1978 can effectively recover the rates from which their landlords have been exempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This section places an obligation on landlords who, before 1 January 1978, paid the rates on dwellings occupied by their tenants and who benefit by an allowence granted under the Bill, to make to the tenant a corresponding allowance in the rent.  This section does not apply to small dwellings within the meaning of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, whether owned privately or by a local authority; these are dealt with by sections 6 and 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1), in addition to what I have already said, specifies the amount of the allowance to which a tenant is entitled. Two situations are covered in subsection (1).  The first is where the tenant was in occupation immediately before 1 January 1977.  Here the tenant is entitled in 1977 to an allowance equal to that by which the landlord benefited as a result of the 25 per cent relief of domestic rates.  For 1978 and subsequent years, he is entitled to four times this allowance. In other words, the total rate has been taken off.  The second situation arises where a tenant has come into occupation of a dwelling sometime during 1977.  Here no allowance is due to the tenant in 1977, since only the reduced <Col N="849" /> rates were a cost factor in providing the accommodation in that year.  However, for 1978 and subsequent years the tenant is entitled to an allowance equal to the three-quarters rates which influenced his rent for 1977.</P>
    <P>These illustrations assume that the dwelling comprises the whole of the premises on which the rating authority had made a rates allowance.  Where this is not so, subsection (1) allows landlord and tenant to agree on an appropriate portion of the aforementioned amounts as the size of the allowance to which the tenant is entitled.  Failing agreement between landlord and tenant on this apportionment, the provisions of subsections (2) to (4) can be availed of.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that where a rented dwelling is not separately valued, the landlord or the tenant concerned may apply to the rating authority to have the valuation apportioned for the purposes of this section.  The rating authority must notify both landlord and tenant of their decision and indicate that it may be appealed to the Commissioner of Valuation.  The landlord is then obliged to publicise this to the tenants of other dwellings which may be affected, for example, those forming part of the same valuation complex.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for the coming into force of apportionments under subsection (2).  If no appeal is taken, an apportionment becomes operative at the end of the 30-day period within which appeals may be taken.  If an appeal is taken, the apportionment comes into force on the day after the Commissioner's decision or on the appeal being withdrawn.  The coming into force of a decision refers to the stage at which the decision is absolutely final and beyond the reach of any possible revision.  Decisions, when they come into force, will of course have retrospective effect in 1978 and, where appropriate, in 1977.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) spells out the amount of the allowance due to a tenant whose valuation has been apportioned under subsection (2).  The formulae involved apply in exactly the same way to an apportioned valuation as do the rules of <Col N="850" /> subsection (1) to a dwelling which comprises the whole of a valuation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides for the recovery by a tenant from a landlord of any allowance due under this section as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to controlled rents.  Controlled rented accommodation comprises 40 per cent of rented accommodation.  As well as that, there are undoubtedly people who had agreements with regard to rates, agreement under which tenants have taken responsibility for rates.  This type of tenant would have no problem in being exempted from rates.  In cases where landlords have failed to reach agreement with their tenants, this section gives tenants access to the court in order to get the benefit of derating.  This course is open to any tenant who feels aggrieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also said that the landlord could come along the following day and give notice to quit.  This is not anything new in regard to rented accommodation. Landlords could have given notice to quit at any time under existing law.  There is no departure in that respect, no change in existing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The point is that if a determination is made that people will be entitled to a reduction because of this measure, landlords can serve notice to quit and negotiate a new lease which would have the effect of increasing the overall charge.</P>

      <P>It is up to themselves what they negotiate.  This gives people access to the courts.  We have had a lot of discussion on this during the Second Stage and outside the House in the past months.  A lot of thought and work went into producing the best possible way of achieving exemption from rates for rented accommodation.  Despite all these criticisms, not one amendment or a better proposal has come from either of the parties opposite although it would have been possible for them, without risk of being ruled out of order from the point of view of putting a charge on public <Col N="851" /> funds, to have put down an amendment. This is the best way to make it possible for these people to benefit, or to have access to the courts if they do not get their rights.</P>

      <P>We answer for ourselves only, not for the journalists.  I regret the Minister has taken up so much of the valuable time of the parliamentary draftsman in producing what I on Second Stage called this legislative gobbledegook. The Minister did not have to go much further than his own manifesto to find a very clear understanding by the people who drafted the fine print of what the situation would be.  In the manifesto it is stated that there would be no rates content in regard to private rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Minister is being less than fair, particularly to Deputy Fitzpatrick and me, if he suggests he is trying to assign rights to people, because he knew on 20 May 1977, when this manifesto was published, that unless an effort was made to change the landlord and tenant laws this kind of legislation is nonsense. That is my verdict on section 5 and I will support it with some observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately they have to be incomplete observations because the Minister responsible does not have the basic statistics available.  I asked a number of questions for written reply in relation to the number of flats and tenants and all matters related to lettings <Col N="852" /> in order to evaluate the effects of section 5 and I got a reply to the effect that the information was not available.  We have here evidence of a lack of basic homework on the part of the Minister and the Department.  They cannot plead that the legislation has been hurried, that it had to be produced in a short time. They did not see fit to produce the statistical data in relation to the situation&mdash;what are the numbers and what is happening?</P>
    <P>Because the Minister has not seen fit to produce that data we can rely only on partial studies.  But when Deputy Fitzpatrick attempted to quote from such data the Minister's reply was that it was a partial study.  It would be nice to have even a partial study coming from that side of the House, but we have nothing coming from there in regard to flat dwellers. In the regrettable absence of such information, let us have a look at what we have, partial though it may be.  The first is a survey published by the National Flat Dwellers' Association.  I will give it to the recorders later on so that they can get the necessary references, and if it is not already in the Library I will ensure it will go there for official reference.  It is dated 16 March, and I will begin to quote from the first page:</P>
    <P>Rates abolition benefits 8,000 landlords but not the 130,000 tenants in private rented accommodation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is the main finding of a recent survey carried out by the Rathmines Branch of the N.F.A. (National Flat Dwellers' Association).  The Rathmines Branch dealt with 70 complaints from tenants from January 1st-February 28th.  The only tenant who benefited from Rates Abolition paid rates directly to the Corporation. The other 69 tenants had rates included in rent paid to their landlords but failed to benefit.</P>
    <P>It was decided to survey a street of houses let in flats to (i), determine whether landlords are consistently refusing to pass on the benefit of Rates Abolition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey goes on to clarify that situation.  Legally, landlords would not have been in a position to pass on the benefits of the aboltion of rates because it would have been Christmas 1977 before they would have paid the second half of the rates due.  I will resume my quotation from the survey:</P>
      <P>It was decided to survey a street of houses let in flats to (i) determine whether landlords are consistently refusing to pass on the benefit of rates abolition to tenants by reducing rents proportionately; (ii) collect up-to-date information on rents, repairs, conditions and so on of tenancies and (iii) check whether landlords are complying with legal requirements...</P>

      <P>The fact is that virtually none of the tenants in private rented accommodation, where the separate dwellings were not separately apportioned, benefited from the abolition of rates.  The benefit the landlords got was not passed on to the tenants.  I wanted to check, for my own information, if the survey carried out by the National Flat Dwellers' Association was consistent or reasonable and I got the Ranelagh Branch of the Labour Party to carry out a similar survey.  The NFDA survey was carried out on a particular road in the middle of &ldquo;flatland&rdquo; and it came up with <Col N="854" /> a picture for that road, but we decided to do a spot check on a number of roads in the centre of &ldquo;flatland&rdquo; in Ranelagh.  The number of roads surveyed was ten, the number of houses was 21 with 80 flats. We received 18 replies in the 21 houses. According to the conclusions of that survey the number of houses in which tenants received a reduction was one in which there were two flats.  The number of houses in which no reduction was received was ten with 48 flats.  The number in which tenants spoken to had moved in after 1 January and, therefore, were not in a position to benefit, was 38 flats and the number of houses in which the tenant claimed special agreement with the landlord and that the rebate did not apply was one house, two flats.  In the absence of official surveys and statistical information, which I have complained about, the one reasonable conclusion I can come to is that, in so far as one can assess private rented accommodation, bedsitters and furnished accommodation, the benefit landlords received due to the abolition of rates in 1978 was not passed on to tenants.</P>
      <P>This is an extraordinary situation.  If one compares this provision in the Bill with other provisions one has the extraordinary situation whereby landlords, who consistently argue in their public utterances through a landlords' association that they are in the business of providing accommodation, have not given tenants voluntarily the benefit of the abolition of rates.  The inadequate and partisan survey which I have referred to&mdash;the only surveys carried out in relation to this matter&mdash;shows that the overwhelming majority of tenants did not receive that benefit.  Curiously enough, the people who will not get the benefit of the abolition of rates are those responsible for the running of the Iveagh Hostel, the Salvation Army Hostel, youth hostels or guest houses.  Those people argue that they are in business, some of it of a voluntary kind like An Óige, and others of a straightforward commercial kind like guest houses.  But they have been denied the benefit of the abolition of rates while landlords have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that he is attempting <Col N="855" /> to confer on tenants the benefit of the abolition of rates and that is as far as he can go as Minister for the Environment without having specific responsibility for landlord and tenant law&mdash; that football is still being kicked very adroitly between the Department of Justice and the Department of the Environment. He may tell us that that is the only way he can give effect to the commitment outlined in the manifesto.  What is the commitment in the manifesto?  It signals to all that there was never any serious intention of conveying to tenants sufficient legal powers to benefit from the rights that would result in the abolition of rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked us, presumably with tongue in cheek, why we did not put down amendments.  The House is well aware why we did not.  The technicalities involved in trying to amend this section are complex enough; but any kind of amendment would undoubtedly result in a reduction in money to somebody and therefore would run the possibility of an increase in expenditure and be ruled out of order by the Chair.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already told us that it took a lot of time to draft this section. It is not reasonable to ask Opposition Members to draft additional complex amendments for a complex and contradictory section.  There is in this section a total absence of statistical knowledge of the field of private rented accommodation.  We are aware of the position with regard to other aspects of our housing.  I asked the Minister questions six weeks ago about this matter and replies to those questions would have provided a reasonable basis for a rational discussion of this aspect of our housing.</P>
    <P>The document produced by the National Flat Dwellers' Association claims that there were 120,000 tenants living in private rented accommodation in Dublin in 1971, based on the 1971 census.  They also claim that there were 300,000 such tenants in the State.  The assessment made by the NFDA, using the 1971 figures, is that it could be calculated that the cost of abolishing rates on houses let in flats would be approximately £3.4 million for Dublin in <Col N="856" /> 1978 and, allowing for a 10 per cent population increase, the real cost would probably be £3.78 million.  They stated that it would cost the taxpayer a minimum of about £8.5 million to remove rates from flats in the entire State in 1978.  Has the Minister an estimate of the cost of such a provision? The NFDA stated that the giving away of that kind of money into a business sector could only be justified if the tenants got the benefit but it was clear that the tenants did not get the benefit.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell further on the narrow point of the cost of the abolition of rates on private rented accommodation, the area which is not controlled.  In case there is any doubt about this, I am not talking about purpose-built dwellings where the occupier is the listed ratepayer.  I am not talking about the numbers of flats converted some time ago, where there were separate valuations and where the occupier was the listed ratepayer.  I am talking about the vast bulk of flats and bed-sitters where many young people live and where there is no such distinction.  In many cases there is not even a multiple dwelling valuation, because the valuation is the old valuation when the property was a single-family dwelling.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we do not have accurate statistical information.  It is all the more regrettable when one considers that this measure was contemplated for more than a year.  In the absence of such official statistical information we have some evidence to suggest, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that only 10 per cent of such people are getting the benefit of the abolition of rates.  If the cost to the State of the abolition of rates is in the region of £8.5 million how does the Minister justify it?  Will his entire case rest on the fact that he has conferred on flat dwellers the legal right to pursue landlords into the courts to get back the money?  He is far too experienced to be accused of being naive in this respect. He and his party must stand accused of being totally cynical because they know, as the Pringle Report on Law Reform has clearly indicated, that a substantial number of cases requiring free legal aid involve landlord and tenant issues. <Col N="857" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick, as a solicitor, will testify that most solicitors would run a mile rather than take a case pursuing a tenant's right to set out in this legislation in order to get the benefit of no more than £100.  The cost of going to court would be hardly worth while.  The workability of this measure is seriously in question.</P>
    <P>Earlier today the Minister argued that some sections of this legislation should stand on the grounds that they were administratively feasible and that proposed amendments from me&mdash;such as the one with regard to the statute acre&mdash;should be ruled out.  He implied that while it might be more equitable it would be inconvenient from the administrative point of view.  I would argue that there is a considerable administrative inconvenience of one kind or another in attempting to make this section work.  I would ask the Minister to give us some information regarding statistical data in his Department on this matter.  Before proceeding to assess how these formulae might function effectively, has the Minister any answer to the statistical questions I posed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer the Deputy very quickly with regard to the statistical questions.  If the census had been held when it should have been held the information would have been readily available, but the census were not held because of a decision by the Coalition Government.  We would have the information at our fingertips had the census been held and it would have been the most accurate information available.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides for the recovery by a tenant from a landlord of any allowance due under this section as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Until this Bill becomes law the tenant could not take these proceedings.  Now there is nothing to stop the aggrieved tenants taking the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn questioned the statement in the Fianna Fáil Manifesto that there will be no rates content in rent. Rates have been abolished as from 1 January 1978.  Whatever other factors <Col N="858" /> may be included in rent, rates cannot be included.  With regard to recovery, the procedures are available: access to the courts which makes it possible for the tenant to recover the amount.</P>
    <P>With regard to the surveys, while I do not dispute Deputy Quinn's survey of 21 houses that were visited, I would point out they were visited at an early stage. Those people who were not given the benefit of the rates remission at that stage could not have started proceedings by letter but they can do so when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>The only way to have accurate information and statistics for the Deputy in a matter like this is by means of a census. The corporation and other local authorities attempt to do it but the information could not be described as accurate. Probably this is not due to any fault of the local authorities.  A census would have got the necessary information but the information is not available to us.  I do not have to give the reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister said it with tongue in cheek.  He said it was the best advice he and his Department could produce to ensure that thousands of tenants in this city and throughout the country would benefit from the derating of private dwellings.  The Minister commented on the fact that this side of the House did not put down any amendments. He should be fair about this.  He knows perfectly well that we cannot put <Col N="859" /> down amendments.  They might be held to impose a charge on the Exchequer and the Minister also knows that they might be ruled out of order for another reason.  It would be ruled out under the Long Title of this Bill:</P>
      <P>An act to provide for certain reliefs in relation to the payment of rates to make other provisions with respect or in relation to rates, to make provisions regarding local government, and to make other provisions connected with the foregoing.</P>
      <P>Any amendment we put down would be a Rent Act amendment.  It would be said to come within the Rent Act code and the Chair would rule it out of order.  The Minister should not try to put across a quick one like that, when he knows such an amendment would be ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>I concede that the tenants of controlled premises can effectively benefit from this rate relief, but I want the Minister's statement that 40 per cent of rented dwellings are controlled.  Forty per cent of what?  Dwellings built since 1960, I think, are not controlled at all.  A great many others built since 1940 are not controlled.  Over the past 20 or 25 years, various means and devices have been used to decontrol premises for a variety of reasons.  If the landlord gets possession because of a change of tenant they become decontrolled.  If the poor law valuation is over a certain figure&mdash;and a figure is quite low&mdash;the premises are decontrolled.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Minister to substantiate his statement that 40 per cent are controlled.  He knows perfectly well that practically none of the flats in the city of Dublin are controlled.  Because they are furnished flats, or alleged to be furnished flats, they are not controlled.  I do not know what the Minister meant when he talked about 40 per cent.  I am talking about all rented private dwelling units.  I challenge the Minister to prove to me that 40 per cent of them are controlled. In one street in Rathmines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is flatland now.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, lobbied the flat dwellers of this city before the last general election. They had them in here in Leinster House and told them what they would do for them and how they would relieve them of burdens.  They probably got some information then about Rathmines.  In one street in Rathmines where there are 51 houses and 274 flats only four per cent of the houses are controlled and 1 per cent of the flats.  How could the Minister possibly establish that 40 per cent of all controlled when we know, as a matter of common sense, that 40 per cent of all rented accommodation cannot be controlled.</P>
      <P>In 1978 the Minister paid out £3,444,000 to flat landlords in this city and about £8,500,000 to flat landlords throughout the country.  I am satisfied that a mere fraction of that got passed on to the tenants.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself.  A promise was made in June 1977 to derate private dwellings and to ensure that the tenants would get the benefit of that derating. The Government took office in July 1977 and, 18 months later in the dying days of 1978, not alone have the tenants not got the benefit of this derating, but the Minister and the Government have done nothing to provide the machinery to enable them to benefit or even to pretend that they could benefit.  Section 5 is not yet law and the Minister has done very little to make it law.</P>

There is no point in the Minister saying that the question does not arise after 1 January 1978 because there were no rates.

There is a perfectly logical, coherent argument.  I believe the Minister should take this out of the Bill, or introduce another section or even another Bill.  If it is impossible to do this he should come clean with the tenants and tell them that in his anxiety to get into office and get their votes he made promises which he cannot fulfil.  He should tell them that his best is not good enough because it is impossible to devise a formula which will pass on rate relief to tenants.  He should tell them he is very sorry but that he made those promises in good faith.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Before putting the question I want to give Deputy Quinn some accurate information he asked for.  I mentioned that we did not have a census a few years ago which would have given us the necessary information.  For the Deputy's information the 1971 census gave good information which might be of interest, but it could be out of date.</P>
      <P>Local authority rented accommodation at that time amounted to 112,320, rented as unfurnished, 59,264&mdash;which would correspond to the controlled rents because those people could not be put out of their accommodation&mdash;rented as furnished, 17,360, that is the relevant figure in this discussion&mdash;and occupied free of rent 16,877.  That figure was made up of caretakers of large premises and such people.  The 1971 census gave those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made it possible for people to go to court and get their rights under Section 5 of this Bill.  It would not be possible to do that without this legislation which, hopefully, will be enacted shortly.  But there is another reason, too. In the area mentioned, Rathmines, there would be many multiple tenancies, perhaps four or five tenants to each flat. Except in cases where there is agreement that the tenant would pay the rates, I assume that any house let in a number of flats would have to be apportioned for rates as between the landlord and tenants in order to arrive at a true figure. To enable this to be done for 1978 each case would have had to be submitted at the end of 1977.  Therefore, that is a valid reason for a delay on the side of both landlord and tenant in arriving at <Col N="867" /> the proper figure.  The lists will be going in again at the end of 1978.  These apportionments could be and should be included and the Bill gives to the tenant the right to ensure that the apportionments are included.  The same applies to the landlord.  Either landlord or tenant can do this by getting in touch with the secretary of his local authority.  This would involve a further delay but an unavoidable delay in the circumstances I have outlined.  I am reasonably confident that this section can be made to work and that we can fulfil our commitment in this regard.  All the factors will be teased out when the apportionments are made.</P>
    <P>Regarding the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick on the question of a person entering a tenancy in 1978, I do not know whether compensation should be paid.  There is no way in which there could be compensation for rates in such a case because of there not being rates on the premises in 1978.  Therefore, I do not know what exactly the Deputy means.  The rent to be paid is a matter to be decided on between the tenant and the landlord in cases of private lettings, but there is no way in which rates could be regarded as a cost factor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Chair's concern in this matter and I shall endeavour not to be repetitive in any way.  However, I asked the Minister for some statistical information and in addition to saying that there was not a census&mdash;a decision which I regretted very much at the time&mdash;the Minister offered the statistics that were to hand but admitted that these were very limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Consequently, they would be out of date.  As one who is not a stranger to the property business generally, the Minister will understand readily that the census information might not necessarily be an accurate reflection of the situation on the ground regarding the number of houses converted into flats and which would therefore directly concern the people who would benefit as a result of section <Col N="868" /> 5.  It was for this reason that I asked about the number of landlords of private rented houses who have registered with each local authority as well as asking a number of similar questions that were for written answer on 14 November.  In all instances I was told that the information was not available in the Department. I can only accept that official reply but it is a reply that indicates something extraordinary so far as the Department are concerned in that they do not even have this information monitored from the local authorities. The Minister has claimed that in section 5 and with these formulae which we have not discussed in any detail&mdash;we are talking about the section in general terms&mdash;he has, with hand on heart, done the best job possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Not with hand on heart.  I believe that I have done the best job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. He has done the best job possible in protecting the property interests of landlords.  If we consider the legal system and if we consider the effectiveness within which a tenant who might benefit under section 5 would derive that benefit, we find that the person whose interests are protected best by this section is not the tenant but the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances would the Minister consider restructuring the entire section in order to give it the opposite effect?  Indeed, having regard to the case made by the Minister in respect of guesthouses on the basis that they are businesses and also to the case made in respect of such premises as hostels and in order to pick up the gap in statistical terms between what we have officially in terms of statistics in respect of known furnished property and the reality which is much greater, would the Minister not consider withdrawing the section and coming back to the House on Report Stage with a section on the lines that a house which is a multi-dwelling but having attached to it a single rateable valuation would not benefit from the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings until such time as each dwelling was apportioned and valued separately within each local <Col N="869" /> authority?  In other words, would the Minister not put the onus back to where it belongs, that is, on the landlord, the person who purports to be running a business?  In the case of a house in Pembroke Road, for instance, there could be ten or eleven separate flats and if the landlords of such houses were to be told that until such time as they seek apportionment and have the valuations calculated, they will not benefit from the abolition of domestic rates, there would follow the two-fold effect, first, of bringing into the open the real number of rented dwellings and also of bringing to the attention of the Minister for Finance a certain number of subterranean factors which are related to this area.</P>
    <P>In so far as we can talk about alternative directions to section 5 we can talk only within the context of departmental responsibility. Much as I would support matters of tax relief in respect of the private rented sector, since it is the only sector that is not in receipt of any State subsidy, the Minister has it within his power, should he so choose, to come down on the side of the tenants and not on the side of the property owners, to reverse the sense and direction of section 5 so that the onus is on the landlord to have his dwelling or dwellings so valued that each separate letting or dwelling is separately apportioned and valued with the local authority.  Then all the formulas would be redundant.  The onus would be on the landlord.</P>
    <P>The benefit to the community would be that landlords who are serious about the business of providing accommodation would benefit from the abolition of rates and therefore would be able to reduce their costs relative to others.  The professional landlords would have a cost incentive which those outside the system would not enjoy.  Secondly, local authorities would have a much clearer picture of the number of dwellings in their area which are sub-divided.  We certainly do not have this picture as a result of the non-answer to my question. There would not be an onus on the tenant to take the landlord into court.</P>
    <P>If the Minister asks the opinion of any practising Fianna Fáil solicitor as to the <Col N="870" /> workability of that section if a tenant seeks redress against a landlord, he will say it would be a waste of time to take on such a case because of the costs involved. He would probably direct the tenant to a free legal aid centre.  The FLAC report states that a large number of the cases requiring free legal aid involve landlord and tenant law where the tenant is seeking redress against the landlord.  The Pringle Report supports that statement.</P>
    <P>The Minister challenged us as to why we did not suggest amendments.  The cards are in the Minister's hands in this regard because any amendment which would require redrafting the whole section would undoubtedly be ruled out of order.  If the Minister is serious about promises made to tenants, it is within his power to change the bias and direction of the section.  We will be opposing the section because it is legal nonsense.  If it is passed it will be bad law cluttering the Statute Book and possibly cluttering the courts.  The Minister can withdraw this section and come back on Report Stage with a provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>To exclude these premises from derating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to exclude from derating those premises for which the landlord has not sought separate apportionments from the local authority.  The onus would not be on the tenant to seek his rights.  The onus would be on the landlord to benefit from the abolition of rates by complying with requests which are already implicit in the bye-laws of a whole range of local authorities under the 1966 Housing Act regarding rented accommodation.  In Dublin only 11 per cent of landlords so register their property.  If the Minister wants to do his best for the tenants and not the property owners he can put the onus on the landlord to apply for the apportionment and until such time as the apportionment is made the rates would be payable. Who is likely to suffer from that?  It is certainly not the tenants because in the vast majority of cases they have not benefited from the abolition of rates.  The survey of the National Flatdwellers' Association and our own survey would <Col N="871" /> support that.  In any case, it applies only for a certain length of time.  Anybody coming in after 1978 is not eligible.  The only people who would suffer would be those landlords who insist that they remain underground, and they are enabled by this provision to remain underground.</P>
      <P>On numerous occasions we have tried to establish who in the Government benches has specific responsibility for the whole area of landlord and tenant law.  The ball has been adroitly kicked between one Department and another. The Department of the Environment have a partial responsibility with regard to flat dwellers but not in the area of landlord and tenant law.  This would be an opportunity for the Minister to strengthen the position of tenants, the only people in the housing sector for whom he has specific responsibility who get no direct State subsidy of any kind.  I propose that the Minister should withdraw this section and make the changes necessary to make the Bill much more beneficial to the community, especially those who depend for accommodation on the private rented sector.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn mentions the re-imposition of rates.  The apportionment could not yet have taken place for <Col N="872" /> the purposes of this Bill.  Our manifesto undertaking was to abolish rates and the Deputy is now suggesting we should reimpose rates in certain cases or on certain classes.  What he is suggesting could victimise the tenant.  There could be landlords who have already reached agreement with tenants regarding a reduction, even without apportionment. I am sure there are landlords who have already given reductions.  We would be victimising some tenants also.</P>
      <P>Our commitment was to derate the domestic sector and we have no intention now or at any time in the future of re-imposing rates on domestic dwellings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I refer to section 5 (2) and I want to bring home to the House how absurd this section is.  Let us take the case of a tenant in occupation of a flat in 1977 and 1978 whose landlord refused to give any allowance for rates relief. The tenant has now left the flat and moved somewhere else and finds that the sum of £50 or £100 is due to him.  If he is not satisfied with the landlord's offer the unfortunate tenant will have to apportion the valuation of the house of which the dwelling is part in order to enforce his rights.  The first thing he will have to do is to ask the local authority to apportion the valuation.  If the local authority move as quickly as they usually move, it will be some considerable time before they apportion the valuation and serve notice on the tenant.  If the tenant is still not satisfied&mdash;and we must assume that he would have reasonable cause for being dissatisfied&mdash;he must then go to court under section 7.  If he is going to a District Court in Dublin or in some other busy area he will be delayed there for an indefinite time.  He will eventually be informed of the apportionment sometime in 1979.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary part of this subsection is that the apportionment will not become effective, as is usual, from the date of application but from the date on which the District Court gives a decision, which could be a couple of years after the date of application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having got that valuable work carried out by the local authority and the <Col N="873" /> District Court, he will be able to calculate what is due to him under the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  If the landlord is still unreasonable, the tenant will have to go to the Circuit Court or the District Court to sue the landlord.  By 1985, if he is lucky, he will have what the Fianna Fáil manifesto promised.</P>

      <P>I am against this section.  I am not against derating in an orderly way.  It was part of Coalition and Fine Gael policy to derate private houses in an orderly way consistent with the ability of the economy to pay.  However, I am against this monstrosity of a section which leads people to believe it will work.  The Minister started by saying that it was the best that could be got. Later he said he was reasonably satisfied that it would work.  If those are not watery undertakings to the unfortunate flat dwellers, I do not know what they are.  I am against this section because it is a legal monstrosity.  Even solicitors who are prepared to help their clients will be frightened by the formulae in this section.  The section is absurd and it should be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This section applies the 25 per cent relief of domestic rates which obtained in 1977 to the occupiers of small dwellings.  These comprise all tenants of local authority rented dwellings and all tenants of privately rented dwellings whose valuation is less than £6.  A higher limit obtains in certain urban areas.  Termination of rates supplements to the rents of small dwellings as regards 1978 and future years is provided for in section 18 of the Bill.  Occupiers of small dwellings did not pay rates as such; this was the responsibility of the owner. However, the owner was empowered to recover the rates from the tenant by means of a series of additions to the rent spread over the whole rental year. Where the owner of the small dwelling was the local authority actually responsible for levying the rate, the power to make these additions was section 9 of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928.  In every other case, contributions in lieu of rates were imposed under section 6 of the 1928 Act.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) provides for a one-quarter reduction in 1977 of all rates-linked supplements to rents levied by local authorities on their tenants under section 9 of the 1928 Act.  Subsection (2) provides for a similar reduction in rent supplements arising from the 1977 rate which are levied under section 6 of the 1928 Act.  Subsection (3) prevents a local authority from making any rates linked addition to a rent under section 9 of the 1928 Act on or after 1 January 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) places a similar prohibition on local authorities operating under section 6 of the 1928 Act.  Section 6 of the 1928 Act applies where a local authority owns a rented dwelling but is not the rating authority for the area in which the dwelling is situated, for example, Dublin Corporation providing houses in parts of Ballymun and elsewhere.  Section 9 will recoup them the amount of any such loss by means of <Col N="878" /> the State grant.  Subsection (5) makes it clear that owners of small dwellings qualify in 1977 for discount on prompt payment of rates if they tendered three-quarters only of the amounts previously prescribed.  These former amounts were eight-tenths of the rates in the case of Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire and nine-tenths elsewhere.  The other fractions mentioned in the subsection represent three-quarters of these amounts.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill safeguards tenants of privately-owned small dwellings against rates-linked additions to rent in respect of rates for 1978 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>These amendments are inter-connected. In dealing with the amendment of a rate, the original draft referred only to the power common to all local authorities which is set out in section 60 of the Local Government Act, 1941.  In fact, Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the four county borough corporations also enjoy the option of amending a rate under the particular Acts applying to the management system in their areas.  The draftsman has considered it more convenient to list these Acts, together with the Local Government Act, 1941, in a separate paragraph.</P>

    <P>This amendment gives more precise instructions to the Commissioner of Valuation about the apportionment of an hereditament used partly as a secondary school, community hall or farm building and partly for some other non-domestic <Col N="881" /> purpose.

This is consistent with the treatment of community halls and farm buildings in section 2 of the Bill where the specified valuation includes the buildings valuation only.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is an example of what I was talking about earlier.  Subsection (10) (b) as drafted reads:</P>
      <P>Subsection (9) of this section shall not apply in relation to any application under this section which is received by the Commissioner during the period beginning on the passing of this Act and ending on the 31st day of December, 1978.</P>
      <P>In the absence of the Ceann Comhairle I complained about the treatment of the Bill in this House and the disregard shown for the people who are entitled to benefit. That is shown very clearly by the subsection as originally drafted.  The Minister is extending the date to March 1979.  I wonder if that is long enough? When will the Bill become law and when will the people know about it?  With the intervention of Christmas and so on I doubt if an extension to 31 March 1979 is long enough.

    <P>(b)  a further such determination or decision is made in relation to such hereditament,</P>
    <P>and where a further such determination or decision is made as regards a particular hereditament, the determination shall have effect only as regards a local financial year which is subsequent to that in which the determination or decision is made.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment adds a new subsection in order to clarify the span of life which an apportionment will enjoy.  An apportionment will operate indefinitely until either the overall valuation of the property is altered in the annual revision of valuation or a new apportionment is obtained.  Where the overall valuation is altered, the one-third which is subject to the £18 rule will apply again unless a new apportionment is obtained.  Where, without the overall valuation being altered, a new apportionment is sought and obtained, then this new amount will supersede the old apportionment.  If a second apportionment is applied for and obtained within the same year it may not take effect until the year following.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am not satisfied that this question of apportioning mixed hereditaments will not in effect lead to an increase in the overall valuation.  The Minister tells me that the Valuation Office will simply apportion the valuation and the total valuation will not be increased. I am concerned lest a valuation of £50 goes up for apportionment and comes back with a valuation of £40 on one part and £30 on the other and becomes a valuation of £70.  I am told the Valuation Office will only apportion, but I want to be assured by the Minister that the Valuation Office cannot increase the overall valuation.</P>
      <P>There is no use in giving me a pious assurance or hope that the Valuation Office will not do that.  History shows that once The Commissioner of Valuation is invited to inspect a premises, the end result is a very substantial increase in the valuation.  After this I will have something further to say.  I want an assurance that the Valuation Office will not have the authority to increase the overall valuation of the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy that assurance.  To revise a valuation upwards or downwards it has to be listed in the ordinary annual list for December.  It used to be the end of March.  Requests for revision must be submitted to the Valuation Office by mid-December and decisions are published in the revised valuation list in the following autumn. On the other hand, a request for an apportionment under this Bill may be made at any time, and a decision may also be given at any time by the Commissioner of Valuation.  The Commissioner is empowered to alter the overall valuation of a property only when it has been listed for revision by mid-December of the <Col N="886" /> previous year.  A request for an apportionment does not constitute a listing for revision.  It does not afford a basis for any alteration of an overall valuation. An apportionment means an apportionment and only that.  It must respect the overall valuation of which a breakdown is to be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): &mdash;&mdash;so that two or more new valuations can only add up to the total of the existing valuation.  This apportionment is done on the request of the rated occupier through the local authority.  For many years we have had the unjust method of revising some valuations and not revising others. Lucky people were not noticed and their valuations were not revised.  Unlucky people came to the knowledge of the rate collector and through him the county council, or the local authority, and eventually they were listed.  This new procedure will create difficulty and it will emphasise this unjust method of revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who wants an apportionment will have to go to the local authority and draw their attention to his hereditament and, in that way, the local <Col N="887" /> authority will get to know about it.  They will get a report from the rate collector, presumably, who will tell them what sort of a building it is and what state of repair it is in.  It is almost certain that in the next revision list going up to the Commissioner of Valuation this building will be listed for revision.  The Minister may say it will only be listed for revision if it merits revision, or if the local authority think it is the type of building which should be revised.  There is a lot in that argument.</P>
    <P>My objection is that it will come to the notice of the local authority only because it is brought to their notice by the occupier who wants to avail of what is supposed to be a benefit for him under this Bill by getting part of his house derated.  The end result might very well be that a man with a £50 valuation gets it apportioned this year and gets £30 on one half and £20 on the other, and next December the local authority will send the whole thing back to the Commissioner of Valuation for revision.  When the list comes down next year the valuation of the business end of the premises could be £60 or £70.</P>
    <P>From his own knowledge I do not think the Minister will seriously disagree with me when I say that is a very real possibility, a real probability.  He may argue that if it were not entitled to be revised, it would not be revised.  That is so, but the end result will be that the occupier will be worse off than he would have been if this derating had never been introduced.  As well as paying his own rates on the business part of the premises, the valuation of which will have become £70 instead of £50, he will also be paying part of the rates for his neighbour down the street who did not bother to have his rate apportioned and kept quite and let sleeping dogs lie.  His valuation can stay at £20 or £30.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was too low, would somebody else not have been paying his rates for years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I agree, and that is part of the inequity in the rating system.  I do <Col N="888" /> not believe we should use a measure like this, which is supposed to be a relief measure, to make people pay more.  Until the happy day when all valuations are revised and drawn on an equitable basis, there should be some assurance written into this legislation that local authorities will not list buildings for revision merely because they have been requested to apportion. That is a reasonable request. Otherwise people will be afraid to avail of their right to have these buildings apportioned. I go further and say that, even if they do not request an apportionment and even if they are satisfied to accept the one-third or £18, whichever is the lesser, they will still be brought to the notice of the rate collector, the rate inspector and the local authority and they will find their way to the Commissioner of Valuation who will revalue them.  The end position for the occupier will be more rates instead of derating.  I would like the Minister's view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum without an apportionment for derating purposes would be £18 or one-third.  This undoubtedly could be very unjust.  A ratepayer could have a reasonably sized building with a valuation of £100 and 75 per cent could be used for private dwellings. That person must be given the right to request an apportionment.  The Deputy's fear is that local authorities will utilise this because it will be brought to their attention.  These buildings to which he referred and said were undervalued were always there.  It could have happened that they came to the notice of the local authority and this usually happens when the lists are made out at the end of the year.  Lists are compiled of people who got grants or planning permission and are always available to local authorities.  One thing certain is that the request for an apportionment must be confined to the existing valuation.  That request can be made and carried out at any time during the year.  It is not confined to the time when the ordinary lists are going up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no good reason why local authorities would want to act the way Deputy Fitzpatrick said.  I have confidence in our local authority officials, <Col N="889" /> who try to treat people in an equitable and fair way.  For example, even without derating, if somebody built up a business which has a big turnover and the premises are on an exceptionally low valuation, somebody else has been paying his share of the rates.  In justice to other ratepayers his rates deserve to be revised.  This was true even before derating was introduced.  I have no reason to believe that simply because somebody applies for an apportionment the local authority will wait until the revision lists are issued and then take special note of it.  There is no good reason why the local authorities would do that and I trust them not to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister's last comment.  I can understand that local authorities would not be tempted to do such a thing if they were not continually stuck for cash&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the reality is that, irrespective of who sits in the Minister's seat from now on, the amount of money local authorities will get will be determined by a principal officer in the Department of Finance.  Say the three of us were in a local authority which was faced with demands for increased expenditure, living with the reality that we would get a percentage which would be announced before Christmas when the budget debate finally ended.  If we wanted to meet the objectives of the council, the only way we could reasonably do it would be to increase the tax base.  The way to increase the tax base would be to increase the value of the non-domestic valuations which would not be subject to the strictures of the Department of Finance.</P>

    <P>Contrary to what the Minister says, I have every belief and trust in local authorities.  I also believe in their ingenuity and astute management, of their cash resources, maximising the use of them.  It is reasonable to assume that, once the application for apportionment comes in, a manager or his assistant will be at least subject to the temptation of <Col N="890" /> saying that these apportionments are below what they would be if such a valuation was sought.  If such a valuation was sought and resulted in an increase in the non-residential part of it, it stands to reason that those local authorities would increase their revenue above and beyond whatever increase was sanctioned by the principal officer in the Department of Finance.  I think that was the reason Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the question.  I do not know the law as well as I should, but can a local authority itself request a revaluation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That being the case, within the context of this section becoming law is the Minister going to set up any monitoring procedure so that some astute official in a local authority is not put into a room by the manager, told to make a list of every application for apportionment and to make a parallel application for revaluation of those properties so that the tax base of the non-residential section of the local authority would increase?  The local authority that can produce an extra £30,000 or £40,000 above and beyond what it would normally have is a local authority in which the manager and his officials have that much more leeway.  Like the Minister, I have a high regard for the professionalism of our managers, but that possibility is there.  In the administration and application of this section does the Minister foresee such a possibility occurring and, if so, does he have any proposals within the context of this legislation to monitor it?  If so, what would those proposals be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way nor should there be any way in which I would deprive local authorities of a right they have always enjoyed with regard to revisions.  The impression I get from Deputy Quinn is that suddenly managers will decide to send a clerical officer or some such official into a room where there is a list of all those who applied for apportionments, asking the official to ensure that everybody on the list is included in the next revised list. The manager has no control over what <Col N="891" /> change might take place in valuations. That is a matter for the Valuation Office and the valuations could be either decreased or increased or they could be left unchanged.</P>

      <P>The matter is one entirely for the Valuation Office.  That has always been the case.  For several weeks I have listened to the Labour Party criticising me.  I was accused of stultifying local authorities, of interfering with their autonomy and I was told that I was only making rubber stamps of them but suddenly I am being asked to deprive them of rights they have always enjoyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The question does not arise in regard to monitoring because local authorities submit lists at their discretion while the Valuation Office decide on the valuations.  A tenant who is not satisfied with a valuation can ask for a different valuation officer or he can appeal to the Circuit Court.  This happens quite often.  Therefore, there is ample machinery to redress any unfairness that might be caused.  Since rates and valuations are a form of taxation surely no one can justify exceptionally low valuations. If, say, Deputy Quinn has a low valuation, Deputy Fitzpatrick and I are paying his rates.  Therefore, I do not understand how there can be any argument in this respect.</P>

Earlier to-day I expressed concern at the prospect of an already unsatisfactory and unequal tax base being distorted further by the provisions of section 2.

      <P>What I want to find out is whether, if the tax base of a local authority is significantly altered by way of using the provision in this section, combined with the existing rights enjoyed by local authorities in terms of valuations, there are any proposals to monitor the situation in respect of calculating the overall requirement of a local authority's needs for of a common year?  I am not suggesting that the rights should be interfered with in any way.  I simply wish to know whether the Minister will be doing the job in the Custom House that he is supposed to do, whether he will know the tax base for each local authority and also if he will monitor any significant change that may occur in the base.</P>

If there were the happy state of affairs in which the local authorities listed everybody, where all the valuations were up to date, there would be more equity in the rating system but we know that not everybody is listed, that people are listed on a hit-and-miss basis.  People are listed because their premises are brought to the attention of local authorities, usually by rate collectors or perhaps by some jealous neighbour but it is unreasonable that simply because a ratepayer wishes to avail of the Fianna Fáil manifesto promise, as implemented by this Bill, he should be listed for revision and have his valuation increased substantially. Indeed, I do not know how local authorities will avoid listing such people for revision but I will go further and say that failure to do so would be a dereliction of duty.</P>

The listing of such cases is <Col N="894" /> the end result of the Fianna Fáil manifesto and I do not think the Minister should make any apology for any local authority if it is considered that such people should be listed.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is unfair to people who have been revised that other people who should have been revised have escaped the net because of being able to keep hidden changes in premises that warrant revision.  In that situation it is unfair that people who avail of the right conferred on them to have portion of their buildings exempt from rates should finish up being brought to the notice of the local authority and having their premises listed for revision so that in effect the rates payable would be more than applied before.  There should be some way around that.  There is some provision, for instance, whereby a person who goes to the Garda for the purpose of invoking the law against somebody who has committed a major crime and while there brings to the notice of the Garda that he himself has committed a less serious crime is not prosecuted.  In other words, if in the course of notifying a crime a person brings to the notice of the Garda some small crime that he has committed, I think there is some rule or etiquette or something like that which provides that he is not prosecuted.  I have something like that in mind here.</P>

He is not worried about the people who are overpaying but the people who would suddenly have their valuation raised, which could have happened at any time. There is no way that any of us should try to justify this.  If a person has a ridiculously low valuation compared with his neighbour or neighbours, that person is not paying a fair share of rates, which is a local taxation.  I do not know why Deputy Fitzpatrick is so worried about them.  They could be revised at any time without any apportionment whatsoever and the apportionment itself will not revise them up or down.  What the local authority do to make the whole system of rates on properties&mdash;commercial now since the domestic is gone&mdash; more equitable, should not be criticised. It should be fair for everyone.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I will tell the Minister why I am concerned if he does not understand. Two people, A and B, are living in the same street in the same town.  Person A has a valuation of £30 and B has a valuation of £30.  A has a lockup shop; B has a mixed hereditament.  B thinks that there should be only £20 on the business part of his mixed hereditament and £10 on the dwelling part.  He goes to the county council, he has to bring that to their notice and it goes in 18 months' or two years' time to the Commissioner of Valuation.  The end result for B is that he ends up with £10 on the dwelling portion of his house and £50 on the shop portion.  Person A sits nice and quietly, does not do anything and he has a valuation of £30 all the time.  That is what I am objecting to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have no concern or worry if everybody was paying what he should be paying and if everybody's valuation was being brought up to date.  I have always objected to the hit and miss system of revision.  I object now to the provisions of this Bill which will intensify that hit and miss system of revision, as the Minister and the Minister of State, both of whom are well familiar with that I am talking about, know and they <Col N="896" /> cannot deny that what I am saying is not alone possible but probable.  I am not in favour of an unjust system of taxation.  I have always been in favour of a just system.  I am not in favour of one person paying another man's rates, but I am against this hit and miss system of revision.</P>
    <P>There is a long-established principle going down through the law and the courts that some person who seeks justly to avail of a relief in taxation or rates should not end up by having to pay more, as would happen here.  That is the principle I want to establish and there is nothing in it that I have to be ashamed of or to apologise to anybody for.</P>

      <P>Earlier to-day we were told that for administrative convenience it is not really worthwhile doing certain things like statistical studies on certain aspects of the matter or possibly equalising the land available to a house that would benefit from the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings.  Yet clearly we have here an instance where each local authority is going to be subjected to a detailed scrutiny by some official in the Department of the Environment to calculate the amount of refund that they would get by virtue of those properties that would have been vacant during the year and which consequently would not have had to pay the full rates.  I think I am right in reading it that way.  That being the case, I cannot understand how the Minister is reconciling a plea of administrative <Col N="900" /> inconvenience in one part of the process of this legislation with his acceptance that there is going to be an administrative inconvenience in this instance, because obviously it must take some time for the Department to administer this particular section.  Has any cost-benefit analysis been done as to what the benefit in terms of money that would be returned or saved to the local authority?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is if the Minister is seriously arguing that he is creating laws on that basis, then the financial constraints within which this legislation has been drafted must be even more severe than we realised on this side of the House as indeed must be the financial constraints within which the Minister is operating at the moment and within which he will have to operate in 1979.  The Minister's party colleagues in Dublin Corporation, when I was a member of the City Council, were very loud and vociferous about the inequity of the clawback with regard to the sale of local authority houses to individual tenant purchasers.  Is this not a clawback of a kind?  How is the Minister really reconciling this?  What kind of money is being saved as a percentage of the total amount of money that would be directly given to local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Well there is in effect a clawback.  Let us say, for argument's sake that the residential valuation base is 100 units; on a grant of £10 they were getting £1,000 and the average refund over the previous few years was less than that by 2 or 3 per cent.  The Minister is then clawing back that amount of money in the sense that he is denying it to them in the first instance. What are the figures involved in this? How much money would it cost to delete this section on the basis of the experience of previous years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="901" />
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes absolutely no difference because the local authority will either have never collected this money or they would have had to refund it.  It makes no difference and in this year it has presented no difficulty whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting into the most extraordinary nonsensical situation with regard to the local government taxation base.  Here is another example of it. The basis of a previous system of local taxation was that properties not being used by organisations or individuals and therefore not subject to the full rates were not obliged to pay their money. Now that the State will be paying for the funds in respect of a portion of the domestic dwellings we are going to have another distortion in the taxation base. This will have to be calculated.  Unless we take the gross valuation of a local authority and reduce it by a percentage which would average the normal refund or the normal vacancy rate, or whatever description it is given within the Department, we are going to now have two figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the calculation of revenue is concerned for any local authority, there is going to be a gross valuation for non-residential property and residential property.  There will also be a net valuation, which will be the factor which will be the multiplier for whatever sum it is decided each year by the Government to allocate.  I know there is no additional cost, because we are talking about money that a local authority never got in the past simply because people did not claim it.  The Olympia Theatre was involved in this and so I am somewhat familiar with the procedure and the processing of claims and so on.  In this instance we are having another section put into the legislation that will introduce a permanent distortion in the tax base. The Minister could quite simply get over it in the first year by adjusting the percentage of increase that he would give to a local authority.  He could say the tax base is 100 units but that normally the effective tax base is only 95 units because of this vacancy factor or this refund factor, so in this year the amount of money given will be based on that but it <Col N="902" /> will be moved up to the full taxation base in the following year.</P>
    <P>This is another piece of unnecessary complication.  The laws of this country are becoming increasingly complex, increasingly requiring the skilled services of professionals to interpret what is going on.  This legislation is a classic example of it.  In section 5 we have the most complex proposals for conferring benefits on tenants, as we discussed at length.  We now have another proposal the net effect of which is to permanently freeze the net valuation of the tax base of a local authority taking into account the normal vacancy rates that occurred in the property of that area.  I do not see why it had to be done.  The Minister had other alternatives to vary the amount of money that was to be allocated in the first place.  We are not talking about any extra money.  We are simply reducing one factor or leaving it stand.  Either way the same amount of money will be paid out.  My contention is that this is an unnecessary complication of the law of the land and consequently is bad law on the grounds that we have too many complicated laws that simply add to the confusion of the ordinary person.  We are only building up a job for people in Deputy Fitzpatrick's profession, the lawyers of this country, who get paid to interpret this kind of thing, when it is we who are responsible for putting it into the law in the first place.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary.  The Minister has discretion to adjust the amount of money he will allocate in any one year. In the period of transition from the original process of local government financing to this one an adjustment could have been made to take account of the gross and net valuation tax base.  For the Minister to say we are simply continuing the old system is not adequate. The Minister is permanently building into this legislation, which does not really deal with the abolition of rates, new measures governing the system of local government finance of which the abolition of rates is only one part.  We have an old complication permanently built into new legislation when the opportunity presents itself to the Minister to streamline it.  I would contend, Sir, that, while you have little discretion in this <Col N="903" /> matter, it does not necessarily imply an extra charge on the Exchequer.  Here is an opportunity for a simplification of the law, but instead the Minister has seen fit to obscure it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy realises the impact of what he is putting forward.  If this was not embodied in the Bill it would mean that the taxpayer would be paying in the total grant a sum of money for rates that would never have been collected by the local authority.  That is exactly what the position would be if we excluded this provision.  Is the Deputy serious when he suggests that that should be the case?  It is the aggregate of the properties for each local authority with regard to the grant.  It is very easy to identify those at local level.  As the demand note goes out a lot of those are permanently vacant and are listed as vacant, dilapidated and so forth.  There are all sorts of ways of listing properties which are easily identifiable. If we had not this provision, the taxpayer, through the medium of the grant going to local authorities, would be liable to pay a sum for rates which would never have been collected by that local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That might well be the case if the taxpayer was paying it in the way the Minister is suggesting.  I am simply trying to establish a clear and uncomplicated local government taxation base.  The amount of money that any local authority will get from the State will be derived by the multiplication of two factors.  The first of those is the percentage rate in the £ that the Government of the day will decide they can make available and that percentage figure is multiplied by the taxation base in each local authority.  If one is increased and the other reduced or <i>vice versa</i> each of those components can still be varied to arrive at the same result.  If that is the case why do we need to complicate it by adding in this provision? Why can we not say that the taxation base in any local authority is the sum total of the valuation of the property there and use it in absolute terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>And include buildings that there would never have been rates <Col N="904" /> for?  There is a valuation on those buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It will then be necessary to go to each local authority and list those.  If the amount of money made available to each local authority is reduced and the taxation base is increased, they are being given the same amount of money.  It will not cost the taxpayer any extra money but it will simplify the law.  It is because of my concern with the simplification of the process that I am speaking on this and not with having every clerk going down to list all those properties that become vacant.</P>
      <P>I also object to this because it freezes a particular state of dilapidation in every local authority.  Cities and urban areas are not static.  Some areas undergo periods of dereliction and dilapidation. That process is likely to continue and even increase in some areas rather than cease.  The Minister is not even stating that each year there will be a net assessment of the amount of dilapidated property.  He is saying that it is calculated on an average over the previous three years.  It is not even an accurate assessment, on the Minister's admission, but simply an aggregate of what it was in the past.</P>
      <P>How does that take into account areas like Dublin city and Cork where certain parts of those cities undergo periods of change, where the process of renewal and redevelopment coupled with an economic recession or a property recession can produce dereliction and vacant sites?  If the Minister was to say that each year it would be worthwhile if local authorities established their active taxation base, that is those properties for which they could reasonably have got rates, and it is on that net figure that the multiplier would be applied, we would accept that.  But he is not saying that.  He is saying that the average net figure is the one that will be applied, so it does not take into account what the base is in any local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There does not need to be any increased expenditure by the Exchequer. The Minister simply reduces the amount of money made available and multiplies it subsequently by a larger tax figure, <Col N="905" /> which includes derelict buildings, many of which would have been derelict for a long time.  The valuation is constant in terms of buildings which already exist and is only added to by new buildings in succeeding years.  I may not have adequate experience to see all the pitfalls of that and I certainly do not have administrative experience to see them.  As a lawmaker from this side of the House, whose only responsibility is making laws, it appears to me that it is certainly a cleaner, neater and more straightforward way of making laws.  That is the only purpose somebody on this side of the House can have.  It does not necessarily cost the Minister more money if he deletes the section, but it makes for neater and cleaner law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If I delete the section it means that the taxpayer will be paying portion of that grant for rates on property which would never have been collected, as I already said.  The aggregate for each local authority will be agreed with each local authority each year.  They will be consulted each year. This is the first year we have had it and to date there has been no difficulty in reaching agreement with local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned Dublin and Cork, where more buildings might become derelict.  In the ordinary course of events, even if we never had derating they should have been put in the revision list and the valuation taken off or reduced drastically when they become derelict, which is the right of whoever is rated.  Without this the taxpayer could find himself paying rates that the local authority would never have got on vacant or derelict buildings.  It is necessary to have it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>The Minister has introduced another factor into this.  He has now informed the House that each year there will be consultations between every rating authority and officials from his Department to establish the net amount of domestic properties.  We are only talking about domestic properties, because industrial derelict buildings do not even enter into the picture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that taxpayers will specifically be making contributions to local authorities on the basis of property, on some of which rates would never have been collected before.  While that is factually correct in a legalistic sense, it distorts the picture. As far as the taxpayers are concerned local authorities will get, every two months, cheques from the Minister's Department representing the total amounts they are due.  This is calculated by a taxation base.  I do not believe we are likely to agree on this, but it seems to me that in a Department which are way behind in their declared legislative reform programme, in a Department which are too busy to do the studies of statistical details relating to either flat dwellers and other areas, the Minister is telling me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Our job with regard to this section would be made much easier if we had some understanding of the real way in which the rates for each local authority will be calculated.  This is critical.  I will be quite happy if the Minister is saying that in establishing the amount of money to be paid to each local authority he will discuss with each authority their net and gross taxation base and their overall requirements and that there would be a differential rate based on the needs of each local authority.  I shudder to think of the amount of time that would take.  Being a member of a local authority, I know what is involved in an estimates committee meeting.  Is the Minister suggesting that the discussion will be carried on between local authorities and officials of the Department on a parallel basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty here. The Minister's objection to deleting this section is that the taxpayer would be paying extra money on the basis of valuations which could not, if there were no change in the law, generate the rate for the local authority.  The other component is the percentage increase and by varying this the amount of money will remain the same.  A block grant will be given to the local authority and the valuations are simply a device for calculating the revenue for a local authority.</P>
      <P>I maintain my claim that this will add an unnecessary complication to the law and put an administrative burden on a Department which, as the Minister has twice admitted today, have not the time, resources or inclination to do certain specific studies in relation to flatdwelling statistics which would not normally have been part of the census.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I rose last evening to support the motion I indicated many areas where there should be genuine concern, unease and unrest among the workers.  I had pinpointed one particular aspect affecting workers, the new housing guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment in directives to local authorities.  I had given a specific example of a case in my local authority area where according to the directive a man in receipt of a gross income of £75 and a take home income of £54 was deemed to be in a position to provide his own housing. I had criticised and ridiculed this peculiar attitude to what was a basic principle of successive Governments, the principle of housing the needy and those who cannot afford to provide their own housing.  This test case and the discussion at county council level influenced a local paper and I was in the process of indicating their feelings on this new thinking in their editorial.  The paper asked who in this age with a wife and family to support on a weekly income of £54, with mortgage rates soaring and building costs booming, could possibly afford to build a house?  They said one could go further and ask if a civil servant <Col N="911" /> on twice the income who enforced this ridiculous regulation could do it?  If he could, they said it would be something of an achievement but for the man on £54 a week it was an impossibility.</P>
      <P>I am concentrating on this aspect because if there is unrest among the workers this revolutionary retrograde anti-social step taken by the Department of the Environment will contribute in a big way to that unrest.  The workers are now being told that for the sake of their pride and dignity they should be encouraged to provide their own homes. Where is the encouragement in rising mortgage rates and small income limits for a county council loan?  These new strictures on local authority housing requirements will condemn everyone in this man's circumstances to the same situation.  Because of financial considerations local authorities will be unable to provide housing for them.  The Government have a grave responsibility for the creation of this social injustice. Everyone has a basic right to be properly housed.  It is a hallmark of the society we created.  How can this Pontius Pilate act on local authority housing be described as social progress, as stated in the amendment moved by the Minister for Labour?  I regret that I can only compare this anti-social thinking on housing of the present Government to the evictions of our ancestors in the last century under another Government. That is a harsh statement but it must be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will reflect again on the past year and on the public sector and its labour relations record.  Listening to the Minister for Labour last night it was apparent that he had been missing from the House for some time.  During the past year the public sector record was abysmal.  The last 18 months has been the worst on record in 20 years.  The year 1978 will be remembered for the stand taken by two groups of public sector employees, the Garda and the nurses.  They are normally a loyal, dedicated and concerned body of men and women and they have always stood by the State, their executive and the people. I can well appreciate their action. They had reached the stage where their <Col N="912" /> patience was exhausted with the negotiations conducted through antiquated negotiations systems and to which they saw no end result.  Because of these interminable negotiations, the Garda and the nurses were regrettably forced to take stern action.  Both of those sectors are vital to the health and security of the country and they were forced into a situation where against their will they had to threaten the withdrawal of their services.  That was a rare occurrence in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, the pot of gold was somewhere over the rainbow but there was no sign of it.  The public unrest there cannot be denied.  Two weeks ago we witnessed the anger and frustration of approximately 4,500 nurses storming up Kildare Street to the gates of Leinster House demanding a new deal in keeping with their admirable commitment to our society.  Only then did the Government relent, and a commission was promised. In similar fashion the Garda threatened the withdrawal of their services due to frustration at the long talks with no results and a certain amount of bluffing. They were driven right out on the edge.  I do not blame them and many people agree with me.  By a show of force and by determination the Garda fOrced the Government to sit down and negotiate and again to set up a commission.</P>
    <P>The third portion of the public sector where there is unrest is the post office, the dispute in which has been going on for so long now that people have forgotten about it.  The matter is still not resolved and this again is a sector vital to the community and to industry.  There is again an impasse here.  I refer to these three sections of the public sector when I say that surely something is wrong somewhere.  There must be some early warning system to prevent such serious escalations in such important sectors of the security forces and essential services of the country.  Continuous bluffing creates hardened attitudes which result in long-term disputes.  If someone had become involved at the outset the situation would have been resolved earlier and we would not have three areas of the public service in a state of chaos.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to those who pay tax under PAYE.  At present they are <Col N="913" /> unsure of the future.  It is estimated that they will contribute £500 million to the Exchequer this year, which is a quarter of the cost of running the country.  As one Minister is pleading for wage restraint for the betterment of the nation another Minister is threatening further taxation.  Those who pay tax under PAYE are wondering how much more they will have to pay next year.  They cannot continue being the backbone of the economy.  The man who pays his tax weekly and who is trying to support his family to the best of his ability finds it hard to stomach the urging of wage restraint.  There is no way out for these people.  They are in the net and the net seems to be getting bigger.  As we hear of wage restraints and the possibility of further taxation, we also hear that food subsidies will be abolished.  Families have been buttressed by food subsidies this year to the extent of £60 million.  If we are anxious for harmonious relations between worker and employer, I cannot understand why we are prepared to create an increase in the cost of living for the sake of saving £60 million out of a total budget of £2,500 million.  It has been said that there is no shortage of money but there must be a hole in the bucket if £60 million has to be saved in this fashion.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party abhor industrial unrest.  We favour a just system of industrial relations which would ensure a growing share of national prosperity for workers and their families.  By the abolition of wealth tax and the easing of the capital gains tax, Fianna Fáil have clearly indicated their alignment with wealth and privilege.  They did not stand idly by on that issue.  They have created widespread dissatisfaction and must accept responsibility for it.  I support the motion.</P>

      <P>When this motion was put down by Deputy Mitchell I was not interested in the wording of it but could see that he wanted to discuss industrial affairs.  As one who has a great interest in industrial relations I welcome the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At question time yesterday Deputy Mitchell suggested on a number of occasions <Col N="914" /> that he had the solution to all our problems and that the Minister should consult him.  I was conscious of the fact that Deputy Mitchell has a knowledge of industrial relations.  During last night's debate I waited for Deputy Mitchell to solve the problems.  Lo and behold, what happened?  Deputy Mitchell apologised for putting down the motion, as well he might, and went on to talk about a man who paid a lot of money for a famous racehorse.  I did not understand the inference but I know that this racehorse went on a go-slow after he had been purchased.  It appeared that Deputy Mitchell was asking the Minister why he allowed this horse to adopt this attitude. The peculiar thing about this horse is that a &ldquo;Piggott&rdquo; was on his back on a number of occasions.  Having looked at the horse, Deputy Mitchell decided it carried a picket instead of a &ldquo;Piggott&rdquo; and blamed the Minister for what had happened.  He suggested that the man who had purchased the horse had not earned his money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will close the story about the horse as best I can.  Deputy Mitchell insinuated that people like the man with the horse are making millions from policies introduced by Fianna Fáil. That transaction took place in 1977. From June, when Fianna Fáil took office, until December last we sat listening to Deputies opposite telling us that anything that was happening in that period was a result of policies introduced by them when in Opposition.  Therefore, Deputy Mitchell was saying that this man had made his money from Coalition, not Fianna Fáil, policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell told us he had spent the weekend preparing his few words and that he had listed statistics in relation <Col N="915" /> to industrial relations.  This is a very serious subject and there is no point in coming to the House on such a subject to bandy figures which cannot stand up to examination.  Deputy Mitchell spoke about lost man-hours through strikes and he said the number is now five times that of 1972, since when we had four-and-a-half years of Coalition Government. He should have given us relevant figures, for 1973 when the Coalition took office and for 1976 which was their last year.  I will record these figures.  In 1973, total man-hours lost through strikes were 206,725; in 1976 the figure was 800,000 and to the end of September 1978, the figure was 399,000. It is fair to estimate that for the whole of 1978 the figure will be in the region of 500,000.</P>
    <P>These figures indicate that Deputy Mitchell did not do any research: he came into the House with a few figures, threw them out and got the press to publish them.  The Minister went into great detail last night and I will not repeat the figures now.  He pointed out that the only Government that has proved capable of controlling this type of situation has been Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell indicated that lower paid workers are striking because of dissatisfaction at increased social welfare contributions which they have to pay under Fianna Fáil and because of the amount of income tax they have to pay. In the time available I did a bit of research and I found that when we came to office in 1977, the male worker was paying £2.87 for the social welfare stamp.  Today he is paying £2.26, a reduction of 61p.  In 1977 the female worker was paying £2.80.  Today she is paying £2.19.  Where did Deputy Mitchell get his figures to prove, as he said, that social welfare contributions are crippling the lower paid workers? Fianna Fáil have always appreciated the desirability of helping lower paid workers and they gave a reduction of £1 to social welfare contributors from the beginning of 1978 and increased this to £1.50 from 1 April.  In regard to income tax, the only Minister who ever did anything for the lower paid workers is the present Minister for Finance.  A <Col N="916" /> remark made by Deputy Ryan worried me most.  He said that during the Coalition's regin the trade union movement had a very good relationship with the Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Leary, but since the changeover the same co-operation has not been there.  That inference was made by Deputy Ryan.</P>
    <P>He said the trade union movement had promised that co-operation to Deputy O'Leary.  I am sure Deputy Corish will acknowledge that it is a serious matter to say that while there was a Labour Minister in power the trade union movement were prepared to co-operate but that that has now gone.  I have too much respect for trade unions to accept that.  I have been dealing with them for a number of years and have found that their members, from the top down, have been of the highest quality. There have been exceptions but they have been few.  I do not accept that the trade union movement would withdraw their co-operation because our Minister for Labour was not a member of the Labour Party.  The trade union movement have the interest of their members and the welfare of the country at heart, irrespective of the party in power.  They have shown that on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>I made that point to illustrate the need for Members who table Motions similar to that before the House to make positive, concrete statements in support of them rather than bandying figures around without taking into consideration the implications of their actions. Reference has been made to what has taken place since Fianna Fáil were returned to power but I should like to point out that last year's growth rate at 5 per cent was the highest in the EEC. However, according to Opposition speakers, the country was in a chaotic situation in that year; we did not have leadership and workers were doing what they liked.  It is expected that we will have a growth rate of the order of 7 per cent this year, which is in line with the Government's target, and will be the highest in the EEC.  Coupled with this production in manufacturing industry in the first half of 1978 was 9 per cent higher than for the same period last year.  Taking into consideration those <Col N="917" /> facts how can Members of the Opposition say that the country was in a chaotic state last year and in the first half of this year?</P>
    <P>Before he tabled a Motion about industrial unrest Deputy Mitchell should have prepared a positive response to such a situation, if it exists.  Irrespective of whether these figures go down, as they have between 1973 and 1978, nobody can be satisfied with this type of situation.  We are all anxious to improve it and the only way we can do that is to find out what section is causing the problem.  I would not point a finger at any section.  When people see a picket outside a premises they immediately blame the workers but that is an incorrect assumption because workers or unions are not always at fault.  Employers must be looked at.  The trade union movement is accepted by all as being an honourable one which has the interest of its members and the country at heart but I would like to see that movement infuse discipline to try to eliminate unofficial strikes.</P>
    <P>Official pickets are respected because people know that the trade union movement would not place such a picket on a premises if they were not satisfied that all avenues had been explored to settle the dispute.  What concerns me is that with all the excellent machinery for dealing with disputes at the Labour Court we still have many unofficial strikes.  I am also concerned that when a dispute is referred to the court in some cases unions, or management, do not accept the ruling.  Many people prefer not to pass unofficial pickets and in a lot of cases not only are the workers and the companies concerned affected but the general public are also badly hit.  We had an incident recently where one man placed a picket outside a bus depot with the result that the old and those who depend on the bus services were affected. In order to overcome such situations the trade union movement should infuse some discipline into their members.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that I am not suggesting that employers are not at fault in all cases.  I would not attempt to say which side of industry, workers or <Col N="918" /> employers, bear the biggest portion of the blame for our industrial unrest but in my view many companies have not attached enough importance to the role of the industrial relations officers they employ.  For too long workers were treated as numbers, and their grievances were not dealt with.  The result was that when workers felt they were being treated like robots they took stern action. Until such time as employers accept that the most important man in their concern is the industrial relations officer the situation will not improve. Companies can have top salesmen, great accountants, brilliant managers and spend a lot of money on advertising but if the industrial relations officer is not competent the whole thing can blow up in a cloud of smoke.  We must forget about throwing bricks at one another, making false statements and quoting wrong figures and get down to solving this problem.  I could ask the Opposition what they did about this problem when they were in Government for more than four-and-a-half years.</P>

      <P>If we are serious in our efforts to deal with industrial unrest we must try to find the causes and to rectify them.  If we do not do this industrial unrest will continue.  The Minister and the Government can be proud of their achievements since they came into office. We would love to have a magic wand that we could wave and have no more official or unofficial strikes.  We do not want to take the right to picket from any man.  A man has a right to strike officially and to have an official picket.  I should like to see the right to place an unofficial picket removed.  I call on the trade union movement and the employers to strengthen their position and to try to control the people who are responsible for industrial unrest.  If this could be done we would achieve something.  If we work together as a unit we can get this country moving again, as the Taoiseach once said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="920" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by giving the Minister a surprise.  I should like to endorse some of the things he said yesterday and which some of his colleagues have said in the past weeks and months.  In particular, I should like to endorse three themes that have been constantly on the lips of the Minister's colleagues; I will not say on his own lips because he is a rather elusive Minister. He is one of the more rarely seen members of this vibrant team but when he surfaces on this subject I must say he adds to the general orchestra which has had these three themes and I should like to endorse them.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to make it clear that this party also deplore the disruptive effect of strikes, particularly those in the public sector, not just on industry but on the lives of ordinary people. Secondly, we agree entirely&mdash;and we said ourselves when we had the responsibility of government&mdash;that the existence of poor industrial relations situations in the public sector, and to some extent in the private sector, has a very discouraging effect on outside investment. Everything the Minister for industry, Commerce and Energy said here a few days ago I would wish to have endorsed had I been speaking after him instead of before him.  Thirdly, I should like to agree with the Minister present here and with his colleagues who said that the degree to which industrial relations here are bad has been somewhat souped up abroad in the private sector at least.  I should like to agree with the Minister and his colleagues that it is quite true that the vast majority of private firms here have next to no industrial trouble.  Our party would be failing in the duty we see ourselves as having if we did not add our voice to that of the Government in endorsing those three points and in recognising their truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I have a very easy conscience in supporting this motion, because the paroxysm of industrial unrest that we have seen in the past 12 months is something for which the policies of this Government are squarely to blame.  I should like to apologise to Deputy Killeen for interrupting him with some levity.  I did not mean to put him out of his stride&mdash;and I did not succeed <Col N="921" /> in doing so anyway&mdash;but when he asked what the Coalition Government had done in order to avoid this paroxysm of bad industrial relations I replied by pointing out some very conspicuous things which they had done and stuck to. They imposed a wealth tax and stuck to it; they introduced food subsidies and did not threaten to remove them; there was no word about taxing children's allowances. I should like to point out to the House, particularly for the benefit of Deputy Killeen, that there was something more than that.</P>
    <P>The previous Government earned the confidence of the trade union movement, not the confidence of every single member, not the blind obedience or loyalty of every single member, but in a general sense they earned, deserved and retained a level of confidence in the trade union movement that ruled out as unlikely, if not impossible, the degree of industrial unrest that we have now come to regard as the normal thing.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I got in the post an issue of <i>Liberty</i>, the journal of the largest union&mdash;the ITGWU&mdash;in the country.  It features a depressing cartoon on page 2. It shows the National Wage Agreements on a bonfire, going up in smoke.  There are two men in the characteristic caricature of workers silhouetted in the foreground and they were saying about the National Wage Agreements: &ldquo;They were too restrictive and kept our living standards down&rdquo;.  There are two other men, easily identified as the Taoiseach and an international banker&mdash;he appears to have German and Swiss registration marks on his briefcase and he is wearing a tie with an attractive pattern of £s on it&mdash;who were linking arms and saying of the National Wage Agreements, &ldquo;They gave the workers too much money&rdquo;.  I do not attach much importance to a cartoon whether it is in this paper or any other paper; but I want to say this&mdash;and I say it with pride because my party suffered because of it and lost seats in some rural constituencies because of it&mdash;such a cartoon could not have appeared in the time of the National Coalition Government.  For all our mistakes or alleged mistakes, for all our failures and blunders&mdash;and they were by no means as many as they were <Col N="922" /> made out to be, as the people will come to see&mdash;it was never once said that we were in league with wealth or with power.  Nothing more divisive can be said in this country or in any other country.  It was because we stuck to our guns, and particularly this party as the former Tánaiste beside me will recognise, because we stood by what the Government had proposed to do when they were first elected that we in Fine Gael lost seats in some rural constituencies from people who saw only the interests of their own tax situation and the interests of their own wealth, and who could not believe that Fine Gael had a conscience which would require them to stand in the middle of the road and try to take both sides with them.  If we did not succeed, we did our best.</P>
    <P>That cartoon is something of which the Government should be ashamed.  It is not an isolated cartoon.  It is said every day of the week and not just by communist agitators.  No one in this House will accuse me or suspect me of being a communist or having the slightest softness towards that side of political throught.  Quite the contrary.  But I am glad to belong to a party which, even though many of its supporters are comfortable, are well heeled, are articulate, was willing to go along with the central Government policy which was at least an attempt to achieve justice, at least an attempt to spread the burdens of life, particularly in recession, evenly between various groups of the population, and not to let one group off so that they could come home publicly from the Barbados and the Bahamas saying they were &ldquo;tax exiles&rdquo; but were now back because &ldquo;the lads were back in office&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the spectacle we saw here last July 12 months.  Is it any surprise that 18 months later we get this kind of response from the biggest union in the country, when we are debating this evening a paroxysm of industrial unrest of a sort never seen here before?  I quite understand Deputy Killeen appealing to us here this evening not to fall over ourselves blaming each other, but that is all very fine when Deputy Killeen is sitting on the Government benches.  What are we to do?  Would he, if he sat over here, have the self command to bottle up the feelings <Col N="923" /> he would experience on seeing the condition into which the social policies of that Government have reduced this country?</P>
    <P>I will not go over the ground covered by Deputy Mitchell last night in regard to the detailed facets of Government policy which have produced this situation. I will not thrash it out in the same detail.  He mentioned the abolition of the wealth tax.  He mentioned the abolition of car tax and the threats we are now hearing to tax children's allowances and to reduce the food subsidies.  What can the Government expect except that there will be industrial chaos when this is the face they present?  The ordinary working population of the country can read. They have access to television sets.  They are well informed.  They are not in the dark about what is going on in the world.  They are not in the dark about the standards of living of other people. They are not in the dark about the financial ambitions of other people and how these ambitions are realised.  They can count.  They can size up for themselves what profits are being made by certain sections of the population, and the burdens which they themselves have to carry and how other sections of the population are getting away lightly.</P>
    <P>I am not a red revolutionary and the Minister and everybody else in the House knows that, but I believe in the Government being fair to all sides as far as flesh and blood can do it.  I believe in the Government imposing burdens and having the guts to do it, but doing it fairly on all sides, and not letting any side get off with the idea that they are something special, that just because they can contribute to an election campaign they should be treated easily.  I do not believe in that, and no one in Fine Gael believe in it.  I do not care if we lost every seat left to us, I would go down happy if I thought we stuck to the idea of justice and keeping to the centre of the road and dealing fairly with all classes.</P>
    <P>This Government are not doing that. They have failed to do it.  By a long chalk I do not go along with all the opinions I hear from the Labour Party, and <Col N="924" /> the former Tánaiste knows that, but on the central issues on which we were solidly together in Government, I backed them with my whole heart and still would.  This Government have a lot to answer for if their neglect of the policies which the Coalition worked so hard for for four-and-a-half years leaves us with an unmanageable and ungovernable industrial situation.</P>
    <P>The first mistake this Government made&mdash;and Deputy Mitchell did not advert to this last night&mdash;was that in their election manifesto they spoke of tax cuts and promised tax cuts.  I quite accept that if you read the manifesto carefully, as not .1 of 1 per cent of the people did, you would see the manifesto was intended as a total package and that one could not necessarily single out one part of it and say: &ldquo;We insist on that, but we will not go along with anything else&rdquo;.  I accept that the manifesto did speak about 5 per cent as being the level at which an acceptable pay increase might be tolerated in the following year. That was in the small print.  The big print said nothing about conditionality, nothing about how the benefits, which the newspaper advertisements and the television advertisements were trumpet ing as hard as they could, being dependent on the acceptance of a 5 per cent wage rise and no more.</P>
    <P>Not only that, but that fact led to the 5 per cent being regarded not simply as an asking price or a bargaining figure. like the Taoiseach's £650 million in the EMS negotiations, but as a floor from which to negotiate upwards so that the achievement and negotiation of a reasonable pay agreement at a time of sinking inflation was impossible from the outset.  It was a dead duck before the ballots had been even counted.  The Minister opposite and all his colleagues must know that.</P>
    <P>Secondly the phenomenon of wage drift on which we have been getting so many elegant little lectures recently from Professor O'Donoghue and his colleagues was well known before the change of Government.  It was well known before the last change of Government too.  Anyone in the backup team of any party could have said that, if you achieve a wage rise of 5 per cent on <Col N="925" /> paper, what you will get in reality is 8 or 10 per cent, and anyone could have told him that when you get 8 or 10 per cent on paper what you will end up with is something like 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The seeds of the wage situation were sown back in whatever time it was that the buzzing brain-pan of Senator Ryan and his backroom boys worked out the election programme in April or May of last year.  That is when the seeds were sown for the damage in that field as in many other fields.  The damage was completed when the Government, naturally and quite predictably, failed to achieve the reasonable wage settlement of 5 per cent they set out to achieve. They failed to do something which the Coalition had succeeded in doing by screwing down the lid on all sides equally in a difficult time of international recession and taking the consequences for it and sticking to our guns.  We succeeded as even Professor O'Donoghue has admitted in print in an official publication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That Minister knew about wage drift and he should have known it must be a dead duck from the moment when 5 per cent appeared in the election manifesto.  Now they come whinging <Col N="926" /> about how they are not getting a reasonable wage settlement.  It was certain that they would not get one from the moment the manifesto appeared.  It is certain that they will not get one next year for the same reason.  I hope no one will accuse me of making trouble.  I hope the trade union congress will think again about their attitude to a national wage agreement; I would be very sorry if the system were to break down altogether.  If it does break down, and if we have seen the last of national wage agreements, I know where to put the blame.</P>

      <P>It is really amusing to find that the Minister and his colleagues nowadays are so full of calls for restraint and for a bit of discipline.  This restraint and discipline apply only to one class of the population, the PAYE earners and the people at the bottom of the barrel. They do not talk about restraint to the people higher up.  These calls for restraint, for what they are worth, are now being made quite freely.</P>
      <P>This week and last week I got a delicious satisfaction from watching a little exchange between <i>The Irish Times</i> and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley.  <i>The Irish Times</i> published an editorial about a week ago in which they called for discipline in economic affairs. They said sardonically that they knew the word &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; is poison to Fianna Fáil and would bring shudders to a Fianna Fáil publicity man's mind.  The paper did not say this but I say it: Fianna Fáil are a party of balloon-men like people used to see at fairs long ago going around with balloons for the children. That is what they are.  They have not produced one single economic idea worth anything since their election.  The hopes of the Taoiseach in regard to the EMS were centred&mdash;I know he and most of his party are public spirited men&mdash;on the £650 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope I will have it this side of Christmas.  <i>The Irish Times</i> said that the word &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; was something which was now necessary for the national and political vocabulary. They said that discipline in economic affairs was absolutely vital and that we could not take the soft option any more, and they expected that this call would be poison to Fianna Fáil.  Yesterday <i>The Irish Times</i> printed as their first letter a really disarming little piece from the Minister for Finance in which he said that they could not accuse him of not calling for discipline because he is always calling for it.  He went on to cite three of his own speeches and one of the Taoiseach in which they are calling for discipline in incomes and restraint in wage increases.  He could have quintupled those letters because I know he is always talking about it, as is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and all the other dignitaries in the Government.</P>
      <P>They have all been calling for it since the election; but there was not one word about restraint or a syllable about discipline in the weeks or months leading up to the election.  The dates of the speeches on which the Minister wrote to the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> are all October and November this year.  There was not a word about this when they were running for election.  It was &ldquo;all systems go&rdquo;.  It was: &ldquo;Let it rip, lads, it is only the malice of the Coalition that is keeping you on short commons&rdquo;.  That was the message that went out from the Fianna Fáil Party 18 months ago.  It is only now they are beginning to talk about discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That cuts no ice with me and not surprisingly it does not cut any ice with the public either.  There is no point in talking about restraint and discipline now.  A party which do not say what they stand for when out of office as well as when in power are not worth a curse.  If Fianna Fáil had come to the people June 12 months and said that the country had gone through an international recession, and considered that the Coalition had <Col N="928" /> not handled the situation as they might have done, and that they were going to try to do better, that they would have to do some unpleasant things, that they could not make everything easy for everybody overnight and that they were not going to attempt such a thing so the people would not be able to say later that they promised any such thing, they would be entitled to respect and would have taught us all a salutary lesson. Instead they have given us a salutary example in the opposite direction of what a party in a democracy ought to avoid. They have given us an example of the kind of posture which will encourage the very thing they are complaining about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killeen spoke about the necessity for speakers on this side of the House producing a solution.  I take it hard at being lectured by a Fianna Fáil Deputy about people on this side of the House pretending to have all the solutions. In the twentieth Dáil there was no more vocal, strident Deputy in this House than the present Minister for Labour, Deputy G. Fitzgerald.  He shouted, roared and ranted every day of the week, in and out of season.  He trampled on Ministers and on the Chair. He had the answers to everything.  He knew it all.  There was an even chance any day Deputy Fitzgerald was in this House that when you put your nose in the door the voice you would hear first was his.  Now he is a changed man.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as making a personal attack on him.  Although I have never gone to him for anything, I sense that if I did go to him for help, he would do his best to provide it.  I recognise that he is a decent man and I do not want to hurt or offend him, but I want to draw a contrast between the incredible know-all character of that Minister when he was an Opposition Deputy and the shrinking violet personality which he has very wisely taken on since he became Minister.  He is hardly to be seen at all.  I hope he will not take offence when I say this, but it reminds me of the words spoken by Hamlet on discovering the corpse of Polonius behind the curtain in his mother's bedroom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>He said:</P>
      <P>This counsellor is now most still, most secret and most grave,</P>
      <P>That was in life a foolish, prating knave.</P>
      <P>There is no stronger contrast in behaviour or demeanour in any man or woman in this House in the twentieth and twenty-first Dáils, than that between Deputy G. Fitzgerald as an Opposition Deputy shouting and roaring, and Deputy Fitzgerald as a Minister who on the rare occasion we see him in the House now, is quietly reading a script.  I will take no lecturing in regard to the affairs of the Department of Labour about how we pretend to have all the answers while the man in charge of the Vote is Deputy G. Fitzgerald.  If he had been a little more modest when in Opposition I would not have had those words to say.</P>
      <P>There is no way of controlling or achieving a balance and stability in industrial relations except by engendering confidence among the people you are dealing with.  That confidence was struggled for, and painfully won, by the National Coalition, but a penalty was paid for it, and paid largely by the party to which I belong.  Nonetheless that confidence was achieved.  It was admitted by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in black and white in an official publication of the Department of Foreign Affairs that the growth rate and in particular the boom in industrial production and exports, about which Deputy Killeen was boasting, were accounted for very largely by the wage restraint achieved in 1976 and 1977. They were achieved by the sweat and blood of Deputy M. O'Leary and Deputy R. Ryan, and with no thanks to any help from the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to sketch out for the Government what they should do.  All they need do is look into their own hearts, according to the doctrines of their founder, to tell them what the people need.  If that confidence is to be <Col N="930" /> re-established, they will have to start looking into their hearts and start adjusting their budgetary programmes and policies in such a way that the confidence, balance and sense that all sections of the community are being required in equal proportion to their ability to carry the national burdens is created. Until that time comes we are going to see more and more industrial unrest.  I deplore that.</P>
    <P>I started my speech by joining with the Government in deploring it.  I agree that to some extent it is exaggerated in the private sector.  I also agree that it has a discouraging effect on investment and I back the Government 100 per cent in calling for improvements.  But of all sectors in the country, the Deputies who now form the Government party are in the weakest position to do so and carry any moral conviction.</P>
    <P>So far as I could see there is no policy on industrial relations emerging from this Government and the people are crying out for such a policy.  I believe they would even take something in the nature of legislation.  I notice everybody is fighting shy of talking about this.  It is like the time when the Coalition were in office and we were being urged by people to realise who was governing the country.  We used to see editorials saying &ldquo;The Government were elected to govern&rdquo;.  What they meant was that we should enact a statutory incomes policy, but they did not have the guts to say it. Something of the same kind is surfacing again.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29 November said:</P>
    <P>Corrective or coercive legislation to remedy the situation is useless and dangerous.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  It went on:</P>
    <P>What we could do with are decent laws which would bind a man, be he employer or be he employee, to a reasonable contract which cannot reasonably be broken.</P>
    <P>What about the unreasonable man? What are you going to do with him?  If he breaks his contract what will you do? Are you going to say &ldquo;there is no coercion here so naturally we cannot do anything with you&rdquo;?  If so, what value is <Col N="931" /> the contract.  That is the kind of wet comment which will persist from publicists and outside commentators for as long as there is not a Government in the country with a little guts.  That is not to be taken as advocating any special kind of legislation, but the Deputy who spoke before me and who had a carefully prepared speech said he believed in outlawing unofficial strikes and unofficial picketting.  I believe he was selected to speak as a backbench Deputy and therefore I must assume that before making his speech he consulted the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>I would prefer that the Minister would shoot his own tigers and not ask poor Deputy Killeen to do it for him.  Deputy Killeen has not been in the House for a wet week yet.  I recall that when the Green Paper was debated here the Taoiseach read from a prepared script and one of his statements was that the Opposition were stunned by the novelty of the proposals put forward in the Green Paper.  I am tempted to offer £5 to any Deputy who, from memory, can name any new proposal from that publication with the exception of the one relating to work-sharing and which became a national joke within a week. What were the new proposals?  In the area we are talking of, there were no proposals and the same applies to other areas with the exception of the one I have mentioned&mdash;work-sharing&mdash;a suggestion that does not stun me even if it may stun others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government, by their social policies, which Deputy Mitchell has rightly described as divisive, and by their fiscal policies, which are both divisive and anti-social, are almost guaranteeing industrial unrest with all that entails for our industrial production, for our balance of payments and for our future stability.  Until the Government show some courage, until they take some les- sons from the book of Deputy Liam Cosgrave or from the book of Deputy Corish and the men who worked with <Col N="932" /> them, they will be in continuing deep trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of supporting this motion. Obviously, then, I reject the amendment. Everybody must know that we have a serious industrial relations problem, although the Minister for Labour would seem to be the odd one out in this regard because at the time of any problem in this area he always seems to be missing. In any event, he appears to do very little in regard to solving the various problems and merely adopts the Pontius Pilate attitude of washing his hands and saying that whatever matter is concerned it is one for the people involved.  This attitude does not absolve the Government from taking on themselves the responsibilities of Government.  Regardless of where they may try to lay the blame, they cannot shirk that responsibility.</P>
      <P>We hear from various Ministers about the irresponsible people who are bringing about a situation of doom in our industrial life and sometimes these Ministers ask why this should be the case.  There are a number of reasons and one of them is that the Government built up people's expectations far beyond what was possible.  In addition, Fianna Fáil tried to undermine the position of the previous Government and promised before the election to bring about a situation of full employment in which every possible benefit would be bestowed on the people.  That was a totally dishonest policy but now they are wondering why the people are so discontented. Our young people in particular have been let down badly.  A committee was set up to study the situation in regard to employment opportunities for young people but there the matter rested.  I suppose the setting up of a committee is a good way of shelving any issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in the lower income groups have been let down too.  Most of them cannot afford cars so they cannot be said to benefit from the car tax remission. These people live mostly in low-rateable accommodation so that there was little if any benefit for them by reason of the removal of rates.  But people in the very high income groups have <Col N="933" /> benefited from these changes.  Is it any wonder, then, that there is so much discontent? By and large, people are very reasonable.  For instance, workers will not go on picket easily.  They have no wish to go on strike and do so only when there is no other recourse open to them. It is for the Government to seek solutions to the various problems.  They are elected to make the decisions.  In the last election they were given a strong mandate. Indeed, one Minister used this situation by way of threatening the Government's 84 seats against anybody who might take industrial action.  Would it not be better that the Government used their majority to produce meaningful policies?  The amendment to our motion asks the Dáil to support the Government's policy aimed at promoting industrial, economic and social progress.  Let us take the question of social progress.  There is talk of taxing children's allowances.</P>

      <P>Children's allowances have been mentioned, there is no doubt about that.  The removal of food subsidies has been mentioned.  Are they going to deny that too?  Is this part of the social policy of this Government?  Is this why workers should not be discontented? They see this inroad into the social aspect of their way of life.  Subsidies on food help them to bid and buy. Children's allowance gives a woman an income.  Are we to support these policies?  This side of the House will not support them and I believe many Members on that side will not support them when it comes to the reality.  People are discontented and not very happy with their way of life and it behoves the Government to examine and ask why this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the trade union congress conference last year in Cork I asked if national wage agreements have outlived their usefulness.  Have they?  I believe they have.  If the Minister was doing his sums he would see that in reality a large number of people, particularly in the public sector, were falling behind in standards. The figures are there and the sums can be done.  The people who are falling behind are to be the scapegoats to be blamed for an ineffective Government. But no, they are standing up to be counted, asking questions and rejecting the national wage agreement because it has run its course.  It did serve a very effective purpose, but do not let us adopt a lazy attitude in the belief that because something has worked it is going to continue to work.  Why did the Government wait for its collapse? Because they were incapable and had no alternative to offer.  That is a pity.  The last thing I and anybody on this side of the House want to see is industrial strife; <Col N="935" /> but if the Government have no social conscience and talk about threatening the way of life of people we are going to get unease.  Why do this Government not get down to the very fundamental principles of industrial democracy?  Are they too much aligned with one section of industry as against the other?  I am not accusing them; I am just questioning.</P>
    <P>If we are to get this nation on the road to economic recovery that can be done only with a comprehensive policy on industrial relations.  The Minister has set up a commission on industrial relations. That is passing the buck.  We are long enough talking about industrial relations and industrial democracy to know exactly where we are going and what we want.  Surely this is properly set out on the shop floor and you should get it right through industry.  You should get harmony and proper consultation within industry so that people are not alienated from one another.  They would then realise that they have the same interest, the common bond keeping that industry alive because they have all a stake in it. That is what industrial democracy is about.  Putting one or two directors on a board does not satisfy me nor does it satisfy workers.  That is only paying lip service to industrial democracy.  This question must be re-examined, starting <Col N="936" /> from the shop floor and going right through.  The Minister has been in office for well over a year and has made no attempt to do anything except to set up a commission.</P>

      <P>That is not satisfactory. Dust is gathering on commission reports all over the place without any action being taken.  This country needs positive action and policy on industrial democracy to see that the worker has his rights, a share of the profits and a share in management.  Until that is achieved we will have industrial strife and industrial problems.  The Minister may sit there and pontificate and put the onus on this, that or the other.  But at the end of the day the onus lies on him, the Minister for Labour, to co-ordinate and develop a proper policy in consultation with the social partners so that we may take our place in Europe as a nation of concern.  We are Europeans.  The Government have made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the absence of the Minister this evening.  At approximately 3.17 this afternoon the Minister for Education stood up to answer three questions, Nos. 24, 25 and 26.  Question No. 24 in the name of Deputy Noel Browne asked the Minister if he has concluded his consideration of the question of the total abolition of corporal punishment in schools.  Question No. 25 in the name of Deputy Horgan asked him when he expects to be in a position to make a policy statement on the matter. Question No. 26 in my name asked him if he would make a statement on his intentions concerning the abolition of corporal punishment in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite those three clear question the Minister proceeded to give a summary of the opinions he had received from the various vocational interests involved.  At approximately 3.35 p.m. Deputy Horgan and I requested the Minister to complete his answer in writing.  That was an unprecedented request on our part but it was because of our frustration at the manner in which the Minister chose <Col N="939" /> to treat the House.  As spokesman on Education for Fine Gael I deeply regretted having to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have answered the question in relation to the opinions he had received by saying that he would circulate them with the Official Report. That is a normal procedure which would have been acceptable to the spokesmen for Fine Gael and Labour.  We requested from the Minister&mdash;we did not receive it in his reply&mdash;his conclusions and his policy in respect of corporal punishment in the schools.  Obviously the most vital area is the primary schools but we have not received the clear policy statement from the Minister which we requested.</P>
    <P>We also request a clear policy statement in relation to secondary schools.  I am aware, in relation to the vocational schools, that corporal punishment is not part of the discipline in them.  I am not aware that corporal punishment is an integral part of discipline in community and comprehensive schools.  I am fully aware of the need for discipline in all our schools and for the continuation of a policy of pastoral care by the many teachers who do an excellent job throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am looking for a clear statement from the Minister in regard to his intentions on corporal punishment and in relation to the rules for national schools, when he will revise those rules and if he will allow corporal punishment to form part of those rules and regulations.  The Minister obviously tried to evade the whole question today in the manner in which he treated the House and in the grossly unsatisfactory reply he gave.</P>
    <P>I want, from the Minister of State, whom I take to represent the Minister, a clear indication of the Minister's position in respect of corporal punishment.  I want a clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the question: &ldquo;Does the Minister intend to abolish corporal punishment as an integral part of the policy in relation to discipline in schools throughout the country?&rdquo;  It does not need a debate. Many people throughout the country are waiting for the Minister's answer.  Unfortunately, he was cowardly in his answer today.  I look forward to the answer tonight from the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Collins, I was absolutely flabbergasted by the extraordinary and unprecedented approach taken by the Minister in relation to a comparatively simple question.  I do not know if he was over-reacting to the attitude of a previous Minister for Education who once caused a lot of controversy in the House by answering 17 questions in four lines.  If he was he certainly overdid it in a way which must cast some doubt on his willingness to face up to the basic issues involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister's answer, which I received this afternoon, had two main characteristics: (1) it was as long as his speech introducing the NCEA Bill in the House some time ago, and (2) it actually failed to answer many of the questions it was supposed to answer and spent a great deal of time supplying information which no Deputy had asked for.  I am speaking now particularly in relation to my own question which asked the Minister for Education if he has now heard from teaching and managerial associations in response to his request for their views on corporal punishment in schools, the associations which have replied to date, the associations from which he is awaiting a reply, when he expects to be in position to make a policy statement on the matter and if he will accord the Dáil an opportunity of discussing such a statement.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he had heard from the associations to whom he had written.  The simple answer to that was &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  In place of that simple answer we got an amazing, verbally delivered, screed of quotation from the organisations and associations in question.  A lot of this information is very useful and very valuable&mdash;I do not deny that for a moment&mdash;but the proper way to give this information is by circulating it with the Official Report.  He did not answer the question which asked him when he expected to be in a position to make a policy statement on the matter.  He did not answer the question in which I asked him if he would afford the Dáil an opportunity of discussing such a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my comparatively brief period in the House I have learned to expect that when a Minister answers a question at inordinate length it is at least partly with <Col N="941" /> a view to attempt to confuse the Opposition and blind them to the fact that he is avoiding one of the key issues.  Certainly when one gets to the end of this very lengthy reply it is clear that the key issue is avoided.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that quotations are not normally permitted under the rules of order at question time and certainly not by Deputies in supplementary questions. When the quotations are over we turn to the last page in an attempt to find out anything about the Minister's intentions concerning the abolition of corporal punishment in schools or anything about whether the Minister has concluded his consideration of the question.  We find nothing but a three-line bromide which states that the views are carefully thought out and responsible and they indicate the very high ideals that motivate the various organisations.  I have no doubt that the organisations concerned are motivated by high ideals.</P>
    <P>Two things occur to me from the Minister's reply, the first being the strong volume in favour of abolition from teachers and, secondly, the relatively small input to the survey by parents.  We must record our disagreement with the Minister's handling of this question and, in particular, with his failure to answer the basic question.  It is not clear from the answer he gave precisely what question he asked the various educational associations.  I believe it is now clear that he probably asked the wrong question.  It was probably a general question about their views on discipline.  If the Minister had had the courage of what I think are his own abolitionist tendencies, he would have asked them straight out if they would now have any objection to the abolition of corporal punishment.  That would have given him a far firmer basis for a positive innovation in the area of discipline than this series of replies, however worthy they may be.</P>
    <P>By the length and manner of his reply, the Minister seems to be evading his ultimate responsibility for the overall conduct of education.  The whole concept of discipline and punishment is something which goes to the root of education and <Col N="942" /> it is because the Minister must ultimately face up to this responsibility that we have put down these questions.  We will continue to press the Minister on this until we get a satisfactory answer.  The Minister has a couple of years to do it but we would prefer he did it sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>The House and, I hope, the two Deputies who have spoken will accept that controlled freedom in school, as in all human activities, is essential.  I think Deputies Collins and Horgan would not presume to argue the opposite.  If they were to do so, I would suggest that they, having had experience of schools as I have had, would not relish the occasion where anything other than the need for this controlled freedom would operate.</P>
      <P>Ideally this control might be self-imposed and based mainly on the recognition by the individual of the rights of others.  We must continue to strive for the ideal and must not blind ourselves to facts as they exist.  Young people and adults experience difficulty in living up to this ideal in any situation. For the establishment of this control and its maintenance, a code of regulations is necessary.  Such a code must provide for the imposition of sanctions in the event of a deliberate, serious and repeated transgression.  In the case of schools, the sanctions may take various forms and there will always be a variety of views among parents, teachers and others as to the best approach to these sanctions and the best manner in which the overall aim of schools may be achieved.</P>

      <P>The manner in which I am employing it is as important as the manner in which the Deputy employed <Col N="943" /> it.  If we are to have a discussion Deputies must accept that there are two sides.  I am surprised that Deputy Collins should say it is a simple matter of have it or not.  That is not in accord with the interest of teachers.  If Deputy Collins, as spokesman for Fine Gael on this matter, says that this is a matter of a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; he is doing a disservice to that spokesmanship.</P>
      <P>Rule 130 of the Rules for National Schools under the Department of Education deals with this matter and states:</P>
      <P>Teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affections and reason and not by harshness and severity.  Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine a pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.</P>
      <P>Deputies know as well as I do that there are forms of punishment worse than physical punishment which can be imposed on any child.  Are we to pursue the elimination of those?</P>

      <P>Yes, but I do not hear the Deputy in pursuit of this.  He knows that a teacher, if so disposed, can be far more vicious and act in a manner much more detrimental to the welfare of the child by unseen sanctions.  Does the Deputy propose that we pursue each teacher and examine his or her disposition or personality to discover whether or not he or she is likely to impose these on the students?  If the Deputy gives an answer to that, then I will accept that this is a simple matter.</P>
      <P>We have the report now of 21 interested parties and I would suggest that the debate can be of benefit to Deputies if they examine this report.  Then we will reach the conclusion which the Deputies wish in this matter.  I share the desire to reach a conclusion, but not in the hurried, irresponsible fashion Deputy Collins would suggest.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>I have received replies from all those organisations of management authorities and teachers from whom I invited views on the use of corporal punishment in schools.  Their views were as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO)</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Executive Committee of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation has considered your request for observations on school discipline, and they have instructed me to <Col N="814" /> say that the membership of the Organisation is quite happy with the terms of Rule 130, Rules for National Schools, on the matter of school discipline. They consider that the Rule is very wisely structured, and contains adequate safeguards for pupils, and at the same time it upholds the reasonable authority of teachers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Association of Secondary Teachers (ASTI)</i>
    </P>
    <P>That the ASTI condemns the use of any form of corporal punishment in post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>The question of corporal punishment and possible alternatives is being investigated by the Association and our views on this matter will be conveyed to you as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Teachers' Union of Ireland</i>
    </P>
    <P>With reference to your letter concerning corporal punishment in schools.  I am to state that this Union is opposed to its use.</P>
    <P>However, the Union does recognise the real disciplinary problems which can arise and the Executive Committee will draw up a document on school discipline for your consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Association of Principals of Community/Comprehensive Schools</i>
    </P>
    <P>I must apologise for the delay in answering your query re corporal punishment.  I have been waiting for a reply from all the Community and Comprehensive Schools on current practice in each school.</P>
    <P>The general picture from the replies I have received, is that, as a policy, corporal punishment is not an acceptable form of discipline and is not used in our schools.  In two schools Principals stated that on a very rare occasion it was used with boys for offences of vandalism, bullying or gross insubordination.  It was administered by the Principal, in the presence of a second teacher and to a maximum of four slaps.</P>
    <P>In practically all the schools contacted no corporal punishment is permitted.</P>
    <P>Various other sanctions are <Col N="815" /> employed, withdrawal of privileges, restriction from participation in games, report cards which students get signed at the end of each class for a period of a week.  If these are ineffective, parents are called in and suspension by the Principals may be imposed if this is thought to be the most effective way of dealing with serious cases of indiscipline.</P>
    <P>My apologies again for the delay.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Catholic Primary Managers' Association</i>
    </P>
    <P>Regarding your letter of 31 January, 1978, I asked the Diocesan Secretaries of our Association to ascertain the views of boards of management on the use of corporal punishment in our schools.  Of the replies I have received the majority are in favour of having some form of corporal punishment for mis-demeanour on the part of pupils. Other comments the Association wish to make are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Rule on Discipline&mdash;No. 130&mdash;is fair and reasonable and if acted upon in the spirit and in the letter there should be no serious demand for its abolition.</P>
    <P>A Clause might be introduced into the Rule stating that the Boards of Management have authority to decide whether or not corporal punishment should be administered for mis-behaviour in schools under their charge.</P>
    <P>Consideration might be given to the question of omitting the word &ldquo;corporal&rdquo; from the Rule.</P>
    <P>A high standard of discipline and good behaviour is absolutely necessary in schools if they are to fulfill their educational purpose.  How this is to be achieved is a matter for each individual school and each school must develop its own policy, taking into account the general directives of the Department of Education as well as the circumstances obtaining in different areas and even in individual classes.</P>
    <P>The school policy on discipline should be the result of discussion not <Col N="816" /> only between the teachers and the Board of Management but it should also take into account the attitude of the parents.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conference of Convent Primary Schools</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our Association strongly adhered to Rule 130, (1), (2), (3), (4), page 74 Rules for National Schools.</P>
    <P>The terminology Corporal Punishment is unfortunate since it has overtones of physical brutality and we feel that these words should be deleted from Rule 130 of Rules for National Schools and Disciplinary Correction inserted.</P>
    <P>Rule 130 should read: Disciplinary correction should be administered by the principal teacher and other members of the school staff authorised to do so by the Board of Management.</P>
    <P>We consider it uncomplimentary to the image of the Principal teacher in the school if he is given the sole responsibility of administering correction.</P>
    <P>Necessity for Disciplinary Correction: It is a deterrent when pupils cause deliberate injury to other children or damage property.</P>
    <P>It may be needed to instil in children a sense of responsibility for their misdemeanours and in some cases to counteract anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>Education is a preparation for life in an orderly, organised community where there are rules written and unwritten, the infringement of which call for disciplinary correction.</P>
    <P>In a home where self-discipline, obedience and respect for authority are encouraged, children will generally follow this pattern in the classroom; the converse is also true.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National School Boards of Management&mdash;Chairmen's Association</i>
    </P>
    <P>General: Reports from the Dioceses indicate that the present Rules are satisfactory and are observed in all our schools: Corporal Punishment being administered only by Principals as and when permitted. <Col N="817" /> There have been discussions at some Meetings of Parents on this subject and parents in general seem satisfied with the present position.</P>
    <P>Causes of Indiscipline: The home attitude is of vital importance; if discipline be non-existent there how can the school impart it?  Conversely if excessive physical punishment is common in the home, Corporal Punishment in schools is ineffective in enforcing discipline.</P>
    <P>Overcrowded homes can also cause unruly behaviour at school.  Some children may have health problems, mental or physical and we value the work of the Medical and Welfare Authorities in this connection.  Some teachers may have difficulties in keeping order in class and may need advice from Inspectors.</P>
    <P>Observations: We approve of the traditional Irish position that Teachers, along with Parents, feel responsible for general training for life; we would deplore the continental view of the teacher as purely an Instructor in specific subjects.  We would welcome further reductions in class numbers.  We believe the role of the parish clergy to be very important especially when there are problems in the home.  We believe regular visits of the Chairman to the schools have a valued part in retaining discipline.  The work of Attendance Officers and Garda Junior Liaison Officers is noted and appreciated.</P>
    <P>Sanctions: Withdrawal of Privileges can sometimes be effective. Detention during school hours works well for minor infringements.  In some few cases of extreme and persistent indiscipline, following consultations with Parents, Inspectors and other school authorities, a recognised system of Suspension or Referral to remedial classes or Special Schools would be desirable.  It is believed that the very existence of such a system would in itself be salutary.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Aontas na mBraithre Teagaisc&mdash; Bunscoileanna</i>
    </P>
    <P>Discipline and good order are an integral part of a child's formation. No child can develop socially, <Col N="818" /> academically or morally without the support of sound and constructive discipline. Children appreciate order as can be seen from the behaviour of normal children; they play games with very strict rules, they are unhappy if others break the rules.  Children from good home environments find support in the rules laid down by their parents. On the other hand, children from a disorderly home will feel insecure and often look for the attention they do not get in the home from the school. Therefore, constructive and sensitive discipline ought to prevail in schools and classrooms.</P>
    <P>The members of our Association adhere to Rule 130:&mdash;Teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affection and reason and not by harshness and severity.  Ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine the pupil's self-confidence should be avoided.</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only in cases of serious misbehaviour and should not be administered for mere failure at lessons.</P>
    <P>Corporal punishment should be administered only by the Principal teacher or other members of the school staff authorised by the manager for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Any teacher who inflicts improper or excessive punishment will be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and will be subject to severe disciplinary action.</P>
    <P>Rule 130, properly administered, is fair and just.  We see no particular reason for changing this rule except to satisfy the wishes of a very small minority opinion.</P>
    <P>We realise, indeed that the issue of Corporal Punishment is a very live issue of debate but we do not regard it as a major problem in modern education. Other problems such as class sizes, remedial and special classes, maintenance of schools, adequate equipment and many others are of far greater importance.  However, these problems have not got the emotive <Col N="819" /> value of the so-called corporal punishment issue.  Emotions can easily be whipped up in arguments which conjure up extraordinary pictures in some people's minds.  Some readily confuse corporal punishment with birching and flogging.</P>
    <P>We contend that corporal punishment is fast becoming a non-issue in practice in modern education.  We are extremely happy to note that the use of corporal punishment has diminished greatly over the past number of years.  We submit that the following are the reasons for this: - 1. Reduced numbers of pupils per Teachers; 20 years ago 60+ pupils per teacher was common; 10 years ago 50+ pupils per teacher was common. Even now 40+ pupils per teacher is common and this number is unacceptable.  With the decrease in class size there has been an obvious decline in the use of corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>2.  Reduced pressures on teachers; with the advent of the new Curriculum and the freedom given to the teacher to teach children at their own level according to their various abilities and backgrounds there is far less pressure on either pupil or teacher than there was before when set standards were demanded by a subject-centred curriculum.</P>
    <P>3.  Since the abolition of the Primary Certificate and local scholarships there is less pressure on schools from the system, from parents and society to see that certain standards were met and maintained. These standards, we contend, were often quite false and gave an artificial picture of the abilities of schools and children.  They also put pupils and teachers under severe and unnecessary psychological pressure.</P>
    <P>4.  Under the old system school inspection was often very severe and could put a school under an amount of strain.  Children were warned &ldquo;the cigire is coming&rdquo; or even after the days of H.E. teachers competed to get &ldquo;an mhaith&rdquo; or even the coveted &ldquo;sár mhaith&rdquo; as such marks helped in no small way to advance promotion.  The <Col N="820" /> cigire bogey-man syndrome is happily no longer with us and this has relaxed teachers in no small way.  Inspection is now carried out in a positive and helpful manner.</P>
    <P>5.  It was not uncommon up to 10 years ago to have two classes of 50+ sharing the one room.  Under the old curriculum which gave little room for flexibility this situation demanded extremely strict discipline which taxed pupils and teachers alike.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that with the introduction of the New Curriculum and the removal of many of the pressures on schools there is now a far more relaxed atmosphere in Primary Schools.  Discipline is not so rigid. Rules are not so sacrosanct.  Children have more scope for their abilities. Interesting and enjoyable subjects are more to the fore.  Children like coming to school.  Staffs are more relaxed and at ease among themselves.  Principals view themselves as leaders of a team. Neither is it a coincidence that with these improvements children are more interested and the use of corporal punishment has diminished greatly.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that in any organised grouping there have to be rules&mdash;written or understood&mdash;and that infringements of these rules normally call for sanctions of some sort or other.  Schools are no exception to this rule.  Schools must be orderly places in which children can learn. Disturbances of the good order of a school or class normally affect the whole school or staff and disorderly or unruly children can and do prevent other children from learning.  Most normal, healthy children will be disorderly from time to time and if they are not checked can and do become uncontrollable.  No teacher can teach and no pupil can learn in a disorderly situation.  Therefore, it would seem logical that to maintain a reasonable order in schools and to check unruly children certain sanctions may be considered necessary and useful. Indeed, children who look for a certain security from teachers demand order and agree that when they are unco-operative sanctions are necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> All forms of punishment and sanction depend upon the relationship between parent and child or teacher and pupil.  Most misdemeanours can be, and are dealt with by a verbal reprimand or a word of advice.  Also, it must be borne in mind that discipline is more and more geared to the individual child, his development and personality.  Pupil/teacher relationships can be improved with smaller class sizes in which the teacher, besides having a more manageable group of children, has the opportunity of knowing each child at a personal and social level and is able to deal with each at an individual level. Stories of sanctions taken outside the context of pupil/teacher relationships can be, and often are misunderstood.</P>
    <P>It is important that a teacher know his pupils well and understand their personalities and their home and family backgrounds.  This is impossible where teachers have to deal with 40+ pupils daily.  There are schools in depressed urban areas, where children have severe home problems, in which there are 45 children in classes that should have no more than 20 if they are to be catered for.  It is well known that many of these schools have a problem of discipline.</P>
    <P>Society is changing and schools change with society and it is admitted that we accept a much less rigid form of discipline than before.  We tolerate a lot of behaviour now that we would not have tolerated ten to 15 years ago. This is so with the mores of society in general which are far more liberal in the past decade or so.  However, it must be stated that there is a growing anxiousness about modern mores and behaviour patterns.  People are not at all happy that standards of discipline and standards of attainment are not as strict in schools as before.  And some are worried that this may contribute to lawlessness and immorality generally.  But others are of the opinion that discipline is not yet relaxed enough and argue that more freedom in the school situation would educate people to higher standards of personal responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Where does the truth lie?  Must we search for the golden mean?</P>
    <P>In the ongoing debate on discipline there seem, according to the media, to be two opposite poles:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Those who favour birching or, at least, far stricter penalties for offenders&mdash;especially young offenders.</P>
    <P>2.  Those who favour a permissive attitude and seem to blame society for the maladjustment of young offenders.</P>
    <P>Where do we look for guidance in this debate?</P>
    <P>The answer is to be found, in the teaching of the Gospels which urges sympathy with a strong moral and social teaching.  Kindness coupled with firmness seems to be a logical answer and excesses are contrary to Christian teaching.</P>
    <P>Normally we can leave the matter of class discipline to the good Christian teacher who has the best interests of his children at heart and can relate to them in a personal way.  Children, like and respect such people and will accept fair discipline from them.</P>
    <P>It is important that we define the aims of our schools and what standard of discipline is necessary to attain these aims.</P>
    <P>In recent times, there has been a noticeable change in children's attitudes to their teachers.  They approach them in a friendly way and look upon them as people who care about them.  They both like and respect their teachers and we view this as a very good development.</P>
    <P>Trust and openess in childrens' attitudes to approachable teachers seems generally to have replaced fear and shyness.  It seems to us that the improvement in parent/teacher contact has helped this situation in no small way.  Family and school have got together in mutual understanding and have learned a lot from each other.  Parents have often expressed agreeable surprise at the fact that their children like going to school and are reluctant to miss a day.  This, they say, is a far cry from their own experience. <Col N="823" /> It is our experience that parent/teacher meetings are generally in favour of fair and restrained corporal punishment and parents often marvel at the patience of teachers who have to deal with large numbers of lively children.</P>
    <P>Let us then:</P>
    <P>1.  Define &ldquo;corporal punishment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Parents have said &ldquo;okay give him a slap&mdash;but I'm against corporal punishment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>2.  Discover what hard and fast evidence and what research is available on normal corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>3.  Be careful of taking an easy opt-out position because the issue is contentious and emotive and place more and more burdens and responsibilities on the shoulders of teachers.</P>
    <P>4.  Generally leave the matter of punishment for parents and teachers to decide between themselves at parent/teacher meetings or with each teacher talking to individual parents.</P>
    <P>5.  Be careful not to undermine the authority of teachers or school policy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Federation of C.B.S. Parent Councils</i>
    </P>
    <P>This Federation believes that parental opinion in this matter should be sought and given due weight in any decision-making process.  Accordingly, we are now undertaking a rapid survey of the views of our members, and look forward to conveying the results of this survey to you as speedily as possible.  A questionnaire has been sent to parents in all Christian Brothers Schools in the country and we await replies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Secretarial of Secondary Schools</i>
    </P>
    <P>The J.M.B. is slightly perturbed about recent debates on this subject. Following a question in the Dáil, corporal <Col N="824" /> punishment seems to have been &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; by the Press and is now a live issue.  Given the sensational nature of the media, we do not feel that it is a suitable forum for a balanced and sensible discussion on a sensitive subject such as this.  To date, the question of corporal punishment has been dealt with in an emotive way and has been divorced from its much wider (and more relevant) context of school discipline.  The J.M.B. is naturally reluctant to contribute to such piecemeal treatment of this whole subject.</P>
    <P>That said, I am also to advise that the J.M.B. does not feel that it would be serving its members' interests by issuing directives about the methods of discipline which they should adopt. Some schools have few problems in this area, others are not so fortunate. The reasons are many and I do not propose to dwell on them here.  Suffice to say that any blanket statement on the part of the J.M.B. would be an inadequate and facile response to what is, after all, a complex question.  It is our opinion that any decision about discipline would have to be coloured by the individual school situation and should be taken at local level by those directly involved in the school.</P>
    <P>Should the Department of Education have any proposals for a more in-depth study of discipline, the J.M.B. would be most happy to contribute.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conference of Convent Secondary Schools</i>
    </P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter of 31 January last.  The position of the Conference is that discipline is a matter which is the responsibility of the individual school.  We are however, totally opposed to excessive punishment of any kind.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Association of Irish Headmistresses</i>
    </P>
    <P>In our Secondary Schools&mdash;which are girls' schools&mdash;we have not found a need for corporal punishment, nor would we support the idea that it might be necessary.  If work is not completed on time, it is completed in free time, and if a child misbehaves <Col N="825" /> she may be deprived of something she enjoys doing while she does something useful to help the school community or some reading for her own advancement.  The punishment is made &ldquo;to fit the crime&rdquo;.  In the case of Senior girls the special privileges which are their normal due may be withheld&mdash;privileges tie up with responsibility and have to be earned.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Methodist Board of Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our Board has now decided to give considerable thought to this subject during the next few months and we have set up a working party to carry out the study.</P>
    <P>We are of the opinion that the subject of Corporal Punishment is not a simple question, on which comment can be made without proper consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Catholic Headmasters' Association</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our Association does not have any official policy on corporal punishment and as in many other matters, decisions in this area are left to the discretion of individual headmasters.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Vocational Education Association</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Vocational Education Committees do not permit teachers in their employ to use corporal punishment. No useful purpose would be served by permitting the use of corporal punishment.</P>
    <P>Since 1930 the Vocational Schools have achieved results without corporal punishment.  In its place they have relied on the clock, common sense, consideration for others and reasonable conventions.</P>
    <P>Schools maintain discipline to enable each child to live at peace with himself and in social harmony with his teachers and fellow students and to work hard.</P>
    <P>In a democratic society a wide range of choices and activities is essential. This should be reflected in the schools.  If a child is to have freedom to choose between a number of <Col N="826" /> courses of action the soundest form of discipline for him is self-discipline. Good self-discipline cannot begin until close supervision is withdrawn.</P>
    <P>If the child is to align himself positively with the aims and objectives of his school, discipline must be based on the mutual respect of teacher for student and student for teacher.</P>
    <P>The good school does not make its students behave well but rather makes them want to behave well.  For the majority of children the school should provide an easy atmosphere where they can decide for themselves that what is asked of them is reasonable. Responsibility with independence is what is required in the students' behaviour and application to work.</P>
    <P>First, the majority of children do not resent authority.  The trouble begins only when authority verges on authoritarianism.  If school rules are made after consultation with teachers and students the likelihood of serious indiscipline will be greatly reduced. Adults and children find it easier to obey rules when they have some say in the making of the rules.  This does not mean that a vote has to be taken every time a rule is changed.  It means that rules are properly communicated to those who have to obey them.  It means that rules should be seen to be fair, just and necessary for the promotion of the greater good of the students.</P>
    <P>Second, students may be deprived of privileges and personal freedom in cases of indiscipline or serious failure at lessons.  Purposeful detention can be used here in place of corporal punishment.  Students may be debarred from participating in games and extra-curricular activities.  They may not like this restraint on their personal liberty but it may be all the more effective for just that reason.</P>
    <P>Third, if detention or other forms of restraint on personal freedom fail students may be put &ldquo;On Report&rdquo;.  This will entail reporting to the Principal or his delegate first thing in the morning and last thing in the afternoon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> During the course of the day the students concerned will have a written report made out on their conduct and application to work at the end of each class by the class teacher.  If after a week there is an improvement this should be acknowledged.  If there is no improvement then other remedies must be sought.</P>
    <P>Fourth, where students who have been on report continue to be disruptive the school may suspend them for a limited and definite period.  Suspension may help the children.  If so, well and good.  If it is considered that suspension will do more harm than good then the school will have to regard these as problem students. These students need the school's help and consideration in a special way.  A major part of the school's duty to society lies in helping such children to get back into the main stream of life in general and school life in particular.</P>
    <P>Three things are essential:</P>
    <P>(a)  That each problem child is intimately known to a member of the teaching staff,</P>
    <P>(b)  That any problem which is important to the child is important to that teacher and through him to the school,</P>
    <P>(c)  That personal contact is established with the child's parents.</P>
    <P>Working with the parents the teacher will endeavour to enhance the child's self-esteem and give him some feeling of success.  The child who has no interest in school subjects, games or extra-curricular activities may be given responsibility for such a simple thing as ensuring that there is an adequate supply of chalk in the classrooms every morning.</P>
    <P>Fifth, if all else fails the educational psychologist for the area may be called in.</P>
    <P>Sixth, if at the end of the day the school cannot help, the parents can be advised that a change of school or perhaps a school with special facilities is required.</P>
    <P>The vocational schools should continue to rely on example, vigilance and <Col N="828" /> persuasion for the promotion of acceptable standards of discipline and work.</P>
    <P>These views are carefully thought out and responsible.  They indicate the very high ideals that motivate the various organisations.</P>

However, a claim for contributory old age pension was received from him on 27 November 1978 through the local social welfare officer. There are no contributions paid or credited on his behalf under the insurance number furnished by him on his claim form and a search of the Department's records has failed to disclose insurance for him under any other number.  In the circumstances, the deciding officer has had to disallow his claim.</P>
