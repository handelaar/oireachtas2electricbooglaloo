    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has raised, at any time, with the British Premier, Mr. Callaghan, the question of granting political status to republican and socialist prisoners in H Block, Long Kesh; and, if not, if he will now make representations to the British Government on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not raised with the British Premier the question of political status for prisoners at Long Kesh.  I do not propose to make representations to the British Government on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it a fact that in May of last year at Geneva we subscribed to a protocol allowing guerilla participants to claim prisoner of war status in a situation where war has not been declared?  Is that true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not see its relevance to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it not a fact that, if we subscribed to that concept, we could ask that it be implemented in a situation of this kind?  We have intervened before where we felt our fellow citizens were being treated with undue hardship by the British in relation to Strasbourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy ought to know well there are many implications <Col N="870" /> to the question he is asking and I do not think he ought to pursue the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: Question No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Could I ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have called the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it not a fact that a situation of virtual martial law exists in the North and, in these circumstances, would it not be reasonable to ask that these people who are captive and helpless and cannot do any more damage should be treated with some compassion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: The persons to whom the Deputy has referred have been convicted of criminal acts and sentenced to imprisonment in the prison known as Long Kesh.  There are not only prisoners who could be described, as the Deputy has described them in his question, as republican and socialist; there are prisoners who would describe themselves otherwise as well in Long Kesh convicted of similar type offences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, as a result of the proposed census in 1979, the following statistics will be available for the number of persons in the State who are (1) single; (2) married; (3) widowed; (4) deserted; (5) separated; (6) divorced; (7) unmarried parents; and (8) persons with marriages annulled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The 1979 census of population will contain a question on marital status, but it will not be practicable to distinguish separately the categories (4) to (8) specified in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister accept that such statistics would be useful if not essential in planning social and other reforms in the years ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="871" />
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: They might be useful, but a census of population, after all, is a general purpose inquiry and, as such, must involve questions which are relatively simply and unambiguous. I think the Deputy would agree that to include the categories referred to in his question would entail ambiguous questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will statistics of this order be included in the general census which I presume will be held in 1981?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will give details of the unfair methods which the Tánaiste alleged, according to a report of an address to the US Chamber of Commerce on 25 May 1978, some of the IDA's competitors have been resorting to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: In his address to the US Chamber of Commerce in Ireland on 25 May 1978, the Tánaiste referred to the indications which we had recently that some of our competitors have been trying to undermine Irish promotional efforts by misrepresenting the situation in regard to the export tax concessions here. This reference related to the activities of a promotion agency of another EEC country.  I am informed that the agency concerned misrepresented the position regarding export sales relief to at least three US based companies during the autumn of last year at a time when these firms were considering the location of manufacturing facilities in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential feature of these misrepresentations was to call into question the credibility of assurances by the Irish Government concerning the entitlement of new firms establishing in Ireland to receive export sales relief until the statutory terminal date of 1990. Appropriate representations were made to the authorities in the member state concerned.  Since then there have <Col N="872" /> been no further indications that this type of conduct is being pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister mean that an agency of an official kind, analogous to the IDA in this country &mdash;an official agency of another EEC country&mdash;were making these representations? Is that the size of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand the position to be that they are a publicly funded agency, not analogous to the IDA to the extent that the IDA are a national organisation.  Many of the other countries are organised from this point of view on a regional rather than a national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate that the Minister has made representations.  I hope they have taken the form of a strong protest.  I do not want to press him on the country concerned, but can political control be exercised over this agency by the country concerned so that a protest will reach the people it is destined for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have reason to believe the protest has reached the people concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy his knowledge of the plans of the Response from Industry Group, the formation of which was announced in the daily newspapers of 27 May 1978</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have no knowledge of the plans of the Response from Industry Group apart from what has been reported in the press, nor have I anything to add to the reply which was given to a similar question on 23 May 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the House to take it from that, that the Minister's Department know no more about the plans of this group than the rest of us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is correct.  The Department are not involved directly with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware&mdash; I am sure he is aware&mdash;that the <Col N="873" /> group's plans envisage them entering into activity of a kind for which at least two statutory bodies, namely the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, already exist?  Surely their activities should be of concern to the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would see this group as being supplementary to the work of the public agencies and, for that reason, I welcome their initiative which is a useful one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not dissent from the potential usefulness of this, but surely the Minister is making an assumption about this group on the basis of no knowledge?  He has just told the House he knows nothing about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the contrary, I have informed the Deputy that what I know about them is what has been published by these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: If this group have not communicated with him in detail about their plans how can the Minister be sure that their work will not cut across and possibly obstruct, perhaps without meaning to do so, the work of Fóir Teoranta or the IDA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not think what they are setting out to do will cut across those agencies.  They have expressed themselves in the documentation they published as being anxious to help those agencies and in no sense to pre-empt them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: How can the Minister claim such lack of knowledge when it is alleged in the newspapers that a Senator who is a member of his parliamentary party is the secretary to this group?  Does he consider it proper that the said Senator should be secretary to that group, according to the newspapers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is a matter for the Senator and the group.  From the names I have seen, I would speculate that various political parties are represented among the membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister consider it strange in the context <Col N="874" /> that the said Senator was one of the chief fund-raisers of his party during the last general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will make a statement on the reported employment of a London firm of consultants to advise on the Irish film industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is not correct that consultants have been employed by me to advise on the Irish film industry. However, I did engage consultants to advise on possible methods of making the National Film Studios of Ireland viable.  The consultants, a London firm, were awarded the assignment following the usual system of competitive tendering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: Has the Minister any legislative proposals or amendments to bring forward to the House at this stage in relation to the industry, or has he any comment to make on that aspect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>: Has the Minister received any inquiries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would hope to be in a position to publish legislation later in the year, but it will be in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister saying that he is engaging these consultants to advise specifically on the Ardmore Studios but not on the future possibilities for an Irish film industry in general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: No, they advise on possible methods of making the National Film Studios of Ireland viable which they are not at the moment.  In the course of their advice they have made suggestions in a broader area than simply those studios alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="875" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister consider either making the consultants' advice public or communicating pieces of it, some of which might be of interest to people concerned with the development of the film industry here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he has authorised the Industrial Development Authority to assure potential industrial investors that no future Government in this country will alter the terms under which foreign industries settle here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have not authorised the Industrial Development Authority to provide potential investors with assurances of the type referred to by the Deputy.  It has, however, been the practice to provide, in appropriate cases, assurances to individual firms concerning their entitlement to export sales relief.  The need for such assurances arose from questions which had from time to time been raised in various quarters about the future of export sales relief.  These uncertainties will be eliminated by the recent satisfactory outcome of the discussions on the EEC co-ordination of regional aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that his colleague, the Minister for Fisheries, gave an unscripted statement, which was reported in the papers on 1 June last, to the effect that no Government here would ever change the terms on which foreign industry was now settling here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister for Fisheries, in the context of export tax relief and the fact that it would be available until 1990, gave an assurance to an audience&mdash;which included a lot of foreign industrialists&mdash;that that change would not be made in respect of those who were entitled to that relief up to 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister having explained what his colleague meant, I <Col N="876" /> see the point now, but would the Minister not agree that the statement as made by his colleague, not scripted, in other words off the top of his head as so often is the case, could give a false and misleading impression to anyone interested in the future of our industrial development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would refer the Deputy to the information which I gave to the House on 8 June in response to a Question by Deputy Walsh regarding industrial development in a number of towns in south west Cork.  I understand from the Industrial Development Authority that this represents a comprehensive summary of current plans for industrial development in south-west Cork.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The advance factories mentioned here are a 15,000 square feet cluster of five units for small industries in Dunmanway and there are various other projects of <Col N="877" /> proposed factories to be built.  One is at Dunderrow near Kinsale, and also the authority were actively seeking to secure a replacement project for the Jacobson factory in Bandon and seeking a suitable industrial site in Bantry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: Being aware of the figures in the reply relative to Kinsale, which involves a new undertaking, and Bandon, which involves a factory that closed down and which has an existing premises, I was more interested in proposals for further advance factories in west Cork as indicated in my question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that the recent figures given in reply to a Parliamentary Question indicate an increase in unemployment in west Cork over the figures for the previous year? On that basis would he accept that there is need for a further industrial drive in particular by way of provision of more advance factories in west Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The only increases in unemployment in west Cork appear to be at Kinsale where there was an increase of 33 and in Bandon the increase was seven.  In seven other locations there was a decrease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am advised by Bord na Móna that of a total order valued at £600,000 recently placed for plastic bags for moss peat, an order valued at £200,000 was placed with CB Packaging Ltd. I am further advised that the cost of packaging is a significant proportion of the total production cost of moss peat, 85 per cent of which is exported.  While the board give all possible consideration to the interests of Irish manufacturers in purchasing equipment and materials they must, in considering quotations, bear in mind the need to maintain their competitive position in the export market.  Acceptance of an uncompetitive quotation from an Irish firm could adversely affect the board's prospects in the export market, thereby jeopardising employment in the moss peat factories.</P>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply to a somewhat similar question on 8 December 1977&mdash;Volume 302, No. 7, columns 1111-1112&mdash;in which I explained that the arrangements for supply of electricity, which include opening of accounts, and collection of <Col N="884" /> charges therefor are settled by the ESB in accordance with normal commercial practice and as such are not matters in which I intervene.</P>
    <P>I understand, however, from the board that they will make supply available direct to any applicant who complies with their standard terms and conditions for supply and that in fact many of the board's existing customers are tenants of private rented accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Minister accept that there is a substantial degree of injustice in the situation where some people living in private rented accommodation&mdash;I presume they are taxpayers&mdash;are in effect deprived of the right to enjoy access to electricity which is in a monopoly position?  Is the Minister aware that there is a genuine difficulty here for some tenants, who for one reason or another may not be able to contact their landlord or may have a difference of opinion with him and are thereby deprived of the right to heat water for a bottle for a baby or to heat their own room?  The Minister should consider intervening in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The ESB are willing to give an independent connection to any tenant who, within reason, requires it.  I presume the Deputy is referring to a situation where the landlord had not paid the bill and the electricity was cut off.  That could be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand that unfortunately that has happened in some instances, but it is primarily a landlord and tenant matter.  The tenant could overcome it by asking the ESB to give him either a direct connection which, I understand, they would normally be willing to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not certain that the ESB would have to get the consent of the landlord to give an independent supply.  I imagine that if facilities were available it should be possible to arrange an independent supply for most tenants.  I imagine that in some houses where there are a lot of bed-sitters it might be difficult but in any large flats it should be possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: The question refers to bed-sitters.  Is the Minister aware that this is a big problem in Dublin? Landlords refuse to bring tenants to court in order to get them to vacate but blackmail them by turning off the electricity and the water?  It so happens that the electricity can be turned off if the bill is not paid although tenants have already paid for the electricity to the landlord.  Will the Minister take steps to stop this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of difficulties being experienced by current house purchasers who had signed contracts prior to the passing of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, where such contracts provided for a leasehold title and who are now unable to enforce such contracts or obtain mortgages and the steps he proposes to take to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not aware that the position is as stated in the question. I am aware of a newspaper report of a statement said to have been issued by the Deputy in relation to these matters.  I regard the statement, as reported, as being misleading and, in certain respects as I shall explain, liable to do harm.</P>
      <P>Since what the Deputy is contending is that the Act created difficulties that would have been avoided&mdash;and that could still be avoided&mdash;if policies advocated by him were accepted, I have to make it clear that I am not prepared to accept his policies and I am in no doubt that house purchasers generally would also reject them once they knew what the Deputy's policies implied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain transitional difficulties&mdash; nothing like as big as the Deputy suggests&mdash;were inevitable if the sale of new dwelling houses by way of lease was to be ended.  I was not prepared, and am not now prepared, to abandon that objective simply to avoid those transitional difficulties.  It was a matter of Government policy that the law would put an end to the sale of new dwelling houses by way of leasehold. It was not enough that the law should prohibit new ground rents as there are <Col N="905" /> other facets of leasehold ownership inconsistent with what houseowners in general rightly expect.  This policy required a cut-off date to be provided for in the Act and excluded the idea of allowing leaseholds to be created after that date even if there was a prior contract to give a leasehold. There were consultations with representatives of the legal profession on all this and it was accepted by them that it was important to avoid the uncertainty which such an exclusion would create.</P>
    <P>The Incorporated Law Society issued clear warnings to their members, both by public advertisement and by individual letter to each member, about the need to have leases completed before the cut-off date unless there was an agreement to give a freehold after that date.  I have no reason to think that those warnings were disregarded&mdash;indeed I would be astonished if, in view of the seriousness of the matter, any solicitor had disregarded them.</P>
    <P>I have seen no evidence, beyond the Deputy's statement, that thousands of householders are affected and I invite him to send me the evidence on which that statement is based.</P>
    <P>A suggestion in the Deputy's public statement, as reported, is that house purchasers are being called on to pay what is referred to as an additional premium in order to get a freehold in a case where the contract was for a leasehold.  The clear implication is that it is improper for a builder to expect any such payment.  Such an implication is unfair and is, I suggest, liable to lead to unjustified acrimony between builder and purchaser.  I am in fact aware that in certain cases extra payments have been sought, but the only cases that have come to my notice are cases in which the contract to give a lease also provided for a ground rent to be paid, and the builder is now offering the fee simple for an additional sum approximate to what one might call the &ldquo;formula&rdquo; purchase price of such a ground rent under the 1967 Act.  I obviously cannot and should not comment on figures that may be under negotiation but it should be clear that the law could not compel a builder to give fee simple where he <Col N="906" /> had contracted to give a lease subject to a ground rent unless he got reasonable recompense for loss of the ground rent.  The builder is entitled to seek a reasonable <i>quid pro quo</i> for the loss of the ground rent which the purchaser had agreed to pay.</P>
    <P>There may, of course, be cases where the builder has not himself a freehold interest but only a lease.  Such a builder is now legally entitled to take steps to get a freehold and he obviously has a very strong commercial interest to get it as soon as possible.  Any delay will no doubt cause some temporary inconvenience but that is unavoidable unless we are to have uncertainty in the law in the future.  It is in the long-term interests of the purchasers even in those particular cases that they should get a fee simple.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that I have no evidence and no reason to believe that any builders are seeking to use the Act to go back on a sale in a situation where it is open to them to provide a fee simple instead of a lease, or are seeking to enforce a higher payment than the approximate equivalent of the ground rent for which the contract was signed.  If they should do either of these things, I am advised that the house purchasers can depend on existing law to protect their interests. If that were to turn out not to be so, I should certainly be prepared to look at the matter again and without delay, but I have no reason to believe that there is any need for that.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by again inviting the Deputy to send me the evidence on which he has based his statement and, subject of course to the principles I have outlined in this reply, I shall see whether there is any avoidable problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to raise a matter on the Order of Business concerning Item No. 47.  Some weeks ago I put down a motion asking &ldquo;that the Patents (Amendment) Rules, 1978 be and are hereby annulled&rdquo;.  The precedents for this are two orders of 1971, the James Connolly Memorial Hospital Board (Establishment) Order, 1971, for which one-and-a-half hours of Government time were given and the Unemployment Assistance (Unemployment Period No. 2) Order, 1971, put down on behalf of my party and the Labour Party at that time for which three hours were given.  To my mind and to the best of my knowledge there is no precedent for not allowing Government time in this kind of situation.  In fact, under the Patents Act, 1964, there is provision in section 3 (2) for this annulling mechanism and also an obligation, I would suggest, on the Government to provide time for it.</P>
      <P>To me, this is a very serious breach of the statute and nothing short of contempt of the statutory obligation on the Government to provide this kind of time.  This is the last day incidentally on which this can be taken, the 21st day after which the matter was placed on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>: If Deputy O'Toole has not told the full story I think I should do so.  Fortunately, we anticipated that the Deputy would raise this today and I made inquiries as to the background.  The order to which the Deputy refers and which he seeks to have annulled was made on 24 April and laid before the House <Col N="942" /> at that time.  The Deputy submitted his motion on 3 May, at the beginning of last month, some five weeks ago. No attempt was made by the Deputy to ask for time or to arrange for the matter to be taken until last week when the Chief Whip of his party requested Government time to take the motion.  The Chief Whip was informed that because of the financial business now before the House and the need to have it enacted in a short time it would not be possible to make Government time available but that, if the Chief Whip wished, one hour of Private Members' time tonight might be availed of for the purpose. The Chief Whip of the Fine Gael Party when asked what Private Members' time was requested by his party this evening nominated the item which I have just mentioned, No. 18, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1978 and made no reference to Deputy O'Toole's motion.  Since the Deputy has quoted precedents he might have quoted another one of 1976 when a similar motion was brought in by Deputy Wilson.  The motion at that time was to annual a statute of the National University of Ireland and it was taken in Private Members' time. The Deputy still has an opportunity, if he wishes, to have his motion taken tonight in Private Members' time.  I am prepared to ask the Ceann Comhairle to amend the Order of Business for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: The precedent quoted by the Taoiseach does not come under the statute quoted by me, it is a different annulment order.  Secondly, the person for whom Private Members' time is being provided tonight, is entitled to his three hours for his Private Members' Bill, and I will not intrude on that time.  The obligation is on the Government to provide time, and my not making a request for time until now is simply because under the statute the onus in on the Government to make time available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: When the Minister wound up the discussion on the last sitting day he gave some indication of the background to the thinking about the need to provide special provision for widowed persons and pointed out that the present income tax system recognised that there are special conditions and circumstances attaching to the condition of widowhood.  The Minister then talked in detail about the various options proposed at various times either to increase or to reduce the amount of relief and allowances to widows, and I got the impression from what he said that he did not favour either of those approaches and would be happy to see a continuation of the existing position and that this is why he rejected Deputy Barry's amendment. In the course of his contribution the Minister made a statement which cannot be justified by the facts.  The Minister argued that between last year and this year the differential between the widowed person and the single person has been maintained.  This statement is true only in a sense which means nothing in real terms to the widows.  It is true only in the sense that the same extra allowance of £70 has been given to the widow as to the single person.  It is not necessarily true that because the same allowance is being given to each, the differential is being maintained.  Their allowances were different to start with and secondly the value of £70 in 1977 is not the same as the value of £70 in 1978.  If we look at the overall increases in the tax-free allowance between 1977-1978 and 1978-1979 in percentage terms we will see that a married couple with one partner working had an increase of 57 per cent, a married couple with both partners working had an increase of 47 per cent a single person had an increase of 30 per cent and a widow or widower had an increase of only 27 per cent.  I fail to see how the Minister can maintain <Col N="946" /> that the differential is being maintained when the position of the widow relative to the single person has been worsened over the intervening term of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support Deputy Horgan's analysis.  Over the years justice has not been done to widowed persons under the tax code and the Minister in the current Finance Bill is accelerating and increasing the injustice. <Col N="947" /> I can illustrate this by comparing what has happened to the tax-free allowance of a married couple with no children, on the one hand, and the tax-free allowance of a widowed person, be it man or woman, with six children.  What has happened to these over the years?  One would assume that as our society became better off it would seek to provide relatively better for those whose need is greatest, namely, widows or widowers with children.  In fact, since 1966 society has been doing the exact opposite. Between 1966 and 1977 the allowance for a widowed person with six children has been increased by 122 per cent whereas the allowance for a married couple with no children has been increased by 179 per cent, a difference of over 50 percentage points.  To my mind this is regressive taxation.  It is a very bad redistribution of income.</P>
      <P>Accepting that all parties have some responsibility for the situation one would have expected the Minister for Finance to have done something to redress the situation in this Bill.  One would have expected him to approach this in a very different manner.  This year for every £9 increase in the tax-free allowance of a widow or widower with six children there has been an increase of £57 in the tax-free allowance of a married couple with no children.  He has increased the privilege in the case of a married couple with no children as against the widowed person with six children.  The same case can be made in regard to the widowed person with five, four, three or two children.  The example I have given of the widower with six children graphically illustrates the position.  This is a wrong approach and I would hope the Minister would consider the introduction of an amendment to rectify this situation between now and Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I have already pointed out that the absence of any increase in the housekeeper allowance is again hitting the weakest, namely the one-parent families where the parent has to go out to work and a housekeeper has to be employed to look after the children. The housekeeper allowance is only £65 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: First of all, I would insist that my recollection is correct and, if it is correct, then the Minister should take the necessary steps to restore the differential at the very least. It is only a matter of a couple of extra pounds on the allowance from the point of view of the differential between the widowed person and the single person.  Whatever about the single person claiming he or she is discriminated against, I am sure no one will resent something which is purely the maintenance of the differential. Another point the Minister might consider&mdash;he spoke about it himself and it is something recognised in the report of the Commission on Income Taxation&mdash;is the heavy burdens that fall upon a widowed person in the tax year in which a partner dies.  The tax-free allowance drops from £1,960 to £935, a drop of over £1,000.  This is almost certainly the one year in which the widowed person needs everything he or she can get in terms of tax-free allowances.  Surely he will accept the basic thinking of the commission and make some move towards special allowances in that particular year.</P>

      <P>: In the social welfare code, on the death of the wage earner the full rate of benefit is allowed for 13 weeks following that death.  There is recognition there that special financial circumstances exist which warrant special treatment and the same argument should apply here.  A <Col N="949" /> widower may be in a very bad position because it is generally accepted that men are less competent housekeepers. In the vast majority of cases the widower must go out to earn a living for himself and his children and he must, therefore, employ a housekeeper to look after his household.  There should be a transitional period for a number of years.  I do not suggest it should be the period stipulated in my amendment.  The Minister may be able to put forward a better suggestion on Report Stage, a suggestion which would be readily accepted and welcomed by people in general, irrespective of whether or not they are married.  Most people recognise that special treatment is called for and if the Minister will tell me he is willing to bring in an amendment I shall be quite happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: First, if a wife dies during an income tax year the husband retains the married allowance for that year.  Secondly, if my recollection of what I said on the last occasion is incorrect and Deputy Horgan's turns out to be correct, I shall apologise to him.  Thirdly, Deputies are well aware that the changes in the allowances, including those in respect of widows, to whom this amendment relates, are changes that were promised in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, changes accepted by the people, and I have no plans to change these allowances in this income tax year.</P>
      <P>It is, I suppose, heartening and to some extent touching that Deputies opposite are so concerned about the position of widows.  It is unfortunate that their parties did not show the same concern they are showing now when they had the opportunity to do something.  One may easily lose sight of the fact, listening to what was said on this amendment, that this section to which this amendment is proposed provides for by far the biggest increase ever seen in the widow's allowance. One has continuously to bear that in mind when weighing up the effects of this proposed amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the first point raised by the Minister I would ask <Col N="950" /> him to tease it out a little more.  He said a married person whose spouse died during a tax year could retain the tax allowance for the remainder of that year.  If a man's wife were to die on 31 March I take it he would get the allowance only for the remaining few days of that tax year and would get nothing the following tax year.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: But if a man's wife died on 6 April he would get an allowance for the entire year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That would be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: That appears to be inequitable because the misfortune and the hardship are just as great for the person whose spouse dies in April as for the person whose spouse dies in March yet the person whose spouse dies in April gets a tax-free allowance for 12 months and in the other case the person gets a tax-free allowance for only a few days.  Would the Minister at least concede that there should be equality of treatment in this matter and that a tax-free allowance equivalent to 12 months, whether it be in one or two tax years, should be granted in all cases rather than what is being done here?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to widows' allowances and the record of the respective parties.  I have figures which show that from 1960-61 to 1972-73 widows' allowances were increased from £259 to £324.  That is not a very great sum.  The increase in 1974-75, and this is conceding the Minister's point about earned income relief, was from £324 to £550, and when we left office it was £735, against £324 when we came into office.  That is a much bigger increase in our short period in office than the increase of about £80 in the entire period Fianna Fáil held office&mdash;from 1960-73.</P>

However, I feel the Minister is avoiding the basic point which is not really a question of apologies&mdash;I am sure the widows of Ireland would rather action than apologies&mdash;but does he accept as fact that, for a given widow in given circumstances and a given single person in given circumstances last year and the same two people this year, without any alteration in their circumstances, the increase in personal allowances given to the widow is 3 per cent less than that given to the single person?  Regardless of whether the Minister wants to or proposes to do anything about that, would he not accept that that is a fact?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to say something about this as somebody who has knowledge of the way widows feel about this budget and the attitude of the Government and the Minister for Finance towards them.  As a member of the widows' association I can tell the Minister that they feel they have been dealt with very badly in this budget.  Previous speakers said that on a percentage basis widows did not get the same consideration as other sections of the community, notably married persons, nor have they got parity with single people this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of Women put the widows' case forcibly. Last week the Minister spoke about the lobby that was present and that single persons should have equality with widows.  It does not serve any purpose to play one group against another.  All women realise that there is a particular problem with regard to <Col N="952" /> single-parent families and to widows. I would like to be able to speak of single-parent families rather than widows but I realise that in widowhood, irrespective of whether they are widows or widowers but particularly if they are widows, the family's standard of living, generally speaking had been determined by the wage of the husband.  In Ireland once women are married they have very few facilities for continuing to earn their independent incomes; there are no facilities for the caring of children.  Even today women earn roughly 60 per cent of that earned by men.</P>
    <P>The standard of living of married women is determined by the wage of the husband.  There is a very big drop in that standard of living when the husband dies.  These people need special consideration in all legislation, particularly in the Finance Bill.  There should be special appreciation of the problems of people who lose their partners.  These people suffer traumatic experiences, particularly in the early years of their bereavement.  The overheads are not lessened and still must be paid.</P>
    <P>The efforts made by the previous Government to try to take those circumstances into account should have been maintained in this budget.  Instead we have a situation where the widow's increase is only 27.21 per cent while it is 30 per cent for a single person and 57.27 per cent for married people.  The increase in this budget is £70 a year for widows while for married people paying income tax at 25 pence in the £ it is £157 and for married couples paying at 50 pence in the £ it is £315 a year.  In this budget we have a situation where the more you have the more you get.  If the Minister wants to pursue the point that everybody&mdash;single people, widowed people, or single-parent families&mdash;should be treated alike, he should have introduced a substantial single-parent allowance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry, when moving this amendment, made the point that he had no hard and fast views about this. He was putting forward a principle. He said that if the Minister, with the resources of his Department and with the advice available to him that would <Col N="953" /> not be available to an Opposition Deputy, could think of a better system he was prepared to withdraw his amendment in favour of it.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I still have the problem which I mentioned on Second Stage and which the Minister did not have time to deal with.  Perhaps he would do so now.  It relates to Government policy in relation to personal allowances and indexation in general.  Unless my memory is faulty, during the period of the last Government considerable political capital was made by the Opposition then out of this.  It was, therefore, with considerable surprise that I read in the Minister's speech on 24 May 1978 at column 1764, volume 306 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I doubt very much if indexation would be a very popular measure at a time when inflation is reduced and is likely to be reduced further.</P>
      <P>I must ask whether the Minister has one policy in Opposition and one when in Government in this respect. If they maintained in the past that indexation is appropriate in regard to income tax reliefs dependent on the level of inflation why have Fianna Fáil changed now that they are in Government? It is estimated that the level of inflation this year will be between 7 per cent and 8 per cent and therefore to be consistent with their position in Opposition the Government should restrict income tax revenue increases to 8 per cent.  The concessions given in section 5 will probably fail to do this, according to the Government's published figures.  It may be that some taxpayers will keep pace with inflation, but others will not and therefore the Minister may be robbing Peter to pay Paul and in the process rewarding some people handsomely at the expense of other taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure published prior to the budget it was forecast that there would be an increase of 21 per cent in income tax receipts if the level of personal <Col N="954" /> allowances remained as it was.  In such circumstances one would have expected the Minister to have given allowances which would mean there would be only an 8 per cent increase in income tax revenue.  However, considering the £70 million which the Minister is giving in relief in respect of personal allowances, the increase in income tax revenue is nearly 14 per cent compared with last year.  Therefore, despite the generous appearance of the reliefs being given we find that income tax revenue this year is estimated to be £624 million as against £522 million last year, an increase of 21 per cent which, considering the £70 million in concessions, means a 14 per cent increase.  Because the Minister gives back only £70 million in the budget, it seems as if he has kept £30 million for the Exchequer by pretending he is giving these reliefs in personal allowances across the board.  He may be giving reliefs to some people but he is increasing the burdens of others.</P>

There is no concession being given to married couples in respect of their children&mdash;indeed there is no child allowance concession given under this Bill.  During the debate on the amendment dealing with this I said it would appear that the Government have an anti-family bias running right through the Bill.  There has not been an increase in children's allowances and in this section, as I have said, there are no concessions given in regard to children. There are allowances for married people, for widowed people and for single taxpayers but there is nothing for children.  The Minister referred to the promises given in the pre-election Fianna Fáil document but there are the matters of subsidies in relation to bread, butter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I got the impression on the last occasion that the Minister was extremely sympathetic to what Deputy Desmond referred to as single-parent families and that the Minister would like to do something to help such families.  Therefore, I trust that on Report Stage he will table an amendment that will in some way recognise in the taxation code the special, the lonely and unfortunate position in which people find themselves on being widowed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is so.  In relation to personal allowances, would the Minister be prepared to accept the recommendations in the NESC paper concerning income transfers?  I have not had an opportunity of studying this paper in depth but I understand that it deals broadly with the concept <Col N="956" /> of a negative income tax, with the idea that instead of having one system with its independent means test, independent bureaucy and so on, that allows for the paying out of money while there is another equally independent system in the form of the Revenue Commissioners making the same sort of inquiries about people's needs, taking in money and granting allowances in relation to the number of children and so on, there should be an integrated system whereby both the social welfare code and the tax code would be unified.  This would eliminate the situation whereby people qualify for allowances in so far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned but find that the allowances are negatived by another Department.  I appreciate that it would be a major job to remodel our tax system in order to achieve this result but perhaps the Minister would indicate his views in this regard.</P>

Also, the Deputies will find that I advocated indexation in a limited area.  Deputies opposite tend to forget that while they were in Government the inflation rate for part of the time was running at well in excess of 20 per cent per annum.  In the context of this section we are talking of the biggest increases in income tax allowances ever given. This is at a time when inflation is falling, when the whole picture is different.</P>

I have pointed out also&mdash;Deputy Horgan referred to this but glossed over it&mdash;that indexation now, at a time of falling inflation, would be less than popular.  If indexation were applied to the rates that obtained last year there would be no increases of the kind proposed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures calculated by Deputy Horgan are misleading him because, by taking in global figures, he is including a number of factors that do not apply in the case of individuals for instance&mdash;increased incomes and increases in the numbers employed gainfully and who are, therefore, paying tax.  There are other items but I hope these two alone will illustrate to the Deputy that it is not correct simply to take the global figure and apply it to the individual.  If you do that you find that the position of all individuals, whether they are married, whether they have children or whether they are single or widowed, is improved substantially by this section.  Indeed, it is of some relevance to remark, since we hear comparisons frequently being made between the situation here and in Britain, that under this section a married person who is in receipt of the average industrial earnings here and whose wife is not earning would be paying £133.95 less in tax than his <Col N="958" /> counterpart in Britain is paying while a single person with a similar income would also be paying less than his British counterpart although in this case the amount would be only £12.70. This situation is being brought about only because of the very substantial increases provided for in this section.</P>
    <P>Anybody can find fault with the income tax code and can indicate where considerable improvements can be made.  In this regard I would be slow to yield pride of place to any Deputy opposite.  But the fact that one does not make the changes that are proposed does not mean automatically that one is unsympathetic to the case or that one does not acknowledge that a fair case can be made.  Sometimes the point being made is merely a debating point but sometimes it is of real substance. However, the real test is what one does as distinct from what argument one makes when one is in a position to do something.  On that test Deputies opposite cannot afford to throw stones in this direction.</P>

      <P>: I agree that one should not compare the total figure <i>simpliciter</i> but is the Minister saying that the growth in money incomes and the autonomous growth in the tax-paying sector will account for as much as £30 million this year, that is the difference between £70 million and £100 million?  We do not even know&mdash; certainly I do not know&mdash;whether the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister's Department have any figures, projections or estimates for a tolerance growth.  If they had and if they published them, this might enable us to make more sense of this set of concessions. The basic argument I am making is that it is possible that many people will not benefit a great deal from these concessions.</P>

      <P>: I am just about to. Perhaps I should have said they may not benefit very substantially.  In <i>Business and Finance</i> of 20 April 1978 there is an interesting article by Mr. Brendan Dowling on the comparative situation in relation to allowances between the United Kingdom and here. <Col N="959" /> Mr. Dowling points out that married couples with two dependent children and on low incomes are very considerably better off in the United Kingdom than in Ireland because of the introduction of the child benefit fixed cash payment per child, which is untaxed in lieu of income tax allowances for children.</P>
      <P>Thus, a married couple with two children on £2,000 per annum would get a net payment from the State of £70 and 8p or 80p&mdash;the figure is not quite clear&mdash;in the United Kingdom while they would pay a net tax charge, including social insurance, of £40.72 in Ireland.  He is talking about a married couple with two children on £2,000 per annum.  The Minister may feel this is not necessarily a very representative figure, but figures he has given to me and to other Deputies in relation to the numbers of persons on various ranges of incomes show that far more people have to subsist on this kind of income than we are generally given to suspect.</P>
      <P>For example, on 23 May 1978 I asked the Minister specifically about self-employed persons.  There is a total number returning income for tax in the self-employed sector of 78,000 people and over half them are in the income range of under £2,500.  These are the people who certainly will not benefit substantially from this set of concessions.  They may not be even earning enough to earn the full value of these concessions.  It might be different if the Government's budgetary and other fiscal policies were designed to make good that deficiency, but there is no sign that that is so.</P>

      <P>: A Finance Bill is a bit like the curate's egg.  Lest anybody in the Public Gallery, or anybody who bothers to read what we say in this House, might think the Opposition do not welcome parts of the Bill, or think this is a game in which the Minister must automatically oppose anything we say and we must object to everything in the Bill, I should like to say I welcome this section.  I do not have to go back over the history of these unfortunate children and the dreadful mental effect on their parents because of this drug.  Anything which can be done to cater for these children or to make life as easy as possible for them is welcome.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister tell me if a parent of one of these children&mdash;and in some families there are two of them&mdash;has private means and sets up a fund, would the income from that fund be free of tax also, or is it related purely to the money which came from the German fund and the money provided by the State?</P>

      <P>: On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to endorse Deputy Barry's remarks.  The settlements arrived at were appropriate. They may never be adequate in the eyes of some people who were damaged by this drug.  If a settlement was appropriate it is also appropriate that the measures being taken in this Bill should be taken.  There is all-party agreement on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> Is it envisaged that there will be no further payments at any stage from the foundation to the children concerned?  Is it regarded as a shut case?  Is there a possibility that further payments may be made from the fund and, secondly, that other individuals may be identified in the future whose birth defects or other growth problems may be traceable to thalidomide?  Does this section cover all those eventualities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It will be appreciated that I am simply dealing with the taxation arrangements in regard to these payments.  I am not in a position to speak with authority on any possible development in the future and whether there will or will not be further payments.  I think it is true to say parts of the settlement made involved continuing payments.  As to whether there would be any reopening of existing cases, or any acceptance of new cases, I simply do not know. I have no information to suggest either of these things will happen.  On the other hand, I am not in a position to say positively they will not happen.</P>
      <P>The section is so designed as to cover payments made from existing known sources to thalidomide children. If a new source of payment for these children were to arise and if that should require an amendment of the section, as I think it might, of course the section could be amended.  The section as drafted deals with the situation as it is, and as we know it to be.  We have no reason to believe that will change but I repeat that, if it did change and an amendment were necessary, it could be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is, indeed.  The section gives unrestricted interest relief to individuals who borrow money to invest in a private trading company, irrespective of the size of the investment or the extent of their actual involvement in the company's business. Ironically I note that, even though some reliefs are available in the section, none of the reliefs would be available where the company lend back funds to an individual or a person connected with them, except where the company's business is lending money.  This is an anomaly of the relief.  A person will be able to get relief on lending money to a company who lend it back to him.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to take head-on the general approach of the section but to limit it in a way which will ensure that any form of encouragement which it is designed to give to investment or job creation is not compromised by any opportunities it may give rise to for tax avoidance. In the case of a private trading company, the position is at present that a person must be a full-time employee or a director of the firm, and hold at least 5 per cent of the stock, before he can benefit from unlimited interest relief against tax on borrowings for investment in the company. Under the section full-time qualification and the 5 per cent stock limit are both involved, so that a part-time employee or director can benefit irrespective of his investment or his state in the private trading company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about employees in this context it is obvious that we are not talking about Joe Soap on the factory floor.  He is not going to go out and borrow tens of thousands of pounds to invest with the company on whose factory floor he is working.  He would not get past the front door of the bank if he attempted to do so.  We are talking about persons in the upper reaches of the company, directors who are employed by the company and so on, who can usually acquire some <Col N="963" /> credit-worthiness with financial institutions simply on the basis that they are in a particular position in a company. The section as it stands opens up the prospects of an individual borrowing to invest in any number of private trading companies, off-setting the interest on his borrowing against tax, and at the same time drawing a return on his investment.  This is obviously a technique which could be abused, particularly because the part-time category allows individuals with little or no involvement in the company to benefit.  It is seriously debatable whether this unlimited interest relief should be allowed to part-time employees or directors of private trading companies.  If there are economic grounds for saying that this should be encouraged and permitted, then it should be restricted as we put down in our amendment, to companies engaged wholly or in the greater part in manufacturing.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners over the years have devised a fairly adequate definition of company activities to decide whether a company is engaged in manufacturing.  I would be quite happy to leave judgment to them as to whether such reliefs should be available to people investing in the company. Section 7, unless amended, could operate in such a way that an individual with £40,000 a year income could borrow £150,000 at 10 per cent to invest in one or more private trading companies, becoming a part-time, non-executive director of each of them.  His annual interest on his borrowing would be £15,000, but if he is in the 60 per cent tax band&mdash;and if there is any justice in this world he ought to be&mdash;the real cost would be only £6,000 a year while he would also receive the full benefit of the investments.  We are going to give a subsidy of about £9,000 a year to that individual to invest, not just necessarily, wholly or at all in manufacturing, but in any trading enterprise.  Because we believe in the importance of jobs and of investments in jobs we put down this amendment and the other one which is suspended from it to restrict this relief to people who make investment in the right way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: What I have to say must be said in the context of the overall budget strategy to which this Bill gives effect.  Certain sections throughout the entire Bill are designed to promote the economy in one way or another.  In regard to this section and our amendment we are concerned that the benefit of this position, for which the Minister proposes to borrow substantially, should be, as far as possible within the confines of a Finance Act, confined to the manufacturing sector.  That is the area in which, given the terms of reference that the Government and the Minister have set, one can legitimately say that such a strategy is justified subject to a number of constraints and conditions, one of which would be to see an increase in output in manufacturing.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind what Deputy Horgan has said, I would like to hear what the Minister has to say with regard to this amendment.  What we are against is that the strategy of the Government could be diverted or undermined by this provision being taken up by people to such an extent that the Exchequer would be robbed of revenue which it otherwise would have got.  At the same time the increase in jobs for which the overall strategy is designed would not materialise.  Essentially for that reason alone we are attempting to focus this benefit towards the manufacturing sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am mystified, particularly by what Deputy Horgan said. Some of the case he made and some of the figures he quoted&mdash;which I have not had an opportunity to check and I am taking them at their face value&mdash; seem to indicate that he was making the case that the relief provided in this section should not be given at all.  However, the amendments he moved and supported do not say that.  They say that the relief should be given but only in the case of a company engaged wholly or in the greater part in manufacturing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The case which the Deputy made seemed as though it could be applied even in the case of <Col N="965" /> a manufacturing company, and he quoted figures to show the amount of relief that an individual could get by engaging as a part-time director in ten companies&mdash;let us say manufacturing companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I was referring to trading companies, not necessarily manufacturing companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Surely the Deputy can see that the argument he made could be applied to somebody who does this as a part-time director in ten manufacturing companies.  The logic of that was not followed through and the Deputy did not propose that this relief should not be given at all.  He said that it should be given in the case of manufacturing companies but not in the case of non-manufacturing companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us pursue that a little further. The relief is confined to trading companies; therefore, by that definition, we are excluding investment companies and so on and we are confining it to companies which in broad terms are engaged in manufacturing, distribution or the provision of services as normally understood.  The Deputies have accepted that the purpose of the amendment is to encourage people to engage in and invest in and risk their money and some of their time at least in enterprises which are likely to create employment.  Where did he get the idea that all new employment in this country has to be in the manufacturing industry?  Do we not know that to the extent that we increase employment in manufacturing industry we will have a spin-off of at least one-for-one in the service industry?  Do we not know also, viewing our overall job-creation requirements and the strategy required to help in the creation of jobs, that we should in our present circumstances pay particular attention to the encouragement of job-creation in the service industries?  Yet the effect of the amendment would be to exclude these and deliberately to take away the encouragement&mdash;that they seem to agree with in the case of manufacturing companies&mdash;from the service industries or distribution.  The approach of the Deputies is quite illogical.  If this relief <Col N="966" /> creates the jobs, whether they be in manufacturing, in the service industries or in distribution, which more precisely is part of service industry, why should we discourage it?  If it makes sense to do it in manufacturing industry, does it not make sense to do it in service industry?  I cannot see the logic of the Deputy's position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: If this option was picked up, has the Minister any idea what it is likely to cost the Exchequer in terms of lost revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not think I could give a figure on that.  With due deference to the Deputy I am not sure that it is very relevant.  If it is relevant it is relevant to manufacturing as well as to the service industries.  The object of the exercise here is to create jobs. If this operates to create jobs why do we say that we will only welcome that if it is in manufacturing and we will not welcome or encourage it if it is in the service industries?  I do not think that makes sense.  Furthermore, there is provision in the section for relief for employees.  While it would be true, as Deputy Horgan said, that employees who would benefit from this in many cases would be in the higher echelons of the work force, they would not all be confined there. Certainly they would not be confined there in the particular cases where there is a limited provision in the Bill in relation to public companies but there would be definite schemes in operation for the taking up of shares by the shopfloor employees at normally advantageous terms.  If one gives this relief in the case of a manufacturing company, how does one justify keeping it from not alone part-time directors but employees of companies engaged in the service industries?  One either accepts the general proposition in the section and carries it through or one does not accept it.  That is a position one can take up but I do not think one can have it both ways; one is either for it or against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are concerned that the benefit to be gained from this section is not taken up by trading <Col N="967" /> companies.  The net effect of that would be that all the money and energy the Minister referred to would go into the creation of what we would consider to be short term jobs based on an artificially stimulated consumer boom.  We would prefer, if there are options in this, to focus attention through the benefit of this concession into the manufacturing sector of trading companies rather than into the service and distribution.  That is the intent behind our amendment.  We feel, in the context of the overall strategy of the Finance Bill, that the emphasis, in so far as it is justified, can be justified only if that money which is being borrowed goes into the manufacturing side of Irish industry. I accept that frequently a manufacturing company that would qualify for this would be importing much of its raw material but nevertheless there are jobs and jobs.  In this context, as the Minister stated, we accept on face value the statement from the CII, and others, that for every one industrial job or manufacturing job created one can carry another job, the one-for-one ratio that the Minister referred to earlier.</P>

In the course of a reply to a question tabled by Deputy Horgan on 31 May 1978 about how much this concession is likely to cost we were told that the annual cost was tentatively estimated to be less than £200,000.  We are not talking about a lot of money either way.  The point we are essentially trying to raise is: in so far as there is discretion in this concession we would like to see it focused on the manufacturing side of trading companies rather than on service and distribution companies.  I do not think there is much point in us making a big meal of this.  The Minister has heard out arguments and, perhaps, they have not been elaborated as much as he would have liked but I suggest that he consider this between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>: Deputies Horgan and Quinn and the Minister are referring to this section as a job-creation section but I cannot see anything in it that mentions job creation at all.  My understanding of the section is that it will hopefully improve industrial relations by giving Joe Soap on the factory floor or the part-time director an opportunity to share in the profits.  I would be slow to consider such part-time directors in the same light as the Minister because a lot of the part-time directors are nearly professional directors in that they do nothing else but become directors of public companies. Speakers on this section should stress the point that this is an effort to get some kind of profit sharing or involvement by people in manufacturing and service industries in the running of the enterprise in which they are employed. I do not see any form of job creation in this except in an indirect way.</P>

We have to decide whether we extend it to a lot of people or to a small number of people.  There is a logic in the Minister's own remarks about the value of jobs in manufacturing industry.  I accept a lot of what Deputy Barry has said although I doubt that the section will be as hugely availed of for this purpose as he expects it may be.  If what the Minister has said is true, that the fundamental importance of manufacturing jobs is that they create other jobs and provide the financial and economic basis for other jobs, then the logic of that is that this £200,000 should be focused in manufacturing industry.  It will then create a situation in which perhaps next year or the year after a further extension of it might be appropriate.</P>

    <P>The purpose of these amendments, apart from amendments Nos. 20 and 22 which are drafting amendments, is to extend the relief provided for by section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As it stands, subsection (1) provides unrestricted relief for interest on borrowings by employees and directors, either full-time or part-time, of private trading companies to acquire shares in or lend money to their companies.  The amendments now proposed will make the unrestricted relief available to full-time employees and directors of private holding companies whose business consists wholly or mainly of the holding of stocks and so on in private trading companies.</P>
    <P>As it stands, subsection (2) provides for relief for interest up to a maximum of £2,000 on borrowings by full-time employees or full-time directors of public companies to acquire shares in or lend money to the company of which they are employees or directors.  The amendments proposed will make this relief available to full-time employees and full-time directors of trading companies, the shares in which are held by a parent company.  In other words, the relief which was being provided to either public or private trading companies is being extended to cover <Col N="971" /> arrangements which are very common where there is a holding company, in the case of a private trading company, or a parent company in the case of a public company.  In all cases we are talking about trading companies, not non-trading companies.  Trading companies are manufacturing companies or companies which are engaged in service industries or distribution.  They are trading companies as distinct from investment companies.</P>
    <P>Under existing law relief is available for interest on borrowings to buy shares in, or to lend money to, a trading company or a company whose business consists wholly or mainly of the holding of stocks and so on in a trading company, if the borrower (a) owns more than 5 per cent of the ordinary share capital of the company and (b) has, during the period from the application of the loan until the interest was paid, worked for the greater part of his time in the actual management or conduct of the business of the company or of a connected company.  The purpose of section 7 of the Bill is to remove the restrictions I have referred to at (a) and (b) so that investment and employee participation in industry and in trading companies generally may be encouraged.</P>

      <P>: Substantially that would be so.  In this context it is an arrangement which is quite common for convenience of administration more than anything else.  Where an enterprise has a number of businesses of various kinds, manufacturing, service and so on, and each one is operated as a separate company but is owned or substantially owned by the one group, it is very common in such cases to have a holding company which controls the other companies.  The holding company itself may not be trading but its assets consist almost exclusively of shares in its trading companies. In such cases if you extend this relief to the trading company it follows logically that it should be extended to the holding company of that kind.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(6)  Section 496 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (as amended by the Finance Act, 1974) is hereby amended by the insertion after paragraph (b) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>`(c)  for the year of assessment 1978-79 or any subsequent year on the excess of the interest over £3,000;'.</P>
      <P>Some years ago it was introduced that people could only claim against tax an amount of interest up to £2,000. The increase in the price of houses means that the £2,000 no longer represents what it was thought to represent, that is, the amount of interest to be paid on medium to large houses.  A house that cost £15,000 last year is not a mansion by present standards. The interest on that money would have been £1,600 or £1,700.  According to recent figures a house that cost £15,000 last year would now cost £20,000.  With a mortgage at 11¼ per cent the interest on £20,000 would now be £2,250.  Portion of that interest would not be allowed for tax purposes whereas last year the total amount of interest was allowed.  I am suggesting that the £2,000 should be raised to £3,000.  I am using 1974 as the basis for my calculation and the capital gains tax introduced then, which the Minister said he is going to index when the Bill is published, would be 81 per cent.  To keep the £2,000 in line with the figure that was used at that time, it should now be raised to £3,630.  I am suggesting that we should have that figure at £3,000 from now on to ensure that people buying relatively modest houses are not caught as they were never intended to be under this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: As Deputy Barry said, the limit of £2,000 is, in general, related to the cost of servicing loans for house purchase.  Of course, it is not exclusively confined to that; it covers any other kind of interest as well of a personal nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="975" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: But I am mainly interested in house purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: But it is primarily related to that.  At the present building society rate of 11½ per cent the £2,000 represents borrowings of about £17,500.  If we take a loan of that amount as being 75 per cent of the purchase price, it would cover the purchase of a house costing more than £23,000.  We can safely take it that the purchaser of a house of that price at least would be in the 35 per cent income tax bracket and very possibly in the 50 per cent bracket.  Relief on £2,000 interest for the taxpayer in the 35 per cent bracket would represent a tax saving of approximately £700 and for the taxpayer in the 50 per cent bracket, a tax saving of approximately £1,000, savings which are not by any means negligible reliefs.</P>
      <P>The great majority of borrowing to cover house purchase is covered by the present limit.  But, having regard to the movement in the price of houses, I would not be unsympathetic to the case Deputy Barry made. Indeed I might well have provided for some change in this limitation&mdash; though perhaps not exactly the one that Deputy Barry proposed in his amendment&mdash;but for another factor that has changed this year, that is, the abolition of rates on residential property.  This is relevant to consideration of this issue.  Perhaps the figure I am about to give represents a fairly extreme case but it illustrates the relevance of it.  A saving of £500 in rates out of after-tax income represents, in the case of a taxpayer in the 60 per cent tax bracket, pre-tax income of £1,250.  This gain is equivalent to relief on an additional £1,250 interest or, put another way, to an increase in the limit for relief in the section to £3,250 as against the £3,000 proposed by Deputy Barry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general the abolition of rates is equivalent to ten to 12 times the rateable valuation of the house purchased grossed up at the purchaser's marginal rate of tax.  Therefore the abolition of rates has had an effect in so far as this existing limit is concerned.  In practice it has increased the limit <Col N="976" /> over the £2,000.  As I indicated, if that had not happened, I would think there was some case for an increase, whatever that increase might be. Having regard to the upward movement in the price of houses I can certainly assure the House that the limit will be kept under review.  But in view of the relief being provided this year, through the abolition of rates in the way I have indicated, that is sufficient.  I might reiterate that the matter will be kept under review so that if it is necessary to make an alteration in the limit that will be done, but I do not think it is essential to do it this year.</P>

      <P>: The Minister prefaced his remarks by saying that perhaps he was quoting an extreme case.

      <P>: The only comment I want to make on what the Minister said is that the theme appearing to run through this Finance Bill is that one gives with one hand and takes with the other.  If the Minister is giving rates relief then he should not take it back this way.  The same applies to the capital acquisitions tax and to the rates on farmers, where the Minister is giving with one hand and taking back with the other. Either he is giving or he is not giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I think Deputy Barry is mistaken in relation to this item because we are taking nothing back as regards the abolition of rates.  By abolishing the rates we are giving additional relief which did not apply.  This £2,000 limit was in operation last year.  This year there is the £2,000 <Col N="977" /> limit plus the abolition of rates, so we are not taking it away.  The figures I was giving&mdash;even though as Deputy Horgan says, the particular example I gave was perhaps extreme&mdash;nevertheless indicate that it is true for all cases.  I did give the general approach which would cover any case, that is, about ten to 12 times the rateable valuation grossed up at the marginal rate of tax.  That would apply to any case.  That is an additional item of relief this year and we are not taking anything away when we give it.  Therefore I think Deputy Barry is mistaken in what he says about this item.</P>

He admitted that the price of houses had moved up and that there was merit in moving up the limit of £2,000 but he was not going to do that because the relief of rates had been introduced. Therefore, if the relief of rates had not been there, the Minister would have moved this up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

Would the Minister regard this as socially appropriate or not?  My second question is whether or not banks qualify as trading companies under the terms of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, banks are trading <Col N="978" /> companies within the meaning of this section.</P>
      <P>On the question posed by the Deputy in relation to people whose business it is to lend money, we may be at cross purposes.  I think the Deputy may be referring to a provision in the section which is an anti-avoidance measure rather than a loophole, as the Deputy seems to think.  In general perhaps I should say that the basic reason behind the relief being given in this section is this.  There are broadly two categories of people one can think about who can assist in the creation of jobs in this context.  One is the man who is reasonably wealthy, and perhaps has a business or a profession, who is willing to invest a certain amount of his money in a business and take the chance on it.  He will not be devoting anything like his full time to that business.  He will be in partnership, perhaps, with other people and they will be engaging management and staff. If, as is normal in cases of that kind, he would borrow the money, although he would have the assets on which to borrow, and if he would not get any relief on the interest, he would in many cases decide that it was not worth his while at the cost involved to take the risk.  I know of a number of cases where such people have made that decision.  They were reasonably comfortable anyway and they felt it was not worth their while to take the risk when in the end it did not make a great deal of difference to their personal situation if they did not invest at all. The object is to encourage people to invest in manufacturing or distribution or services and thereby create new businesses and, therefore, new jobs. That is the basic thinking behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other category of person involved is the manager, or managing director in some cases, of a company. In general, I am thinking in terms of people who are not terribly old but quite effective in business and whose services are, perhaps, sought by a number of businesses but who do not have a great deal of capital behind them.  It is quite common for people like that to be offered as part of the deal when they are engaged share options in the business.  Of course, this <Col N="979" /> is a form of incentive to them to build up the business and to the extent that they succeed in that they are increasing the value of the shares they have taken up.  Such people, although they may have relatively high incomes, frequently have no real capital behind them and the main thing they have to sell is their entrepreneurial skill.  In order to take up the share options they have to borrow money.  Such people are affected by the existing limitation and this section is designed to give relief in such cases so as to encourage this kind of development, which adds up, I believe, to a greater dynamism in different kinds of business and if we can get that it follows that we can get more jobs.  That is the basic thinking behind the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not know if I share entirely the Minister's optimism when we see the way in which manufacturing employment is failing to recover at the moment, according to the latest figures available to me. There are two aspects of section 7 which point in slightly different directions: one is the abolition of the full-time qualification and the other is the abolition of the 5 per cent stock limit.  I am wondering whether the Minister has considered the possibility that the simultaneous abolition of both of these makes companies more vulnerable to a loss of majority control to persons who are not directly involved in the companies along the lines the Minister was describing.  He mentioned people who are offered share options as part of their remuneration. They can benefit under this section, but so can people who are not directly employed by the company.  It seems that there may be a danger here of exposing companies to change of control, passing from inside the company to outside the company, and perhaps ultimately the creation of monopolies which would be inimical to the kind of orderly development of the economy for which we are all looking.</P>

It was subsequently adopted by the Government as a matter of policy and enshrined in this Bill.  In the circumstances I could not accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>: The Minister says he cannot accept the amendments and does not want to do so because of what happened in the election campaign and the various proposals that were put to the people in that regard. But he is also seriously saying that, more or less for the indefinite future, we are to have two categories of businessmen in Ireland&mdash;one assessed on a notional basis, if they want so to be, and another assessed on an accounts basis&mdash;because it makes nonsense of any attempt to ensure reasonable horizontal equity in fiscal policy or reasonable planning in investment policy to have a situation like that?  I urge the Minister to tell the House, regardless of whether this will extend for the next three or the next five years, whether in principle he accepts the fact that at some stage&mdash;and the sooner the better&mdash;the special protection being extended to the farming community in this transitional period will give way to a system in which their income and their outgoings can be compared on a reasonable basis with those of other members of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is a strong case when dealing with the agricultural industry for arguing in favour of the notional system or some similar system on the grounds that it can, while levying taxation, encourage production, which is of course in the national interest. But I want to put it to the House and to Deputy Horgan in particular that when you are dealing with this area especially you can very easily <Col N="982" /> lose if you concentrate on what appears to be the equity of the situation and ignore the reality of how much tax you can collect.  For instance, if we were to abolish the notional system I have no doubt that we would collect far less income tax from farmers than we do at present.  Whether one takes the view that that is a good thing or a bad thing is not, I think, relevant here. With the notional system, with the multiplier which may change every year in relation to the amount of production and agricultural prices, it is possible reasonably accurately to calculate the amount of income tax that would come from the persons concerned.  Experience to date shows that the accounts system as applied to farmers is not the ideal system from the point of view of any Minister for Finance.  I say that without regard to the party affiliation of a particular Minister for Finance. A Minister for Finance is obviously interested not only in the amount of revenue for the Exchequer but also, if the tax is applied to a particular sector, to see that there will be a yield reasonably commensurate with the estimate.  Experience suggests that situation does not obtain in relation to the accounts system applied to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the arguments adduced by the Minister on this section to date I think there is an element of tongue-in-cheek on his part in his defence of the current notional system. Our amendment is put down on the basis of having a fairly brief discussion with the Minister on this matter and pointing out once again the entirely anomalous situation existing.  If I were a farmer I would regard the notional system as being surrounded with very considerable uncertainty in the years ahead as to the tax payments I might have to make.  As a PAYE tax person you have the consolation at least of knowing where you are and knowing the system that will be there by and large in the future.  But the farmer depending on the system is dependent on the multiplier and on the caprice of individual Ministers, whether they adopt a hard or a soft line.  I should not like to be trying to project an investment programme for a farm conscious that by the middle 'eighties <Col N="983" /> such may be the pressure from urban areas, and above all from those subject to PAYE, politically there may be no option but to bring about massive changes.</P>
      <P>Already there are straws in the wind.  I recall Deputy Callanan, for whom we all have deep respect, seeking from the Minister some indication of what things would be like next year in this general context.  We should all like to know.  The Minister for Agriculture has been saying recently that farmers in general will have to pay more tax.  The area of uncertainty is beginning to open up.  I do not think revenue projections should be dependent on the manifesto of one particular political party, even if that is coming apant at the seams now after 12 months.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think there is a serious situation.  The Minister earlier said that perhaps instead of the current system one would have, to use his exact words, &ldquo;something similar&rdquo;.  It is the &ldquo;something similar&rdquo; that puts the fear of God into farmers, because right into the last general election every Fianna Fáil canvasser who went into every farmyard in the country used the words &ldquo;something similar&rdquo; and what Deputy Richie Ryan was not going to do to them in terms of the multiplier and the notional system if the Coalition got back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another peculiar kind of argument adduced by the Minister was that at least the yield under the notional system is predictable.  Only a week or so ago he was talking about the £14 million for 1978 being perhaps somewhat less&mdash;one was not quite sure. Admittedly, while the system has the virtue of simplicity, it is a kind of simplicity which does not merit being included in any country's taxation system.  I do not want to prolong the agony of this system which has been exhaustively analysed in various reports, particularly by the National Economic and Social Council and occasionally by the ESRI.  I think everybody accepts, from any kind of worker in the Revenue section down to a third year economics student, that the system that now operates, this <Col N="984" /> dual system of farm taxation, is by and large unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>More serious perhaps than any other objection we have raised to the system there is the element of disincentive to productivity.  There is a very serious problem here, because there were no productivity criteria built into the payment of this tax. Whatever else one might say about the deficiencies of the accounts system, about the difficulties of the Minister trying to garner revenue from the accounts system and about the views of certain accountants who have made a fortune advising farmers on how to avail of the accounts system to pay less tax, to suggest that the notional system would if it were abolished hinder growth in agriculture is wrong, because it is obvious that if anything it contributes on a disincentive basis.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, which have been analysed time and again in this House and around cabinet tables over the years, we feel that the sooner a planned development of farmer taxation takes place, the better, so that by the 1980's there will be an established norm, a rational criteria of taxation. Most farmers would welcome this because they would be able to plan ahead.  We favour some commitment by the Government to the general principle outlined in our amendment. It would be a commitment for broad equity between different sections.  There is no greater irritant at a meeting than when one explains particularly to a group of taxpayers in any townland the budget situation under PAYE and the situation under the notional system. People know that it is inherently defective and unfair, that it is a typical creature of the typical politics of pragmatism and expediency of successive Ministers.  I urge the Minister to have a look at this question.  It is a matter that could be considered by a commission on income taxation.  This is one of those areas that could be usefully subjected to critical examination by a commission on income taxation.  It is years since we had such a commission and this is the right time to set one up.</P>
    <P>In the long run we are in favour of a form of farm accounting system. <Col N="985" /> Most farmers keep accounts.  They are engaged in an enormously costly system of production.  Most of them like to be involved in a farm accounting system and, by and large, they would prefer to pay taxation on a legitimately derived surplus of income on the farm.  With a proper tax system they at least would feel that the perennial political argument which goes on in this House would be ended for all time and they would not be the objects of envy in terms of their non-paying capacity, or in terms of having a surplus out of which they paid virtually no tax for all practical purposes.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the Minister should examine the notional system and should try to set some sort of deadline. I know the Minister would have to consult with the farming organisations on such a matter but it is better to do it in the House than by means of a blue paper, a green paper or a projected paper in the years ahead.  I have no doubt that the Minister would be even more respected for adopting that kind of reforming approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: In discussing the notional system of taxation, which is an optional system it is important to realise that a notional system of one kind or another is used in relation to farmer taxation in European countries. I do not have tabulated information with me but I understand that there is a notional system in operation in Germany based on the potential earning capacity of the land.  The farmer must pay so much tax related to the capacity of his land.  If he does not use his land properly to get the maximum from it he will still have to pay the tax, but on the other hand if he uses his land properly and gets more than expected from it he can keep the surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a national point of view, for Germany, there is a lot to be said for that system which encourages the optimum use of the land.  Land, unlike any other national resource, is strictly limited in supply and there is a need to ensure that it is used to the maximum extent.  When one is devising a tax for those engaged in agriculture one must take into account <Col N="986" /> this unique characteristic of the agricultural industry.  The position in relation to our notional tax system is that, in general, it is used to a much greater extent by farmers engaged in intensive farming.  Generally they would be farmers engaged in dairying. They are the farmers who are using the notional system and for whom the system is a sensible proposition because per £ of rateable valuation per acre&mdash;there is a rough equivalent between the rateable valuation and the earning capacity of the land&mdash;they are the farmers who are making more income per £ of rateable valuation per acre as compared with those who opted for accounts, farmers who may be in beef cattle production, for instance, where the gross margins per acre are much lower.  The notional system is an encouragement and a benefit to the most intensive farmers.</P>
    <P>I do not say the taxation system is the crucial factor in making these people produce more per acre because it is not.  The returns in the market place are much more important but, in so far as it encourages farmers to maximise returns, it has merits.  I have already said that Germany has this notional system and so has France where there is a notional element permanently built into the system.  I agree with Deputy Desmond that it is important that there should be certainty and predictability in relation to one's tax liability.  This is as important in the case of farmers as it is in the case of all taxpayers.  It is something that must be borne in mind. Care must be taken to ensure the tax code reflects the approach of the EEC. In the farm modernisation scheme the emphasis is on planning for five, six or eight years.  Planning necessitates fiscal inputs and financial liabilities outgoings and incomes, and the tax liability is a very important ingredient. In devising a tax system for farmers one must, therefore, take account of the realities and the needs.</P>
    <P>The notional system does not, of course, call for the same amount of expense on the part of the farmer because he does not have to hire accountants and he does not have to spend <Col N="987" /> a great deal of time preparing accounts or keeping accounts.  Time is money. One must therefore evaluate productivity from the notional point of view of the time spent.  I agree that management accounts should be kept by all farmers and failure to keep such accounts can be no excuse.  The important thing is to achieve equity between farmers and other members of the community.  Equity does not necessarily mean exact equivalents in precise terms of taxation.  Equity can be achieved in a number of different ways.  I trust the approach will take account not just of the needs of farmers but of the potential of agriculture and the importance of maximising the return per acre from all our land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: Naturally, I support this amendment tabled by the Labour Party.  Equity in taxation demands fairness to all sections.  Those on PAYE have a certain objection to the notional system.  When the system was first introduced it was intended as a period during which farmers would make the arrangements necessary to produce accounts.  We ask in this amendment that the period should be one year.  That may not be altogether practicable.  I think the Minister should state specifically what the period should be.  Those on PAYE argue that they are carrying an unfair share of the burden of taxation compared with the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely vital that taxation should appear to be fair and, while the notional system is retained, that feeling of frustration will continue where those on PAYE are concerned.  Farmers should not be a special section and I do not believe most of them want to be a special section.  Any I know believe they should pay their fair share of taxation.  When PAYE was introduced shopkeepers and others had to keep accounts and they very rapidly fell into line when they found themselves over-assessed by the Revenue Commissioners.  There does not seem to be any reason why farmers could not keep accounts.  If they have a choice they will naturally opt for the system which gives them the advantage. That is not satisfactory.  I think <Col N="988" /> most farmers now keep accounts.  If they get grants under the modernisation schemes they must keep accounts and make returns.  Of course, these are not for tax purposes, but they are there.  I admit farmers are now in the same kind of transitional period as were the small shopkeepers who were over-assessed and it might not be possible for them to switch over in one year.  But there is a strong case for their keeping accounts.  Those within the tax net are keeping accounts.  I believe they would accept what seems to be fair, that is, fair in comparison with people who run small businesses and in some cases businesses which are run in a slipshod manner.  These people have to make this kind of return.  The day will come when all the people outside the PAYE system will have to make returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  What is fair for the small business section of the community is also fair for the farming community and the farmers appreciate that.</P>
    <P>The majority of farmers in my area are in the tax net.  I believe they see it is only fair that they should have to make returns as the small shopkeeper living in that area has to do.  He is not making half as much money as the farmers are making.</P>
    <P>When the idea of the notional system was originally introduced it was intended as a breathing space for the people who had not been keeping accounts.  This is the biggest area of dispute between the people under the PAYE system and the farming section. It is about time everybody was under this tax system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: If this amendment or something like it were accepted it would resolve the problem that was raised at least as much on the Minister's side as on this side of the House at an earlier stage in our debate, that is, that there is, as far as I understand, a possibility under the notional system that persons will be assessed for tax on incomes which they have not got because of a bad harvest or a bad loss of one kind or another.  The Minister in his reply on Second Stage referred to this problem and said he was thinking of doing something about it.  I may <Col N="989" /> be pre-empting the discussion on some of the ministerial amendments, but not as I read the section at the moment is this problem being met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I indicated at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate that I had arranged for discussions between the Revenue Commissioners and the farming organisations in relation to this matter.  It relates specifically to the provision in the Bill which obliges one to opt for the notional system and to stay with the option for three years.  The outcome of the discussions will not be known for some time.  I indicated that anybody who opted for the notional system this year would not be bound for three years if satisfactory solutions emerged, which I expected, and if they followed the line of the solution which emerged.  Any amendment in this regard would have to await next year's Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister said that there were discussions going on between the farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners at the moment which hopefully will have the result that people who are now caught in the notional system for three years will have an option in next year's Finance Bill of coming out again.  Is that correct or is it a misinterpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: No, it is not, but I would not at this stage like to give the impression that what is likely to emerge is the right to opt out of the notional system under any circumstances. The principal concern in this regard is that we could have a situation where somebody was being taxed under the notional system on an income he did not have because his herd was struck by disease or something like that.  That is the primary concern and the primary reason for making any change.  That is why I said that whatever solution emerges&mdash;and I believe a solution will emerge&mdash;anybody who follows that solution will not be obliged to stay with the notional system for three years.  I cannot say at this stage what the solution will be except that its primary purpose will be to try to ensure that a man is not <Col N="990" /> taxed on the notional system on an income he does not have.  It is not just a blanket release from the requirement of this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 40, to delete &ldquo;30&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;90&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow the farmer a longer time from the date of the receipt of his assessment to decide whether he is going to go for the notional system or for the accounts system.  Section 13 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>... he shall be entitled, on giving, within 30 days after the date of the notice of assessment, notice in writing to that effect to the inspector, to elect to be charged to tax for that year in respect of those profits or gains on an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of section 21 ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the farmer will have to decide within 30 days whether he is going to go on the notional system.  I presume that once this Bill is enacted the assessments will go out straightaway and farmers will have 30 days more or less from that date to make up their minds if they are going to go for the notional system or the accounts system.  They are also going to have to make up their minds in the following context.  If they opt for the notional system they must stay on it for three years, regardless of what might happen to the multiplier.  This year it is 90 but next year it could be increased to 200 and the following year to 400. It could be increased in a capricious fashion without any necessary relationship to actual earnings in farming.  In other words, farmers could be trapped into the notional system on the basis of its apparent attractiveness this year. But they could suddenly find next year, <Col N="991" /> not because of a disaster on the farm like brucellosis, but because the Minister decided to change the multiplier, that the calculations they had made, which were correct for this year and represented the right thing to have done from the point of view of maximising their output, were not correct for the next year, because the same equation will not apply.  They would then find themselves with a much larger tax bill to pay than they had anticipated.</P>
    <P>If I have interpreted him correctly, the Minister said there are talks going on between his officials and farming organisations, unspecified, to see if there is a way around this dilemma. He said that if subsequently a solution is to be found, people who by some process of inspiration succeeded in making arrangements which coincide with the solution, so long as their approach is in line with the solution arrived at in the course of these talks, will be all right.  But the problem is that they have got to make their decision now, within 30 days of the date of assessment, and there is no indication from the Minister that the talks will have been completed within that period, or that even if the talks reach some solution, although it may be acceptable to the Minister, the Revenue Commissioners and the farming organisations, the Government will agree with the decision.  That does not always happen.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the farmer has to decide in 30 days whether he will go for the notional system.  I think the Minister will agree that if he were such a tax-payer he would feel he was being asked to place a great deal of faith in the talks and that he would not feel certain about his position.  This amendment has the merit of extending the period during which the farmer must make his decision from 30 days to 90 days.  There is a possibility that though the talks may not be completed within 30 days they might be 90 days later.</P>
    <P>The decision to be taken by a farmer now will be binding for three years, not one year as heretofore.  If the period was 30 days in the past and <Col N="992" /> binding for one year and because the decision now will be binding for three years I suggest that the period during which one must weigh up all factors should also be increased threefold, from 30 days to 90 days.  Therefore the period suggested in the amendment is appropriate in the circumstances of uncertainty created by this half promise that something may emerge from these talks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Farmers have known the position as it is in the Bill since budget day on 1 February, because I announced at that time this arrangement about sticking to the option for three years, and to suggest that they will need an extra 60 days on top of the period they already have had within which to make up their minds in the light of varying circumstances is a bit unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I refuse a basic idea Deputy Bruton appears to have.  I dealt with this when replying to the Second Stage debate, but in view of what he has just said I think I had better say it again.  The idea that somebody should be entitled to know one or more years in advance what his income tax will be or what his income tax rate will be is a proposition I cannot accept. Other taxpayers are not in that position. The rate of tax, the allowances and the bands, may be changed in any year and there is not a taxpayer who has a guarantee they will not be changed.  Therefore anybody who thinks that by going for the notional system this year something may emerge which will enable him to opt out of it, because of his dislike of the omens about tax rates, or whatever, should forget about it.  Let him go for the accounts system now and stick to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing that is contemplated in respect of the change in the provisions in the Bill is to cover a situation where because of something like disease or some other occurrence a farmer might find himself under the notional system paying tax on an income he did not have.  The talks I have referred to are designed to produce a solution to that type of situation&mdash;in other words, to try to ensure that a farmer on the notional system <Col N="993" /> will not be obliged to pay tax on an income he does not have.  It is not designed to allow a farmer a greater opportunity to assess whether tax rates are likely to change and thereby made a decision on that basis.  If he wants to think in those terms he should make his decision this year and he might well decide to go for the accounts system.  That is his business. The talks I have referred to will probably not produce a solution earlier than the autumn, and Deputy Bruton was right to suggest that a solution in that regard will not emerge in time for people to make their election in regard to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Perhaps it would if 90 days were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Not necessarily.  The person who is making his election now should decide it on the basis of such things as whether he plans to increase his production substantially for the next few years, whether he is in a position to keep accounts and so forth.  The kind of thing that is likely to emerge from the talks I have referred to will only be a solution to what I might describe as a disaster situation or at least a situation in which a farmer is being asked to pay tax on an income he does not have. It is not designed to meet a situation in which a farmer comes to the conclusion, having weighed up all the factors: &ldquo;I will be better off on the notional system this year and the accounts system next year&rdquo;.  Specifically we are trying to prevent farmers from switching from one to the other because, as Deputy Bruton is well aware, this is a fertile method of tax avoidance and that is why this provision is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is designed to extend the period of election for one system rather than the other from 30 days to 90 days, and I think I should make it clear that the basic system that will work will be that a farmer will be first assessed in the ordinary way, that is, on an accounts basis or on an estimated basis.  If he accepts the accounts system he can deal with the matter in the same way <Col N="994" /> as would any other taxpayer.  Alternatively, if he wishes to be assessed on the notional basis, by giving notice of his election for the notional basis he is effectively appealing against the assessment that was made.  The whole machinery is geared to treating such election as an appeal and the machinery that follows from that is the same as that which applies in the case of an ordinary appeal.  One of the aspects of the machinery in the case of an appeal is that there is a limit of 30 days in which to appeal.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that in the case of an ordinary appeal there are numerous circumstances in which an extension of the time limit may be permitted.  If, for example, a reasonable case is put forward, such as illness, in practice there is a reasonable approach by the Revenue Commissioners. Precisely the same law and administrative practice will apply in the case of an election for the notional system, but because it will be treated as an appeal within the tax system there is no need to extend the period. If one were to do so in this case one would need to extend the period in respect of all appeals if one were not to upset the whole fundamental approach regarding election for the notional system.</P>
    <P>It is not intended to provide the maximum possible further period for a farmer to assess his chances as between the notional and the accounts system.  By now a farmer should be in a position to make up his mind as to which system suits him best.  If he opts for the notional system he must continue on that system for the stipulated period unless he follows a line which I would expect to emerge from the talks.  That line, however, will be designed only to cover a situation in which, if the line were not followed, the farmer would be paying tax on income he did not earn.  Presumably a farmer's decision on which system to opt for will not be based on that kind of situation, which would be a kind of disastrous situation and one that will not enter into his normal calculations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: One should not facilitate anybody in using the notional <Col N="995" /> system as a means of avoiding tax by reason of calculations in relation to tax rates for instance, which affect everybody regardless of whether they are on the PAYE system or on a notional system.  However, the reason for the amendment arises from the fact that the tax in this case is based on a multiplier of the rateable valuation.  This year the multiplier is 90 but next year is could be 200, 400 or even 800.  The Minister suggested a valid principle, namely, that one should avoid a situation in which under the notional system a farmer would have to pay tax on income he did not earn.  The Minister seemed to imply that the only circumstances in which such a situation could occur would be in the event of some disaster on a farm and that it would be to cater for that sort of situation that the talks with the farming organisations would be concerned.  But the Minister failed to point out that such a situation could be brought about by ministerial action, by the Minister deciding to increase the multiplier at a rate much greater than the average rate of agricultural incomes.  For example, if we take the average agricultural income increase for next year as being 20 per cent, the Minister, should he decide to increase the multiplier by 100 or 200, could bring about a disaster situation.  In such circumstances the farmers would not be satisfied to have to pay tax on the notional system.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these points would the Minister consider building a safeguard into the proposals he is working out with the farming organisations in order to safeguard against a situation in which the Minister would decide to increase the multiplier by an amount disproportionate to the increase in agricultural incomes?</P>

      <P>: I tried to outline the kind of circumstances that would change the situation, but I would not like anybody to be misled in regard to what may emerge by way of relief in so far as the notional system applying for three years is concerned.  It will be only in limited circumstances that the relief can arise.  I cannot determine it now.  It will entail an amendment of the Bill next year.  What will be involved will be only a safety net for people who opt for the notional system and who will be confined to operating that system for three years.  But nobody should operate on the basis of being able to opt out of that system in the event of his not liking the level of the multiplier.  That would be self-defeating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept that, if a farmer in making up his mind were assured that the Minister would be increasing the multiplier only in line with the general increases in agricultural incomes, the farmer would be able to make a rational decision within 30 days, knowing his plans and his potential. However, there are two incalculables. One is a possible disaster on the farm, such as a herd being wiped out by disease.  The Minister has suggested that his talks may be concerned with that sort of possibility.  The other incalculable is a possible decision by the Minister to increase the multiplier by an amount far in excess of the average increase in agricultural incomes or, in other words, to depart from the practice followed by him in this Bill and by his predecessor in other Bills in regard to increasing the multiplier. Such an eventuality would not be provided for in the talks the Minister has in mind because it would not concern the type of narrow circumstances to which the Minister has referred.  It would not be dealing with individual farmers but with the broad mass of farmers.  The Minister has said that other taxpayers are not allowed opt for one system as against another although nobody knows in advance what the rates will be.  I am suggesting that, if that is all right for a person in that situation, it should be <Col N="997" /> all right for the farmer on the notional system.</P>
      <P>I respectfully submit to the Minister that he is not comparing like with like if he is making that case, because the farmer would be in the same position as that person so far as the tax rates are concerned.  If the tax rates go up, they go up for the farmer on the notional system just as they go up for the person on PAYE, and the farmer on the accounts system.  I am not suggesting farmers should be able in some way to get out of a high tax rate by switching from one system to the other. I would not countenance a provision to encourage them or facilitate them in doing so.</P>
      <P>People on PAYE or other forms of taxation are paying on the basis of what they actually earn.  The notional figure could be increased by an amount which is not commensurate with the actual increase in agricultural income. If the notional figure is increased by 100 per cent next year, the farmer has to pay regardless of whether he has any income.  We are not comparing like with like when we compare the option to go on the notional system with the option other taxpayers might have of working to a particular level of output or income.</P>
      <P>In his discussions, in addition to coping with the type of problem he already recognises, namely, the problem which could arise for a dairy farmer, for example, who opts for the notional system and his herd of cows is cleaned out by brucellosis&mdash;the Minister has indicated he is seeking a solution to that problem&mdash;the Minister would also need to give an assurance about his own intentions for the next three years in relation to the level of the multiplier, and to relate it to some objective measure of agricultural income so that it would not be possible for him to increase the multiplier wholly capriciously without any regard to what was actually being earned by farmers on the notional system.  The Minister would need to give that second assurance before his proposals would be acceptable in any sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, all of this is in the area of speculation.  We do not know what the Minister will concede at these talks. The farmer will have to make up his <Col N="998" /> mind in the absence of that knowledge. That is unfair and it should not be a feature of the tax system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not think it is accurate to say it is unfair that the farmer does not know what will emerge from the talks.  He has to decide on his option.  What I am trying to do in the talks is to cover a situation which could arise in certain limited circumstances. The fact that I am trying to do that does not make it unfair that a farmer has to decide on his option without having regard to what solution may emerge for the limited circumstances. He must make his decision on the basis that those limited circumstances will not exist in his case. We recognise that circumstances might arise out of animal disease.  Deputy Bruton seems to think another kind of disaster which might strike&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy did not, but he implied it.  He seemed to think the Minister would fix the multiplier at an inordinately high rate and he is looking for an undertaking from me about the level of the multiplier over the next three years.  First of all, we are talking about an amendment to extend the time of election from 30 days to 90 days.  Of course, that would not solve the problem the Deputy is talking about because, if the multiplier were increased, it would not increase until next year, the year after, and the year after.  That is what he is visualising.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be quite impossible for me to give an undertaking on the level of the multiplier next year or the year after at this time.  Obviously this has to be considered in the context of the budget.  The Deputy also knows that so far&mdash;including this year&mdash;the level of the multiplier has been lower than what one might call the mathematical level.  If one were to consider any undertaking, the only thing one could say would be that it would be in a fixed relationship to that.  That might not be an undertaking farmers would welcome.  On balance the Deputy will find it is best to leave the situation as it is.</P>

      <P>: I do not know about that.  I can see the drift of the Minister's argument.  Leaving it completely in the air is putting people in a situation in which they do not know what they are deciding about for the next three years.  Conceivably there could be a decrease in the multiplier if agricultural incomes were to fall in a particular year.  In 1974 there was a serious fall in agricultural income as a result of a drop in cattle prices.  The multiplier should be related in some general way within a certain tolerance.  There will have to be a tolerance one way or the other in regard to objective data on agricultural income.  Some such undertaking would be valuable if the case is being made that farmers must opt for three years.</P>
      <P>I have made my case.  The Minister will decide what he thinks best.  I am sure those who are making representations to him on the matter will also make their views known as to whether they wish for an undertaking from him.  I may put down a similar amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 9, to delete &ldquo;last&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;first&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment clarifies a point <Col N="1000" /> raised in relation to the provision that a farmer who has been assessed for tax on the basis of accounts for a period of three years may then opt for assessment on the notional basis. It has been suggested that the terms of the new section 20 (2) can be read as meaning a farmer would have to remain on the accounts basis for four years.  This is not intended and this amendment is designed to make that clear.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following proviso:</P>
      <P>Provided that the multiplier specified in the formula contained in section 21 (1) shall not be increased for the next two years of assessment following that year of assessment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has covered a lot of points regarding this amendment on amendment No. 27.  The position in farming is different from that of the PAYE earner the Minister refers to. The multiplier covers all the farming community, good farmers, bad farmers, lucky or unlucky farmers no matter how hard they work.  They may have a bad year and their income may decrease but they will still have to pay the amount of tax which is the product of the multiplier and their rateable valuation, whereas if the individual PAYE payer works less overtime or his income diminishes from some other cause he knows he will have to pay less tax provided that the tax bands remain as they are.  The farmer has no such guarantee as regards the multiplier.  Should he be sick for six months and his farm is run down, if he has already opted into the notional system he will still be liable for a fixed amount of tax no matter what his circumstances are. The multiplier applies right across the board to every farmer who opts for the notional system in the 30 days after the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are seeking to try within the notional system to find some formula <Col N="1001" /> that will allow these variations in individual farmers' cases to be taken account of.  That is the thinking behind the amendments we have put down for this section.  We want the farmer to have some confidence that in the third year of his assessment, 1980, if, through some circumstances not taken account of in the talks between the Revenue Commissioners and the farming organisations to which the Minister referred, the farmer's income drops there will be something built into this Bill that will allow him some means of not having to pay tax out of income which he has not earned.</P>
    <P>God forbid that Deputy Colley should move out of his present position and be replaced by somebody with less sympathy for the farming community than he has who would increase the multiplier to 150 or 200 in two years' time, when maybe there would be no green £ valuation in the EEC and when price increases would be at their present 2 per cent or 3 per cent level.  We are trying to get for farmers some assurance that in that unfortunate set of circumstances they would not be caught for tax out of income which they have not got, apart from the disaster which the Minister spoke about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The most effective way to ensure that one is not taxed on an income one does not have is to go on the accounts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: That may be so now but in two years' time they will still be caught in this and they may have no income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It may be reasonably assumed by any farmer who is weighing up the situation, and having regard to the terms of the talks that I have referred to, that an effort will be made to ensure that a farmer who opts for the notional system this year will not find in two or three years' time that he will be obliged to pay tax on an income that he does not have.  That is the general objective, but I cannot undertake at this stage to fix the multiplier for the years ahead.  As I have indicated, the fixing of the multiplier is primarily a matter to be dealt with in the preparation of the budget.  Farmers <Col N="1002" /> who feel that by opting for the notional system and sticking with it for three years they are taking on the risk that the Minister for Finance of the day may increase the multiplier either substantially or unreasonably and that the risks involved are too great must realise that the only sensible thing for them to do is to go on to the accounts basis.</P>
      <P>We must never lose sight of the fact that, while the notional system has a number of advantages from the point of view of the Exchequer and of the national economy, it also has advantages from the point of view of many farmers.  This unique system&mdash;unique compared with other taxpayers, not unique in the sense of applying internationally because other countries have a somewhat similar system&mdash;is a form of concession.  If they find that the terms on which the concession is available are unattractive I am afraid that the alternative for them is to go on the accounts system rather than be trying to change the terms on which the concessional system is available. There obviously is a limit for any Minister for Finance in what he can agree to allow as part of the notional system.  The closer it equates to the accounts system the less reason there is for having a notional system at all. There must be a practical limit to the kind of concessions that can be given in relation to the notional system and I am afraid we have reached one of them in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Could the Minister give us the benefit of his opinion about the notional system?  He keeps referring to it as a concession rather than as a form of taxation.  I do not regard it as a concession; I regard it as a form of taxation devised to meet the needs of agriculture.  The Minister himself suggested that there were benefits to the national economy and the Exchequer in the notional system that took account of the needs and character of agriculture.  In an earlier amendment we dwelt on the fact that the notional system encourages farmers who achieve a large output per acre to achieve more, and it encourages farmers, who for one reason or another do not achieve the output target, to <Col N="1003" /> increase their efforts to do so.  Those characteristics of the notional system are good.  I am disturbed by the Minister describing a form of taxation, namely the notional system, as a concession. Last year in the general election campaign the party of which the Minister is a member made a great show of their belief in the notional system and their commitment to its continuance.  The Minister is now talking about it as a concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have always talked about it as a concession because it is, and Deputy Bruton knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to know what the Minister means by a concession. Does he mean something that he intends to withdraw in the near future?  If that is what he has in mind, he should come out and say so.  The drift of his argument seems to be &ldquo;If you do not like the notional you can get on to accounts.  I do not mind what you do.  If you are not prepared to buy this pig in a poke that I am offering, you can go on accounts&rdquo;.  It seems that the Minister does not really want people to be on the notional system at all and that he is seeking any easy way of getting rid of that system altogether. If that is what he has in mind, he should say so.  He should not try to do it by this means and we could have a clean honourable and straight debate on this issue.  He should not try to do it by this backdoor method of telling farmers that he can give them no guarantee that he will not increase the multiplier by 400 per cent in the next two or three years even though agricultural incomes may rise by only 40 per cent.  All the Minister is prepared to say is that he can give them no guarantee and if they do not like it they can go on accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The talks, the parameter of which he so narrowly defined, obviously will not deal with that sort of problem at all.  They will be concerned only with individual disasters on individual farms and not with the change that might be made in the multiplier.  The Minister appears to be about the business of getting rid of the notional system of taxation.  If that is his business he <Col N="1004" /> should say so.  If the Minister believes, as he and his party evidently believe, that the notional should continue he should not make it so unattractive by virtue of susceptibility to a capricious and unjustified change in the multiplier in subsequent years while farmers are tied to remaining within it.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if he would give an assurance that the changes he might make in the future in relation to the notional system would be related to some objective data dealing with agricultural incomes but he did not give any indication that he would be prepared to do that.  In fact, he tried to suggest that this would be a bad thing from the farmers' point of view. At least it would be a lot better than the present situation because at present farmers do not know where they stand if they opt for the notional system.  The Minister's failure to give an assurance in relation to this matter does not arise from the reason he gave, that it was not good for the farmer to give an indication as to what the multiplier might be in advance.  It was not that he was afraid that the agricultural income statistics might justify a slightly larger increase in the notional next year than this year.  That was not his reason for his lack of anxiety to give an assurance as to what the multiplier might be next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reasons may be otherwise.  They may derive from the fact that he gave certain specific promises. There is no guarantee that he will go one step further than those promises.  If something was not in the manifesto there is no need for us to make a case for a change, no matter how good a case is.  Given that there was no commitment in the manifesto and that the Minister is not anxious to give a commitment as to what the multiplier may be in the future or whether it may be related in any way to what happens to agricultural incomes in the future I wonder what he has in mind.  He is concerned only to stick to the exact words of the commitment he has given and if there is any contingency that is not provided for in the precise commitment given he feels he is at liberty to proceed in any way he wishes.  In a sense he is <Col N="1005" /> entitled to do that but that does not give the farmers any assurance as to the way they will be treated in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to make a commitment. He should say in advance what the multiplier is going to be or, if he finds that too difficult, define a relationship with or without a tolerance between what the multiplier will be in the next three years and the figures as shown by the CSO or the Agricultural Institute&mdash;the Minister can have his pick&mdash;as to agricultural incomes.  If the Minister gives that assurance he will satisfy a lot of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister said earlier that when an assessment is sent out within 30 days the person who opts for the notional system will be treated as appealing against the assessment of the inspector under section 416 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That section allows a person to go to the special commissioners to have his income assessed.  At that stage that person is included in the notional system for three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can that farmer who for reasons of ill health or otherwise which will not be taken into account in the discussions between the Revenue Commissioners and farming organisations, in the third year appeal under section 416 of the 1967 Act or will this only apply in his initial entry into the notional system?  Can he appeal if his circumstances change and if those circumstances were not taken into account in the talks to be held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I may have confused the issue a little when I said that the election was treated as an appeal.  That is true but on the other hand it does not mean that when one comes to the third year there is a question of electing again backwards.  It could mean an appeal.  A farmer always has the right of appeal even under the notional system.  He could appeal on <Col N="1006" /> the basis that they were working on the wrong rateable valuation or not allowing him the correct deductions. He cannot appeal in the sense of the election for one system or the other. In other words, he cannot elect again except on the basis of the discussions I mentioned.  In that regard I should like to state that while I spoke about disease it could be a bit wider than that but it is related to the farmer's income and not to the multiplier.  If there was a substantial drop in the farmer's income or some other reason it is possible to provide machinery whereby he could then opt out of the notional system and on to the accounts system but it would be related to the farmer's income and not to the multiplier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister for Fisheries stated recently that it is his intention to introduce a comprehensive Bill to block a loophole that exists in the legislation with regard to fines on foreign fishing vessels found poaching within our territorial waters.  I understand that the Taoiseach today, during the debate on the Order of Business, stated that such a Bill might have to be introduced today or tomorrow.  Nevertheless, we gave plenty of notice that we were not satisfied with the existing situation and we have decided to proceed with the moving of the Bill in the hope that the Government will allow it to pass and if not that they will agree to amendments to keep it in line with their proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a glaring need for amending legislation.  All the available evidence points to a big increase in poaching by foreign vessels since the legality of the existing legislation was questioned, particularly since the High Court decision in February last that the District Court did not have the right to fine foreign vessels more than £100, <Col N="1007" /> which is the maximum fine, and that the District Court did not have the right to order the confiscation of catch and gear.  This is the kernel of the matter.  In some cases the cost of the catch and gear amounts to thousands of pounds.  The District Court in Cork was found to be wrong when it ordered confiscation of gear worth £102,000 belonging to a Bulgarian trawler named <i>Aurelia</i> on 22 September 1976.  We hope that this legislation will raise fines and penalties to a realistic level.</P>
    <P>There has been a big increase in the scale of poaching by foreign vessels.  I will endeavour to illustrate that point by referring to replies to recent questions in the Dáil.  In answer to a question on 1 December last, the Minister for Fisheries told us that from 1 January 1970 to 1 December 1977 19 Spanish boats had been prosecuted for illegal fishing in our territorial waters.  In eight years, 19 Spanish boats were apprehended and convicted of poaching.  In 1977, 12 boats were apprehended.  In the previous seven years a total of seven Spanish boats were apprehended and in one year, 1978, 12 boats were apprehended. Since then, 14 Spanish boats have been apprehended.  In one week in May of this year seven Spanish boats were apprehended and convicted of illegal fishing.  That was a rate of one per day whereas up to 1977 the rate was one per year.  Poaching must be stopped because our fishing grounds cannot take this type of depletion.  The Spanish, French and Dutch boats are no longer in the same category as the Irish fleet.  The Spaniards are no longer using 40 foot or 50 foot wooden boats. In the last ten years they have been using very large boats and their catching power is immense.  Not alone are they convicted of illegal poaching but they are invariably convicted of catching under-sized fish, which is a serious aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Contrary to common belief our fishing grounds are not rich in fish stocks. We are not as rich in fish stocks as Norway and Iceland.  Our fishing grounds are only average and can <Col N="1008" /> easily be ruined by the recent fishing efforts of the Spanish, the Dutch and the French.</P>
    <P>On 1 December last the Minister promised to introduce a Bill in January of this year to bring fines to a realistic level.  On that day I asked the Minister if he had any plans to increase fines to a realistic level.  The Minister said he had, that a Bill was nearly to hand and that he would introduce it in the Dáil in January.  So far we have not seen that Bill.  On 13 April 1978, Deputy Dr. Browne asked the Minister if any steps would be taken in regard to a recent High Court ruling that the valuable penalty of confiscating fishing gear of foreign trawlers was unconstitutional.  In reply, the Minister said that he proposed to introduce amending legislation urgently to increase fines substantially to provide for the forfeiture of fishing gear and to provide for trial on indictment in cases of illegal fishing.  In a reply to a supplementary question by Deputy O'Keeffe, the Minister said we could have a full and constructive discussion on the legislation which he proposed to put before the House within six weeks.  The Minister said that we would have two Fisheries Bills within six weeks.  That reply was given on 13 April.  This is 13 June and so far we have not even had one Bill.  We need two Bills in relation to fisheries urgently.</P>
    <P>We urge the Government to accept this Bill.  If they have any reasonable amendments to put forward we would be glad to accept them to allow the Bill to go through the House as quickly as possible.  During the hearing of a case in Carrigaline District Court on 12 May this year the District Justice said it was ludicrous that the maximum penalty which he could impose for poaching by foreign boats was £100.  He did fine two Spanish trawlers £100 each for fishing within our exclusive limits.  He also fined each of them £50 for having under-sized mesh in their nets.  The continentals have no qualms about the size of the fish they catch.  As this Bill does not provide for increased fines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: If the Minister is willing to put forward an amendment it will be gratefully accepted.  The continentals regard small fish as a delicacy and our view is that they should not be caught.  The catching of hake that is only a few inches long is out of order and should be severely punished.</P>
      <P>Another interesting fact came out of that court case in Carrigaline on 12 May: the State Solicitor, Mr. Dempsey, looked for costs in bringing in the Spanish boats.  He said that the cost to the Irish Navy, and hence to the Irish Government, for bringing in the Spanish boats was £780.  The figure for arresting and bringing in a Spanish boat has been quoted to me as being approximately £1,000.  Therefore it costs us money to arrest and bring in foreign boats.  There is no certainty that we will even get the £100; they may very well escape when we bring them in; that has happened on occasion too.

      <P>: Anything that will help to adjust the present unsatisfactory situation is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may draw comparisons with the penalties imposed by other countries. It is difficult to obtain exact details of the penalties other countries impose but I have a list of some.  For instance, in Canada not alone do they have a very heavy fine&mdash;the last of which we have any knowledge was one of 25,000 dollars, or two years in jail for the skipper, or both, and that is quite an old law.  In Norway they confiscate fishing gear and cargo, as they call it, as well as imposing a heavy fine.  I believe also that they have made provision for confiscation of the boat if it is apprehended for illegal fishing and also a prison term of three months for the skipper.  As one might well imagine, Iceland has a very severe penalty for illegal fishing.  The British have a maximum fine of £50,000 and <Col N="1010" /> we understand they will increase that quite substantially in the near future. It has been reported in various sources that a lot of countries are waiting to see what the British do and then copy their legislation.  I hope we do not have to await their legislation because that may take another year or two.</P>
    <P>According to a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, 3 June 1978 a Japanese fishing boat which was caught with more fish on board than that to which it was entitled in Russian waters was fined in excess of £1 million. That is quite an extraordinary figure, 1.45 million roubles for having more edible shellfish on board than was recorded in its log book.</P>
    <P>Therefore the proposals in our Bill are not very drastic.  The fines are quite large but are not out of hand; they are very mild in comparison with the Russian-type penalty.  Our Bill provides for a fine of £100,000, for confiscation not alone of the gear and catch but also of the boat and, if necessary, a prison term of three months for the skipper.  People may question some of these penalties and say they are rather severe.  Let us look at the present make-up of the continental fleets&mdash;and remember we are really worried about continental fleets only at this stage because the Russians and East Europeans who fished rather heavily off our coast in recent years are not noted for illegal fishing; by and large they adhere to limits and are fairly good at doing that.  The people we have to watch are the Spanish, Dutch and French, two of whom are partners of ours in the EEC and the third, the Spanish, have applied for membership.  The boats from these countries that fish off our coasts are huge by any standard.  By and large they are not privately-owned; the vast majority of them belong to huge conglomerates. We will get a few French boats over here during the summer months when the weather is good, small French boats, fishing for lobster, mackerel, prawns and so on, which are privately-owned.  But my information is virtually that all of the Spanish, French and Dutch fleets are owned by large companies which can <Col N="1011" /> very well pay fines of the order of £100,000.  Their catching power on one trip alone is greatly in excess of £100,000 worth of fish.  We are told that the modern Spanish trawler costs something in the region of £2 million to £3 million to build and that on one fishing trip alone they can catch many hundreds of tons of fish.  When one remembers that fish on the continent is fetching over £1 a lb. one can see that their catching power and its value are quite immense.  Therefore we must make them pay dearly if they are caught inside our territorial waters, and they must get the message fairly soon.  The whole point of this legislation is to keep them out.  They&mdash; especially the Spaniards&mdash;have been thumbing their noses at the Irish authorities, be they the naval protection service or the district justices around the country.  I am sure they come out of our courts smiling having been fined £100 when they have illegally caught fish, the value of which amounts to many thousands of pounds. Therefore we need not think that our fine of £100,000 is extremely severe; certainly it is not.</P>
    <P>The confiscation of the boat is a penalty that will really sting.  As I have said, most of these boats are owned by companies and no company would like to lose a boat valued in that region.  Other countries have legislation which caters for confiscation of the boat.  The third penalty is one of a prison term for the skipper. If the skipper is merely working for a company it is not going to be much of a penalty to him if he is caught poaching inside our territorial waters. While he probably would get off scotfree the company would have to bear the cost of the fine.  But making him liable to three months' imprisonment is an appropriate penalty, given that there is no other weight on his shoulders.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he will bring in a comprehensive Bill to make up for all of the deficiencies obtaining at present.</P>

      <P>: One aspect I should like to see covered by any Bill is that aerial evidence be accepted in the courts.  The present system under which a trawler has got to be caught with its fishing gear in the water is entirely unsatisfactory, is very difficult to prove and is far too restrictive. Nowadays with modern techniques&mdash; particularly with the use of radar&mdash;a boat that is poaching can see the approach of a patrol vessel many miles away.  By the time that patrol vessel comes on the trawler it is more than likely the gear will have been hauled aboard.  Therefore it makes it extremely difficult for the navy to catch one of these boats actually fishing and, hence, a conviction is exceedingly difficult to obtain.  For the life of me I cannot understand why evidence by our aircraft personnel is not accepted.  I cannot see what prevents us from including that type of evidence in any future legislation.  It has been accepted previously.  There have been cases in which the Canadians have got convictions in court for evidence taken by spotter planes.  In the past four years there have been two such convictions in Britain as a result of observation by aeroplanes, the more recent of which was reported in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of Saturday, 20 May 1978.</P>
      <P>The report is as follows:</P>
      <P>An Irish Sea chase and an unique arrest of a Spanish trawler by an RAF Nimrod patrol aircraft were described to magistrates yesterday when the Spanish skipper appeared in court for fishery offences.</P>
      <P>The vessel &ldquo;Goizalde Argia&rdquo; was arrested in Irish fishing waters after a five-hour chase across the Irish Sea after being spotted fishing illegally some 38 miles off the Pem-brokeshire coast on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The skipper, Jesus Cereza, was fined £15,000 by Milford Haven magistrates yesterday for illegal fishing in British waters.  He was fined a further £100 for refusing to comply with the RAF pilot's direction to stop, and £100 for using an illegal net.  He admitted the offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> Mr. Michael Howell, prosecuting for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, said that the Nimrod aircraft used all the recognised international signals to try to stop the vessel and direct her to Milford Haven.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>But it was not until after a five-hour chase that the vessel was stopped by the fishery protection vessel HMS Lindisfarne in the Irish sector of the fishing limits.  Mr. Howell said that the arrest was legal under old law which dated back to the days of piracy.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Minister, but it appears extraordinary if the British can get convictions against the same people who are poaching off our coast due to aerial surveillance, that we cannot legislate for the same thing.</P>
    <P>My Bill is a crude attempt to plug an existing loophole.  I am not a barrister like the Minister and I have not draftsmen at my disposal to draw up this legislation.  If the Minister wishes to amend this Bill, let him do so.  If this Bill is voted down, we would appreciate it if legislation introduced by the Minister included the acceptance by courts of aerial surveillance.  It is the obvious thing.  We are trying to patrol a 200-mile limit and it is virtually impossible with the vessels at our disposal.  I know the Minister has promised that he will get £30 million from the EEC to provide more boats, but even with five or six more boats the 200-mile limit cannot be policed effectively.  There is an outstanding case for introducing aircraft as the primary instruments of detecting poachers in our territorial waters and I should like to have the Minister's view on that point.  If the British can do it, why can we not do it?  It is a straightforward point.</P>
    <P>We have been fooled up to the whites of our eyes by foreigners who have been poaching in our waters.  The present disastrous state of fishing stocks off our coast is not due completely to the poaching in recent times by the Spanish or the French; it is mainly due to the wholesale poaching <Col N="1014" /> by the Dutch in the late sixties and early seventies.  The Dutch more than anyone else have ruined our fisheries, particularly our herring fisheries. They were unscrupulous, and if they are given the opportunity again I have no doubt that they will be likewise. They have disappeared to an extent, not completely, in recent years mainly because it was not worth their while.  They have killed almost all the herring off our coast, particularly off the south coast.  There are still fairly considerable quantities off the west and the north-west coast and some in the Irish Sea, but our main herring fishery in Dunmore East has been wiped out due to the activities of the Dutch.</P>
    <P>In the late sixties and early seventies they went as far as plotting the course of the only fishery protection vessel in the Naval Service at that time.  There was only one such vessel and they employed people onshore to plot its course, when they knew it was out of the way on the west or north-west coast or in dry dock they came in and fished right up to the shore. That is the cause of the depletion of our stocks.  Unless we tackle the problem urgently the Spanish will do the same thing, particularly with our white fish supplies.  They have been at it on an enormous scale and we must keep them out.  In a couple of years' time it may be too late.  We cannot afford to wait.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry is at a very youthful stage.  Our fishing industry is not developed at all in the context of the Continent.  We have not the large boats and the trained personnel and until such time as we have we must try to protect these fishery grounds.  We must try to improve the training facilities for our fishermen.  I appeal to the Minister to do something to rectify the extraordinary situation where facilities available are not sufficient and to hand over the responsibility for training our fishermen to some agency which can do it usefully. I mention in particular a body such as BIM.  I cannot understand why this has not been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Most of our fishermen are not properly trained and cannot use the type of gear that they are expected to use.  It is a common thing to hear people say that a lot of our fishermen are using sophisticated gear which costs a vast amount of money much of the time purely for the sake of prestige.  That is an abominable situation.  We must keep strict control on our fisheries until we are able to fish them properly.  We are not able to do that now because we have not the boats and the personnel to man them properly.</P>
      <P>Up to now we have facilitated foreign fishermen who have been apprehended within our territorial waters by allowing their cases to be heard before a special court.  We have been too nice to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: A special court is held immediately the foreign boat is brought into port.  In my opinion that boat should be kept in port until the District Court is sitting in the general area, whether that is within a week or two weeks&mdash;the longer the better from our point of view.  Nothing hurts these people more than being tied up for a week or so.  At present a special court is held within a day or two of their being brought into court and then they are off again to do more damage.  They are probably fishing again once they get outside the mouth of the harbour. The facility of a special court should be abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also abandon the necessity of having the patrol vessel which apprehends them accompany them to port and the necessity for that vessel to stay in port until the court case is over.  I cannot see why this should be necessary.  If the officer who took the reading and carried out the arrest accompanies the trawler into port, the Naval protection vessel should be allowed to return and carry on its work.  This can be a serious drawback when there are only a couple of protection vessels at sea: it prevents the apprehension of other boats which are fishing illegally.  It is obvious from the recent spate of convictions that <Col N="1016" /> they are out there in droves.  It costs the State a considerable amount to have the vessel in port doing no useful work.</P>
    <P>I do not know how soon the Minister hopes to get this money for extra patrolling.  He has stated that he hopes to get five or six extra boats and to have them built in this country.  I agree that this should be done and we welcome this measure.  It would be a major solution if our courts could accept the aerial evidence which I have mentioned.  I should like the Minister to accept this Bill and to put down amendments if he wishes.  If they are reasonable we will gladly accept them.  What we are most concerned about is that some such measure as ours should be introduced and implemented immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Obviously, having regard to the tenor of Deputy Deasy's remarks we are going to have a constructive discussion on this matter.  As far as the principle is concerned of dealing with the obviously inadequate situation in regard to penalties for sea fishing offences I, on behalf of the Government, agree with the Deputy that this matter must be tackled by legislation.  As the Government, we have had to take considerable care in preparing the legislation so as to ensure that we do not once again have legislation dealing with sea fishing offences and penalties declared unconstitutional.  While I appreciate the spirit and principle embodied in the Bill brought in by Deputy Deasy and agree with it, the Bill is not adequate to cope with the situation created by the High Court decision which found basically that a District Court was an inadequate court to deal with the serious penalty of forfeiture of gear, nets and fish which was the position heretofore.  Effectively, our legislation because of that High Court decision is completely inadequate to handle the serious problem as Deputy Deasy rightly described it and I think we all agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is such a serious problem that we want legislation that can finally fasten it down and ensure that whatever is passed through the House can stand <Col N="1017" /> up in constitutional terms in our courts and also in international law.  For that reason we have been giving very detailed consideration in my Department and in the Attorney General's Department over the past few months to a comprehensive Bill which would cope adequately with the situation in the spirit of Deputy Deasy's Bill and more important, would incorporate the legal constitutional and court mechanism that can fully stand up to any test, in an Irish court or in any European or international court of justice. What we are doing is very serious and important business&mdash;I say that advisedly.  Under the Government legislation we propose to make very substantial increases in penalties for fishery offences that will affect very seriously our Community partners, third country investment and also our own fishermen if they adopt illegal gear or nets or anything of that kind in the course of their fishing.</P>

It is now with the printer and will be in Deputies' hands at least on Thursday morning of this week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> To have a sensible parliamentary debate on the matter it is better for the Government, I think, to introduce its measure in its more comprehensive form which comprehends and includes much of what is in Deputy Deasy's Bill.  It is much better to go about it this way rather than for the Government to start amending Deputy Deasy's Bill.  This is only a procedural aspect because basically we are agreed in broad principle on what requires to be done.  On the procedural aspect, I assure the Deputy and the House that there is no ill intent in that respect. However, from now on, once the Government Bill is published, a much more effective way of dealing with it is to proceed with the debate on the Government Bill and take amendments as they occur to Deputies.  We are including and embracing the principle in Deputy Deasy's Bill but we are making the Government Bill much more comprehensive so as to cope with the legal, constitutional and international law situation in which we could be involved in the future unless we have a Bill that can stand up fully in the legal sense.</P>
    <P>I shall not deal in detail with the weaknesses of Deputy Deasy's Bill. He does not deal with the summary court aspect at all but only with the indictment aspect.  He does not deal with the consequential provisions necessary in regard to the trial of indictable offences and he does not deal fully with the consequences of some of the provisions where in some areas the Government's measure goes further than Deputy Deasy's Bill.  In order to bring a degree of realism to the debate I might as well say now in broad principle what will be in the Government measure.  It will embrace what is in Deputy Deasy's Bill and go further in certain areas.</P>
    <P>Briefly we propose to proceed on three bases.  First&mdash;and this gives alternative options to the Irish State in prosecuting for fishery offences&mdash; we should have at our disposal adequate summary jurisdiction.  At present it is inadequate at £100 and we propose that should be increased to £500.  If there is the option in the <Col N="1019" /> case of a minor offence that can be dealt with quickly, then there is a penalty of £500 which is more realistic than the present £100.  I doubt if there will be any disagreement on that.  It involves a simple amendment of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>In addition, we will write a forfeiture provision into the Bill in regard to unlawfully caught fish and unlawful fishing gear found on the boat.  That comes within the High Court decision in that that decision was related to the section in the Principal Act which declared all gear, nets and fish found on the boat to be forfeited.  We can still retain the forfeiture provisions in the District Court as long as it is proved that the fish gear and nets were unlawful as such.</P>
    <P>In relation to indictment areas we propose to go to a second tier of offence.  We intend to bring the offender to a trial by jury and to allow for absolute forfeiture, at the discretion of the court, of all fish and fishing gear found on the boat irrespective of whether it was lawful or unlawful, together with a fine of £10,000 in respect of entry alone, without proof of offence, by foreign boats.  The second tier of offence would involve foreign boats entering the exclusive fishery limits of the State.  The fact that they entered the exclusive limit would automatically make them liable to a fine on conviction of £10,000 and confiscation of the gear.  This is a new type of offence.  This second tier of offence, involving a £10,000 fine and forfeiture of gear, will apply to any form of illegal fishing which may take place within our waters or to any device used in regard to legal fishing.  The final and most serious tier of offence, on which Deputy Deasy concentrated, relates to a fishing offence by a foreign vessel.  Illegal fishing within the exclusive limits of the State by foreign vessels merits the same penalty as that in Deputy Deasy's measure, £100,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it true that the Government upped the figure when they saw the Bill we published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1020" />
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Not really.  They all follow a pattern from £500 for the minor offence to £10,000 for the middle offence and £100,000 for the most serious offence.</P>
      <P>The penalty of £100,000 on conviction and the total forfeiture of lawful or unlawful gear and fish applies to the major offence.  There are three prongs to what we propose to do and Deputies can see from the brief outline given that there are more serious penalty provisions here than those envisaged in Deputy Deasy's Bill.</P>
      <P>Because of the constitutional provisions involved the introduction of this Bill has been delayed somewhat. With all due respects.  Deputy Deasy's Bill would not stand up in a court of law if it were enacted.  Our job as a Government was to ensure not just in the Irish courts, which are difficult enough having regard to their interpretation of the Constitution, but in regard to the European Court and any other international court relating to third countries, that the measure would stand up, and that accounted for the delay.</P>
      <P>Apart from the offences and penalties mentioned there are other matters ancillary to the offences and penalties to be incorporated in the Government measure.  In other legislation we make provision for the detention of a suspect vessel in port for up to 48 hours for examination prior to the institution of legal proceedings. This requires a lot of consequential legal provisions to be incorporated in the Bill.  This provision must be watched having regard to the exigencies of European and international law apart from our Constitution.  In this Bill we issue a strong warning to illegal fishermen. This Bill indicates that we are not standing any more nonsense in this respect.  I know I am on common ground with Deputy Deasy in this aspect.  If the owner of a vessel is convicted of a second offence we propose to confiscate the vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: No, foreign fishermen. Deputy Begley will have a <Col N="1021" /> chance to see the legislation and to see that as far as Irish fishermen are concerned the Bill mainly relates to gear and fish.  I am talking about the major offence, the illegal entry and fishing by foreign fishermen within our limits.  I am talking about the £100,000 penalty category.  In addition, if there is a second conviction, we propose that the owner of the boat will be liable to have his boat confiscated.  It is important to make it quite clear that we mean business in this respect.</P>
      <P>I will take into account the point made by Deputy Deasy in regard to aerial evidence and perhaps we can have a Committee Stage discussion on that.  I will certainly take some legal advice from the Attorney General on how that can be incorporated into the Bill.  It may cause some problems in regard to the laws of evidence, but the point will be taken into account.  We have the very effective practical help of the spotter planes at present, and from the point of view of linking up with the vessels, giving the information, surveying the scene and so on they have proved invaluable in the practical sense.  Whether that can be further translated into practical help in the terms of evidence in court is something that would have to be looked at and I certainly will look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy mentioned the situation in regard to Spain.  I am well aware of the problem and last week we had discussions with Spanish officials about the situation.  We hope that, prior to Spain's entry into the EEC and in the course of her negotiations in regard to membership, to secure a final, lasting and sensible arrangement relative to the whole vexed question of Spanish boats fishing in Irish and EEC waters.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  The Spanish authorities are fully aware of this, as aware of it as we and the EEC are, and yesterday I had discussions with Commissioner Gundelach on this aspect.  What we are doing at the moment is securing a substantial reduction in the Spanish fishing fleet operating in our waters.  This is being achieved by a substantial reduction in the licences issued but a great deal more needs to be done particularly <Col N="1022" /> from the point of view of the historic rights Spain has between six and 12 miles off our coasts.  At the moment we have that area under control and we hope to work out some sort of reasonable negotiating position which will give a conclusive result and fully protect Irish fishermen from the largely haphazard operations at the moment on the part of Spanish fishermen.</P>
    <P>The question is one of control.  This is where plans come in and, at the meeting of the Council of Ministers next week.  I hope to ensure that we get the first plan with the Dutch off the ground.  We have that worked out in very great detail.  It is the herring fishing plan off the west coast running from Belmullet down to County Clare in an area approximately 20 miles from our base line where we have restricted the inner box up to that to boats of up to 84 feet registered length, which includes practically the whole Irish fleet, apart from three boats, and excludes the Dutch fleet, which the Commission will be recommending next week and under which a quota of 10,000 tons will be allocated to Irish fishermen and 4,000 to Dutch fishermen, that 4,000 tons to be caught outside the 20 miles from the base line and, in some cases, 25 miles outside that.</P>
    <P>This is a start.  I do not say it will be the answer overnight but it is the first plan adopted within the Community and Ireland is taking part in it.  It is not too difficult because there are only two countries and one species of fish involved.  It will be much more difficult to work out similar plans for a number of species and a number of countries in other areas around the coast but it is at least a start and I hope to get it through next week at the Council of Ministers and have it in operation in July.</P>

We will have the registered number, type of boat, length and engine power, the skipper will report on his entry into the box, and there will be an Irish naval vessel permanently there controlling the situation. I have decided to go along with this on an interim basis to see how it works and I am glad to say the Irish fishermen's organisation has taken a responsible attitude to it.</P>

I mention that because it is very much part of what we are at in the present discussion, the object being to ensure there is a proper system of control, proper monitoring and proper organisation of fisheries.  The days when fishing was just left on a haphazard, hit-and-miss basis are gone for ever. That is a fact of life today.  We will have to make it quite plain to people from other countries that they must observe the law and we must have the law that can deal with them.  We must also have arrangements that will ensure everyone knows the law and that the law will be properly administered.  We must have penalties.</P>
      <P>Finally, while I must oppose Deputy Deasy's Bill on the basis that it is not sufficient in scope to cope with the problems for the reasons I have mentioned, I approve the spirit generally of the Bill and the motivation behind it but, when he and his colleagues see the comprehensive Government measure on Thursday morning, he and his colleagues will appreciate that we can proceed as a matter of urgency with the business we have to do on the basis of that measure plus whatever amendments may be made in the Bill.</P>

      <P>: Nowhere has Fianna Fáil neglect been more obvious than in their handling of our fisheries.  We have before us a Bill as a stop-gap measure to deal with an urgent and critical problem.  Deputy Deasy has outlined the difficulties we have had over a long number of years with illegal fishing in our waters, difficulties accentuated by the reference of the Bulgarian case to the High Court on constitutional grounds.  That really brought the problem to a head.  Looking behind the problem, we had a situation where the fines levied for illegal fishing were of a derisory nature, £100 in the 1959 Act. That could only be regarded as nominal. The real penalty was the forfeiture clause.  The figures, however, do not support the argument that the forfeiture aspect was all that important or of tremendous consequence up to a couple of years ago because, in reply to a question by Deputy Cosgrave on 30 November last, it appeared that the total in fines ran into only £100,000 each year and the forfeiture maximum never exceeded £45,000.  As a result of the difficulty about the Circuit Court jurisdiction we came to realise that a problem of a critical nature was facing the country in that it became very clear that owners of foreign trawlers were fully aware of our ineffectiveness in dealing with illegal fishing.  This brought up the question of amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy produced a Bill which will stop this gap.  Coincidentally, the Minister has produced a measure which is on similar lines but is a more comprehensive measure.  What concerns me is that even at this stage, if the Minister's Bill is circulated on Thursday, in view of the fact that this session is due to end shortly, when will it become law?  I assume the Minister is not suggesting that his Bill can become law in the current session.  This will be put back to October or November at the earliest.  We have a situation whereby over the next six months foreign trawlers which have been ravaging our fish stocks can continue, and even increase, their efforts.  On the other hand, we have a Bill drafted, printed, circulated, now at Second <Col N="1025" /> Stage, before the House, a Bill which Deputy Deasy does not pretend is perfect and does not answer all the problems but which he has produced to meet one major critical problem.  If this Bill is allowed a Second Reading this week, put down for Committee Stage next week, I have no doubt any Committee Stage amendments will not be alone accepted but welcomed by Deputy Deasy.  With the full co-operation of the Minister and the Government this Bill could become law before the end of the month.  I cannot stress too strongly the importance of having a measure on our Statute Book to deal with this major problem of illegal fishing in our waters.  I accept that the other matters mentioned by the Minister in his comprehensive measure must be dealt with, but I do not put them on the same critical level of urgency as illegal fishing within our waters.</P>
    <P>We are faced with this choice: with the co-operation of the Minister and the Government, Deputy Deasy's Bill can be on the Statute Book by the end of the month.  If that choice is not accepted, our waters will be open to all for another six months.  The statistics in this regard quoted by Deputy Deasy are very discouraging.  It is quite clear that the graph of illegal fishing is rising very rapidly.  We had a figure of seven Spanish boats over approximately seven years&mdash;an average of one a year.  In the next 11 months we have 12 boats&mdash;the average had jumped to over one a month.  Since then we have had 14 Spanish boats which roughly would appear to double the average to two a month.  Last month, May, there were seven Spanish boats in one week. If we follow this graph what will we find next month?  The entire Spanish fleet could be using the six month <i>interregnum</i> to gather what they can, knowing there is a good measure&mdash;let us be fair about this&mdash;coming from the Government, but in six months' time.  We are giving them advance warning.  We are advertising our wares. We are telling them &ldquo;you have six months to clear out what you can&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>: &ldquo;If you fall foul of <Col N="1026" /> the fishery protection vessel, have your £100 in your back pocket.  Lob it down on the counter and off you go to your illegal fishing again.&rdquo;  It is as bad as that.  I do not want to be an alarmist about this but as somebody who comes from a coastal constituency I have no doubt that even the figures which have been put before this House do not in any way represent the extent and scope of the illegal fishing going on.  I have been given reports from people on the coastline in my constituency of enormous fleets of foreign vessels fishing almost right up to our shores.  I appreciate the difficulties of the fishery protection service and the good work they are doing, but they cannot cope with what amounts to an invasion, a new Spanish Armada, which is hitting our shores.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest about this: we are all interested in ensuring that our fishery stocks are protected from foreign invaders.  It is a question of how to do it.  I am not suggesting for a second that the Minister is not interested in having this done.  What I am suggesting is that this is a way it can be done. I am afraid I have to put it to the Minister that there has been serious neglect on the part of the Government in dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>We had a situation last December where a Bill to close this gap was to be produced within a month.  It was to be circulated in January.  In April, even worse than having promises of producing it within six weeks, under pressure from me inquiring about the delay I was informed by the Minister, and I quote from the Official Report, column 715 of 13 April 1978:</P>
      <P>The matter is only on my lap since the final court decision which was made only a month ago.</P>
      <P>I got that reply in April from a Minister who had stated in December that he would have a Bill ready in January. How these two replies can be reconciled is a puzzle.</P>

      <P>: The Minister is speaking for himself.  It is obvious that <Col N="1027" /> the two replies of December 1977 and April this year are irreconcilable.  Be that as it may, the problem has been allowed to remain.  It has not been tackled and the Government have not produced a bill to try to close the gap, to try to ensure that the foreign invasion of our fisheries will be stopped.</P>
      <P>The position is that both sides of the House are on all fours on the need for a measure to control the invasion of our fisheries.  We were similarly agreed six months ago on this need. We did not get legislation from the Government and as a result the Opposition have introduced this Bill. It attempts to cope with the problem in a simple way and it does not go beyond simple amendments of sections 221, 222 and 223 of the Principal Act.  It attempts to deal with the problem by providing that if any foreign fishing vessel enters our exclusive fishing limits the master shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or both.  More important, it provides for the forfeiture of fish, fishing gear and the boat.  We believe that will stop illegal fishing once and for all.</P>
      <P>In a relatively vague way the Minister has said that this Bill may not stand up, that it may be unconstitutional, that it may not be looked on favourable by European or other international courts.  The Minister should be frank about this.  He should have defined clearly how it would be unconstitutional&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: We approached this on the basis that we should have legislation that will stand up constitutionally at home, and internationally, and that such legislation will be put into operation as quickly as possible. We are anxious for co-operation from the Government side.  We could have amendments to it, if necessary, to ensure that it complies totally with European or other international conventions. We would accept any such amendments, but we must examine criticisms of the Bill uttered in a vague <Col N="1028" /> way, suggesting that it may not stand up to international law.</P>
      <P>I suggest that at this stage the debate should not be conducted on the legality or otherwise of words and phrases in it.  I would hope to see from the Government specific concrete suggestions as to how the Bill could be refined to ensure that it will meet international obligations.  I suppose the Minister's response has been understandable to some extent.  He has told us that he has a Bill ready, that he has a document before him ready for the printers.  However, because that Bill cannot be enacted before the end of the session I urge the Minister to put aside his pride and to co-operate in amending the Bill now before the House and have it operable immediately. In order to do this we must agree to the Second Reading of the Bill and then get down to considering necessary amendments.  There are words, phrases and sections in the Minister's Bill which could probably be added to this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the matter is tackled in this way we will be doing a service not alone to our fishermen but to all the people of the nation.  The fish stocks around our coasts are not limitless and we, the legislators of 1978, have a duty to ensure that those who come after us will have some fish left to talk about and that there will still be need for a Minister for Fisheries and for Irish fishing boats.  If we genuinely wish to tackle this problem, this is the way to do it.  I therefore appeal to the Minister and the Government to cast aside all notions of pride and to look at this problem as we have been looking at it. We regard it as urgent, as being in need of a remedy forthwith.  Therefore the Government should join with us in a mutual effort to preserve our fish stocks.  At a later stage there is no reason why the Minister should not introduce a more comprehensive measure dealing with other aspects of fishing, dealing with problems which are serious but not as urgent as those which we attempt to tackle in this Bill. Already, arising from this discussion, there have been a couple of suggestions which the Minister will undoubtedly take note of and consider in the context <Col N="1029" /> of their being incorporated in a Bill at a later stage.  In particular there is the question of the catching of undersized fish.  I understand the fine for such an offence is £50 maximum.  That is one aspect of the matter that the Minister might consider.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is in our Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: We would approve strongly of that question being tackled. There is a question, too, of evidence.  I agree that there are technical complications from the point of view of early evidence and I suppose there are technical complications also in relation to the identification of vessels but perhaps we could have a provision whereby the name and the number of a vessel would be visible not only from the sea but from the air.  There are other technical complications which deal with the law of evidence.  This is another matter that could be incorporated in our fishery law although it is not of the same urgency as the other matters.  However, it is a matter which should be looked at but looked at in a positive way and not in a manner that would permit the holding up of the major operation which is that of putting an end to illegal fishing in respect of which the evidence is now alarming.  The stage has been reached when anybody interested in the industry cannot afford to be complacent.  If the job is not tackled now we may find that irreparable damage will be done to our fish stocks in the very near future.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in the spirit of co-operation and of an anxiety to help our fishermen we urge the Minister to revise his thinking and to allow a Second Reading of this Bill so that we may proceed with it and complete it in time to have it enacted before the end of the present Dáil session.  We accept that the Minister is trying hard in the area of fisheries.  Although we do not agree with everything he is doing we accept that he has the same concern as we have for our fishermen and for the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>: Traffic congestion is a serious problem in the Dublin area generally, as it is in all major cities. It is not realistic to make comparisons between one city and another in this respect.  Responsibility for the formulation of measures to relieve traffic congestion in the Dublin area rests with the road authorities concerned, that is, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and, where statutory controls are involved, these authorities must act in consultation with the Garda authorities. Dublin Corporation have a traffic subcommittee and, under its aegis, a traffic committee, a traffic study group and a traffic technical unit.  A number of expert studies on traffic congestion in the Dublin area have already been carried out and, while I do not consider that consultation with EEC advisers would be of assistance, it is open to the corporation to seek such consultation as they may consider appropriate.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government propose to transfer the labour inspection duties relating to agricultural machinery, formerly exercised by the Royal Irish Constabulary, to the Factory Inspection Service of the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand that the inspection duties to which the Deputy's question refers arose under the Chaff-Cutting Machines (Accident) Act, 1897.  As I indicated in my replies of the 19 October 1977 and the 23 May 1978, the administration of the Act is not assigned in statute to any Department and is not now administered, as such, by any Department. However, I understand that, following the enactment of the Safety in Industry Bill, the Minister for Labour intends to set up a working party to consider and make recommendations in regard <Col N="912" /> to safety and, in this context, the position of agricultural workers will fall to be considered.</P>

      <P>: The following table shows the estimated number of permanent and temporary male employees engaged in farm work in each county in June 1976 and the number of tractors on agricultural holdings in June 1975&mdash;the latest years for which this information is available.  The 1976 figures for males engaged in farm work are based on sample returns covering approximately 50 per cent of the area of the country.

    <P>* Receipts from the Fund over the 1975-77 period were less than the amount of grants approved because there is a time lag between approval of grants and actual payments which are made <i>pari passu</i> with national expenditure on projects.</P>
    <P>** The amounts shown in each year refer to the total expenditure by public authorities over the duration of the projects approved in that year.  (In the case of industrial projects, the amounts refer to expenditure on industrial grants).</P>
    <P>In relation to the last part of the question, the Regional Fund makes only a partial contribution to the financing of projects; in the case of industrial projects, 20 per cent of the investment cost, or 50 per cent of national expenditure, whichever is the lesser, and in the case of infrastructural projects, a maximum of 30 per cent of the cost. Accordingly, as the Deputy is aware, only projects which are already being financed from within the Public Capital Programme are submitted for Fund assistance.  Receipts from the Fund which are a partial recoupment of the original national expenditure are at present used to finance increases in the Public Capital Programme.</P>

      <P>: The £51 million referred to in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 155 on 30 May 1978 is, as indicated in that reply, made up of £50.03 million in respect of levies on exports within the Community and £0.97 million in respect of levies on exports outside the Community.</P>
      <P>The amount of £50.03 million, which represents MCA charges on exports to other member states, was taken into account in arriving at the overall figure of £244.5 million shown as receipts under the FEOGA Guarantee Section in 1977 in the reply to Question No. 125 of 24 May 1978.  The gross receipts under the FEOGA Guarantee Section (£294.48 million) were reduced by the amount of £50.03 million giving the net figure of £244.5 million for receipts.</P>
      <P>The amount of £0.97 million, representing MCA charges on exports to non-member states, is part of the European Community's own resources and hence is reflected in the figure of £22.1 million shown in the reply to Question No. 125 as Ireland's contribution in 1977 to the budget of the European Communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: There were no projects, surveys and so on specific to County Donegal involved in the categories referred to during the period 1974-1977.  While some surveys (eg. carried out by the Central Statistics Office on a national basis) would have covered County Donegal, it would not in general be feasible to apportion the cost, and the EEC grant element, on a county basis. In the case of &ldquo;pilot projects and studies to combat poverty&rdquo;, while there is no project specific to County Donegal involved, it is possible to make a very tentative apportionment of expenditure in respect of the Community Action Research Project which is located in three areas, including County Donegal.  Such apportionment would indicate that EEC grants of the order of £4.700 in 1976, £10,200 in 1977 and £15,500 in 1978 were involved in Donegal.  As EEC grants generally represent 50 per cent of the project cost, national expenditure of the same order would be involved.</P>
      <P>It might be mentioned that an EEC grant for the recently completed study on cross-Border communications in the Derry-Donegal area was approved under the European Regional Development Fund rather than from the Regional Studies heading included in the categories referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>: As the Deputy is aware, the entire national territory is treated as a single qualifying region for EEC Regional Fund purposes.  Applications for fund assistance in respect of projects costing less than 10 million units of account (£4.17 million) each are, in accordance with Article 7 of the Fund Regulation, submitted on a grouped basis for the country as a unit and the Commission determines a single aggregate aid figure for the region. (All of the fund-assisted projects in Donegal fall into this category).  The moneys actually received on foot of approved projects are not used to &ldquo;top up&rdquo; the national aid already given.  Instead, they are at present applied to the financing of increases in certain services under the Public Capital Programme and are expended as an integral part of that programme. In these circumstances it is not feasible to apportion the figures for receipts from the fund and the expenditure arising from the receipts on a county basis.</P>

      <P>: The amount spent on alcoholic drink in this country was £304.5 million in 1975 and £370 million in 1976. Figures are not yet available for 1977.  It has not been possible to obtain comparable figures of spending for other EEC countries but statistics for the amount of alcohol consumed in these countries show that Ireland had the second lowest <i>per capita</i> consumption for 1976.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> All non-contributory old age pensioners are notified when their pension books are first issued to them of the obligation to notify a social welfare officer of any subsequent increases in their property or income and of the liability falling on them to repay any sums overpaid to them if they do not do so.  A reminder is also printed on the cover of every pension book.</P>
    <P>In accordance with statutory provisions the person concerned in this case was assessed under the Rule relating to income in cash with means consisting of his British pension.  A person in occupation of land would be assessed with the yearly value of the advantage accruing to him from the use or enjoyment of the property.</P>
    <P>A person who sold his land would not be assessed with the income arising from the proceeds of the sale but with the yearly value of the capital in his possession in accordance with the method of calculation prescribed in the rule relating to property not personally used or enjoyed.</P>

      <P>: I am aware from newspaper reports that it has been suggested that the size of oil tankers should be regulated.  I am not, however, aware of any formal proposal in this regard before any international forum.</P>
      <P>The question of limiting the size of oil tankers is a far-reaching one which would have to be considered in a broad context taking account of both economic and safety considerations, including the consideration advanced by some experts that a limitation in tanker size would lead to increased numbers of tankers and consequently increased congestion in certain waters.</P>
      <P>The Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, which is the specialised agency of the United Nations dealing with maritime affairs, is the appropriate international body to examine questions of a technological nature relating to shipping.  The organisation has in recent years drawn up a considerable body of rules designed to promote marine safety and eliminate oil pollution of the sea.  These include rules relating to tank arrangements and the limitation of tank sizes in tankers.</P>
      <P>The requirements and safety standards prescribed at international level are subject to a continuous process of updating to take account of technological and other developments.  Following on the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> disaster the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation has undertaken a special review of the various maritime safety and sea pollution issues arising therefrom, including research into the steering and manoeuvrability aspects of large tankers.  I am of course greatly concerned to ensure that all practicable steps are taken to reduce the risk of oil spillages.  My Department accordingly participate fully in the international deliberations on this matter and support all appropriate and practicable measures calculated to eliminate oil pollution of the sea caused by ships.</P>

      <Col N="929" /> On 22 May 1978 a vehicle, the property of Horse Ferries International (Córas Iompair Éireann in association with Lambourn Ridgway Ltd.) which was transporting eight Army horses to an international horse show at St. Gall, Switzerland, skidded and went out of control at Dole, France.

      <P>: In reply to Parliamentary Questions from Deputy N. Andrews on 13 December 1977 (Official Report volume 302, columns 1179-1182) I said that it was my belief that the problem of drinking by young persons was a social one related to the drinking habits of the community generally and that legislative changes or police action could at best have a marginal effect in dealing with the problem.  I indicated that the co-operation of the community was essential in bringing to the notice of the Garda information concerning those who might be deliberately selling intoxicating liquor to under-age persons.</P>
      <P>I do not rule out the possibility of some change in the law in regard to the sale of drink to young persons but undesirable consequences could result from any but the most minor change and it is doubtful if the benefits would be very substantial.</P>

However, recommendations, which would include common patrolling of Community waters by the fishery protection vessels of member states under a common emblem, were contained in a report drawn up on behalf of the Committee of Agriculture of the European Parliament in January 1978.  This report also recommends that the Commission examine the possibility of forming a fleet of Community-built aircraft and ships for the purpose of patrolling the fishing zones of member states.  The motion for a resolution contained in this report was adopted by the Parliament at its February session with some slight amendments.</P>
      <P>Secondly, a more recent report dealing with Community financial participation in fisheries inspection and surveillance operations has also been drawn up on behalf of the Committee of Agriculture.  This report, which is to be discussed by the Parliament later this week, recommends the establishment of a European maritime authority capable of co-ordinating the wide range of functions of a European coastguard authority including inspection and surveillance of fisheries and scientific fisheries research.</P>

I have already allocated £1,670,000 for their local authority housing construction programme in 1978, including £470,000 in respect of new work to be started before 31 July 1978.  It is a matter for <Col N="933" /> the council to decide what new work will be started within this allocation.</P>
      <P>The allocation made to date represents an increase of 9 per cent on the council's 1977 allocation.  This is in line with the increase in the allocation for the programme nationally in the Public Capital Programme for 1978.</P>
      <P>The council have been informed that a detailed review of expenditure on the local authority housing programme generally will be made later this summer.  When this review has been completed I may be in a position to make a further allocation to the council to enable them to start more work later in the year.</P>

      <P>: The figures quoted by the Deputy refer to the net outward passenger movements by sea and air recorded in the 12 month periods ended December 1976 and December 1977, respectively. During intercensal periods these returns are used as broad indicators of the trend in net emigration and they do suggest that net emigration increased in 1977 compared with 1976. As figures for net passenger movement are available only up to January 1978 is not possible to indicate the trend in 1978 to date.</P>
      <P>Changes in net emigration result from variations in inward and outward flows of migrants.  In recent years inward migration has been substantial. The apparent upward trend in net emigration could reflect changes in inward as well as outward flows.  In the absence of an up-to-date census of population it is not possible to make such an analysis of the trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The census of population scheduled to take place next year will provide data for a more satisfactory assessment of the overall emigration position and will help to identify the extent to which the increase in the net outward passenger movement represents <Col N="941" /> an actual increase in net emigration.</P>
