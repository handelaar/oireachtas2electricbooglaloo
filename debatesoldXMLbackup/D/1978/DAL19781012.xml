      <P>On the Order of Business, I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he will reconsider his decision to transfer Question No. 191 to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  The question is one which relates to an allegation made by the Chairman of the IFO on an RTE programme that members of the Government when in Opposition had offered financial and legal aid for the taking of proceedings against the previous Government.  As this is something which is not the responsibility of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry as he was not involved in that allegation, as he had no responsibility for what his colleagues did in opposition, and as it relates to an allegation against a member of the Government when in opposition, does the Taoiseach not accept that this is something he should handle himself? Perhaps he will reconsider or reflect further on his decision to transfer the question?</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Capital Gains Tax (Amendment)" RHead="Bill, 1978: Second Stage">
    <Title>Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Bill, 1978: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> This Bill represents a further step in the Government's announced programme of reform of the capital taxation code.  The main objective of the Bill is to mould the tax on capital gains into a form which, while reinforcing the tax on speculators and &ldquo;get-rich-quick&rdquo; merchants, will, at the same time, refrain from penalising the person who has devoted much time and effort to building up a business.  Almost everyone will, of course, gain from the proposed adjustments for inflation contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my budget statement in February of this year, this government have never opposed the principle of a tax on capital gains. However, we do believe that such a tax should not have the effect of penalising hard work and inhibiting enterprise.  The Government believe in a more refined system which will not penalise genuine effort and unduly bear on gains accruing from hard work and investment.  In opposition, the present Government were highly critical of certain aspects of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.  We believed that the Act contained a number of major faults, chief of which was that it did not distinguish between gains which were the returns of investment and hard work over the years, and speculation which aimed at a quick profit with little or no economic input.  A second major fault with the 1975 Act was that it did not distinguish between real gains and paper gains resulting from the high inflation of recent years.  In such circumstances a person could be taxed on a purely nominal gain, whereas there was a loss in real terms.  The continuation of such a situation is unacceptable to this Government and amending provisions are, accordingly, provided for in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>A further unsatisfactory feature of the 1975 Act was that a person, subjected to compulsory acquisition of his property by a local authority or other body, could find himself not alone compelled to give up his property but also liable for capital gains tax on that involuntary disposal, even though payment of that tax might have been deferred under the provisions relating to roll-over relief.  We consider that in such cases the vendor should be at least entitled to acquire property, <Col N="191" /> similar to that which was compulsorily acquired, without being taxed on what was after all an involuntary disposal.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House, as well as rectifying these major flaws in the existing legislation also changes some other features of the capital gains tax code, particularly in relation to property passing on a death and to disposals within the family by persons over 55 years of age.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the individual provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is the Interpretation Section and is self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>Section 2 increases the basic rate of capital gains tax from 26 per cent to 30 per cent.  This increased rate will apply in the case of those disposals which will not be able to benefit from the special tapering relief contained in section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 3 proposes a fundamental reform in capital gains tax.  It provides that, in calculating the gain on the disposal of an asset, the allowable expenditure (such as the cost of the asset and certain enhancement expenditure) may be adjusted in line with changes in the All Items Consumer Price Index between acquisition and disposal.  When the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975 was before the House I pointed out that the lack of any such provision was a major flaw in that legislation especially in the light of the very high inflation of that time.  While this Government have taken steps which have had the effect of contributing significantly to the lessening of inflationary pressures, it is, nevertheless, desirable as a matter of principle that such provision should be made at this time.  We do not consider it satisfactory or equitable to impose capital gains tax simply on the basis of an increase in the monetary value of an asset between one given date and another.  In the circumstances of recent years one could easily be in the position of being taxed on a paper gain which was, in fact, a loss.</P>
    <P>The effect of this section is that any increase in the value of an asset due to inflation as measured by the consumer price index should be taken into account in deciding the real gains consequent on the disposal of that asset.  It is not <Col N="192" /> proposed that the new indexation arrangements will operate in such a fashion as to charge an amount in excess of the monetary gain or to transform a monetary loss into a gain.  Also, the new procedures will not operate so as to increase a monetary loss or transform a monetary gain into an allowable loss.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made for assets held on 6 April 1974, which was the commencement date for capital gains tax.  Under the 1975 Act either the market value at that date, or a time apportionment method, would have been appropriate in order to determine the gain in the case of assets held on that date which were subsequently disposed of.  Section 3 (2) provides that the market value on that date will be the determining factor in future.  Because only the gain since 6 April 1974 will be liable for taxation in the case of disposals of such assets, and since it will be necessary for indexation purposes to obtain a valuation of those assets at that date in any event, the time apportionment method is no longer appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 4 proposes a further fundamental change in the rate structure of capital gains tax.  The new structure is based on the principle that the rate of tax should be related to the length of time for which an asset is held between acquisition and disposal.</P>
    <P>A basic aim of any capital gains tax should be, I believe, to discriminate between the speculator and the genuine entrepreneur or businessman or farmer. Equity clearly demands that investment and hard work should not be penalised while economic logic demands that a capital tax should not act as a disincentive to economic activity.  A man who builds up a business over 15 or 20 years, putting time, effort and money into its improvement and expansion, should not be taxed on the same basis as somebody who simply buys and sells an asset within a short time, relying solely on market forces to increase the value of the asset in question.</P>
    <P>One way of making a distinction between the two categories in the capital gains tax system is to have the rate of tax depend on the period of ownership. The length of ownership can be regarded, in general, as an indicator as <Col N="193" /> to whether the owner acquired the asset as a genuine non-speculative investment or whether he acquired it merely in the hope of disposing of it to achieve a short-term gain as soon as market forces were favourable.  Accordingly, section 4 proposes that there will be a reduction in the rate of tax payable for every period of three years during which an asset is held before disposal, leading to total exemption after 21 years.  The period of 21 years will run from the date of acquisition of the asset, irrespective of when it was acquired.  In passing I may say that a distinction between long and shortterm gains&mdash;the latter being generally regarded as being in the nature of income&mdash;is clearly recognised in the taxation systems of more than half of those OECD countries which tax capital gains.</P>
    <P>As development land gains and gains arising out of the discovery of mineral deposits normally arise from factors other than the time and efforts of the owner of an asset, this tapering relief will not apply to such gains or, consequentially, to gains from disposals of unquoted shares deriving the greater part of their value from such land or assets. In addition, the relief will not apply in the case of disposals by companies. However, tapering relief will normally apply in relation to the sale by an individual of his shareholding in a company.</P>
    <P>Section 5 rectifies another major omission in the 1975 Bill.  It provides that, where certain assets are compulsorily acquired and the whole of the compensation received is invested in similar or comparable assets, the assets compulsorily disposed of and the replacement assets will be treated as a single asset and, for the purposes of capital gains tax, a disposal will be treated as not having taken place.</P>
    <P>In keeping with our belief that the taxation code should not act as a disincentive and should treat people fairly, it is considered that a man should not be penalised on the occasion of a compulsory disposal of an asset provided he reinvests the compensation in a similar or comparable asset.  In such a case his possession of the asset in question has <Col N="194" /> been terminated through no fault of his own and it is clearly inequitable to tax him in such circumstances as if it were a normal realisation of assets.  If, however, a man chooses not to reinvest the compensation in similar or comparable assets, then he is using the occasion of the compulsory purchase proceedings to realise his assets and so his liability must be dealt with under the normal rules.  If an amount greater than the amount of compensation received is invested in the new asset, the extra amount will be treated, for the purposes of sections 3 and 4, as having been invested in the purchase of a new asset.  Of course if a part of the compensation proceeds is not reinvested there will be a part disposal of the original assets for the purposes of the capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>These provisions should help to ensure equity in cases of compulsory disposal of assets and to encourage reinvestment of compensation moneys.</P>
    <P>Section 6 changes the law concerning the transfer of assets on death.  Under existing law, if a person inherited an asset and subsequently disposed of it, any gain on the disposal was calculated by reference to the cost of the asset to the deceased owner and not by reference to the value at the time of the deceased's death.  This valuation approach has several drawbacks.  First, it means that a beneficiary could be liable for capital gains tax on gains arising during a time when he did not own the asset.  Secondly, it encourages the retention of business or farming assets in the hands of successors who might not have the capacity to use these assets to their best economic advantage. Thirdly, where the successor or executor has to sell the inherited property in order to pay debts incurred by the deceased or for other reasons, the imposition of a charge to capital gains tax could create a financial problem in certain circumstances.  The arrangements I am introducing in section 6 avoid these drawbacks by providing that assets acquired on a death are valued by reference to the market value at the date of the death.  The transfer of assets on death continues, of course, not to be an occasion of charge to capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is concerned with the acquisition of settled property by an absolute <Col N="195" /> owner on the death of a life tenant and provides for a new valuation arrangement as at the date of death of the life tenant in line with that set out in section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 8 extends the relief provided under section 27 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975 in three important ways. Section 27 gave total relief from capital gains tax in the case of disposals of certain business assets on retirement by a parent to a child or, in certain cases, to a niece or nephew, if various conditions were fulfilled.  One of these conditions was that the value of the assets transferred did not exceed £150,000.  The existence of this qualifying limit meant that any person with a farm or business worth more than £150,000 was discouraged from transferring the property to the younger generation during his lifetime.  The removal in this Bill of the £150,000 limit will encourage the early transfer of family property into younger and more active hands, which is desirable on both economic and social grounds.</P>
    <P>The second change made in the section 27 relief under this Bill relates to the proportion of the total assets transferred. Up to now, the relief would apply only if the entire farm or business property was transferred.  No provision was made for a situation where a father wished to hold on to a small part of his farm for himself while transferring the major part to his son, or to a situation where he wished to transfer say half to his eldest son at a certain date and the remainder to a younger child at a later date.  Section 8 remedies this deficiency by enabling the section 27 relief to be given if either the whole or only part of the asset is disposed of to the child.</P>
    <P>The third change allows the parent to benefit from both the section 27 and section 26 reliefs contained in the 1975 Act. The section 26 relief relates to disposals outside the family where the consideration does not exceed £50,000.  Up to this, the two reliefs were mutually exclusive and consequently the situation, where a father wished to sell part of his business or farm for cash outside the family, say to provide for his old age, while transferring the remainder of the property to his <Col N="196" /> children, was not catered for.  Under the provisions of section 8, the two reliefs can now apply in any particular case if the other conditions governing the reliefs are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is concerned with the interaction of the new reliefs provided in sections 3 and 4, that is, indexation and tapering rates, respectively, with the operation of the roll-over relief arrangements contained in section 28 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends the anti-avoidance provisions in section 39 of the 1975 Act relating to disposals to and by charities and certain other bodies in order to adapt those provisions to the new provisions for indexation and tapering rates. It is not intended, however, to interfere with the exemption given to genuine charities under section 22 of the 1975 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 provide for amendments of a technical nature to the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 to bring the corporation tax code into line with the changes introduced by sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 15 brings the period for lodging appeals against a capital gains tax assessment into line with the period of 30 days allowed in the case of income tax assessments.</P>
    <P>Section 16 and Schedule 1 are concerned with the technical details of the operation of the indexation and tapering reliefs contained in sections 3 and 4, including, in paragraph 6 of the Schedule, a provision to counteract avoidance of tax by manipulation of the tapering relief by certain shareholders in close companies.</P>
    <P>Section 17 and Schedule 2 provide for the necessary repeals in the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, as a consequence of the measures introduced in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outside I should like to say that the Fine Gael Party are not opposed to capital profits or, indeed, to revenue profits both of which are the legitimate rewards of business initiative. That type of business initiative is essential if we are to have economic growth. However, something else is essential for economic growth and I do not think this <Col N="197" /> Bill will help to bring about this third necessary element.  We need industrial harmony.  If we are to achieve industrial harmony it must be seen that all sections of the community bear their fair share of taxation and this includes capital and revenue profits.  They should be taxed as well as income.  This Bill will virtually abolish capital taxation.  The amount that will be collected under it will not be worth collecting</P>
      <P>We should compare this with the fact that PAYE payers in the period from 1 January 1978 to 15 September 1978 contributed to the National Exchequer 20 per cent more than they did in the period 1 January 1977 to 16 September 1977.  They are the latest figures I have. The amount of their contribution has increased by £70 million.  The Minister may argue that this is accounted for by the increased employment; but the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, before the Dáil adjourned, said that the bulk of the new employment the Government intended creating would come on stream in the public sector in the months of July, August and September and those people would not yet be taxed.  That Minister also admitted the other day that the amount the private sector had contributed in increased employment had fallen short of his expectations and target.  We are talking about the existing taxpayers, 95 or 98 per cent of the people employed, and they faced an increased bill from the State of 20 per cent in 12 months.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the much-heralded budget cuts were not cuts at all because the amount has increased so much.  I blame the Government for the unhealthy state of industrial relations here.  It is not possible to have industrial harmony or good industrial relations if one section of the community feel they are being unfairly treated.  The passing of this Bill will not improve the situation, although we will attempt to amend it during the course of its passage through the House. The ordinary wage earner will see this Bill as a method of again increasing the inequity between those who have incomes and those who have capital which they can use to make fairly substantial gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> At the time the Minister introduced the budget I stated that the abolition of wealth tax and the amending of the capital gains tax was certain to affect industrial relations.  I was proved right. Within hours of that announcement by the Minister for Finance the much-heralded 5 per cent, the corner stone of the Government's economic policy, became 8 per cent and we all know what happened to it since.  I should like to quote to the House what the Minister said about this 5 per cent during the course of his budget speech and Members will see from this what a mockery has been made of this 5 per cent.  The Minister, as reported at columns 357 and 358 of the Official Report of 1 February 1978, said:</P>
    <P>I should like to clarify aspects of the pay target proposed by the Government.  The target was formulated only after careful and detailed examinations of the requirements of the economy in both the short and medium-term.  Demands for flexibility and for adjustments in line with inflation have to accommodate themselves to the need for pay moderation.  The Government's commitment is unequivocal and, if agreement to such moderation cannot be achieved, we shall have to take the necessary measures to ensure that excessive increases, if any, are recovered from those who secure them.</P>
    <P>Within three days that prop had been knocked from under the economic policy.  This Government do not seem to be able to get into their heads the fact that people must be treated fairly as regards taxation.  The wealth tax has been abolished, capital gains tax has been virtually abolished while at the same time income tax payers are being asked to pay more.  What happened to the 5 per cent that was unequivocal, according to the Minister on 1 February last, but which became 8 per cent within three days?  Last week the Minister for Economic Planning and Development admitted that many settlements in the private sector were now at 16 per cent, more than three times as much as was thought to be acceptable by the Government <Col N="199" /> and twice as much as the wage agreement.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were on this side of the House we were told often enough that wages policy was a matter for the Government.  There is a hand-washing exercise going on in this regard now.  The only people who are being kept to the 8 per cent are the public sector employees. Does the Minister seriously think he can hold that line when neither the Minister for Labour nor any other economic Minister has uttered one word or attempted to intervene in one situation where 16 per cent wage negotiations are being agreed by the unions and employers?  Does the Minister not realise what this is doing to our exports?  Does he not realise the loss in competitiveness that is bound to result from this?  Does he not realise that this is helping to increase inflation?  All this is happening because of this Government's attitude to equity in taxation: they do not believe in it.  They have announced that they would do this in the face of all advice.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I suspect that some of the trade union leaders are secretly pleased that this situation has come about.  It is like playing a match: you can get yourself into a position where you are fouled so that you can get a free.  The Government have fouled the ordinary income taxpayers by these two measures. Now the trade union leaders feel morally free to look for similar increases in pay. We cannot blame people for seeking to get the best reward possible for themselves.  The fact that many of them have the muscle to do this is regrettable. People in key positions feel they have the moral right to do this when they see the direction in which this Government are moving in regard to taxation.  The PAYE taxpayer is being continually ground down.</P>
    <P>We welcome the indexation in this Bill because it is fair.  A man should not be taxed if he has not made a real gain. There may be a paper gain but there may not be a real increase in the value of his assets; it is the devaluation in money which has brought about the increase. During the Finance Bill the Minister strenuously resisted any effort to give the same facility to ordinary wage <Col N="200" /> earners.  That is unfair.  If indexation is fair sauce for the capital gains goose it should be fair sauce for the PAYE gander.</P>
    <P>This Bill will do most damage to industrial harmony.  If the extra boon that has been created by increased wages, alleged tax cuts and massive borrowing by the Government had been used to create more jobs, one might say that it might balance out over a number of years; but it has not.  It has gone into a massive increase in imports.  This is the very sad thing about what has happened here this year.  In the first five months of 1978 imports increased by 26.7 per cent, despite the fact that a number of commodities, such as fuel, coffee and tea, came down in price, and retail sales increased by 19.7 per cent.  This means that there has probably been a much greater penetration of imports on the home market than before.</P>
    <P>When the Minister announced the credit squeeze last week he said that this was part of the tactics for our entry to the European Monetary System and would help to curb imports.  The Central Bank said the same.  On the same day the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy put an advertisement in the papers saying that the battle against imports had been won.  That is a ridiculous situation for two Government Departments to be in.</P>
    <P>I accept that section 3, which introduces indexation and permits the adjustment of allowable expenditure by reference to the CPI, taken in isolation is a good move which we welcome.  We accept that it is improper to tax the illusory paper gains that occur when prices are rising continually.  When the 1975 Capital Gains Tax Act was introduced the then Minister felt that indexation was impractical and argued that the low 26 per cent rate compensated for this.  It follows that since we are now having indexation the capital gains taxation rates should be brought into line with income tax rates.  When we study this Bill we find that this is not what the Minister proposes.  Section 4 proposes that the rate will vary from 0 to 30 per cent depending on how long the assets have been held.  It is probable that most assets are sold after a period of ownership of, <Col N="201" /> say, six years.  Under section 4 the tax, after six years ownership, will be only 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>We cannot accept that it is fair that capital gains&mdash;most of which are realised by the better-off sections of the community&mdash;should be taxed at the lower rate than applied to wages and salaries.  We argue that if indexation is introduced&mdash;and we welcome this innovation&mdash;then the real gain left, if any, should be added to the taxpayer's income for the purposes of income tax and taxed at whatever is the appropriate rate for that taxpayer.  I would concede that it might be fair to permit the taxpayer to opt to have the gain spread over four years because capital gains tend to be much more variable than other forms of income.  But in our view the ridiculously low rates provided in section 4 are quite unacceptable.  Furthermore there seems to be no logical reason for charging a rate of 7½ per cent on the sale of an asset which has been held for 15 years as against 6½ per cent for one which has been held for nine years.  Capital profits are either good or bad in themselves. Whether they are made over a short or long period of time is completely irrelevant. The <i>rationale</i> and thinking behind any Capital Gains Tax Bill should be to prevent people from changing from income to Capital Gains.  That should be the cornerstone of any Capital Gains Tax Bill.  That is not the case with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another thing I do not understand in this Bill is why the half income relief section of the 1975 Act is being repealed.  It seems to me that that was of benefit to a man on a small income who had to dispose of an asset for reasons perhaps of ill health, because he fell on hard times and had to get money quickly but whose income at the same time was very small. That man is being penalised now whereas the speculator, who will invest his money in land, will get relief.  That seems to me to be most unjust.  I want to give an example to illustrate how this is so.  Let us take a married man with an income of £1,800 per annum.  He makes a gain of, say £5,100 within the year. Under this Bill&mdash;his income is £1,800; he gets a married allowance of £1,730 <Col N="202" /> and therefore his taxable income is £70 at the 20 per cent tax rate, which is £14. That is on his income.  Then let us take the gain he has made of £5,100.  He has an exemption of £500; his liability is £4,600 at 30 per cent which is £1,380 plus the £14 payable on his income. Therefore his liability on capital gains and income in that year&mdash;and remember he is a poor man with an income of £1,800 per annum&mdash;is £1,394.  Under the existing Act, with the half income relief, he would have an income of £1,800; he would have half the capital gain which would be £2,500, plus the excess of £100 leaving him taxable on £4,400 less his married allowance of £1,730, leaving him with a taxable income of £2,670, the tax on which would be £760.  He is not a wealthy man.  He is somebody who has had to sell an asset on which he has made a gain of £5,100. Yet that man, who is comparatively poor, will be charged an extra £634 capital gains tax under this Bill as opposed to the 1975 Act.  That seems to me within the capital gains structure itself to be unjust not to mention the inequities to which I have referred already.</P>
    <P>The whole structure of this Bill will encourage speculation.  The present Minister, when replying to the debate on the 1975 Act, defined speculation and repeated that definition this morning.  I believe it will have an effect also on the already too high price of farming land. Why should anybody with, say, £100,000</P>
    <P>to invest, which he is reasonably sure he will not want for three years, five years or some such period, invest that amount in ESB stock at present available, or buy what would be only 35 acres of land now in some parts of the country if it is not development land?  I am speaking now about ordinary farming land.  Under the provisions of this Bill would it not pay that man far better&mdash;provided he is going to hold the land for three years, five years, ten years or whatever&mdash;from his individual monetary point of view to go out and compete, drive up the price of land, putting his money there rather than investing it in, say, ESB stock or any other stock, the income from which will be taxed at a rate perhaps as high as 60 per cent?  If he holds that land for even <Col N="203" /> three years he will be taxed on the gain only at 30 per cent, half the rate.  At the same time he is helping to push up the already too high price of agricultural land obtaining at present.  I can foresee that under this Bill this is what will happen. It will not be development land, because that will be taxed at the top rate, but rather farming land which will be speculated on.  It will drive money into things like antiques, diamonds, all those assets that wealthy people can play about with.  Leaving that aside, the point I want to make is that this will create further competition for agricultural land already too high in price as people see the financial advantage to themselves of investing money the tax on which, if they hold it for a period of time, will be considerably less than had they invested the same amount in stock such as the ESB or an Irish industrial company.</P>
    <P>There are other sections of the Bill which will reduce the tax yield for no good reason.  The Minister referred to one of them, section 14 of the 1975 Act. That section provided that where persons inherited assets on a death they did not pay tax but stepped into the shoes of the deceased person.  If they sold the assets they had to pay tax on the gain, not alone the gain made between the time they inherited it and sold it but the gain made during the life of the deceased.  That was a fair arrangement and I do not think it imposed any hardship.  However, section 6 of this Bill provides that where a person inherits assets, the gain which accrued during the life of the deceased person disappears from the tax net completely.  The beneficiaries of a will can now sell an asset and pay no tax whatever if it had been in the hands of the deceased for 21 years.  If we had a very severe capital acquisitions tax which ensured that tax was paid on most properties passing on death there might be something to be said for the new proposal.  But in fact our capital acquisitions tax is a very mild one with an exemption of £150,000 for a widow and each child.  In those circumstances there is no justification whatever in section 6 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>To conclude, we have no hesitation in welcoming the indexation proposals and <Col N="204" /> would only wish that they might be extended throughout the whole tax code and not just to the people who make capital gains but to people who have to pay tax on their income, to personal allowances, child allowances and to the tax bands.  The other sections of the Bill are so unfair to the rest of the tax paying public that as a party which at least attempts to concern themselves with fairness and justice we are obliged to oppose this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be well aware of the history of the legislation which the Government are now amending and I make no apology for belonging to a party who were fundamentally responsible for the introduction of the capital gains tax in the first instance in 1975.  The Minister in his introductory remarks pointed out that his Government have never opposed the principle of a tax on capital gains.  It is a fact however that during a lengthy period in office prior to 1973 they never did anything meaningful about imposing tax on capital gains.  It was left to the Government which succeeded that Government to do something about it and what they did is enshrined in the Act of 1975.  It could be argued that it was electorally dangerous to introduce a capital gains tax at a time when the country's economy generally was just about to experience the effects of the major recession which hit the world trade about that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be argued&mdash;and I believe it was argued in this House and in the other House&mdash;that the capital gains tax which was being introduced in 1975 was one of the factors which would affect that magic ingredient known as business confidence.  There is very little evidence for that.  Business confidence, such as it is, is much more directly related to marginal tax rates on income tax than to capital gains tax or indeed to wealth tax. The introduction of a capital gains tax in 1975 was long overdue.  It was comparatively mild in its extent and in its application. In so far as it did not contain any immediate indexation provisions it was only following a line of action, of conduct if one likes, which had been popularised by several previous administrators, <Col N="205" /> that of allowing fiscal drag to do the work of the Dáil in respect of increasing effective tax rates.</P>
    <P>We all know how in the sixties successive Fianna Fáil Governments used fiscal drag to bring more and more taxpayers into the PAYE system and used the result of that fiscal drag to finance a number of important economic and social expenditures.  The reluctance to incorporate indexation in this Bill was, I suspect, although I was not privy to the decisions at the time, no more than a fairly cautious device inspired by the cautious paymasters in the Department of Finance to ensure that the effective rate of tax would become a little stiffer as the years went on without the need for amending legislation every 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see that the Government are not proposing to repeal the capital gains tax as they would like to repeal the wealth tax.  No doubt they will, if they stand by their word, repeal the wealth tax once the last amount of outstanding money due under it has been collected.  But to tell the truth, they might as well have repealed the capital gains tax as introduce this amending legislation which so effectively nullifies some of the major provisions of the Act and which offers such enormous scope to the legions of accountants and tax lawyers who make a very special and lucrative practice of finding loopholes in our tax legislation.  It might as well have been repealed holus bolus.</P>
    <P>The Government, not for the first time, are trying to have it both ways. They are trying, with their radical face, to say &ldquo;We are in favour of capital gains&rdquo; and then, with their much less radical face, and in much smaller print, saying &ldquo;These are the capital gains which we are in favour of.&rdquo;  When one looks at that small print and when one looks at those capital gains provisions one will see, as Deputy Peter Barry has argued very eloquently, that the effective yield from this tax is such that it hardly merits the name capital gains tax at all.  I would like to see some calculation which will give us some idea of the relationship between the cost of collecting whatever will be collected and the amount which <Col N="206" /> will be collected because it is, of its nature, a tax which is difficult to administer and in which evaders and avoiders need to be sedulously pursued and this puts a substantial strain on the already overstressed capacity of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The obvious inference from this is that if this now negligible amount of tax is to be collected at all it will cost a huge amount to collect or the many gains which ought properly be subject to tax simply will escape the net.  One of the most fundamental changes which have been imported in the Bill before us is that of indexation in relation to time.  Here I would like to quote from the Minister's speech where he says:</P>
    <P>In passing I may say that a distinction between long and short term gains&mdash;the latter being generally regarded as being in the nature of income&mdash;is clearly recognised in the taxation systems of more than half of those OECD countries which tax capital gains.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute the accuracy of this statement but I must draw attention to the phrase which says that short term gains are generally regarded as being in the nature of income.  It seems to me inescapable that gains, whether they are capital gains or increases in income, are all gains of one kind or another, and all gains in a society which claims any degree of horizontal equity in tax, ought to be taxed.  This Bill introduces a system whereby anybody who wants to defer tax on income by converting it into capital and holding it for a number of years, is allowed to do so.  A person may not hold it for a great number of years. On the tapering basis, he will have to pay at least some tax, but if he holds it for 15 years and has to pay 7½ per cent tax on it, how much more advantageous and attractive a proposition is that to him, if his ordinary margin of tax rate is in the region of 50 or 60 per cent. Among many incentives here we are offering people the incentive to defer income arising from the sale of property as far as possible, because under this legislation the longer they defer the sale of their property the less tax they will have to pay.  In the end they will be paying <Col N="207" /> little or no tax on something which has been taxed neither as capital nor income.</P>
    <P>The raising of the threshold in relation to family dispositions is another provision to which I would draw attention. The later stages of the Minister's speech point out that the original Act,</P>
    <P>gave total relief from capital gains tax in the case of disposals of certain business assets on retirement by a parent to a child or, in certain cases, to a niece or nephew, if various conditions were fulfilled.  One of the conditions was that the value of the assets transferred did not exceed £150,000. The existence of this qualifying limit meant that any parent with a farm or business worth more than £150,000 was discouraged from transferring the property to the younger generation during his lifetime.  The removal in this Bill of the £150,000 limit will encourage the early transfer of family property into younger and more active hands, which is desirable on economic and social grounds.</P>
    <P>The huge majority of agricultural holdings simply do not come anywhere near the £150,000 limit and it is precisely in these holdings where a change of ownership should be encouraged in order to increase agricultural productivity. The argument inherent in this Bill seems fallacious on the grounds that it will not make any positive or negative difference to these critical agricultural holdings.  The removal of the limit is no doubt related to the escalating value of agricultural land.  The £150,000 limit in cases of agricultural land was reasonable in 1975 and continued so for some time despite inflation and other circumstances. Within the last few years and especially during the last 12 to 18 months there has been galloping inflation in farm prices which cannot be laid at the door of the previous Government but which can be laid at the door of this Government by virtue of their failure to ensure that any benefits in the agricultural sphere which have been arising from our EEC membership were equitably distributed between agricultural and non-agricultural communities. <Col N="208" /> We are now talking about agricultural land at £3,000 per acre.  The original £150,000 limit was then applied to a farm of roughly 50 acres.  Recently, a farm in Meath with a building was sold for an average price of £12,000 an acre. This escalation in the price of agricultural land is the result of a policy that fails to tackle the problem of redistributing the gains from the common agricultural policy.  It is a failure which this Government in its fiscal legislation to date shows every sign of repeating in the future.  The logic of this Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Bill does not tend to increase efficiency of large agricultural holdings.  All it means is that large agricultural holdings which represent a very substantial amount of wealth, will be able to escape any effective forms of capital taxation as long as the owner has children or other relatives to whom he is, in his own time, prepared to bequeath them.</P>
    <P>An anomaly in another area is that the reliefs which are being introduced in this Bill are not apparently available to companies which are resident here.  I have no special sympathy for companies within the capital gains tax bracket but I must contrast the Minister's apparent unwillingness to facilitate Irish companies who have no doubt facilitated his party substantially, by allowing them an exemption under the Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Bill, whereas part of the Government's complaint against the wealth tax was that it discriminated against people who lived here.  This is a kind of carrot and stick approach where some people are liable for capital gains tax because they live here whereas they are not liable for wealth tax because we cannot have a wealth tax which discriminates against people who live here; but we can have a capital gains tax which does not in any sense favour companies resident here.  I suspect that the answer to that may be something to do with our obligations under the EEC, but the anomaly is there.  There is also another anomaly which is perhaps more serious.  It can be pointed out by reference to the Minister's speech, page 3, where he enunciates in the manner of somebody enunciating a fundamental principle:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> We do not consider it satisfactory or equitable to impose capital gains tax simply on the basis of an increase in the monetary value of an asset between one given date and another.</P>
    <P>Take the question of a man who lodges £20,000 cash in the bank.  He pays income tax on the interest of that money but it is possible that having paid the appropriate amount of income tax, he will have made a net capital gain in a period of 12 months simply by leaving the money in the bank.  That capital gain is a short term gain and would not be subjected to any tax.  However, it could be described as speculative.  The reason for this is that there seems to be some kind of distinction between cash and other assets. The anomaly which this Bill is presenting for our admiration is that a capital gain on cash will not be taxable while capital gains on other assets will be taxed to a decreasing and eventually nugatory extent.</P>
    <P>The anomalies I have spoken of are only details.  My fundamental problem with this Bill is that it appears to give the impression of being a liberalising piece of legislation whereas in reality it neutralises effectively the basic legislation. To this extent it will contribute substantially to the psychological climate of an inflationary tendency, a situation which must already be causing the Government serious concern.  But I have little sympathy for them since they are the authors of their misfortune.</P>
    <P>It is significant that neither the wealth tax proposal nor this capital gains tax proposal featured in the famous manifesto.  The reason for this is clear.  If these two proposals had been in the manifesto in any degree of detail it would have been more clear to the Irish people what the people who were then in opposition and who are now in Government were actually about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy would suggest that our attitude either on capital gains or wealth tax was a secret from the public.  As the Deputy should remember we had been hammering this for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember that Fianna Fáil's attitude in opposition was not <Col N="210" /> secret but there was an absence of an explicit commitment in the pages of the manifesto, a document to which not only the Minister but other Members of the Government retreat willingly when pursued by people from this side of the House as to why certain things are not being done.  We are told that whatever we are pursuing is not in the manifesto. What is important now, especially as we approach a critical national wage agreement, is that the psychological climate be right.  Far from creating that sort of climate this legislation will make matters considerably more difficult.  One day recently I read in <i>The Guardian</i> an article that was written by one of that paper's political correspondents.  It was a judicious summary of the Government's economic and fiscal policies.  The correspondent assessed, and with some accuracy, the risks the Government were running.  He said also that they were pursuing reflationary policies at a speed that would turn Mrs. Thatcher's hair grey overnight.  He went to great lengths in putting forward the Government argument of what their policy involves and said it is not merely an economic or a fiscal reflation but a psychological reflation. Something which gives the Irish people hope that they have not had before, hope that they did not have during the term of the previous Administration.</P>
      <P>If we look at what is happening in our economy we do not find much evidence of hope.  Rather, in the growing balance of payments crisis, in the uncontrolled consumer boom, we find evidence of a population who are spending enormously because of a fear that they may never have as much money to spend again.  It is this climate that is dangerous for our economic growth and prosperity but this is the sort of climate that is being encouraged and underpinned by this sort of <i>carpe diem</i> legislation from the other side of the House.  It is this climate which far more than any climate of hope has been created by this Government and which will ultimately be their downfall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this innovative legislation.  So far as I can ascertain this is the first occasion in any <Col N="211" /> western European country that inflation has been recognised by tax legislators.  I was not a Member of this House when the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, was introduced but from reading the debates of that time I find that the present Minister for Finance opposed the legislation on the principle of there being different types of capital gains.  The Minister maintained all along that the quick-buck speculator should be taxed. This party have never opposed the principle of capital gains tax.  Therefore, the Minister is being logical in following through in his first budget the principles he enunciated while in opposition. Sometimes promises made by people in opposition are forgotten when those people are returned to office but there has been no question of that so far as the Minister is concerned.  He has been consistent from the outset.</P>
      <P>The idea of capital gains conjures up various pictures to people.  The ordinary working man who is within the PAYE system will not understand readily why a man who realises a substantial gain on an asset that was held for a couple of years should not pay tax on that gain.  In the interest of equity it is important that such gains be taxed.  The Bill before us distinguishes between the person who holds an asset for only a short time and the one who holds an asset for many years.  Consequently, if a person holds an asset for as long as 21 years he will not pay tax on the gain whereas if he sells at any time during the 21-year period he will be taxed on a sliding scale of between zero and 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>The other major part of the Bill is the inflationary clause.  From my reading of the Bill I understand that all assets will be deemed to have been acquired at market value at 6 April 1974 and that the inflation index as measured by the consumer price index in the mid-February preceding the year of acquisition will be used to update the cost or the valuation of that asset.  If that person realises those assets within the 21-year period then the effects of inflation will be taken into account.  I hope that this principle of inflation relief will also be in future tax legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> The old Act left quite an anomaly with regard to the disposal of family assets.  If a person was over 55 years he could dispose of his assets within his family up to £150,000.  That was not so effective in the last few years and prevented people from transferring farms to their children because the price of land is so high that it would not take a very large farm to go above the £150,000 threshold.  This Bill eliminates that completely and it means that if people over 55 years of age wish to dispose of their farms, for example, there will be no capital gains liability whatever if they dispose of them to members of their families.</P>
    <P>The 1975 Act also had a separate relief that if a person was over 55 years of age the assets could be disposed of outside the family if the consideration was less than £50,000.  This relief is being continued, and I welcome it.  There is also a provision in the new Bill that if children receiving the assets sell them within ten years they will be subject to two charges of capital gains tax.  There will, first, be the assessment made on their parents, if the relief does not apply and, secondly, an assessment on any gain accruing to the children.  It appears that inflation and tapering will also be applied to each disposal.  This Bill will increase slightly the disadvantage of putting assets into companies because they will be liable at 30 per cent.  I recognise the Minister's thinking is that the benefits of inflation and tapering are for the individual and that they should not benefit companies.  However, there are many very small family companies who own small pieces of property.  Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister might consider an amendment to take recognition of that.</P>
    <P>A slight fault I find with the Bill is that the tapering is only given if a claim is made within two years.  Capital gains tax might only affect an individual once in his lifetime and he might not be very conversant with dealing with it.  If he does not apply within two years he will not be able to get his tapering relief.  All taxpayers may not be aware of that and there may be a case for removing the time limit or having the period changed to ten years.  The tapering relief is only <Col N="213" /> available to a person.  Perhaps the ten-year restriction applying to assets passed to children on retirement might be a possible disadvantage to lifetime transfers of farms and so forth.  Those points which I have made are very insignificant in regard to the total effects of the Bill. There are a number of very important sections in it which are better left over to Committee Stage.  I would like to welcome the Bill and to congratulate the Minister on such an innovative measure.</P>

      <P>I submit it is directly relevant to the Bill.  It is very important to evolve in Ireland a just and equitable society.  I have noticed over the past few years a growing distinction between the haves and the have-nots in our country. This Bill is a continuation by Fianna Fáil of that rift in our community between the haves and the have-nots.  I do not wish to come into conflict with the Chair.  I wish to support what has <Col N="214" /> been said by the Fine Gael spokesman. The first thing to be noticed about the Bill is that it increases capital gains taxation in relation to speculation.  I welcome that and I support it.</P>
      <P>The question of indexation which has been introduced in this Bill merits comment because it will favour the very wealthy.  A total of 87 per cent of the tax revenue comes from the income taxpayers in the country.  The workers pay through the nose.  Week in, week out, they pay their income tax to the Exchequer. In the nine months from 1 January 1978 to 15 September 1978 the income tax paid was £434,589,000, a colossal sum when compared with the £6 million received in capital tax.  It is an interesting comparison because every day we read of sales of pubs and other properties but very little of the profit seems to be finding its way to the Exchequer for redistribution to those who are in need.</P>
      <P>There is no question of Fianna Fáil introducing an equitable system of taxation for PAYE payers.  Are they not as entitled to it as anybody else?  So far, no attempt has been made to treat them equitably and this Bill is a continuation of the pay-off by Fianna Fáil to the many businessmen who gave substantially to their election coffers in order to help them buy their way back into power.</P>
      <P>I submit that our society is evolving into one of haves and have-nots.  It is a wrong policy to be pursuing and it will cause serious social unrest which will manifest itself in a number of ways. There will also be serious social deprivation among certain sections of the community. The next time round the people may give Fianna Fáil their answer and throw them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the first page of the explanatory memorandum, development land is not included in the indexation system.  What is the position in regard to agricultural land which is held by the estate of a deceased person for a number of years before being disposed of for distribution to the beneficiaries?  If the land is development land at the time of distribution, will it benefit from the indexation? This is a genuine query and I <Col N="215" /> should like the Minister to comment on it.  Why is indexation relief not given to companies?  I understand and agree with the position in relation to non-residents, but why are small companies not entitled to benefit from the same indexation as people?  If a person disposes of an asset, why is the net profit realised not treated in the same manner as income?  Why should there be a distinction?  If it becomes part of his income it should be treated as such.  If he makes a capital loss why is the capital loss allowed against his liability for income tax?</P>
    <P>This Bill is a reflection of the type of society being promoted by Fianna Fáil. They are promoting a society in which the haves are gaining at the expense of the have-nots.  When I say &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;, I mean genuine cases and old age pensioners. I do not mean those who would not work in a fit, but I do have sympathy for those who are not getting a fair share of our wealth.  The number of poor is increasing because of inflation and because of Fianna Fáil's lack of social commitment as exemplified in the budget and in the Green Paper.  Their priorities in regard to the poor are in serious contrast with the love and affection which they have for the wealthy.  This Bill is another reflection of the negative attitude of Fianna Fáil towards the poor.</P>

      <P>In discussing this Bill I do so with all the limitations of not being an economist but with some of the advantages of somebody who has given a fair amount of thought to the structure of the society, the equity within that society, and an equitable system of the organisation of that society.  It is quite clear that this is a remarkable new example of the new class of leader within Fianna Fáil and their rapid departure from their earlier concern for the working class interests in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Bill, 1978, is designed to make the already wealthy very much richer.  It is a discriminatory Bill.  It is a class Bill.  It is a Bill which is going to intensify bitterness. It is going to engender envy.  It is going to justify the legitimate claims of the trade union leaders.  If their members are to live and work within a free <Col N="216" /> enterprise society in which, to use Connolly's tough phrase, &ldquo;the biggest pig gets the most swill&rdquo;, then they are not going to accept limitations on their demands for a fair share of the cake.  The Minister is legitimising whatever action they decide to take in order to get what they can because their interests are not being defended as prior interests by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The chosen people in the Fianna Fáil catalogue are the wealthy few, the already wealthy, people in land speculation, stocks and shares gamblers, the people who get our mineral rights by having enough money to buy them, take them from under the feet of ordinary people and all the other gamblers within the capitalist system who exploit the weaknesses of that system.  I cannot understand the rationale of reasonably intelligent people who come here with this kind of Bill at a time of such crisis, such growing and threatening crisis, in the whole of the western capitalist democracies and particularly in our country.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the first factor is the 30 per cent rate of taxation.  Why is this discriminatory rate fixed for the wealthy section of the community?  What justification could there be for treating these people differently from the vast majority?  The preceding speaker said 87 per cent of tax revenue was collected from the ordinary people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Deputy is repeating it, may I point out that statement is incorrect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The great bulk of tax is collected from the ordinary people and collected&mdash;and this is true&mdash;at a rate of approximately 60 per cent, twice the rate charged to people such as those who recently, in the building societies&mdash;a most important section of private capital investment&mdash;said that they were not interested in lending money for building houses, that they were interested in making profits.  They make no bones about it and the leaders of Fianna Fáil in the building societies made that clear, that they are interested in profits.  It is this kind of person in our society who is being put in a privileged position by this <Col N="217" /> privileged rate of 30 per cent tax.  This is certainly straying a long way from the early policies of the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;slum clearance housing, social benefits, schools and so on.</P>
      <P>There is no case whatever for allowing this negligible rate of taxation&mdash;negligible compared with the rate most of us pay&mdash;and then adding the escape hatches.  Without the help of even a mildly competent accountant there are many ways of evading paying taxes for the most simple and unthinking mind.  As far as I can see, the Minister does not even want them to pay, does not expect them to pay even the 30 per cent on real capital gains from acquisition due to either death or inheritance and then the sale of the asset.</P>
      <P>Under the tapering out scheme, the 20 or 21 year provision, it is quite possible that somebody by holding an asset long enough and making a capital gain on it, will pay no tax at all on the sale of the asset.  So, not only is it discriminatory in its rate but this Capital Gains Tax Bill is also discriminatory in the provision which allows the person to not even pay the 30 per cent.  Why is this bonus given?  Why handpick a tiny minority of already very wealthy people and give them first a discriminatory rate of tax and then say &ldquo;If you are clever enough you need not even pay that tax&rdquo;, because they have one particular asset, capital, while the ordinary worker whose only asset is his skill or craft trade or profession gets no such consideration from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average tax rate continues to increase and this decision by the Government to make capital gains inflation proof by indexing is an extraordinary decision to again protect the wealthy from the hardship that all the rest of us must suffer in taxation and as a result of inflation, when you think of PAYE in the sixties, the number of people in the net at that time and the number now paying various degrees of tax.  No attempt has been made beyond the fixed wage settlements of 3 per cent, 4 per cent or 5 per cent, as may be, to protect the real incomes of people from the savage imposition of taxation <Col N="218" /> which has taken place in recent years. Why should these other people be given this privilege of indexation in relation to profits made in many cases in a particularly disreputable way?  All over the city there is great need for houses, ordinary working-class houses, houses for white collar workers and all we get are large office buildings in all directions, most of them extremely ugly due to the philistine standards and values of these people because all they want is space to sell for profit, as Senator Ryan told us recently on behalf of his company.  Why should the Government treat them with this respect, care and privilege?  The legislation purports to deal with the quick profit speculator.  If it did that it would be welcome but quite obviously the Minister has taken this opportunity to protect the interests of his own class. In relation to family businesses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Marx said, &ldquo;every form of society tries every possible device before it finally destroys itself&rdquo;. That is what the Government are in the process of doing.</P>
      <P>Before I was interrupted by the Minister I was dealing with the decision to remove the limit of £150,000 with regard to family businesses.  There are difficulties in the capitalist system in trying to preserve family businesses.  The figure of £150,000 seems a quite substantial figure but now it has been decided to remove that limit.  What is the justification for that?  I presume a case might be made for saying that £150,000 is out of touch with reality and the question of doubling or quadrupling it might be considered.  At any rate there should be some limit on the kind of firm that will be exempt from taxation because of transferance, death or for some other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the extraordinary provision whereby the stock market gambler can continue accumulating larger and larger profits.  If he does so long enough he will not have to pay tax.  Presumably large family firms such as Guinness can come in under this provision when they transfer or when a death occurs.  The land speculator, mineral wealth speculator and the stocks and shares speculator have been put apart from the rest of us.  They have been made into a new elite, a new class&mdash;that is a dangerous word&mdash;who, in the opinion of the new class in Fianna Fáil, are not like the rest of men simply because they are so wealthy and powerful.  It is obvious <Col N="221" /> that the whole trend of the latter-day legislation by Fianna Fáil is exemplified in this Bill in its very powerful and very dangerous class attitudes, although not half dangerous enough for me in some ways.  If anything can help to push us on towards serious revolutionary changes in our society it is Bills of this kind and the discriminatory, unjust provisions of the Bill that will be used, as were other provisions of Fianna Fáil legislation in recent years.  It is justification of the kind of society where all feel that they have as much right as everybody else and that they will use any and every device available in order either to get what they consider are their just demands or if they do not they will pull that society down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I am sure the Minister wishes to finish before lunch-time.  The Government's capital taxation package at this stage can hardly be described as a package.  It can be described simply as a write-off.  I am wondering about the real relevance of what we are talking about here this morning.  In 1977 about 1,500 people paid £1.5 million in capital gains taxation.  I respect the figures because there is not a known number of actual payers.  We know that the number of chargeable assessments issued by the Revenue Commissioners in 1977 was 1,833.  Allowing for duplication, I estimate that there would probably be about 1,500 people who in 1977 were liable for payment of capital gains tax. We know that the estimated receipts for last year were £1.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect this Bill is emasculating any rational system of capital gains taxation beyond recognition and for this year of 1978 it is giving back about £1 million to about 1,500 people.  It is giving them that much relief.  That is the nub of what we are talking about here today.  There has been no reference to it in the Minister's speech introducing Second Stage of this Bill.  I want to draw a very interesting contrast in regard to about 1,500 of the wealthiest section of the people who are being given relief of about £1 million by the Minister in their liability for capital gains tax, and simultaneously in the first nine months <Col N="222" /> of this year alone the ordinary PAYE income tax payer has paid in an additional £74 million.  The contrast is stark and illuminating if one looks at it in that context. In the first nine months of this year income tax payments were over £460 million.  In the first nine months of last year income tax payments were £385 million.  Therefore in the first nine months of this year there is an additional payment of about £73 million paid by persons liable for income tax.  They have been paying more out of their taxable incomes while a very small, relatively better off number of people, including a number of companies and individual trusts set up by such persons, are getting back virtually £1 million relief in capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party have made great play, totally spurious play, that they really are in favour of a capital gains tax.  If I may quote the Minister, he wishes to reenforce a tax on speculators, get-rich-quick merchants and so on.  This is totally false.  The Government, by way of their wealth tax and capital acquisitions tax amendments in this year's budget, are giving away £1 million in capital acquisitions tax alone and the wealth tax gave away £8.5 million.  Now we have a capital gains tax to give away an as yet unassessed amount, because it is payable a year in arrears.  This is a very substantial amount.  The Minister might as well, therefore, write off the £1.5 million gained in 1977 in capital gains.  For practical purposes we have abolished it at the behest of no more than 400 or 500 people, who clearly said to the Minister, Deputy Colley, and his colleagues at the last general election &ldquo;Abolish it if you want our votes and our unlimited financial support for your election campaign.&rdquo; We have a unique parliamentary system here whereby there is unlimited expenditure on parliamentary elections, something which is virtually unique in the western world and therefore anybody can put a price on his support to a political party.  This is what happened and we know it did.  We know that the Fianna Fáil Party in 1976 and 1977 were flooded with money from about 400 or 500 people who said &ldquo;Well, if we are going to get back £1 million relief in <Col N="223" /> capital gains we might as well throw in £500 now to the Fianna Fáil Party; it is a damn good investment.&rdquo;  That is what happened.</P>
    <P>I have a simple suggestion to make to the Minister.  He would at this stage be as well off abolishing capital gains tax altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not continue with this masquerade of taxation.  Let us say to the Revenue Commissioners, those exalted gentlemen sitting in Dublin Castle, &ldquo;Look, dismantle the section of the Revenue Office dealing with capital gains.  Let us release those assistant secretaries, principal officers and inspectors of taxes.  Let us forget about printing all those forms.&rdquo;  In the context of general revenue the income from capital gains now is peanuts.  Peanuts are more valuable.  One has to bear in mind that the total Government income at this stage from capital taxes is something in the region of one quarter of 1 per cent of national revenue.  We might as well abolish capital taxation altogether in the context of having any meaningful system.  If we are getting, as we are, a total of £10 million out of a total national revenue this year of something in the region of £2,350 million and next year say £2,500 million, I wonder if it is worth our while having at this stage a capital taxation structure at all, certainly in terms of capital gains.  The only industry the Minister is providing at present is one for tax consultants who, by and large, would be paid for telling people what they are no longer liable for. They will get substantial fees for doing that.  The thing has gone out of all bounds and there can be no real prospect of a normal return to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we collected £1½ million in capital gains tax and I should like to know what it is estimated we will collect in 1978.  No indication was given in the Minister's speech of what that figure is likely to be and we were not given any indication at the time of the introduction of the budget.  I accept that the tax is paid in arrear but there should be some indication of what will be collected.  Will <Col N="224" /> we collect £750,000 next year?  What will be the net effect of this Bill be?  What will it cost to collect this tax?  Surely the cost of collecting it will run to between £300,000 and £400,000.  One can take a stab at what the full figure will be and reach a rational figure in that context.</P>
    <P>This is not a system aimed at catching speculators or the get-rich-quick merchants.  It has no relevance in that context.  As a member of Dublin County Council I can give the Minister many examples of speculation in land, urban building property and in house gains of a substantial nature.  The people concerned laugh all the way to the bank and dodge out of the direction of the Revenue Commissioners any time they sense they might be approaching them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I will merely refer the Minister to his long experience of consultancy between 1973 and 1977 with the firm he worked with and the inquiries he got.  I do not think it would require much imagination to elaborate on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not stir up any further problems for the Minister in that regard.  For the first nine months of 1978 we collected £6.6 million in capital taxation while in the same period in 1977 we collected £8.2 million, a decrease in that income of £1.6 million.  Income tax in the first nine months went up from £385 million the previous year to £460 million, an increase of almost £74 million. There has been a decline also in the income from corporation profits tax.  In the first nine months of 1977 it was £6.5 million while in the first nine months this year it was £3.9 million, a decline of £2.6 million.  It appears that the only people who are effectively paying any kind of taxation at this stage and are now paying 90 per cent of all taxation income are the PAYE payers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third time I have heard something like that in this debate.  Is the Deputy saying that PAYE payers are paying 90 per cent of all taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>And that it is 90 per cent of all tax revenue collected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows well that PAYE is a lesser proportion of the total figure.  It looks like we are coming to the situation where 90 per cent of general revenue of the income taxation structure is now being borne by PAYE payers.  It is rapidly reaching that stage and the Minister is aware of that.  One does not have to go chasing through the Exchequer returns for the first nine months of this year to get ample evidence of what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>In the context of running into another national pay agreement I should like to state that there is not a trade unionist&mdash;I accept that a large number of them voted for the Minister as is their democratic privilege&mdash;who will not view with some degree of jaundice and a degree of chagrin generally the fact that the capital taxation structure is being dismantled and the income taxation liability is being progressively increased on him in return.  That is a reality which does not need a great deal of stressing. The Minister should take seriously our advice.  The system has been refined out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be interesting to see what we will get from this new system next year but I have no doubt that the new industry of tax consultants will have a field day largely by writing nice letters to people to tell them that they have no liability under this new system and requesting a fee of £100 for this information.  The 1,500 people concerned will be only too happy to do so because they are laughing all the way to the bank with their £1 million.  They are not putting their money into the great productive three-stage rocket of Deputy Colley's. That rocket is faltering all the way up and the third stage has not taken off yet. Like 100,000 other Irish people in the <Col N="226" /> last six months they went off on foreign holidays with the money they should normally have paid over to Deputy Colley. They enjoyed themselves immensely and the country has lashings of new cars and expensive pubs, but such people have not created one job.  They are laughing because, like Margaret Thatcher in the run up to the British general election, Deputy Colley lost his nerve on the run up to our last general election.  He would have won that election anyway because we had made enough of mistakes to hand it over to him.  There was no need for that kind of handout, payoff and privileged give away of capital taxation.  No amount of codology by the Minister that he is after the get-rich-quick people will change my view in that regard.  They are all laughing at Deputy Colley because they know that their liability has been massively reduced and they are on the pig's back.</P>
    <P>The people, when they see how that £1 million has dropped for such people, will have a backlash on this issue.  The young people will do so because they are not hidebound to political conventions. They will be very critical of the dismantling of capital gains taxation by the Minister when they see the amount of wealth that is around them and realise that they have no prospect of benefiting from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had what I suppose was a fairly predictable line from the Fine Gael and Labour benches.  After all, this Bill is rectifying the basic mistakes in the Bill which they brought in and clearly they had to pretend in dealing with it that it was of no consequence or, alternatively, that we were simply wiping out capital gains tax, as Deputy B. Desmond tried to suggest.  This was predictable.  The Opposition addressed themselves only to a very limited extent to the major amendments in the existing law being implemented in this Bill and which I outlined in my opening speech.  They may not wish to be reminded of these matters but I am afraid it is my duty to remind them of what is involved and what was involved in the Bill they enacted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I would like to draw attention <Col N="227" /> to is that a number of Deputies, not least Deputy B. Desmond and Deputy Browne, seemed to be under the impression that capital gains tax is something for which only the rich are liable.  One of the problems about it is that quite ordinary people of modest means are becoming liable to capital gains tax, and have been in the last three years, and still do not know it.  They have not been caught up with yet because they are not aware that they are liable for it.  Let us not imagine we are dealing only with very wealthy people when we are talking about capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the major changes being made are matters of principle which should apply whether the taxpayer is very wealthy, modestly wealthy or not very well off.  Those principles are outlined in my opening speech. The two major things involved are first, the question of tapering relief and second, the question of indexation of the gain in order to assess the liability.</P>
    <P>On the question of the tapering relief, it is all very well for Deputy B. Desmond to wax eloquent about Fianna Fáil before the election indicating to people that they were going to do them a very good turn on capital gains, money flowing into the coffers and so on, but Deputy B. Desmond knows as well as I do, and as anybody who is interested in the topic knows, that what is in this Bill represents what was said by me and my colleagues, when we were on the Opposition benches, consistently in 1974 or 1975 when the existing legislation was being enacted.  This is nothing new. It is a matter of principle and the principle is that if you are going to apply capital gains tax you should not apply the same rate of tax to the speculator&mdash;and I do not use that term necessarily in a derogatory sense&mdash;to the person who makes quick profit with little or no economic input.  He is entitled to do it under our system, but if you are going to tax him you should tax him considerably more heavily than the person whose capital gain arises from a lifetime of hard work in a business or on a farm.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintained that principle when on those benches and I am maintaining it here.  I did not hear one Opposition Deputy when dealing with this Bill genuinely tackle that problem and say: &ldquo;I do not accept that.  I think it is wrong.&rdquo;  Nobody said that, and that is what is involved in this Bill as far as that principle is concerned.</P>
      <P>We had the contributions of people like Deputy Browne who likes to think of himself as one of the exploited class and I suspect that he thinks the rest of the people in this House, the Deputies on this side and the Deputies on the other side too, are the exploiting class.  Of course, he does not want to be confused with the facts.  He thinks that the workers on average pay a 60 per cent rate of tax as against the top rate of capital gains tax of 30 per cent.  I want to suggest to Deputy Browne that if he had the slightest interest in the workers he would have a more accurate idea of the rate of tax they pay.  If they were paying a 60 per cent rate of tax we might have the revolution he is looking for.  I do not take kindly to somebody posing as the friend of the workers against the alleged exploiters who does not have a clue about what the workers are living with; what kind of tax they are paying and what their concerns are.  I would suggest that their concern in relation to capital gains tax is that they want to see the guy who makes the quick buck pay tax, and that is what we are doing in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the question was asked, and this was posed by one of the Deputies in the debate: why not treat capital gains as income and tax them as income?  That is a proposition I considered but there are snags to it.  First, you have to decide if you are distinguishing between the speculator and the person who made the gain after many years of work and then draw the line somewhere as to what will be the top rate and what will be the tapering rate.  If you are going to draw the line, for the purpose of having the top rate the equivalent of income tax, you have to take one year as your period.  Once you do that and say that any gain made within a year is to be <Col N="229" /> treated as income&mdash;I think this is done in some countries&mdash;immediately you are up against this problem.  If a person has capital losses he will be able to set them off against his income tax liability.  I do not think that is a proposition that would appeal to many people.</P>
    <P>On balance, it seems that the approach we have adopted of a tapering rate in three-year intervals over 21 years from a 30 per cent rate to a nil rate may not be perfect but it is as close as we will get to implementing the principle of taxing the speculator much more heavily than the person whose capital gain arises from work over many years in building up a business or a farm.</P>
    <P>The other major item involved in this Bill is the application of indexation.  The case was made, and it was predictable that it would be made, that if you do this in the case of capital gains, why do you not do it in the case of income tax?  That is plausible, but think about it.  A capital gains tax is a tax on a gain.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out when introducing the Second Stage, under the present law, with no provision for indexation, a paper gain on which somebody may become liable to capital gains tax may in fact be a loss.  Whatever argument there is for indexation in relation to income tax nobody is charged income tax if he does not have an income.  But one can be charged capital gains tax if one does not have a gain.  There is an essential difference between the two.  For that reason I believe that in the case of capital gains tax, because of the nature of the tax as its name implies, indexation is justified. The argument that what is done in regard to capital gains tax will provide an excuse for irresponsible action in wage negotiation or will be the cause of social unrest was advanced in this debate.  It may or may not be surprising, depending on how one looks at the situation, to find that the argument was made both by Deputies Peter Barry and Browne.  It is not true because the basic thinking behind that argument is that which the Coalition Government had, the belief that the great majority of people are concerned <Col N="230" /> with the politics of envy.  They are not; they are concerned with getting a fair deal for themselves.  They are not concerned with doing down the other fellow and the fairest deal they can get in present circumstances is to see a real effort being made to create jobs.  That real effort is being made.  The taxation system has to be as far as possible geared to helping and facilitating the effort to create jobs.  The concern of the average man in the street in regard to capital gains is to ensure that the fellow who make a quick profit will pay a fair amount of tax thereon; he is not concerned with the total yield or whether it is up or down.  We all know that the total yield under existing law, or as it is expected to be under this Bill, is largely irrelevant in terms of revenue to the Exchequer and what it can do to help or hinder social progress in the sense of tranfer of money from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The argument that what is done or is not done in this Bill could in any way justify irresponsible action on the wages front is a false one and is not one which I think Deputy Barry, on reflection, will want to repeat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of detailed points raised some of which can best be dealt with on Committee Stage but there are a few to which I should like to refer now.  Deputy Barry Desmond referred to the decline in corporation profits tax yield.  I think he is being slightly misled in his reading of the situation because the corporation profits tax, as such, has been abolished and replaced by or subsumed into corporation tax. That was done in 1976.  Inevitably, in those circumstances, the yield from corporation profits tax is declining because we are dealing only with arrears <Col N="231" /> due in the past.  That is why there is a decline.  But corporation tax, including arrears of corporation profits tax, yielded £77 million in 1977 and is expected to yield £107 million this year.</P>
      <P>I do not know if there is any point in correcting a misapprehension on the part of Deputy Browne because he clearly did not want to be confronted with the facts.  But in case he might be misleading anybody else, when he talked about roll-over relief being an escape hatch for speculators&mdash;I do not purport to be quoting his exact words but that was the sense of what he was saying&mdash;I should say that roll-over relief does not apply to somebody who sells stocks and shares.  It is available only to a trader and in respect of certain types of assets, plant and machinery, land and buildings used in the trade, and goodwill.  The relief is available only in so far as the proceeds of those items is reinvested in business.  Therefore the picture being painted by Deputy Browne in that regard is totally false.</P>
      <P>In connection with some of the comments made on the yield perhaps I should point out that the yields will not be greatly reduced until 1980.  The reason for the drop in yield between 1979 and 1980, as indicated in our estimates, is that in 1979&mdash;since capital gains tax is payable a year in arrear&mdash;the yield will consist to a large extent of tax relating to disposals made before 6 April 1978, that is, before this tax Bill applies at all.  The drop relates largely to yield from transactions to which this Bill will not apply.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins raised some queries. Personal representatives will qualify for indexation in respect of the period during which they had the assets, that is, from the date of death to the date of disposal. If the land in question is development land when it is disposed of the tapering rates will not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry queried the abolition of the alternative charge provided for, I think, in section 6 of the 1975 Act.  That section provided for an alternative basis of charge to income tax.  With the introduction of indexation and tapering rates we consider that section 6 would produce an unnecessary additional complication <Col N="232" /> necessitating additional complex calculations.  That is the only reason for the change.  I understand, for what it is worth, that in Britain they have also done away with this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not closing my mind to it.  Perhaps we could pursue it a little further on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy referred to the tapering relief when he said that the time limit of two years for claiming this relief was too short.  He was particularly concerned with people who might be liable for capital gains tax once in their lives and would not be familiar with this situation. Incidentally, he showed by what he said that he is aware of the fact that capital gains tax is a tax which can and does apply to people of relatively moderate means all over the country.  It is not simply a tax applying to either very well-off people or people who are engaged in speculation only.  In any event, the point he was making was that such people, not being familiar with the law on the subject, could well find that they had not applied within the two years.  I want to reassure him that the position is that one must apply within two years or such longer time as the revenue commissioners may by notice allow.  This will cater for taxpayers who inadvertently overlook claiming and who are the people with whom the Deputy was concerned.  There are other matters of detail that we can more conveniently deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Stage is normally concerned with the principle of the Bill and in this case more so perhaps than in many other Bills.  It became quite clear that we were dealing with the principle and I want to reiterate that as far as this Government are concerned the major principles involved in the amendments which we are making to the existing law are principles which we have enunciated consistently ever since this matter first came before the House when we were in opposition and we are applying those <Col N="233" /> principles in this Bill.  We are doing so because we believe it is the right thing to do.  The approach we are taking to tapering relief, thereby distinguishing between the speculator on the one hand and the person building up his business over many years on the other, plus the approach in regard to indexation in relation to capital gains tax, are approaches which logic and reason require.</P>
    <P>We have always said so and we are doing what we said we would do.  We are practising what we preach and in doing so we may be discomfiting Members of the House on the other side who I suspect know in their bones that the criticism we made of the Bill they brought in was justified and are therefore in a somewhat difficult position in trying to criticise the Bill we have now brought in but which is implementing the changes we then advocated and to which they on their part did not listen at the time we advocated them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking last night I mentioned that the Coalition Government had accused us of making a false promise to remove rates on private dwellings.  When we returned to office and actually removed the rates from private dwellings they were outraged. <Col N="234" /> We saw some examples of the outrage expressed in some of the speeches which we heard yesterday.  All too frequently on Dublin Corporation I have heard accusations being made against the Government that they have done away with local democracy.  This is not true. What the councillors, particularly in Dublin Corporation who form a majority, are trying to say is that while there is a limit put on the amount of money that the local authorities can spend, the people are being short-changed, that the local authorities no longer have the power to spend money in the manner that they did before the abolition of rates on private dwellings.  If the question were put to the people as to whether they would prefer to go back to the former system of rates on private dwellings in exchange for councils who could spend as much as they wanted&mdash;they did not actually spend much money then because they were always aware that we had to keep rates bills down to a minimum&mdash;would they vote for the abolition of rates on private dwellings and go back to that former state?</P>
      <P>I have not heard any suggestions coming from the Opposition as to how the present scheme could be improved or altered.  Naturally if a council could spend as much money as they liked so long as the Government would pick up the tab, hostile councils, those councils that have a majority of opposition councillors, would naturally embarrass the Government as much as they could.  As I explained last night under the heading of community and environment in the Dublin Corporation this year our allocation was £290,000 for community projects. The point I would like to make and which should not escape the notice of the people is that the relief of rates on community halls and schools and so on which is contained in this Bill represents a massive injection of funding by the Government to the community at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know exactly what it will cost the Government to remove the rates on community halls.  In my constituency the rates on one community hall are in the region of £400 a year.  On that basis the removal of rates on community halls throughout the country represents a fairly <Col N="235" /> large injection by the Government into community work, and it is a recognition of the value of community work.  This money will be quantified as soon as the Minister makes an assessment available of the money lost to the Exchequer through rates relief.  Before a community hall qualifies for relief it must satisfy the local authority that it is a non-commercial enterprise.  Yesterday speakers said that they had no money to spend on various projects.  The amount of money budgeted for by the cultural committee of Dublin Corporation this year was £50,000.  The committee had virtually spent all this money, with the exception of about £3,000, by June of this year.  The figure of £50,000 was set by the committee.  If they had wanted more they could have increased this figure.  It is important to emphasise that when the Minister gives the grant to the corporation to replace the sum that would be ordinarily collected from private house dwellers, he does not stipulate how every penny of that is to be spent.  If we wish to increase the amount to be spent on the community or on the environment from £290,000 to £400,000, the figures would have to show within the increase for the coming year where this money is to come from. In other words, we are in control of our budget; we can decide how we want to spend the money.  If we want to cut back on certain services or to increase expenditure on certain services we can do so.</P>
    <P>Before the change of Government a member of the Fine Gael Party, then Deputy Belton, now Lord Mayor of Dublin, stated that he believed that only houses with up to a valuation limit of £20 should be exempted from paying rates.  This was an alternative policy being put forward by the Coalition.  It is recognised that people who live in houses with valuations of £40 or £50 can be in as much or in greater difficulty than people with up to £20 valuations when it comes to paying their rates.  The only justifiable way to abolish rates was to abolish them on all private dwellings. Other members of Fine Gael, including Councillor Peter Kelly, a brother of Deputy John Kelly, also went on the air <Col N="236" /> with an alternative system, but none of them equalled the Fianna Fáil plan to abolish rates outright.  Unfortunately, in the 1973 election campaign ACRA on hearing the announcement that we would abolish rates chose to disbelieve us and told people not to believe us.  That might have influenced a number of people in not voting for us and it resulted in the abolition of rates not taking place for another five years.  Many people feel that by next June in accordance with the old saying &ldquo;eaten bread is soon forgotten&rdquo; the people will have forgotten about the abolition of rates.  It is not true in this instance because the people are extremely grateful to Fianna Fáil for implementing this promise so soon.  People have made a great saving since the commencement of this year due to the abolition of rates and car tax.  The people will not forget this in spite of the wishes of the Opposition to denigrate what we have done by removing rates.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy J. Ryan implied that as a result of a Government direction the valuations office had sent people up and down the country revaluing small businesses.  This is completely untrue. They only act on a list presented to them by the local authorities.  Each local authority is responsible for revaluations within their area.  The Opposition are continually complaining at local level about local democracy being removed. Are they suggesting a reimposition of the rates system?  If they are not, how can they see the Government removing controls from the amount of money which the local authorities get each year?  The grant is extremely generous allowing for inflation in the current year and adding to that a percentage of the GNP for growth in local government tied to GNP.</P>
    <P>Last year, when we in the Dublin Corporation were budgeting, we allocated £20,000 to the Municipal Art Gallery. That was reduced by £5,000 on the previous year because the committee reduced their demand by £5,000.  They should have had £25,000 plus the increase which had been allocated, for an across the board increase.  The reason the allocation was reduced to £20,000 was because they did not spend the allocation of £25,000 the previous year. <Col N="237" /> The committee felt that a reduced allocation would be sufficient and that the extra money could be spent elsewhere. This year we have spent up to £25,000 and the committee looked for a further £10,000 to cover any other purchase which might arise during the year.  It is not possible to grant this further allocation. It was put to a vote and carried by the Coalition majority aided by certain community councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the interruption. It is helpful in that it allows me again to emphasise that expenditure within a local authority is a matter for that local authority.  Of course we shall be hearing from Deputy Keating about such matters as statutory payments that have to be made but if, for example, a local authority decide to transfer moneys from, say, housing to the taking over of laneways they would be entitled to do so.  However, I would not advise them to transfer moneys from projects <Col N="238" /> that keep people in employment but they have a fair deal of manoeuvrability within their budgets.  If a local authority overspends it is not fair to lay the blame at the feet of the Government or to talk about the ending of local democracy.  In Dublin Corporation only a short time ago we reached certain democratic decisions but it suited Labour and Fine Gael, through their spokesmen, to endeavour to persuade the councillors to go back on those decisions.</P>

      <P>I confess that the thought was in my mind although it had not been my intention to utter it so bluntly.  The point I am making is that local democracy is very sacrosanct to Labour and Fine Gael when it is a question of local authorities not having enough money to spend but that when other issues are at stake they are quick to attempt, through their political spokesmen, to tell their local councillors how to act.  Is that not an invasion of local democracy?  On Dublin Corporation both Deputy Keating and I arrive at decisions in a good spirit but if the Deputy can score political points and embarrass the Government, naturally he will do so.</P>

      <P>Equally I have the right to defend the Government's action and to ask those on the opposite side to tell the people what alternative there was to the abolition of rates on private dwellings. <Col N="239" /> There is no such alternative.  I am convinced that in June next the electorate will show their appreciation of what we have done in this area.  The amount of criticism we have had from the Opposition regarding the taking away of local democracy causes me some concern. One must ask whether there is implicit in this accusation the possibility that Fine Gael and Labour, should they ever be returned to power, would decide to reintroduce some form of rates on private dwellings.  We would welcome a positive statement from their spokesman on this matter.  The Fine Gael spokesman has spoken already but he should avail of another opportunity to spell out clearly what are the intentions of his party on this question.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the people are very satisfied with the moneys being given to local authorities by the Government. The people realise that the Government must operate within certain limits and that as the country continues to prosper each Minister gets an increased grant for his Department.</P>
      <P>It is important to note also that in determining grants to local authorities the Government took into consideration those areas which had low populations. When we realise, that, for example, a penny on the rates in Dublin would have raised £39,000 whereas in a county such as Leitrim the same increase in the rates would raise only about £800, we realise how fair the Government have been in giving the bigger increase to the areas of low population.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  I am very relieved that the Government introduced this Bill.  All the time that Fine Gael and Labour were saying that we had no intention of abolishing rates I had every confidence that we would keep our promise.  I said in Dublin Corporation and also in my constituency that if the Government failed to deliver on this issue I would not be seeking re-election.

      <P>Personally I am very grateful for not having to pay a large <Col N="240" /> sum by way of rates on my house this year or next year or the year after but I would welcome an assurance from the parties opposite that should they ever form another Government they would not reintroduce rates on private dwellings or on community halls, youth clubs or other such facilities.  It is regrettable that we do not get criticism from the Opposition that is a little more constructive and that they are not prepared to recognise that we have kept our promise or to admit that they should have introduced a similar measure when they had the opportunity.  That kind of approach would be a lot more honest than the line they are pursuing.</P>

      <P>The previous speaker towards the end of his remarks referred to that brave gesture of his of putting his future political career on the line and then concluded that by virtue of the introduction of this Bill he would be able to stand for re-election.  I know now that this Bill and the thinking behind it was largely motivated by the consideration of those on the opposite side of the House with their political return to high office and little else.  This matter is far deeper than that.  I will not go into the completely irrelevant details of committee meetings of a body in which 95 per cent of the people of this House have no interest and very little knowledge of.  I will leave that device to those who do not wish to confront the fundamental issues before us.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of wishing the Minister a happy return after his holidays.  I thought I would meet him over the holidays but we will communicate again about that.  I only mention that because Deputy Briscoe said that people on the opposite side of the House never break their promises.  I was rather disappointed that the Minister and I did not have the opportunity of having a discussion during the holidays, as I had hoped we would, about a matter of mutual concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal before us is a welcome one because it seeks to put an end to a system which has been universally condemned as iniquitous, that is the rating system, which as we know, imposed a penal burden in most cases on people <Col N="241" /> without any regard to their ability to pay or without any regard to the way in which they acquired a particular property.  We have a ludicrous situation of people in the same street, all in different circumstances, paying the same tax on their properties.  It was even worse in some cases where people were encouraged to tear the roofs off their houses in order not to pay rates and people who tried to maintain and extend their houses were penalised.  I am glad the Government have taken steps to end that carry-over from a previous century and one must welcome it.</P>
    <P>I regret the Government did not go further.  I believe in the discussions, before the general election and in the Fianna Fáil manifesto the people believed that the proposals put before us would inevitably lead to the benefits of the rates abolition accruing to everybody, not just those who are fortunate enough to own their own homes but also the people who are tenants in either private accommodation or local authority accommodation.</P>
    <P>In the case of people in private houses let out for accommodation there is a glaring omission from the terms of this Bill.  The Minister was frequently questioned during the past 12 months on his intent with regard to delivering on this particular pledge.  All the overtures seemed to indicate that he intended ensuring that people in private rented accommodation would benefit but they do not.  The farcical suggestion that young couples with one or two children will go to their landlords and threaten them with their little voices that if they do not allay the degree of rates in their rents that they will bring them to court is too ludicrous for words.  I do not believe that even one case will be brought before the courts because the particular clause is unworkable. That is the best advice I can get although I accept that the advice available to the Minister will be more comprehensive.  I do not believe there is a chance of this suggestion being successful.</P>
    <P>This is just a psychological device to allow the Government off the hook of delivering on this part of their promise. <Col N="242" /> Deputy Briscoe referred to the difficulties the Government experienced with regard to their 100 per cent pledge to abolish rates for all the people.  He suggested that any other course of action might lead to a return of the rates system.  He went as far as to say that it should be made clear by all parties in the House that no such thing was intended or suggested.  There will not be any suggestion from this party of a return to a rating system, such as we have had, now or in the future.  Now that the Deputy has introduced this matter into the debate it would be appropriate if the Minister denied convincingly the regular rumours which we hear about discussions which will in effect re-introduce rates on private houses not by the name of rates but by some other names.</P>
    <P>The basis for those rumours is the intense activity which is taking place in regard to the re-valuation of houses.  I would like the Minister to tell us specifically the reason for the increased activity in relation to revaluation of domestic and other dwellings at this time.  One interpretation could be that it is a forerunner to the introduction of some type of house registration fee or some other device which would allow people to pay a tax on their dwellings which would not be called domestic rates but something else.  That rumour has been denied in the House on a number of occasions but I am not very happy about the matter.  The denials were rather evasive.  I would like a categorical assurance that the Government are committed once and for all to the extinction of this penal system of tax on houses and that it will not be reintroduced under any other name.</P>
    <P>We have also been accused of being obstructive, which in my short experience in the House it appears one side perpetually condemn the other side for being.  I do not wish to be like that.  I have a couple of suggestions to offer which may help the Minister, the Government and the people about whom we are all concerned.</P>
    <P>We should try to understand the particular problems of flatdwellers.  There are between 300,000 and 400,000 flatdwellers.  The figure of 300,000 comes from the 1971 census which is <Col N="243" /> considerably out of date and is probably very conservative.  The more likely figure would be around 350,000 people who depend on private landlords for their homes.  I believe that they are entitled to the same rights as any other citizen and that they are entitled to the same protection from the Government which everybody else is entitled to enjoy.</P>
    <P>I believe in this case they are not getting it.  Those people were promised protection, not particularly by this party or the Labour Party before the general election.  It is very germane to this debate to consider the attitude of the Government in relation to that pledge which they made.  A charter for flatdwellers was drawn up and circulated in flatland areas of urban centres which said that the Fianna Fáil Party in Government would help to alleviate the economic and social stress of people in private rented accommodation.  We now know that that is a lot of nonsense.</P>
    <P>In the one opportunity which Fianna Fáil had to demonstrate concern for people in private rented accommodation they have reneged.  They have not got the right to do that because many of us have in our possession a letter sent by the Government to flatdwellers prior to the election in which one sentence says:</P>
    <P>We would be in favour of setting up tribunals to which the landlord and the tenant could have recourse for the purpose of fixing fair rents and deciding disputes between the parties.</P>
    <P>When a motion was moved in the House asking the Government to set up a fair rent tribunal it was not alone defeated unanimously by the Fianna Fáil Party, not alone did they troop in sheepishly to smash a pledge which they had given a scanty number of months previously, but there was not even a hint or suggestion from the responsible Minister that such a proposal would be considered or that he was yet ready to accept the proposal.  Are the Government going to set up a fair rents tribunal or are they not?  They voted unanimously against such a proposal and there is evidence in writing that they promised such a tribunal prior to the election.  If that is not deceit and lies, then what is?  I <Col N="244" /> should like the Minister to comment on that point.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 350,000 people in private rented accommodation who are vulnerable in the context of this Bill.  Ten per cent of those people will be protected by the Bill in a substantial way but the majority of them will still pay the old rent for their dwellings and there is no protection in the Bill for them.  It seems that the abolition of rates on flats is not justified unless some effort is made to pass on the benefit to the people in the flats.  If this is not done it is only a subsidy for landlords.  If that is what the Government wish, they should say so.  I am very unhappy at the degree to which I have witnessed this Government being exclusively concerned with one section of the community. The growing trend in the house property market means that there will be more tenants in private rented accommodation rather than fewer, assuming that such accommodation is available. There is a shortage of this type of accommodation at present.  The people who live in such accommodation do not have property or substance and they should be expected to receive support from the Government.  In Dublin alone there are 120,000 tenants in private rented accommodation.  From that figure we can see that the abolition of rates on houses let in flats in Dublin alone would be of the order of £3½ million.  That is a <Col N="245" /> substantial subsidy for a group of landlords who have not reinvested in any major way.  I believe that the private landlord has not been dealt with adequately by the State.</P>
      <P>We have not seen the private rented sector as being a legitimate part of the housing spectrum.  We have not invested any money in it.  We have never given it any recognition in any real way.  Any laws which exist in regard to it are not enforced or are irrelevant.  The by-laws which were introduced recently to encourage improved standards are ignored. The planning law in relation to private rented accommodation is a farce. One sample survey which was taken with a view to seeing even how many houses had planning permission for conversion to flats showed that the percentage was 1.55.  Private rented accommodation has never got the kind of attention which it deserves.  It is a legitimate part of housing stock.  At present there are between 300,000 and 400,000 people living in that sector and it is important to ensure that these people are living in decent conditions, are not being over-charged and exploited.  If necessary, the landlords who provide such accommodation should be helped to improve it.  This could be done by a system of grants.  I do not mean the construction and improvement grants, which are puny, and are designed to help a family to add a small bedroom.  I am talking about an extension of the concept of house finance which is implicit in both the public and private housing sectors in regard to the provision of sites, the encouragement of people to improve their dwellings and the insistence on standards.  The truth is that there will be no insistence on standards in the area of private rented accommodation in the foreseeable future, not because people on both sides of the House do not wish it to happen but because thousands of people would be on the streets if there was a crackdown on some of the places that pass as flats.  A poor situation exists in that regard and I would ask the Minister to consider the problem of flat dwellers and their accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How would the benefit of rates relief be passed to people in rented accommodation? I do not believe that the section <Col N="246" /> giving the tenant power to refer the matter to the courts is effective.  How long the matter would take to come before the courts is a matter of conjecture. I can just imagine a couple holding on for ten months to get £2 off their weekly rent.  I can imagine the kind of tension there would be in the house during this period.  There is another way in which benefit could be passed on.  The Minister should consider allowing the rent to be offset in part or in whole against income tax.  Those who are unemployed should get benefit in kind.  In other words, they should not fall through the net because they have not got jobs. The benefits accruing from the suggestion of allowing the offsetting of rent against income tax are substantial. Above all, they would ensure that every tenant got a measure of compensation which they are entitled to in the context of the Bill and in the context of the promises made by Fianna Fáil prior to the election.  It would not be an expensive way of doing it and it would ensure that everybody got benefit.  It would ensure that the benefit would be flexible and would take family circumstances into account.  I would respectfully ask the Minister to consider this suggeston.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  The mechanics of it could be worked out by the draftsman.  It should not be excessive relative to people who are getting mortgage benefit.  There is a case to be made <Col N="247" /> for it.  It warrants consideration and I know the Minister will consider it sympathetically.</P>
      <P>People who are in private rented accommodation and who are being deprived of this benefit can ill afford to go without.  A recent ESRI study of girls living in private rented accommodation showed that as much as 25 per cent to 33 per cent of their income was being paid for accommodation.  Any alleviation of that heavy burden would be welcomed by them.  For a clerk-typist it could mean anything from £10 to £13 per week.  This Bill does not meet the needs of people in this category, many of whom are not very well organised or articulate and tend not to be people of great substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other difficulty which I think underlines the need for some attention by the Minister to the suggestions we are making is that people in this category who are paying an average of 30 per cent of income for accommodation are and will be bound by national wage agreements which if the Minister and his colleagues had their way could be as low as 5 per cent or less in some cases.  It is anomalous to suggest that one should accept that kind of increase in salary while on the other hand the position obtaining at present is that a landlord can increase the rent by 100 per cent, without hindrance in many cases.  The whole area of landlord and tenant legislation with particular reference to this Bill is very complex but I understand there is a report somewhere in the labyrinthine corridors of government of an inter-departmental investigation into landlord and tenant legislation and that one of its recommendations is that its proposals should be published in a Green Paper.  Doubtless that would shed substantial light on an area which traditionally has not been given great attention. I ask the Minister to consider getting this document and to consider the suggestion contained in it to publish the Green Paper which would help all of us in our deliberations and would make for an improvement in the general position of flatdwellers and therefore of the <Col N="248" /> community in general.  If a section of the community are relatively deprived or not given relevant advantages to which they believe they are entitled, the whole community suffers.</P>
    <P>One of the tragedies in this area of private rented accommodation is that people sometimes live in dwellings not well kept and the morale of people who believe they are not being looked after by the Government and that nobody is really interested in them, suffers.  The mobility of that population, its whole psychology, is something that causes problems to a community.  I am very conscious of this in my own constituency because we have an increasing number of houses converted into flats and the problems stemming from that are very substantial.  A measure of Government support in the context of insisting on the financial advantages of this Bill accruing to people in that accommodation would undoubtedly help them and they would feel they were not being treated as outcasts but were part of the community.  It would encourage a positively civic attitude on the part of both tenants and landlords.</P>
    <P>I do not think we would be adverse to the Minister drawing up proposals for a scheme of grants to help landlords to ensure that accommodation was substantially improved.  In many cases the dwellings are pitiful and not the kind of accommodation with which the Minister or anybody in the House would wish to be associated or have any members of our families or friends in.  If it is not good enough for us we should not tolerate it for anybody else.  Only yesterday I had occasion to feel quite moved by the conditions in which some people live and who are getting very bad and shabby treatment from some landlords.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going into great detail.  All that arises in the Bill is to ensure that tenants of flats will get the benefit of the abolition of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can devise some system of passing on this benefit it would help everybody.  I ask the Minister to consider the modest suggestion I put forward and also the ideas which he and <Col N="249" /> his advisers could produce if they really tried.  There is an obligation on us to ensure that the 400,000 people in this category get the benefit which the rest of the people are getting and which we are delighted they are getting.</P>
      <P>A point about this Bill which I think nobody has mentioned but which is important is this: the abolition of rates was widely welcomed and is of advantage to almost everybody but there is one category who because of the manner in which the rates were abolished have suffered a financial burden.  These are the elderly who were on a waiver of rates scheme.  I would be glad if the Minister would consider a suggestion in that context. It is a little difficult to explain and it took me some time to understand the concept but basically the waiver of rates scheme with which we are familiar allows certain people on low incomes not to pay rates or to pay only a portion of them.  It is a substantial and comprehensive scheme.  In 1977 in Dublin city alone a sum of £1 million accrued to people on the waiver of rates basis. These are people who by definition are poor.  Under the scheme in existence at that time they had a benefit relative to their neighbours in the community of anything from £2 to £5 per week, a substantial benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill abolishes rates and clearly the money will be made up in some other way.  I am not concerned with that in the present context but I know that the public will be paying in either direct or indirect taxation, or there will be borrowing for the time being and taxation will come later.  In other words, the whole community, and that will include the people I am concerned with in these remarks will repay the money.  It will include those who had a waiver of rates.  If the £1 million in Dublin alone is now to be returned to Government coffers and if also the £3.5 million in 1978 for Dublin alone is to be found the Government will have to raise it by taxation of some kind. It means there will be no discrimination as regards who pays rates in this more subtle and indirect form.  Clearly, that is a retrograde step for the thousands of people who had waiver of rates and who are poor.  It will mean that whenever the inevitable tax burden comes along, <Col N="250" /> whether on food, clothing or other goods these people will be paying.</P>
    <P>They should not pay or be asked to pay.  Surely we are more enlightened in our approach to social problems and social welfare plans than to reimpose by a circuitous method a burden on people who two or three years ago were already classified as entitled to be exempt from that particular levy because of their financial standing.  That may be a little complex but it is a valid point.  It means that thousands of old people all over the country who have had the benefit of the waiver of rates scheme will now be paying rates via taxation.  If the previous philosophy of ensuring that such people were not penalised in this way is to be followed through the logic must be that people in the waiver of rates schemes and who can still be classified as such&mdash;the manpower for this classification is still there: apparently nobody lost jobs due to the abolition of rates&mdash;should obtain a subsidy, a cash grant to make up for what they have lost.</P>
    <P>There are other proposals to help them specifically designed to ensure that the necessities of life for people in very poor circumstances are available.  I think my point is valid and I would appreciate it if the Minister would refer to it if he has time when concluding.  Otherwise, it would not be unreasonable for me to conclude that the Government are not concerned about these thousands of people who are finding the going very tough.</P>
    <P>The heavy subject of local democracy is very often mentioned when we talk about local rates.  I shall not dwell on it but it is relevant and despite what some previous speakers said there is a major implication in this Bill for the autonomy and integrity of local government.  Local government in the context of local authorities, corporations and councils is fundamentally a misnomer.  First, it is not local in many cases and certainly it has very little to do with government.  I have no doubt that in due course the Minister will wish to introduce proposals for major local government reorganisation and reform.  If he does not and if the opportunity falls to this side of the House we will be delighted to do it.  It is a complex area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> With regard to the section in the Bill which refers to this, it is clear that for the first time there will be a limit on local authority expenditure, a limit approved by the Minister for the Environment after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I do not wish to be unpleasant about this matter but it is in contravention of what the Minister assured us time and time again and what he said at public functions when he stressed that the autonomy of local authorities would not be interfered with.  It is being interfered with.  I am not saying that this year the local authorities were particularly hard done by but, as a matter of principle, what it means is that in any year where the Minister or the Government see fit they can tell a local authority that they are getting a certain amount of money which they can take or leave.  They can tell the local authority they can have an increase of 5 per cent over the previous year, or 11 per cent as was the case this year in certain instances. Let us call a spade a spade.  If we are going to have a tight fiscal rein on the powers of local government and on their ability to raise funds, let us say so. Otherwise we enter into the area of deceit and that will not be a service to Government or Opposition.  We cannot say that a Bill which introduces a tight measure of control over future expenditure of local authorities does not fly in the face of the traditional freedom enjoyed by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I must be honest and say that I think some local authorities have been having a honeymoon.  They have been spending without due regard to the national purse. Simply because we are in Opposition we do not wish to pretend we would like to see local authorities freewheeling all the way.  There must be some kind of national pattern, some regional integration of expenditure by local authorities, but it should not be heavy-handed.  It should not be a dictatorial line fixing a figure of 11 per cent, 6 per cent, 5 per cent or 3 per cent.  That is what is happening now.  Guidelines should be set down and there should be consultations and exceptions made.  In other words, we should have a uniform evolution of local <Col N="252" /> government fiscal policy throughout the country, not an arbitrary decision to pick a figure out of the air that has no apparent relevance to economic or social indicators.  Local authorities should not be told in an arbitrary fashion that they will get a certain figure and that if they overspend on one section they must do without in another area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe a few moments ago referred to the kind of difficulties encountered by local authorities and I would not have referred to the matter if it had not been mentioned.  He said that one of the Committees of Dublin Corporation&mdash;I am only using it as an example because it is not fundamental or relevant and I am sure is of no interest to the Minister&mdash;found they had no more money to spend after six months.  This was not because they had indulged in a binge for the first six months of the year, and if there was any such implication in the remarks of the previous speaker I think it should be denied because the budget for this year was the same as that for last year.  In cash terms we are talking about a budget of £50,000.  What has happened is that for the first time on the Dublin City Council&mdash;and I am sure this is happening on other councils&mdash;we see that people who have applied for grants cannot get them even though they would have received them six months ago.  These grants are not of a luxury nature but are for important cultural, educational and recreational work in the community.  This work is fundamental to the development of a healthy environment in our cities and towns and if it is impeded or inhibited the calibre of life in the areas concerned will suffer.  As a result, we will be back in this House in a few years time talking about another string of Loughan Houses and other places in which to put people because we have not built proper cities and the proper environment for them.</P>
    <P>The situation this year is the direct result of the rein put on local authority expenditure.  In other years we could simply say that we would raise the money and it would be done.  Indeed, if that power had not been ours recently a major theatre in this city quite possibly might have been forced to close.  It was only because we were able to say on a <Col N="253" /> once-off basis that we would raise the money as elected representatives and the Government's flexible policy allowed us so to do that that the theatre is open to-day. Therefore, it is very important that we put an end to any attempt to curb the flexible powers of local authorities to raise money.  That attempt acts against the interests of local communities and the concept of democratic local government. Otherwise we are mere ciphers.  I predict that if this pattern emerges in other legislation the result will be that people will not bother with local government and we will have rubberstamping on an even more extensive scale, and it is fairly extensive at the moment having regard to the powers of the City and County Managers (Amendment) Act.</P>
    <P>As a democrat there is something at the heart of this Bill that I find obnoxious and I am sure this is shared by all thinking people who believe in a democratic system.  It is the centralisation of financial control and, unfortunately in our society, that is what power is about to a great extent.  The man with the gold makes the rules.  As councillors we are allowed to play on the wings provided that we spend within a certain budget.  A more healthy, respectful and encouraging approach that would allow for the development of local government and a more responsible approach by some councils could be brought about.  It could be done with patience, understanding, sensitivity and dedication to the ideal of genuine local government which is the devolution of real and meaningful powers to people to a degree consistent with the interests of their area.  This would give them genuine control and power, not the operation we have at the moment which will allow people to indulge themselves on the margins so long as they spend within a certain limit.</P>
    <P>There are all kinds of implications involved. I would ask the Minister to consider the prospect of a council that might find itself in contention with the Government of the day.  Could not a Minister be put in the position of being tempted to suggest to his Government, or to take the powers to himself, that because a certain council or other body has been recalcitrant, had not been toeing the line <Col N="254" /> or had been causing problems that perhaps one way of curbing their over-zealous approach might be to restrict their expenditure?  Although a corporation such as Dublin City Council might have a budget of £100 million, in practical terms the councillors' role affects only a very small percentage of that expenditure. Major statutory charges are involved and they are not a matter for debate.  They have to be paid&mdash;wages, drainage schemes, roads, the upkeep and maintenance of public buildings and so on.  In fact, in regard to 90 per cent of what local authorities rubberstamp in their estimates each year they have very little choice but so to do.  Nobody can suggest to me that we could take salaries and wages away from people and apply the money to the area of culture, recreational amenities or housing.  That is not being realistic.  We are concerned with the small area at present under the control of councillors.  This area which is already very small is being further restricted and I predict constant tension between managers and councillors throughout the country.  A manager during the year may see fit to seek money for schemes or for problems that arise suddenly and the only place he can turn to for the money will be what I call the political areas, the areas of grants, of environmental and social schemes, of encouragement of the arts, the building of play centres and community halls.</P>
    <P>Those are the areas which will suffer because there is no other area.  No-one is going to tell me that if the manager of a county council discovers a crack in a drain and it is going to cost £30,000 to remedy it he is going to say, &ldquo;Sorry lads, 15 of you are on the dole&rdquo;.  That is not real.  The only place that he can get it is in these softer areas.  Therefore I assure the Minister of our deepest sincerity about the degree to which this growing and important area of encouraging and creating an environment in urban areas for people to live and develop properly is going to be hampered and impeded.  It is a real fear, and I ask the Minister to consider it.  With goodwill all round many of these things can be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The Minister on a previous occasion denied categorically that he had any intention of curbing the powers of local <Col N="255" /> authorities.  I listened carefully to Deputy Briscoe and he admitted clearly that there were controls imposed by the Government.  He asked the question, rhetorical I presume, how can we remove these controls?  There should be no debate about whether there are controls. They exist, and no amount of pleasantries exchanged at the Association of Municipal Authorities or after-lunch speeches and so forth will take that away.  One has to put a public face on these things sometimes and say things which are gilding the lily to some extent.  In truth there is a severe, and possibly from a social point of view a harmful restriction on the financial powers of local authorities and we are extremely concerned about it.  A more moderate approach could be obtained which would allow for the Government to issue guidelines, to consult with local authorities acting in breach of these guidelines, to ensure that there is a regional pattern, and that we did not, as we do at the moment, have all kinds of financial anomalies in the context of local authorities.  In Dublin 6,000 people are waiting for houses, while some local authorities have houses and no one to put into them.  These anomalies should be ironed out, but not by a heavy-handed, dictatorial approach which is implicit in this Bill will that kind of positive social development take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government can do a lot better than taking the arbitrary decision to decide on a percentage increase, and perhaps a percentage decrease if times become tough.  Some of the Minister's colleagues assure us that times are not as rosy as it would appear. There is a problem here and I ask the Minister to take a serious look at it.  A better approach than the one suggested can be found.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the question of guest houses.  The Minister has been made aware of the concern of all parties with regard to what appears to be an anomaly whereby registered guest houses are going to be relatively disadvantaged as compared with unregistered guest houses.  This would be very serious.  What will happen first of all is <Col N="256" /> that people will disengage from the registered list.  I can visualise the irony of the situation of some of the Minister's backbenchers being confronted by a constituent who says, &ldquo;I am in trouble.  I am paying a very substantial rate.  I have a registered guest house; what will I do?&rdquo;  I can see that the answer will be, &ldquo;Just get yourself unregistered&rdquo;.  None of us wants that approach.  Not alone would it be financially inequitable but it would be a positive inducement to faulty standards, to the detriment of our tourist industry.  Therefore, the only practical approach would be that all guest houses, registered or unregistered, should be rate free.  Guest houses as opposed to hotels are areas of social intercourse.  They act as the ambassador, so to speak, of our tourist industry.  They have reasonable, tangible, social grounds for claiming rate abolition.  Certainly in any case we should never allow a situation to obtain whereby, with two guest houses alongside each other, the owner of one of them which is of questionable standard with dubious hygiene, unregistered, operating freely under whatever rules and regulations it sees fit, pays no rates, while the owner of the other, an honest entrepreneur, with a small house, keeping good standards, clean, hygienic and so on, is relatively penalised.  I do not think the Minister would want that, and I am sure that he will respond to our plea to ensure that that position does not obtain.  The sooner we get some commitment from him on that the better.</P>
    <P>Earlier on I referred to the question of valuations.  It should be mentioned again in the context that earlier this year in the Dáil the Minister was asked questions about the valuation procedure whereby officials visit houses, estates and so on, carry out inspections and decide on a revaluation.  All of this is centralised and co-ordinated.  We asked at the time why this revaluation was going on as it was. The answers given were reasonable. They were that all rates were not abolished; commercial rates were not abolished.  Therefore, in order to provide a rates basis it was necessary to try to discover what the whole revaluation picture was.  I have become aware of a new enthusiasm on behalf of the people involved in revaluation which worries me <Col N="257" /> slightly.  As one charged with ensuring that there is no sleight of hand about the matter, I would like to be assured that, for example, the procedure which is going on with unprecedented zeal at the moment&mdash;and the revaluations are of a substantial nature, jumping in some cases by as much as 60 or 70 per cent &mdash;is not the first plank of the reintroduction of some form of tax on houses or the beginning of an attempt to extract from the commercial sector who are still paying rates the sums of money or part of those sums which are no longer accruing directly from the tax-payer in the private house.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the question of revaluation with a number of people and my findings so far have been sufficient to warrant it being put on the record here as a matter of concern.  It is enough to rouse my own suspicions and I say to the Minister that he has an obligation to see that there is no substance in any attempt to embark on a campaign or crusade to up-date and revalue as a prelude to reintroducing rates under some other name perhaps at some future date, or as a means of trying to extract from the commercial sector the moneys which are no longer coming from the private sector.</P>

      <P>Yes.  On the general level of the reserves they are approximately as anticipated and they represent 3.8 months cover on imports which is high by international standards.  As to the proportion held in sterling&mdash;I do not have the exact percentage&mdash;it is by no means the major portion of the reserves. In other words, the major portion of reserves is held in currencies other than sterling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of a break in the traditional link between the Irish pound and sterling have been under constant review for some years past.  As the Deputies will be aware, successive Governments have taken the view that a decision to continue or to change the present relationship must be based on an <Col N="259" /> assessment of where the balance of economic advantage lies.  The whole question of our exchange rate arrangements is currently being considered in the context of the proposals being elaborated for a new European Monetary System.  I can assure the Deputies that all the implications, including operational aspects, will be fully examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister contingency plans for the adverse effect that could result in the export section of our income if the Irish punt is revalued upwards against sterling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware it is planned to have a debate in the House on this matter next week in the course if which I hope to outline the implications under various headings, including the one mentioned by the Deputy.  It is difficult to go into it in detail at Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the early publication of a White Paper and I should like to know if he could tell the House, in advance of our debate next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the next question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister has referred to a transfer resource of £620 million and I should like to know if he would indicate to the House the basis of calculation.  He has said that this £620 million would be sought by us over the next five years if we see our way into this new currency arrangement and I should like to know on what figures or calculations that £620 million is based.  It appears to be inadequate for the kind of difficult adjustment that would occur in the period of our currency realignment and the country is guessing on what figures the Minister has set his figure of £620 million which he apparently is seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With due deference to the Deputy I do not think that arises on these questions; it may be a matter to be covered in the course of next week's <Col N="260" /> debate.  The calculation of figures of that kind rest on quite a number of fairly complex issues.  It should be borne in mind that in so far as that figure has emerged publicly I do not think it emerged from me.  It represents a stage in negotiations which are going on at present.  It is not necessarily a final position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not wise tactics in negotiations of this complex nature to give as the upper figure of our request the £620 million, a figure which appears to the Opposition to be inadequate in view of the rather excruciating adjustments that will occur in the Irish economy if we find ourselves in line with this new currency?  There is a public impression abroad that realigning our currency with the new European one will give us a bed of roses situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should bear in mind that a great deal depends on the form of aid, if I might call it that, which might become available in the concurrent studies.  As of now there is no guarantee that any such aid would become available but, as to what would emerge, a great deal would depend on the format it would take and what it would be directed to.  It is not possible to indicate at this stage in the negotiations what would be the optimum position for us having regard to the fact that the final version of the form it might take has not yet been determined.  The most I can hope to do in the course of the debate next week is to indicate the current state of play but we would not be in a position to indicate the final position arising and, therefore, to make an assessment. Indeed, the Deputy would not be in a position to make an assessment of what should be required as a result of that.</P>

      <P>The figure of £620 million was reported in the newspapers and the Minister has told us that it did not come directly from him but I am sure the newspapers did not pluck it out of the air either.  There must be some basis for that figure.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that the calculations by which this figure was arrived at would be of assistance during next week's debate and during the substantive debate that will take place later.  I should like to know if he would give us an indication of how this figure or whatever figure he has in mind was arrived at?  If he gives it to us next week it will be of great assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Government are committed in the sense that that word is normally understood.  It is true to say that we would wish to join the European Monetary System, something which has been stated by other members of the Government, but the decision as to whether we should do so or not must depend on the final version of it and an assessment of its impact on our economy.  No such decision has been made and cannot be made at this stage.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The figures included in the table for receipts by way of grants and subsidies in the period 1 January 1973 to 31 December 1977 represent the amounts of money actually received under the various headings during that period. These amounts differ in some respects from the figures published in the six monthly reports to the Oireachtas on Developments in the European Communities which represent the amounts of grants and subsidies approved.  This is because there is normally a time lag between the approval of grants and the date of their payment, with the result that receipts from the Community to date have been somewhat less than the amount of grants approved.</P>
      <P>The table also includes estimates of receipts and payments for 1978.  It should be pointed out that these estimates are subject to a significant margin of variation, especially in the case of receipts under the FEOGA Guarantee Section which are liable to be affected by variations in trade and by changes in MCA levels as a result of currency fluctuations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.  The VAT rates appropriate to different types of contraceptives are the zero rate for one type and the 20 per cent rate for others.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, due to an error of classification, the VAT rate of 10 per cent was incorrectly applied to two particular types of contraceptives up to June last. Since then, the VAT rate of 20 per cent appropriate to those two items has been applied.  There are no figures of the effect on VAT revenue but it is not thought to be significant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the entire incident appears to make an ass of the law?  Would the Minister care to comment on the legality of the action of the Revenue Commissioners, in view of the law, in regard to the importation of contraceptives for sale?  It appears to be the case that the importers made no secret of the fact that these contraceptives were for sale, for distribution to family planning clinics throughout the country, yet the Inland Revenue people imposed tax on these.  It appears to make the entire legal position rather silly at present and seems to call for very urgent action indeed in reforming the law in respect of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>That is in another matter; it arises in connection with a particular company.  I think there is a question relating to it.  It is in connection with that particular company that this has happened. The position is that for quite some time&mdash;as I am sure the Deputy is aware&mdash;contraceptives were being imported, VAT was being paid on them and, as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, their disposal, after importation, did not constitute sale. That position can and could continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 15, 16 and 17 together. Arrangements were introduced in 1975 for the provision of secretarial assistance <Col N="276" /> for Deputies who are not office-holders. Payments are made to political parties and Independent Deputies in respect of persons nominated by the Ceann Comhairle to provide such assistance. Payments under the scheme to the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party amounted to £19,789, £10,170 and £5,102, respectively, in 1977.</P>
      <P>As well, sums by way of allowances for expenses, as set out in the tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report, were paid to the Leaders of the three main parties in the financial years 1960-61, 1970-71 and 1977.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme for the provision of clerical assistance referred to, one clerical assistant is provided in the case of the three main political parties for each certain number of Deputies or fraction of that number: the average number of Deputies per clerical assistant at present works out at 9.5 in the case of Fianna Fáil, 8.6 in the case of Fine Gael and nine in the case of Labour.  The three Deputies not belonging to the main parties, that is, two Independent Deputies and one party represented by a single Deputy, have together been allocated one clerical assistant which represents in their case a more favourable ratio than in the case of the Deputies in the main parties.</P>
      <P>I cannot say at this stage what revised arrangements might be necessary in the hypothetical event of further parties outside the main parties returning Deputies in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to raise this in the House.  I tried endlessly in other ways, but I had no alternative.  I appreciate that it is a very difficult situation which boils down to the decision by the major parties as to whether they will extend a reasonable attitude in relation to the smaller party.  The basic principle that appears to have been discussed and considered in relation to this question of secretarial assistance was the pool system which was discarded for obvious reasons.  The Fine Gael people would not like to work with the Labour people and the Labour people would not like to work with Fianna Fáil and so on.  That having been dismissed, is the Minister now attempting to impose a pool system on Deputy Blaney, Deputy Sheridan and myself?  We are not allowed confidentiality, the right to see people in private, have telephone conversations in private and so on.  In equity, would the Minister consider that there is a case either for accepting a general pool system for all of us or else making some kind of specific assistance available to this party with a view to what will happen to Sinn Féin, the Workers' Party, the Communist Party and subsequent parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand what the Deputy means by applying a pool system to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If one was working in a pool system it would mean that the Fine Gael Deputy, the Labour Deputy and the Fianna Fáil Deputy would probably dictate letters to the same person.  It was decided that that obviously was not practical or wise and this system was rejected by all the parties.  This system is now being imposed on Deputy Blaney and Deputy Sheridan and myself.  They are being asked to work with us with whom they have no political affinity and we are being asked to work with them, obviously with different political views. That does not apply to either Labour, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, so why should it apply to us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the pool system as outlined by the Deputy is not practical if it were extended across the board, but what alternative is available? <Col N="278" /> It seems that the only alternative which could satisfy the Deputy's requirement is that one typist be allocated to him.  Do I understand it correctly?</P>

      <P>The basic issue raised by Deputy Browne in this question is of very great importance to Members of the Dáil in the efficient discharging of their duties.  In a local authority a relatively minor official has better facilities for performing his duties than any Member of this House except those who are holding office.  It is a farcical situation where there are six, eight or nine Deputies in one room.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that a better way of doing this job would be to make a personal allowance available to each Deputy in respect of secretarial help?  That would meet the points raised by Deputy Browne, any other Deputy or any party member.  Would the Minister also agree that that kind of assistance is required more in the locality in which the Deputy is elected to serve rather than in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Murphy's question and to Deputy Browne, the question of making a cash allowance to each Deputy as a contribution towards secretarial assistance presents a number of problems, but if the parties were agreed on that method in substitution for the present method I would certainly give serious consideration to it.  I do not want to go into complicated details here but there are difficulties. If having considered the matter the parties preferred that system.  I and the Government will certainly give serious consideration to changing the system.  I would not be prepared to do so unless the parties having considered it separately were of the opinion that it should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of providing one typist per Deputy, obviously every Deputy would wish to have this facility but there is a question not only of the substantial cost involved but of the possibility that some people might regard the service as an underhand method of increasing the remuneration of Deputies.  In addition there is the practical problem of accommodation within easy reach and also the problem of the provision of telephones and so on.  Therefore the matter is not a simple one.  In general, while I do not suppose there is any Deputy who would argue that the facilities available for Members are adequate, the facilities have been improving steadily down through the years.  Since I came into the House, for example.  I have witnessed vast improvements.  I am not saying that the services are adequate or perfect. <Col N="280" /> There is room for improvement but we cannot expect realistically to achieve the optimum position in too short a time.</P>

Would he consider also the further suggestion I have made in correspondence with the Taoiseach that the present formula, if expressed in different terms, that is, including Senators but with a somewhat different ratio, could produce exactly the same result from political parties but would provide also for secretarial help for Independent Senators?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether he has considered the question at all?  He has been asked often enough to do so by the three of us who are involved. We do not have recourse to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges <Col N="282" /> as we are not represented on that body.  I have been asking to be received by them but my request has not been met.  I want the Minister to remove entirely from the public mind that which he has intimated here today, that is, that Deputies Browne, Sheridan and I do better than anybody else out of this situation in that we have one secretarial assistant for three of us as against a ratio of 1 to 9 and 1 to 8.4 for other Members.  That is ignoring entirely cash supplements that are paid in various ways to the three parties. With that consideration in mind, it will be seen that on average we get less per head than that represented in cash and kind by each of the other parties. This Chamber is the only place in which we can voice any view on this since we will not be heard anywhere else so let me remind the House also that we are the only people working in basement conditions with fur growing on the walls, in an area that is not lighted properly and which becomes too hot when the heat is on and too cold when the heat is off.  The three of us are stuffed in there in these conditions.  Such a situation would not be tolerated in any other capacity in the country.  I am totally fed up with it.  For more than a year I have been urging the Minister to improve the situation but without success and now he tells us that we are doing better than other Members. Let it be remembered that we represent 250,000 people or 12 seats in the three constituencies concerned but we are not even getting a fair share in relation to facilities.  I worked here for years when there was no assistance, when there was no postal allowance and when we were not allowed trunk call expenses but I am not cribbing about the progress that has been made in the meantime.</P>

Is the subsidy of those private schemes not in contradistinction to the position taken up by the Minister's colleagues and himself that there should be a cutback in subsidies to public housing, health and social welfare pensions?  There is no criticism by them that those schemes should be cut down.  While some of the people benefiting from those schemes are white collar workers some of them <Col N="286" /> are very wealthy people.  The wealthier one is the more one benefits.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the great bulk of the people who are benefiting under this are in the broad category of white collar workers, as he said, but the question of the amount of subsidy that should be paid on public housing is another matter and has to be considered in the overall context of the fiscal management of our economy.

    <Title>Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1977: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to summarise the principal points of objection which I have to the proposal before us.  I dealt with them at some length prior to Question Time and I do not intend to repeat them at length.  The first major point is that the benefit which was promised to all citizens is not being granted.  There are approximately 300,000 people in private rented accommodation who are not getting the benefit of the abolition of rates.  In passing, one could say that the phrase &ldquo;abolition of rates&rdquo; is a misnomer.  No matter what way one wishes to analyse it, rates are not being abolished as such because the revenue is being raised in another form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point leads to the second major objection which I hold.  It is one that has not been given a great deal of attention and I should like Minister to pay particular attention to it.  Old people and people of limited means who have been adjudged to be entitled to a waiver of their rates in previous years are now forced to pay their rates in the context of the direct taxation which will go towards making up the deficit.  The Government have ignored this point and I would now draw it to their attention and ask them to reflect on it.  There is an anomaly in regard to people who until some months ago had the benefit of a relative financial advantage over their neighbours of anything from £2 to £8 per week, depending on the size of their houses. They are now to be disadvantaged by virtue of the fact that the deficit will be <Col N="305" /> picked up from taxation of one kind or another, which is not going to discriminate against them but which will be levied equally on everybody.  The position is that the person who was, by definition, already seen to be a poor person or a person of limited means, now finds that their outgoings on the necessities of life will increase and will include the revenue which the Government now see fit to make up.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to overstress the importance of this measure to people in private rented accommodation. I am aware that there is not as high an awareness as there should be among the population of the advantages to which they are entitled and which they were promised 18 months ago.  A symbol and a symptom of the Government's attitude to people in private rented accommodation is summed up by their rejection to respond sympathetically to proposals to establish a fair rents tribunal which would give recourse to the courts for tenants and landlords.  Compounded as it was by the unanimous support of 84 Government Deputies, I found that rejection particularly sad because it flew in the face of a written guarantee given to the association representing flat dwellers prior to the election that the Government would commit themselves to the introduction of a fair rents tribunal.  That letter, dated 7 June 1977 and signed by the National Director of Elections for Fianna Fáil, Senator Eoin Ryan, is there for all to see.  There does not appear to be one shred of interest in implementing that proposal, not one suggestion that at some stage in the future that proposal will be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>All we are dealing with in this Bill is rates on flats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to point out to this House, and I will not be easily diverted from that course, that the attitude of the Government to giving the rates abolition to tenants is epitomised by their attitude to the rents tribunal. This was also a pledge and it is not just being reneged on but is being totally opposed by the Government.  If that is <Col N="306" /> symptomatic of their general attitude, then the ratepayers may expect a similar deal in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Apart from the ludicrous suggestion that a tenant would take the extreme step of going to court, if the Government are serious about giving some measure of guarantee that tenants in private rented accommodation will get their entitlement, they must do better than the proposal in the Bill.  There are a number of insidious aspects of the financial implications for flatdwellers.  Until the end of 1976 the landlords association&mdash;and I have sympathy with the difficulty they have in trying to maintain housing stock and believe that they have been ignored over the years&mdash;consistently maintained they were businessmen, that their flats were business properties and that their incomes and outgoings should be seen as such.  By their own definition, if you like, perhaps they should have been ineligible for rates abolition.  Perhaps they should not be entitled to it because they saw their role in the community as being a commercial one instead of a social one. It is perfectly clear that the abolition of rates in the context of private rented accommodation only benefits the landlord. I am not against benefit accruing to landlords but no Government has a right to pretend they are giving certain rights and concessions to tenants.</P>
      <P>With regard to referring the matter to the courts, I have no doubt that the courts will not be invoked to adjudicate in such cases because anybody in their normal mental state would hardly go to court and immediately incur the wrath of a landlord who could eject them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect that is worrying is that there are implications in relation to housing policy generally.  Earlier I suggested that the Government should consider the possibility of allowing the rent paid for private accommodation to be offset in part or in whole against income tax.  The introduction of such an allowance would be an indication of the Government's desire to ensure that the benefits of which we have heard so much, and which won a massive political endorsement, would be passed on to the people entitled to them.  At present the irony in the situation is that there is growing evidence that quite a number of <Col N="307" /> single people are buying family houses because of the mortgage interest allowed. Therefore, there is a growing anomaly in that people who are, to use the Minister's colleague's words, relatively well heeled and articulate are getting benefits and tax concessions from the State while people who are struggling to bring up families, often in shoddy accommodation in which neither the Government nor the local authorities have the slightest interest, are being deprived of a concession.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy certainly has a democratic right <Col N="308" /> to air his views here but not to repeat them and the fact that there is a Minister of State standing in for the Minister does not mean that the Deputy repeats his whole speech for the benefit of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not do that and it is an improper suggestion to make, with respect to you.</P>
      <P>I should like again to draw the attention of the House to the question of valuation.  I should like some Government response to the question of the growing fear of people of the new enthusiastic zeal for revaluing property. I want to know the reason for it and whether the Government are willing to deny categorically that there is no suggestion of the rates being re-introduced by a backdoor method under any other guise.  It is important to put this on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the sovereignty and fiscal power of local democracies, which I consider to be fundamental in the Bill, is also relevant and very central.  I talked about that before lunch.  I do not intend to go into it in any great detail except to say that I assume at least that the Government will not be so bold in their reply to this debate as to pretend that controls of a very strict nature to the powers which local authorities have have not been introduced.  That is beyond doubt.  Indeed the Government side of the House have already admitted that in this morning's debate.  What we should be talking about here, if such controls are deemed to be necessary in any situation, is the type of control. There are grave dangers in the Government Bill, in the implications it has for the manner in which local authorities can order their own finances internally and also with regard to their powers for raising money.  Indeed, in the Dublin City Council alone we have had examples of this and I have no doubt they are common throughout the country.  The Minister of State, as someone with substantial local authority knowledge and experience, will be quick to recognise that.  It is very important, unless the whole concept of local government is to become even more farcical than it is at the moment, that it does not become a <Col N="309" /> rubber stamp for central government. Therefore substantial fiscal sovereignty of a clearly defined nature with genuine delegated powers of responsibility should be openly expressed as part of Government policy.  Instead of that we have the opposite in this section of the Bill and that is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>I assume we will have, in due course, a statement from the Government about the premature disclosure of this Bill.  I mention that because I hope it is not being forgotten by the Government.  We want to know how it came to be prematurely disclosed by the Government. It is relevant to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Government to consider sincerely the concern of all of us who would like to see social justice permeating all levels of our society.  I am aware of the discussions which the Government party had prior to the election with the landlord associations.  They had two meetings subsequent to which certain guarantees could be given about the kind of actions the Government would pursue in office.  I would like to think that the evidence so far, which is that the Government are primarily concerned about some echelons of society to the exclusion, to the detriment, to the impoverishment of other levels of society, will now be reversed and that we will see in practical terms, particularly with regard to people who are in a very difficult plight in parts of &ldquo;flatland&rdquo; and urban areas, a reversal of the Government tradition for the last year and a half of caring about only certain levels of society to the exclusion of others.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a measure of social justice to be granted to these people. It has not been done.  This is in direct conflict with what the Government promised.  I know that if the Government wished they could railroad this Bill through the House.  The numbers are there.  I am long enough here to know that that is apparently the way things operate.  I should like to think that we could be more flexible in our approaches than that, that the points being put forward would be seriously considered. If amendments were to be put forward by the Government they would be seen as a sign of strength and not as a sign of weakness.  They would be seen as <Col N="310" /> the ability to comprehend that one side of the House does not have a monopoly of wisdom or insight and that there are other experiences and insights which may be beneficial.  This Bill falls far short of the promises that were made and the standards of justice for all members of our community towards which most of us in this House aspire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what the previous speaker had to say about the Bill.  Some of the suggestions were worthy of examination and consideration and I would hope that they would in due course be examined and carefully considered.  Obviously it is too soon to hope that any amendment could be made to a Bill of this kind because, first of all, we have to put it into practice.  We have to see how it operates in practice and in due course we will see the benefits which have accrued, the faults which will have occurred in the Bill, the difficulties which will have evolved as a result.  The suggestion that perhaps we should consider allowing flatdwellers to set off their payment of rent against income tax to some degree is worthy of consideration.  There are other suggestions that Deputy Keating has made.  I do not intend to repeat them.  His contribution was a constructive and positive one.  It bodes well for the future of this session in contrast to the contrary behaviour of some of his colleagues last year.  There is no doubt that all political parties in the last election intended one way or another ultimately to abolish rates on private dwellings. The present Government undertook to abolish rates on domestic dwellings, schools and community halls.  They said in their pre-election programme for the economy in the future that all private houses would be affected by this legislation and that the rates element in the rent on local authority houses would be removed.  They also said that the rate content of the rent paid by tenants of privately rented accommodation, as Deputy Keating so rightly said, needs very careful monitoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not too sure that it is appropriate to take up so soon the suggestions made by Deputy Keating but I certainly see the merit in them.  The attraction of our <Col N="311" /> package and the way in which it has been thought out and put in black and white had some bearing on the success of the Fianna Fáil Party in the last election, but it was only one of many attractive items that were put before the people. We are not permitted to go into detail on that.</P>
    <P>The inequity of the rates system is general ever since rates were first introduced in the mid-nineteenth century. Adjustments and various modifications were made in the system and as time went on it became more and more inequitable. For instance, a semi-detached house with small front and back gardens might have a rateable valuation of £35 while a very large house with ten or 12 bedrooms on three or four acres of land might have a valuation of about £12. Certainly there was no equity in that system and the reaction among the 850,000 householders who were each year asked to pay in some cases upwards of £500 to £1,000 was growing all the time.  We recognised that earlier than the previous Government.  Families were in the position that when the rates demands came in all other activities came almost to a halt.  It was like a sheriff coming to take away anything that remained.  No consideration was given in the rating system to the ability of people to pay.  The man on a low income of £40, £50, or £60 a week had to pay the same as the person with £150 or £200.</P>
    <P>There is no argument on either side of the House about rates being abolished, I am glad to say, but there is some argument about how rates on private flats or the rate content should be allowed to the tenant of each flat and how people in these flats can get the benefit.  The suggestion by Deputy Keating and other speakers that under the system we have set up, whereby the tenants or flatdwellers can go to court to pursue the rate content in the rent, only very few people will do so is not really a serious suggestion. If people feel aggrieved they may appeal to the court.  No great cost is involved and if they have a case the courts will support it as laid down under this Bill.  The suggestion that they will not do this is, to me, rather arrogant.  It assumes <Col N="312" /> that people are not prepared to assert their rights.  In my time as public representative of one kind or another I have never noticed anybody slow to pursue his rights whether in the courts, in social welfare or otherwise and I am sure that when the rate content involved in a flatdweller's rent comes in question the matter will be pursued.  There is a very vocal organisation as we heard here to-day to support tenants.  We had quotations from the Flatdwellers' Association and so on.  The tenants have a very professional organisation to support them.  I see no reason why the courts cannot be used at least as an interim measure to see how they go in the next year or two.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Bill also covers the use of dwellings which provide lodgings and that this will not in itself disqualify premises from domestic status is very important.  It means in effect that houses which are listed, as distinct from registered, with Bord Fáilte will not lose their entitlement to domestic rates relief. The Minister has said that registered guesthouses under the Tourist Traffic Act are in a different category from ordinary dwellings and as such cannot qualify for relief as ordinary dwellings under the Bill.  That is eminently reasonable and I have heard nobody complain about it.  Many registered guesthouses, in addition to accommodation permanently and specifically set aside for guests, will also include ordinary domestic quarters and such a guesthouse will qualify for some reliefs as a mixed premises.  These matters have been mentioned by the Minister.  His introductory speech was quite reasonable and I do not think anybody can argue with it to any great extent.  I feel very much like somebody asked to speak on something on which not only is there unanimity in the House but in the country.</P>
    <P>Whether the Opposition care to use every conceivable scare to frighten the people with alternatives to rates, whether they can continue to do that and maintain credibility as a serious Opposition, I do not know.  We have heard that as an alternative to rates we will introduce a property tax of some kind and rumours are spread by the Opposition that some separate taxes will be laid on <Col N="313" /> householders for public lighting, sanitary services and all the other services available.  This is deliberate scaremongering.  Unreasonable approaches of this kind frighten people and they have been frightened enough over the years by the constantly increasing rates bills not to be threatened in this way.  It should be emphasised and they should be assured that there is no question of property taxes.  Nobody has ever suggested this.  A previous speaker mentioned that a house registration tax would be introduced.  Where do the Opposition get this information?  On what do they base their allegations about substitute taxation to replace rates?  It is not a reasonable approach to their own defeat in the election to try to frighten people into disbelieving something which brought great relief to almost 1,000,000 householders.</P>
    <P>The Opposition should not continue to suggest that alternatives will be found. If they intend to introduce alternatives if and when they return to office, they should come out and say what their alternatives are.  Not once from the Government side of the House have I heard any suggestion from anybody that Fianna Fáil intend to introduce property tax, or house registration tax, or separate taxation for the ordinary services such as sanitation, water, and so on.  If the Opposition have such proposals for the future, they should lay them on the line for the people and not attribute suggestions of that kind to us. If they intend to return to a different form of rates or taxation let them say so and not try to pin that on us.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that local government will be undermined and local authorities will increasingly lose their significance and their power.  I do not accept that at all.  Local authorities must be consulted about various issues such as road building in their administrative areas.  The zoning and planning of their areas are subject to their own development plans.  The feedback from local councillors and members of local authorities is part and parcel of democracy.  I do not accept that this Bill can undermine in any way the autonomy of local authorities.  We are told there <Col N="314" /> will be a tight rein on money.  Why not? Anybody running a business will ensure that his accountant keeps a very close eye on his accounts and his investments and how his money is spent.  Why not? Why should we not keep an eye on how public money is spent and keep control of it?</P>
    <P>A certain amount of money is available to every local authority.  The suggestion&mdash;and I must say I thought it a mean suggestion&mdash;that local authorities who would not toe the line would be penalised by the withdrawal of a percentage of their allocations every year is unwarranted.  Such an allegation is unworthy in a democratic Parliament such as ours.  A suggestion that a local authority who do not agree with the manner in which the central Government are operating will be penalised by the withdrawal of funds or by a reduction in the allocation of funds is mean, and I regret that it was made.  I do not think it arises at all.</P>
    <P>A suggestion that the powers of the local authorities will be curbed is not on. I do not accept it.  This is a very good Bill.  It carries out what we undertook to do.  We undertook to abolish rates on private dwellings, schools and community halls.  We have done that.  We undertook to abolish car tax.  We did that. Our undertakings have been delivered in this Bill and I cannot see why anybody feels aggrieved about it.  Every Bill put through the House is bound to hurt somebody, perhaps half a dozen people, or maybe 100 people.  Every Bill makes a change and change frequently hurts a small minority of people.  There is no question or doubt about that.</P>
    <P>The cost to central funds of £8 million in a full year is an enormous amount. Obviously ways will have to be found to recoup some of the money.  The Government have outlined the ways and means in which they propose to do this.  Taxation is buoyant and more money than ever before has been flowing in to the Exchequer.  The country has never been better.  Anyone travelling in rural Ireland will see that money is available in enormous amounts.  I am very pleased about that.  The return to the Exchequer is there and will continue to rise.  As a nation we have money which we must <Col N="315" /> divide in so many ways.  The real benefit of this Bill is that it removes the ultimate burden on householders.  Every year householders had to find £200, £300, £400 or £500.  Whether we like it or not, people had not the foresight to save £10 a week, or £5 a week, or whatever was required.  Then the Bill came and contributed to an air of gloom and depression on the part of householders.  The gross inequity of the system was such that it was no longer justifiable.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue to review the operation of the Bill in the years to come.  As things stand I do not see any necessity to amend the Bill.  I am quite satisfied it covers precisely everything we undertook to do.  I suppose it is fair to say no other Bill introduced so far has been welcomed by so many people.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill thereby fulfilling the undertakings we gave in the last general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister implements the abolition of rates on private dwellings, schools and certain categories of community centres. I approve of that because the rating system was an inequitable system of collecting taxation since it did not take account of a person's ability to pay.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed also to finance the relief of rates and the methods adopted by the Minister for that purpose, despite anything that may be said on the Government benches, do away completely with the powers of local authorities.  I say that from bitter experience. I have the honour to be a member of Kildare County Council.  As in every other local authority, agreement was reached in Kildare County Council to pay certain increases in income, salaries and wages as a result of arbitration. Now, in my experience, there is just no way a county manager could include that item in his estimates last year.  Had he included the Government's recommended 5 per cent increase I wonder what the Minister would have said to him.  No way.  The increase, of course, worked out roughly at 10 per cent because of productivity agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> What would the Minister have said to the county manager if he included an estimate last year of about 11 per cent for this increase?</P>
    <P>We have a majority of Government representatives on Kildare County Council and we have always authorised sufficient to cover claims of this nature. It is now necessary to submit these to the Department for approval.  Did we get approval?  No.  The manager was told he would have to find the money from last year's estimates even though he could not estimate for the amount at that time. As a local authority we have no power to overspend.  That power has been taken from us under the system adopted for the abolition of rates.  There are two options.  The increase must be paid.  The money will have to be found in the scheme of works we administer.  In that eventuality employees will have to be laid off or the schemes will have to be rearranged.  In our wisdom, with a majority of Government supporters on our council, we opted for a 16 per cent increase in the rates last year for works that should be done in the county.  That was cut by the Minister to 11 per cent. Fair enough.  We agreed with the abolition of rates but the Minister now expects us to provide increases in pay for our workers.  They are entitled to these increases.  As I said, we cannot overspend. All we can do is lay off workers or cut down on schemes.  These are the options offered by a Minister who boasted about the money he was providing for the relief of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Further restrictions will be imposed on local authorities.  I have here circulars sent down from the Minister's Department. They have probably gone to every local authority.  One is about housing. The Minister says he is allowing an increase in the loan up to £9,000. Everyone knows that unless you increase the income limit it is ridiculous to increase the local authority loan.  No one earning less than £3,500 could dream of paying £90 a month loan repayment.  Of course, £9,000 would not buy a house today.  The prospective buyer will have to get £3,000 or £4,000 somewhere else. We are told we should encourage people to buy their own houses.  It is no part of our responsibility as public representatives <Col N="317" /> to encourage people to go into debt.</P>
    <P>Another circular says we should make land available to the speculative builder, the idea apparently being to get this speculative builder to provide houses which should be provided by the local authority.  This is the kind of thinking coming from the Department since the abolition of rates.  If this is not taking power from local authorities I do not know what it is.  There was unanimous agreement on the council that the money to meet the increases in incomes, salaries and wages was necessary and it was right and proper that it should be raised. Yet we were told that we could not do it. Under this Bill we have reached a situation where local authorities cannot do anything without the prior approval of the Minister or his Department.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that most of the rates in any one year will go towards the maintenance of services already provided.  There is not a local authority in any area who do not wish to improve their services.  It has been said that 11 per cent was a very reasonable amount. I do not agree, nor do the council of which I have the honour to be a member.  They are one of the most responsible local authorities and it was their view that 16 per cent was necessary. We always drew up an estimate in Kildare which contained a provision for an increase in services and this was to be provided from rates.  Last year we were not allowed the increases which we desired.  We were told to cut down to 11 per cent.  Of course, we had advantages because it was a year in which we were owed certain moneys by the Department and we received certain grants.  This year the crunch is coming.  The increase of 11 per cent allowed last year was less than the inflation rate from the previous year. I assume that the rate of inflation, whatever way it is compiled, is now less than that.  If the amount this year is to be less than the rate of inflation, then it will certainly be a restriction on the members of a council in the performance of their duties and in carrying out their aim of increasing services.  This is a just aspiration for every member of a local authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> In this Bill the Minister is implementing the manifesto promise to do away with rates, but he gave no consideration whatever to how the finance would be provided while leaving some power in the hands of local authorities. There was no idea about how this money was to be provided.  It may be said that 11 per cent was a generous allowance. I know that people such as landowners and business people who were not relieved of the necessity of paying rates had to be protected from a huge increase, but the principal consideration was to protect the Exchequer because the Government were committed to the manifesto.  No one likes imposing rates and local authorities inquire diligently to see where they can save one penny for the ratepayers.  Now they are expected to keep within the limits laid down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Judging from the result of an application by our county manager requesting money to pay an increase in wages and salaries to staff, I can only assume that no matter what emergency arises we cannot overexpend and may have to cut down on services.  As a member of a local authority, the Minister knows that there are many cases where money must be spent.  The members of Kildare County Council authorised the manager to overspend by £85,000 in order to give increases in wages and salaries to their staff.  The manager has now been told by the Department that he must find that money in last year's estimates.  This could be done by laying off workers but, knowing the manager, I think that will not happen.  The money must be raised by re-arranging at this late date the programme of work for the remaining three months of this year and by leaving out some necessary works.  We must raise a further £85,000 and we are told that we cannot spend some of next year's rates.  That was always done through the years and if that is not restricting the freedom of the council, what is?</P>
    <P>We are told in circulars which are arriving by the dozen of all the ways in which we can spend less money.  We can get bigger subsidies for private sites and we can sell these sites at a subsidised price.  I give credit to the Minister for increasing <Col N="319" /> the subsidy.  We can give a loan of £9,000 in order to build a house on such a site which, at the present market price, will cost £12,000.  The person's income must not be over £3,500.  This kind of talk is rubbish, and I say that seriously. The Minister knows, because he is a practical man, that a man who has to repay £90 per month on a loan of £9,000 cannot do so on an income of less than £3,500, that he must go elsewhere to get another loan of £2,000 or £3,000.</P>
    <P>We have been told to have another look at applicants for local authority houses.  Several circulars have been issued to local authorities telling them that they must restrict housing lists to three-member families.  I know many people who have not got families through no fault of their own and who are living in extremely bad conditions.  Such people are being forced out of the housing lists, and to my mind this is a strategy of the Department to cut their losses through the abolition of rates.</P>

      <P>Even when they collected rates, the income of local authorities was very limited.  The Minister has said that two-thirds of the rates revenue is now payable by the Department.  To my mind local authorities will spend 95 per cent of any limited increase in allocation simply to maintain existing services.  They will not be free in future to develop those services in the way they would wish <Col N="320" /> because any increase in allocation will barely cover inflation.  Indeed, last year it did not even come up to that level.</P>
      <P>I have given an indication of the predicament in which the county manager of my area finds himself.  He is now in a situation where he cannot even estimate for the current year.  It is in this way that the limited powers local authorities had are being whittled away and if this continues councils will become mere talking shops and they will be severely restricted in any improvement they wish to make.  This Bill will further restrict any powers they had.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the abolition of rates meant anything to old age pensioners. They already had waiver of rates.  Now an old age pensioner is in a worse position.  He sees a man living in a £50,000 house in a position where he does not have to pay rates and he does not have to pay tax on the two cars he owns.  Although I agree that the abolition of rates has merits, I seriously suggest that it has created anomalies of the type I have just mentioned.  If there is to be local autonomy there must be some form of local taxation.  I say this while agreeing that rates should have been abolished because they were inequitable in that people had to pay them even though they had not the capacity to pay. The fact that the central Government are providing all the money for local services may make people wild in their demands whereas if there is local taxation in some form they would be more careful.  If Government Departments are to have control of local purse strings the local authorities will not have power to do anything.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest about it.  Local authorities will not have any power unless they have money.  I can go to local authority meetings and demand money for road building and for the extension of sewerage facilities but unless there is some money available it cannot be done. In my experience local authorities have been most responsible and have not spent a penny unwisely.  That record is there for all to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain how local authorities will have powers if there is such a severe limit on their expenditure, <Col N="321" /> as has been proved by our application to overspend a few pounds.  If a local authority is to be subjected to such restriction it has no powers.  I accept that the Bill was necessary in order to implement what the Minister is proposing.  His party gave a promise in their manifesto to abolish rates on private dwellings and on certain other buildings and they are doing that.  However, I am justified in saying that they made no attempt to say where the money was to come from. Even with the best will the Minister is controlled by budgetary policy and by overall Government policy.  The power of the councillor in the many councils throughout the country will be very curtailed. There must be some other way by which the local authorities can call on finance other than by coming cap in hand to the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is the intention of the Department of the Environment or the Department of Finance to impose some other kind of tax.  If that is the intention I am prepared to consider it on its merits.  I do not know to which Department the Valuation Office are responsible but I would like to tell the Minister that there is much hurrying and scurrying around my constituency raising the valuations.  I do not know at whose request this is being done but I do not think it is at the council's request.  I think it is being done because of a Government direction.  Valuations in my county are being increased substantially. I do not know the purpose if rates on private houses are gone forever as we were led to believe.  Perhaps there is the prospect of imposing some further tax.  I presume the Government are not anxious to give our council more money because the fact that valuations are greater increases our demand.  I doubt that the Department are so anxious to give us more money that they are hurrying around my constituency increasing the valuations.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and the Cabinet on the measures they are taking in this important Bill.  As Deputies from both sides of the House have said, it is a Bill that will honour the commitments made in the manifesto in relation to the removal of rates on domestic property. In the past Fianna Fáil were prepared to lead not only nationally but internationally in providing a scheme for the sale of local authority houses to tenants. That scheme has been modified several times since.  It has been widely recognised as being valuable and worthwhile and has been readily adopted by our people.  In this area Fianna Fáil led internationally and once again Fianna Fáil are leading in the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings.  Other countries have come here, particularly the British, to see how such a measure could be operated.  In this respect the Minister and the Cabinet are to be congratulated on the steps they have taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must disagree with my colleague, Deputy Niall Andrews, who said that rates were to be abolished anyway.  I think there is a little more to it than that. In fairness to the Coalition I would say that they were prepared to stabilise rates on domestic dwellings and in that sense I would agree with Deputy Andrews.  Certainly they showed they were prepared to stabilise the rates but the Minister's statement shows that they were having considerable difficulties in the matter and, in fact, the figures show that the average rate in the £ in the period 1973 to 1977 rose from £6.70 to £9.  The Minister went on to say &ldquo;Our initiative has been bolder and more clear-cut in taking these steps to remove once and for all the burden of rates from over 850,000 householders and other persons who would benefit from these reliefs.&rdquo;  It is important that we recognise the step that was taken here.  There was no equivocation about it, there were no half <Col N="323" /> measures.  A clear-cut and decisive action was taken.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the Opposition Deputies I thought they were not really convinced about what they were saying. They should clarify in their minds whether they are for the abolition of rates totally on domestic dwellings or whether they are against it, not whether they are grudgingly for it.  Deputy Bermingham said the proposal had merit but maintained that it was not all that people thought it was.  This typifies the approach we have seen in this House since the measure was introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham went so far as to suggest that some form of local tax would be necessary in place of rates.  The Oppositon should get their minds clear on this.  Fianna Fáil were very clear-cut, as the Minister says.  They took decisive action, and I hope this Government will continue to keep up this standard shown in making such an effective approach and being so decisive in the effective steps which were taken.  Such measures will be feasible only where the people in general act responsibly.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that the savings in rates are an increase in net income for the majority of people.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development made this point very clearly at various stages during the last year. I believe that people recognise what has been done and that they will act responsibly, but we must remind ourselves that the majority of people have gained in this way.  I like the concept of security in the home irrespective of income or circumstances, because I am very much a family man.  Consequently I was very pleased when the Government took this action and when the commitment was made in the first instance in the manifesto.  Several people have pointed out that, although this now applies to widows, pensioners, the unemployed and various other people, some of these people would have benefits from the previous system of the waiver of rates.  It is important to bear in mind here that this involved the means test which most people regard as demeaning and which always led to a great deal of debate and <Col N="324" /> contention, particularly in border-line cases.  Therefore, I very much welcome the view and the approach taken by the Government here.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the removal of rates from community halls and <i>bona fide</i> secondary schools.  Having been involved deeply in one community hall from the time its foundations were laid by the late President Childers until the hall went into operation, I thought it was scandalous that such a hall should be charged rates and that the people who in a <i>bona fide</i> way worked voluntarily for the community should have to find these rates.  I am very pleased that the Minister has taken this step in relation to community halls, and to secondary schools where it would affect particularly the voluntary secondary schools who are already struggling under fairly difficult financial burdens.</P>
    <P>Like some other Deputies, I am concerned about the position of flatdwellers. The Minister has provided for them to get relief and he has pointed out that the Bill contains a number of provisions designed to ensure that the benefit of domestic rates relief is passed on to the tenants of rented accommodation.  I am pleased that the Minister has attempted to pass on these reliefs.  I recognise that landlords in some cases may be reluctant to pass them on and may not do so.  I ask the Minister to exert any pressure he can on such landlords to ensure that they pass on the benefit to their tenants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham and other Deputies during this debate raised the question of the loss of power at local authority level, suggesting that without rates the money will come mainly from the central fund.  It is clear that approximately 40 per cent of the income of local authorities will still come from the non-domestic sector and from commercial rates.  In the short term the Minister has instituted a very fair method of allocating the fund's resources and he has done his best to meet the points raised during the debate on this issue.  We all, including Deputy Bermingham, must recognise that there must be financial responsibility at local authority level within the overall plans and achievements of the country as a whole and of <Col N="325" /> the Government in power at any time.  It is a good concept to think in terms of us all growing together in relation to our national achievements and ploughing these back into local areas and so working collectively, nationally, to increase the growth of our economy and the wealth of our nation.</P>
    <P>The abolition of rates highlights the need for local government reorganisation. I am very much aware that the Minister in his recent speeches has promised a review of local government organisation.  I ask him to take early action on this review from a number of points of view.  Within the organisation structure as it stands at present or with the changes which are taking place there is a need to look at the delegation of responsibility.  I am also concerned that the Minister might consider providing a consultative body for community councils and responsible community associations, preferably before we go into next year's local elections.  This is important because the growth of voluntary community organisations and bodies is very much a feature of life today.  Whatever the ultimate developments are, it will be very valuable to provide at least such a consultative body who could meet community councils and responsible associations say twice a year for the purpose of putting their views to the elected councils and representatives of the local authorities.  I support the Minister's promise to review local government organisation within a reasonable time.  I hope that this will be done as early as possible and that he will take action, whatever it may be, preferably in advance of the forthcoming local elections next year.</P>

      <P>I raise this subject as the result of a certain amount of ambiguity that would appear to exist in relation to the availability of Irish passports for Irish citizens at present living in the State of Rhodesia.  It has been apparent <Col N="326" /> for some time that the Irish citizens in that State are not fully informed and/or fully aware of their rights in this matter.  Successive Governments have not attempted to explain to these citizens in great detail the constitutional rights that exist in regard to their entitlement to an Irish passport.  We have approximately 8,000 citizens living in Rhodesia and it has been the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs not to issue passports to those Irish citizens whose activities might further encourage the unlawful actions of the illegal regime there.  Can the Minister define activities that would further encourage unlawful actions of the illegal regime in Rhodesia? An Irish person employed as an officer of the civil service there who might have a house mortgage, have to pay school fees or insurance policies and loans to finance houses in that State is in a financial quagmire with the result that he is not in a position to leave that country if he wishes.  I should like to know if he is alleged to be supporting an illegal regime?  Is a person who ten years ago joined the police force, the armed forces or any section of the civil administration to be denied an Irish passport because the allegation can be made by the Department that he is inadvertantly encouraging the unlawful actions of an illegal regime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our attitude, and the policy of the Department in recent years, has been far too vague and requires clearer definition. It requires a stronger and clearcut statement by the Minister.  Recently the Minister was engaged in an extensive tour of six countries in Africa during the course of which he met many Irish contingents. His trip was greatly appreciated by them.  I should like to know if he met any deputations from the Irish people living in Rhodesia.  I believe he may have met some people representing the Irish community living in the state of South Africa.  It is important that it be pointed out that there are many Irish people living in Rhodesia who do not support apartheid but who, by virtue of economic factors that existed at the time of their qualification from university, technical colleges or secondary schools, could not find employment here and had to seek work overseas.  Indeed, they were <Col N="327" /> encouraged to do so by successive Governments.  Having found gainful employment those who went to Rhodesia now find themselves deprived of their constitutional right to an Irish passport.</P>
    <P>In the course of his written reply to Question No. 324 yesterday the Minister said that every Irish citizen living abroad has a right of entry to this country and that he had always made it clear that any Irish person living in Rhodesia who wishes to settle in Ireland or otherwise leave Rhodesia permanently would be issued with an Irish passport in the usual way.  In that statement we have the vagueness which has been characteristic of this section of foreign policy.  A person does not need a passport to return to their own country but why does an Irish person living in Rhodesia have to state that he wishes to settle for the rest of his life in Ireland before he can obtain an Irish passport?  Irish citizens living anywhere else in the world do not have to make that declaration. Why should an Irish citizen have to state to the Department that he will never return to Rhodesia where he may have relatives or may wish to attend funerals or sporting events?</P>
    <P>In the light of the declaration by the illegal régime in Rhodesia that they are going to have full integration with regard to housing, schools and hospitals, that they are going to reform the Land Act and are initiating a general election with one man one vote, I suggest to the Minister that he render facile the availability of passports for all Irish citizens living in Rhodesia.  We have seen the Minister's sincerity with regard to upholding the United Nations mandatory sanctions but what about our neighbour the UK, who, in a matter of months after the initiating of those sanctions, knew they were being broken? Has the Minister familiarised himself with the Bingham Report presented to the UK Government?  In the light of the fact that the UN resolution responsible for these mandatory sanctions must be renewed in the near future and because a country who allegedly supported those sancions wilfully and knowingly broke them, is the Minister once again going to <Col N="328" /> bring the Department, and the country, along like sheep, following one another?</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for many years about our hospitality to and the way we appear to go out of our way at official level to visitors from Communist countries.</P>

      <P>The Chair allowed the Deputy to raise this question and I would ask him to stay within the terms of it.  He is rambling away from it.  The question deals with the issue of passports to Irish citizens in Rhodesia and the Deputy should stay on that topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the 8,000 Irish citizens in Rhodesia will not be able to obtain Irish passports because of the misinterpretation of the UN sanctions which have been broken by other countries.  The Department wishes to appear to be the prize lamb by sticking to the letter of the law.  The Department's approach to this issue is cumbersome, bureaucratic, over-elaborate and does not work.  Our Department are not giving to our citizens in Rhodesia, whether they want to be there or not, the full facilities they need to obtain Irish passports, in a state which is under siege, and the Department do not have any contingency plans for the evacuation of our citizens should conditions deteriorate even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a twofold concept involved in denying Irish citizens Irish passports. One encourages them to dig in deeper and turn their backs on their homeland. As the Minister said in the last sentence of the second paragraph of his reply, in this connection it has been the policy of successive Irish Governments not to grant passport facilities to persons whose activities further or encourage the unlawful actions of the illegal régime in Rhodesia.  We have seen the humbug associated with these sanctions.  I call on the Minister to expedite any passport applications that are pending, to do away with the bureaucracy surrounding them, to do away with the over-elaborate mechanism for processing these applications and to give those Irish people their entitlement.  Because they live there does not mean they support apartheid or that <Col N="329" /> they are supporting the unlawful activities of an alleged illegal régime.  I ask the Minister to grasp this nettle firmly and help those citizens.</P>
    <P>If I or any other Irish person goes abroad with an Irish passport and it expires while I am abroad, I have always believed that, providing my conduct has been reasonably good, I can re-apply by post and have it brought up to date.  The sanctions being brought in by the Minister are one-sided.  I appeal to him to urgently consider doing away with unnecessary red tape and with any bias that may be felt towards people who, by virtue of geography, are hindered from obtaining these passports.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I quote again what the Minister said, that is, that it has been the policy of successive Irish Governments not to grant passport facilities to persons whose activities further or encourage the unlawful actions of the illegal régime in Rhodesia.  That covers a multitude.  It cannot be defined exactly.  Hence it is bureaucratic, cumbersome and over-elaborate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate that this is not a decision by this or any previous Government which we of our own judgment decided to impose on Rhodesia. This is a decision of the Security Council of the United Nations by which we as a member nation are bound.  Therefore it is not a question, as the Deputy seemed to imply towards the end of his contribution, of our being bureaucratic in respect of the sanctions and making judgments that are too severe.  These judgments were made not by us but by the family of the United Nations of a régime which has broken all the standards which we as a nation struggle for, and which many other nations are at present struggling for.  That judgment imposes on us an obligation that we should take all possible measures to prevent the entry into our territory of persons whom we have reason to believe have furthered or encouraged, or who are likely to further or encourage, the unlawful activities of the illegal régime&mdash;the illegal régime, note&mdash;in Southern Rhodesia or any activities which are calculated to evade any measure decided upon in resolution 253 <Col N="330" /> (1968) or resolution 232 (1966) of 16 December 1966.</P>
      <P>Second, the Deputy seems to think, and I accept that his questions were prompted by his concern for the interests and safety of those people, that there is some ambiguity in this.  I cannot imagine where that ambiguity lies.  I thought my answer to his question very clearly indicated that it had been the policy of successive Irish Governments not to grant passport facilities to persons whose activities further or encourage the unlawful actions of the illegal régime in Rhodesia.  Nevertheless every Irish citizen living abroad has a right of entry to this country.  That is an unqualified right.  I have always made it clear that any Irish person living in Rhodesia who wishes to settle in Ireland or leave Rhodesia permanently will be issued with an Irish passport in the usual way. If any ambiguity has arisen it is because the Deputy said that we were requiring a statement from these people that they would have to settle in Ireland permanently. What I said was that any citizen who wishes to settle in Ireland or leave Rhodesia permanently was entitled to an Irish passport.  We are not obliging them to stay in Ireland permanently.  I hope that point has been cleared up.</P>
      <P>I want to answer the specific questions raised by the Deputy before I deal with the principles involved.  He asked if I met deputations of Irish people in Rhodesia during the course of my recent visit to southern Africa and my answer is no.  No deputations were sought.  He mentioned that I met Irish groups in South Africa during my visit.  I want to clarify that point.  I know that the Deputy did not wish to imply that I was on a visit to South Africa.  To gain access and exit to and from Lesotho and Swaziland, which I had to do on three occasions because I had to return to Nairobi for President Kenyatta's funeral, I had to pass through South Africa.  I had the opportunity of speaking to some of our citizens there.  What I heard from them&mdash;people who were concerned about the future of all people in that part of Africa&mdash;was very disquieting and has since proved to be all too accurate.  I wanted to put that on the record in relation to my visit to Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> I hope the Deputy is aware of the fact that there is no question of these people living and working in Rhodesia having to give a guarantee that they will settle in Ireland permanently.  It is important to establish that they will be welcome at home with or without a passport because they have the right to come home.  The decisions here are not decisions taken by us but by the illegal Smith régime.  They are the ones who have put themselves outside of the court of the standards being applied by the United Nations.  I do not wish to make comments on other situations and other countries but I do say that we are bound by the mandatory sanctions of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which most of these people have in Rhodesia&mdash;I think the Deputy touched on it&mdash;is that if they leave Rhodesia apparently they will not be allowed to bring any of their possessions with them.  They will not be allowed to sell what they otherwise might sell and come home with sufficient money to set up in a new business.  I want to say that that is not a decision of this Government.  Apparently the position in Rhodesia is that as long as one stays one can literally live like a king&mdash;I think that is not overstating it&mdash;a white king but, as soon as one wants to leave, one must then revert to the role of pauper.  That is not a decision taken by this Government or by the United Nations. It is a decision which has been taken by the Smith régime and is not one over which we have any control, regrettable though it is.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that for those who wish to come home or to settle elsewhere they could do so with the security of finance or whatever else.  But it is not our Government that has the control over these things.  Perhaps those questions could be asked rather in Rhodesia than here.  Nonetheless let me say that obviously the Government are concerned to ensure to the extent that we possibly can, in the event of certain dangers arising in Rhodesia&mdash;and anything that has happened in recent weeks or months unfortunately is not in any way reassuring&mdash;the safety of our <Col N="332" /> citizens, as every other country must of theirs.  The Deputy will appreciate&mdash;though he has not even asked for this&mdash;that I could not disclose at this stage whatever tentative arrangements we have made already and discussions we are having with a view to trying to foresee or overcome the possibilities of danger that would arise in such an event. No Irish Minister&mdash;or Minister from any other Government for that matter&mdash;can guarantee at all times the safety of an Irish citizen wherever he happens to be.  Obviously that would be to ask the impossible.  Accordingly I cannot guarantee the safety of any Irish citizen wherever he happens to be any more than any other Foreign Minister can guarantee the safety of his citizen in another country.  What we can do is to ensure that if they wish to travel freely, provided they are adhering to the standards of the country in which they live, to the standards of international agreements and conventions, we will certainly give them that facility.</P>
    <P>That there is an unfortunate problem in Rhodesia is all to obvious; that it may get worse is a matter of great concern for all of us.  When the Deputy talks in terms of one man one vote in Rhodesia I have to say we are not debating the actual issue, that I think the Deputy is really going beyond the bounds of reality to imply that what we have now, or will have in the future, will be one man one vote of the kind that would enable the United Nations to lift the sanctions which have been imposed by way of mandatory obligation on Rhodesia.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on one or two other matters and, if I may, spell out for the benefit of the Deputy and all who may be concerned the position as I have stated in my reply but also, if necessary, to add somewhat to it.  If there are other countries which, for reasons best known to themselves, have not adhered to the standards expected of countries who are members of the United Nations and who have not applied consistently these sanctions that, I would suggest, is a matter for those countries to consider and answer for themselves and to their own public as well as to the international community.  Surely it is not being suggested that, if there are countries that <Col N="333" /> have failed to meet standards internationally accepted, the rest of us who try to be consistent should lower our standards or ask the United Nations to lower theirs.  I can assure the Deputy that I will not under any circumstances ask the United Nations to change its position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Rhodesia.  I would hope that perhaps developments there, on the basis of constitutional proposals that were being proposed, would enable Rhodesia to enable the United Nations to change its position on these sanctions.</P>

      <P>Firstly, the Minister is aware that I did mention contingency plans.  Secondly, the Minister mentioned in his reply people permanently leaving Rhodesia.  In those circumstances, how does a citizen indicate to the Minister's Department that they are permanently leaving a country?  What type of document would be accepted by the Minister's Department prior to the issuing of the passport?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Here it is a matter of trust and good faith.  If I may deal with that issue: in regard to any Irish person who wishes to settle in Ireland, or otherwise leave Rhodesia permanently, I would suspect that if they wish to settle <Col N="334" /> in Ireland they are welcome to come here without passports.  If they formally indicate to us that they are leaving Rhodesia permanently&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; they are going to leave Rhodesia permanently then certainly I think we could consider the application favourably.  In the final analysis it is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the advice of his Department, to use his discretion in relation to the circumstances under which the passport will issue.  But let me make this clear: we would have to consider all the circumstances to feel satisfied, as one reasonably could, that that in fact was the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would they have to produce documents such as those required for the United States, an employer in New Zealand and a guarantor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously matters of that sort that would confirm that they had this intention.  I want to say in relation to all this that, as the Deputy will be aware, one of the problems is that there is compulsory military service in Rhodesia.  Anybody who is there between the ages of 18 and 50 is thereby obliged&mdash;and again this is not our rule&mdash;to serve in the army of the Rhodesian illegal régime.  We do not issue pass ports to anybody who serves in the army of any state other than our own.  Secondly, we certainly do not do it in respect of an illegal régime.  It is because of the regulations which have been introduced by that régime that we are not in a position to issue passports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to make it clear, that those Irish citizens&mdash;and many of those who are entitled to citizenship are so entitled by virtue of being the children or grandchildren of Irish citizens&mdash;who wish to come home to Ireland do not need passports.  For those who wish to apply for passports to come home on the basis of what the Deputy has mentioned, certainly we would look at that very <Col N="335" /> sympathetically.  For those who, for one reason or another, do not choose to do that but who choose to stay there for as long as they can, we are still considering our obligation to the extent that we can <Col N="336" /> in the event of a doomsday situation arising.</P>

      <P>In the event of an outbreak of rabies the primary responsibility for implementing the Rabies Order, 1976 rests with my Department.

    <P>My Department have already provided supplies of equipment for catching and holding suspected dogs and cats at each of the district veterinary offices throughout the country and at other centres.
