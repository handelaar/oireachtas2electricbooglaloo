    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 29:</P>
    <P>In page 16, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following proviso:</P>
    <P>Provided that the multiplier specified in the formula contained in section 21 (1) shall not be increased for the next two years of assessment following that year of assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I had almost finished what I wanted to say on this amendment.  If any Deputy has any further query on it I will endeavour to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister had started to reply to the point raised when the debate was adjourned yesterday. He got up very quickly now in the hope that we would not notice and that he would get away without replying to the points raised.  It was a <Col N="1035" /> good effort but not successful on this occasion.  Fortunately we got up in time this morning.</P>
      <P>The main point I was making in common with other Deputies was in relation to the Minister's attitude in requiring farmers who opt for the notional assessment to stay on it for three years regardless of what might happen on their own farms and, more important, regardless of the fact that the Minister might decide to increase the multiplier by a disproportionate amount, say, from 90 this year to 200 next year, regardless of the trend in agricultural incomes in the intervening period.  There could be a disportionate and unfair increase in the multiplier which would change all the calculations.</P>
      <P>If the Minister increased the multiplier without regard to what happened in terms of increases in agricultural incomes in that period, farmers on the notional would have to pay income tax based on a notional income which was far in excess of their actual income in the particular year.  Farmers are being asked to accept on faith that the Minister will not do this.  They are being asked to opt for the notional for three years and to stay on it without any assurance from the Minister that he will not increase the multiplier by an amount disproportionate to the average increase in agricultural incomes in the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister two questions. First, would he give an assurance that he will not increase the multiplier by a disproportionate amount and that any increase in the multiplier&mdash;and one cannot rule out an increase obviously &mdash;will bear a relationship to the average increase in agricultural incomes. That is a fair request and I should like to hear the Minister's point of view.  The second question is a little more important perhaps from the political point of view.  Is it the Minister's intention to do away altogether with the notional?  He referred to it as a concession.  He adopted a slightly cavalier attitude towards the arguments I have just outlined in saying: &ldquo;If the farmer does not like the notional he can always <Col N="1036" /> opt for accounts.  He does not have to go on to the notional.  If he does not like buying a pig in a poke, if he does not trust that I will not increase the multiplier by a disproportionate amount in the next three years, even though the farmer must stay on it for three years regardless of what I do, he has 30 days to make up his mind and he can decide to go on accounts and forget about the notional system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Given the imponderables the farmer is being asked to assess in this situation and given the apparent inability of the Minister to understand the difficulties that a farmer faces in making up his mind on this, it seems that the Minister is seeking to do away with the notional system by the back door and that his real intention is to make it so difficult and uncertain for farmers if they opt for the notional system that they will give up the ghost and say, &ldquo;Ah, forget about it, we will go on accounts.  That is what the Minister wants us to do&rdquo;.  If this is what the Minister really wants it is in considerable contrast to what the farmers were told about the Minister's party's attitude to farmer taxation during the general election campaign.  There is a phrase in the Fianna Fáil manifesto which refers to the Fianna Fáil notional income tax system.  They adopted the proprietorial adjective to describe the notional system that they were going to introduce.  This was not going to be just a modification of the system which obtained under the previous Minister for Finance.  No, it was going to be a Fianna Fáil notional system, thereby implying that this was an integral part of the Fianna Fáil approach to agriculture.  It was to be their own notional system, one which they held out to farmers as a particularly attractive aspect of their election programme.  They did not tell the farmers all the difficulties that might arise.  The Government's attitude indicates that, far from wishing to retain the notional system as they appear to do in their manifesto, and to make it their very own, they want to get rid of it entirely through the back door by putting farmers in the position that they have little or no choice but to opt for accounts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> I have already dealt with the arguments in favour of retaining a notional element within our farming taxation system.  They are, first of all, that a notional system of taxation exists for farmers in many continental countries. It exists in Germany and in France to the best of my knowledge.  The idea behind it is to optimise the output from the land because land is a unique asset in that it is strictly limited in supply.  Under a notional tax system, under which you pay a certain amount regardless of how well or how badly you work, you provide farmers with an incentive to produce more because they will not be penalised for producing more from each acre.  In an Irish context that means encouraging enterprises like dairying where the output per acre is high and where we as a country have a comparative advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other European countries where there are longer winters, higher feeding costs during the winter, and where dairying is much more marginal than it is here.  The notional system suits dairying and has been opted for, I would say, although I have no figures to quote, in large measure by dairy farmers.  The most intensive form of agriculture in this country is dairying.</P>
    <P>The notional system provides an incentive to production per acre.  That is the nub of the argument.  Yet it seems that the Minister by the attitude he is now adopting wants to get farmers off the notional system because he is providing them with no answer to the very genuine problems they are facing. I would like his answer on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have already said on at least two occasions in response to Deputy Bruton that it is impossible for me to give an undertaking in regard to the level of the multiplier at this time.  It is a matter that has to be determined at budget time in relation to the level of what I might call the agricultural index.  Deputy Bruton understands that as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to his second point concerning the abolition of the notional system, if I had wanted to abolish the notional system I would have done so. On the contrary&mdash;one would never suspect this from listening to Deputy <Col N="1038" /> Bruton&mdash;it was his party in Government who were phasing out the notional system from the point of view in certain circumstances of a Minister for Finance and of a farmer.  It is a system that is not available to any other kind of taxpayer and in that sense it is a concession.  The option is open to any farmer to go for the accounts system which corresponds with that applying to other taxpayers.  I repeat that in so far as there was any question of phasing out of the notional system, Deputy Bruton's party were doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can the Minister give any undertaking as to the level of the multiplier in the years ahead?  Does he not think it unfair to ask the farming community to enter into a contract, so to speak, for three years on the notional system when they have no idea as to what tax they will have to pay?  It appears that his answer to that is, &ldquo;OK, they have the accounts system&rdquo;.  Bearing in mind that tax is new to the farming community and with a sizeable proportion of that community over the age of 55 years it is impossible to get them to accept the accounts system.  I agree with an accounts system because such a system is important for other than tax purposes. The fact remains that you will not get a farming community to accept the accounts system overnight.  The Minister's answer is not valid.  The Minister cannot give any indication as to the level of the multiplier over the next three years, yet he is asking farmers to commit themselves to accepting the notional system for that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, on a television programme recently expressed what he said was his personal view, that farmers should pay more tax.  I would take this to mean that the multiplier over the next three years would be increased. I ask the Minister to bear in mind, first of all, that the valuation system on which the notional system is based is totally out-dated and unfair. Because the farming community will not readily accept an accounts system the Minister should give some commitment over the next three years if <Col N="1039" /> he is asking them to tie themselves to that system.  Does the Minister accept that it is most unfair to tie farmers to a system of that kind?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not accept that and I have already dealt with the point in the course of the debate.  No taxpayer knows what his liability is going to be over the next two or three years.  It has been argued that he knows at least what the tax rate is going to be, but of course he does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is not what was argued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Tax rates may change. What is involved here is the notional level of the income.  If a farmer wants to be taxed exactly on his income with all the appropriate allowances he can go on the accounts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is not a valid answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister will not let him opt for the accounts system next year if he goes on the notional system this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will not agree to a farmer switching from accounts to the notional system and thereby avoiding any liability for tax.  Is Deputy Bruton advocating that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: If he is not advocating it that point is of no value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the farmer has not an income&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy is merely making a debating point.  He does not mean it, obviously.  As far as a farmer on the notional system is concerned, the notional system determines for the purpose of income tax what his income is.  If he opts for the notional system it is reasonable to assume that he does so because he believes that under it his notional income will be less than his actual income.  As far as the multiplier is concerned I am sure Deputy Creed is aware of the fact that the multiplier, even as increased this <Col N="1040" /> year, is considerably below its true value.  It would be a reasonable assumption for any farmer to make that whatever level the multiplier might be fixed at it would not be fixed beyond its true value.  That is self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is that an assurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>: Regardless of the circumstances of the farmer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes.  If the Deputies opposite would contemplate fixing it beyond its true value they should say so but it seems to be self-evident that it would not be fixed beyond its true value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is something that was there all the time for anybody who was interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is the first time the Minister has given that assurance and I am glad he has done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy knows that he was painting a picture of something that would not happen when he talked about a Minister for Finance, whoever that might be, arbitrarily fixing the value of the multiplier above its true value.  I do not believe the Minister for Finance of the Deputy's party would contemplate that kind of situation.  I do not think my predecessor, for all his faults, would have contemplated that. If Deputy Bruton would contemplate it, the country is fortunate that it is unlikely for some time to come that he will be determining this matter.  In the absence of ideas of this kind being imposed by people like Deputy Bruton I believe that reasonable people will see for themselves that there is no likelihood of the multiplier being increased beyond its true value.  The level at which it would be fixed is, obviously, one that cannot be announced in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any farmer who is contemplating the notional system obviously has to take into account the possibility that it could be increased, but he does not know at this stage, and neither do I, <Col N="1041" /> what the true value of the multiplier will be next year, not to mention the year after.  There is nothing one can do about giving a firm assurance to anybody who wants to go on the notional system as to what the value of the multiplier will be next year or the year after.  In the nature of things that has to be that way.  I have already indicated that people who want to go on the notional system have, particularly as a result of the Bill, a number of concessions involved in the form of deductions from the notional income but if they feel that this would not be in their interests they are entitled to opt for the accounts system.  As a matter of interest in 1976-77 more than 60 per cent of farmers opted for the accounts system which may suggest something to Deputies.  It is clear that the proposal in this amendment is one that could not be accepted by any Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Last night I asked the Minister about section 416 of the Income Tax Act and I do not believe he replied to that question.  I do not think the Minister appreciates how nervous a lot of farmers who have medium to large sized farms are about the fact that he is the Minister who is introducing this notional system that will hold for three years.  They all remember that he was the Minister who raised the income tax level to 80 per cent, the highest it ever was here.  It was his successor who brought that level down to 60 per cent.  That is why farmers are nervous of the present occupant of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sure they remember that he and his colleagues were phasing out the notional system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: As Minister for Finance Deputy Colley imposed a penal taxation on farmers.  Under him 80 per cent of their income was taken away in the form of tax and the farming community are afraid that something similar will happen when he gets his hands on some of their money. They are afraid that he will lower the valuation and increase the multiplier until he gets to a figure equivalent to 80 per cent of their income, as he did with the ordinary PAYE taxpayer.  If <Col N="1042" /> the circumstances of a farmer who opts for the notional system this year change next year can be use the machinery under section 416 of the Income Tax Act to appeal that assessment for tax in the second and third year?  The Minister for Agriculture on television recently felt that more farmers should pay tax and in this connection I should like to know what the position will be if the valuation level is reduced resulting in more farmers being brought into the tax net.  Will they be in for two years or will they have three years also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are dealing with farmers who are liable to income tax and not with any notional scenario with regard to the liability of farmers who are not liable for tax.  I dealt with the question of an appeal last night. An election for the notional system is treated as an appeal against an assessment which is originally made on the accounts basis.  Having made that election as the Bill stands a farmer is obliged to stay with the notional system for three years.  Subject to the discussions that are taking place between the Revenue Commissioners and the farming organisations, the position of the farmer on the notional system for the three years will be that he cannot, because his income drops, change to the accounts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand that but if he opts for the notional system can he use section 416?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: He can appeal on the basis that he has been wrongly assessed under the notional system or not allowed the allowances or deductions he felt he was entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is my view that under section 416 one is allowed to appeal against the level of assessment and one can dispute the fact that one was earning X amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: If he has opted for the notional system he is not entitled to appeal on the grounds that his actual income is different from that deemed to be his under the notional system. That is the whole basis of the notional system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1043" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Even though the circumstances would have changed in years two and three?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  That would effectively mean that he is switching to the accounts system.  Subject to what emerges from these discussions, what is contemplated is to provide the machinery to enable the farmer to switch to the accounts system if there was a very substantial drop in his income as a result of disease or for some other reason.  As the discussions have not yet produced anything&mdash;and I do not think they will produce anything earlier than the autumn&mdash;I cannot be more specific.  I am anxious to indicate the kind of thing that is contemplated so that there will be no misunderstanding of the circumstances in which it will operate.  It would involve a substantial drop in the income of the farmer concerned. It does not relate to the level of the multiplier, which is a matter of general application, but to the individual circumstances of the farmer concerned.  As they would be circumstances of considerable hardship, I would contemplate an arrangement whereby a farmer who has opted for the notional system would be allowed to change to the accounts system. Subject to that, it would not be open to a farmer who has opted for the notional system to change to the accounts system for a period of three years.  The allowance of such a procedure for switching from one to the other from year to year is a certain recipe for tax avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister said that a farmer on the notional system could change midstream, so to speak, if his herd became diseased and he had to sell them at an obvious loss of income.  There are more difficult cases of hardship such as a farmer dying and his widow having to take over. Does it only apply to disease in the herd or does it apply to other circumstances in which a farmer could produce evidence of loss of income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not in a position to spell this out because it has not happened yet.  Anything arising out of <Col N="1044" /> it would involve an amendment next year.  The principle governing the discussions will be to give an option to somebody who is tied to the notional system for three years in circumstances of a considerable drop in income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would it not be a hardship if the multiplier was increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>: The multiplier is the figure by which the rateable valuation is multiplied.  The Minister says that that figure will not be set beyond its true value.  Farmers will have to decide within 30 days whether or not to opt for this system without any knowledge of what the multiplier will be in future years.  The only assurance we have got from the Minister after a lengthy discussion is that it is self-evident that the multiplier will not be increased beyond its true value.  As farmers will have to make up their minds on the basis of the Minister's statement, what the Minister says and what he means are going to count.  My interpretation of the multiplier or of the notional system is of no relevance to farmers at this time. I am not going to be determining the multiplier or the notional next year or the year after.  Therefore it is a question the Minister should answer seeing that the farmers will have to make up their minds within 30 days whether or not to opt for the notional system on the basis of the Minister's statement that it is self-evident that it will not be increased beyond its true value.</P>

If next year the Minister changes the threshold from 60 to 50 it will bring a large number of farmers into the taxation net who will have to opt for the notional or the accounts system. <Col N="1047" /> Is the Minister telling us that a farmer coming into the taxation net, having to make up his mind for the first time, would understand the Minister saying that the multiplier would not be increased beyond its true value?

      <P>: There is absolutely no necessity to keep anything going. There are two questions here.  For the sake of argument I am prepared to accept the Minister's statement that neither he, nor any other Minister for Finance would increase the multiplier beyond its true value.  But he made another statement, which was if I heard him correctly&mdash;that the multiplier at present was below its true value.  Might I ask the Minister by what process of ratiocination he arrived at that conclusion because the processes of thought which led him to that conclusion must have involved a comparison between the present value of the multiplier and its real value.  If he does not know or cannot tell us what one of these is how did he arrive at that conclusion?</P>

I suppose he has a lot to read and I do not blame him for not reading everything, but I thought at least he would have had a rough idea of the true value of the multiplier and how it is arrived at.

I believe that he has been trying either to muddy the waters or simply to filibuster and that if Deputy Bruton does not know he ought to consult with a number of <Col N="1049" /> farmers, neighbours of his, who will give him a lesson on how the multiplier is worked out and their views on how it should be worked out.  I think also that Deputy Bruton now is endeavouring to confuse the issue as far as he can but I do not think he will succeed in convincing people, particularly the farmers, that suddenly he and his colleagues have changed their spots.  The farmers know that they were the people trying to get rid of the notional system on which they are now trying to elaborate and so on.  They had the chance to do it and they did not.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow depreciation of machinery as an alternative to contractors' fees in the notional system.  It is not proposed that farmers should be able to claim full contractors' fees and depreciation, or a mixture of both.  It is merely proposed that they must be able to opt for <Col N="1050" /> one or the other.  At present the concession being given, incorporating contractors' fees as one item which may be set against the notional income, has a slightly anomalous effect if a man gets in a contractor to do his work for him.  In view of the large value of contractors' machinery nowadays their fees involve perhaps quite a substantial element of depreciation of that machinery because it is wearing down very fast.</P>
    <P>We all know from experience how often these machines break down, how quickly they become either obsolete or worn out.  Therefore there is an element of depreciation of the contractors' machinery in the fee being charged to the farmer.  The fact that a farmer can, if you like, indirectly claim that depreciation on the notional system if he uses a contractor whereas he cannot do it if he uses his own machinery seems to me to create an anomaly which makes it much more attractive for the farmer to use contractors' than have his own machinery. Many farmers may have their own machinery or engage in farming in a way that they feel having their own machinery is the right approach.  It would seem to me that giving them the option of depreciation or contractors' fees, as we suggest in this amendment, is a reasonable suggestion which I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The notional system provides for certain deductions; it does not allow for others.  The deductions to be allowed in the notional system cannot be viewed in isolation from the level of the multiplier.  The multiplier is fixed having regard to a number of factors which include the kinds of deductions which may be made.  I am speaking of the statutory multiplier.  The matter of allowing the fees of agricultural contractors is primarily because I believe that the operations of agricultural contractors should be encouraged.  The idea of farmers spending a great deal of money and tying up a great deal of capital in machinery for which they have relatively little use in so far as they confine its use to their own land is obviously uneconomic from <Col N="1051" /> their point of view and from the national point of view and consequently the use of agricultural contractors is something to be encouraged.</P>
      <P>If, however, a farmer is in a position where he is on the notional system but it is economic for him to make heavy investment in machinery for his own use and he feels that he should be allowed the depreciation charge, he can of course opt for the accounts system and get the same depreciation allowances as other taxpayers or traders.  It seems likely that most people who would be on the notional system would be inclined to use and should be encouraged to use agricultural contractors rather than invest heavily in machinery.  Both from the general policy point of view and from the point of view of the specific issues involved in settling the level of the multiplier, it seems that the present position&mdash;the position as outlined in the Bill&mdash;is more satisfactory than the one which would obtain if we accepted these amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 17, lines 53 and 54, to delete &ldquo;but not including&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;and includes the conveyance on or off the land of goods or animals but does not include&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides that deductions will be allowed to farmers using the notional basis of assessment in respect of payments made to agricultural contractors for the conveyance on or off the land of goods or animals. Under the terms of the new section 21 of the Finance Act, 1974, which is now being inserted by section 13 of this Bill, an allowance is to be granted under the notional system of assessment for payments made by farmers to agricultural contractors for agricultural work performed by them on the farmers' land.  The conveyance of animals or goods, particularly off the land, cannot be said to be covered by the definition of agricultural work, which speaks of work forming an integral part of the cultivation of <Col N="1052" /> farmland or the harvesting of the produce of such land.  The amendment ensures that such expenditure will be deductible on the notional basis of assessment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 59, after &ldquo;1967&rdquo; to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and shall include contributions towards a pension fund for the employees concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to seek clarification rather than change the provisions of the Bill.  As I understand it, wages are allowed as a deduction against the notional system; but there are some farmers who are doing something which is desirable and should be encouraged, namely, contributing towards a pension fund for their employees. It is important that such contributions, as they are in effect part of wages, should be deductible also. The Minister may be able to tell me that this is implied in the definition of W in line 20.  If it is and if the Minister can assure me of that, I do not see any need to press this amendment. I should like to have clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I cannot give the Deputy that assurance.  The purpose of the amendment appears to be to extend the definition of emoluments to include contributions made by a farmer to a pension fund in respect of an employee for whom he is claiming a deduction under the notional system of assessment. &ldquo;Emoluments&rdquo; is defined in section 110 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, as meaning anything assessable to income tax under Schedule E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, the amendment is seeking the granting of a further deduction on the notional basis.  As I have said in relation to another amendment, the deductions to be allowed on the notional basis must be looked at in relation to the level of the multiplier.  If a farmer wants to claim deductions for items such as this or any others which are not included in the formula laid down for deduction on the notional system, then it is open to him to lodge accounts and go on the accounts basis and claim <Col N="1053" /> deductions, including deductions for contributions to approved superannuation funds for employees, as provided in the Income Tax Act.  If he does that, he will be able to claim deductions and relief on the same basis as any other person engaged in trade or business.  While he is on the notional system the deductions allowable have to be considered in conjunction with the multiplier.  It is a notional system and different from the ordinary accounts system.  In so far as this amendment would involve extension of the items which may be deducted under the notional system, I cannot accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sorry that the Minister has not changed the situation. He has explained it in a way which I did not understand.  I thought the amendment was not really necessary, but obviously it is.  From the social point of view I feel that the creation of pension funds for farm employees should be actively encouraged because, like everybody else, farm workers must retire at some stage and it is important that there should be a pension fund available for them.  Their employers have a responsibility to create such a pension fund.  The Minister would be doing a good day's work which would not cost a great deal of money if he were to accept this amendment.  It would be encouraging a proper and responsible approach on the part of farmers towards the retirement and security in retirement of their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the farmers on the notional system will probably be the more intensive farmers, they are more likely to have employees than are farmers for whom the accounts system is more appropriate.  Therefore, the question of having a pension fund for such employees is relatively more important in respect of farmers on the notional system.  While farmers on the accounts system have an incentive to create a pension fund, it now appears that farmers on the notional system do not.  This is an anomaly which could have a bad effect in the long run and I would ask the Minister to take another look at this.  I do not think that accepting this amendment would cost very much money and I <Col N="1054" /> would be interested if the Minister could give an estimate of the cost. Perhaps the Minister would consider this before Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would not disagree with the proposition that this kind of activity should be encouraged and, as I have indicated and the Deputy accepts, it is encouraged under the accounts system.  I have not figures available as to what the cost of this would be, the reason being that the actual calculation of the multiplier is mathematically affected by items of this kind.  If this were to be allowed the calculation of the multiplier would be affected.  To accept that, therefore, would mean changing the multiplier. So, the Deputy will see that it is not something I can contemplate with equanimity but I shall certainly look at it with sympathy between now and next year so that if it is being allowed the necessary calculations can be made in calculating the multiplier for next year.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 12 to 16 and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(III) (A)  has, in respect of that person, paid employment contributions (within the meaning of the Social Welfare Act, 1952) for the period or periods during which the said person was employed by him in that year, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(B)  in a case where such employment contributions are not payable by the individual in respect of that person by reason of the employment of the said person being an employment specified in or by regulations under Part II of the First Schedule to the said Social <Col N="1055" /> Welfare Act, 1952, has employed that person on a full-time basis throughout the year for the purpose of working the farm land occupied by the said individual, has paid wages to that person in respect of such employment and, in relation to that person, has complied with the employment regulation orders under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1976, in force during that year which would apply if the person were an agricultural worker (within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act, 1976),</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for deduction under the notional basis of assessment in respect of payments made by a farmer to members of his family for work done on the farm. Deputies will be aware that there was a provision of this kind before and I presume they will be aware that it was abused to the extent that many farmers, by a strange coincidence, seemed to be paying sums to their relatives which just equalled the level at which that relative would, if paid any more, become liable for income tax.  It had to be stopped.  It was stopped and as this Bill stands, without this amendment, it does not make any provision for this kind of deduction. But after considerable discussion and examination of the situation I decided that it is possible to meet the case where legitimate payments are made without abuse arising and the method provided for doing it in this amendment is to allow the deduction provided the member of the family concerned works on the farm full-time and is paid at least the minimum agricultural wage.  On that basis I think it is possible to avoid the abuse.  I suppose it is obvious that in such circumstances the person receiving a wage will be liable to income tax.  That will establish a degree of control that would not arise if we did not have this provision.  I believe that the allowance should be made but it should not be open to abuse and I hope this amendment will achieve both these aims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 22, after &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or for any previous financial year in which rates had been paid which had not been set-off against an income tax payment to the extent that they had not been so set-off.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make the system more equitable in view of the fact that by virtue of the agricultural grant changes that have been made recently farmers' rates in some cases have been doubled or more.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> for this doubling of farmers' rates while the rates of many other people apart from commercial people have been abolished, was that they could set off these rates against their income tax. <Col N="1058" /> This doubling of rates applies only to farmers who are within the income tax net.  The problem is that farm income is very variable.  The allowance does not take effect until about 18 months after the rates have been paid. That is another defect in the system. It may well be that a farmer paid a very substantial amount of rates in 1978, but when he would come to pay income tax on 1 January 1980 in respect of the 1979-80 year, which is the year in which he would be able to set off his 1978 rates against his income tax, because that was a bad year and he had not earned an income which would put him in the tax net he would not get any benefit from the ability to set off his 1978 rates against his income because his income for that year was not taxable, or his income could be such that he only needed to use part of the rates he had paid in 1978 to put him outside the tax net.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 is to meet that situation, so that, if in 1980 a farmer finds he does not need to use the very substantial increased rates he paid in 1978 to put himself outside the tax net because he has not earned the income, this can be kept on credit for him and he can use it against his income for 1980-81 or some subsequent year. In this way the farmer will not lose the value of the concession simply by the accident that in one year in maybe five he does not have a taxable income, that rates paid 18 months previously cannot be set against it because of the way the section is drafted at the moment.  This is a fair proposal which I hope the Minister will accept. From the point of view of the Exchequer it has the merit that, if the farmer does not need to set off his rates against his income tax, the Exchequer will have the use of the money. The farmer will not receive any interest on the money; it will be an allowance stored up for him and any interest to be derived from the money will go to the Exchequer.  This is not a profligate proposal but merely one which allows something which the Minister concedes ought to be allowed to be deferred, if it is necessary to use it, and it would avoid injustice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> Amendment No. 40 is designed to deal with a farmer who has another trade or profession, not a farmer with another permanent fulltime pensionable job.  It is to deal with the small agricultural contractor or shopkeeper, who is quite common in rural Ireland. Without such farmers acting as shopkeepers and contractors these facilities would not exist, because in many parts the demand for these facilities is not great and nobody could hope to make a living from providing them.  The services provided by the small agricultural contractor and shopkeeper, as the Minister acknowledged in an earlier discussion, ought to be encouraged. However, the position is that both these people within the meaning of finance legislation will not be able to avail of the concession of setting off their rates against their income tax, nothwithstanding the fact that if they have a valuation in excess of £60 this year their rates were doubled and in some cases were more than doubled.</P>
    <P>A full-time farmer or a farmer with a full-time pensionable job can set off his rates against his income tax.  My amendment is designed to cater for a limited category of cases.  It does not envisage that a large builder who is also a farmer, who is earning twice as much from his building business as he is from his farm, will get the concession of setting off his rates against his income tax.  I propose that if his income from the trade or profession is less than half his income from farming he will be able to get the concession in relation to setting off his rates against his income tax.  The trade or profession must be very much a subsidiary activity.  This is a reasonable amendment towards which the Minister would have no innate hostility.  I hope the Minister will be able to see his way to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will deal with my amendment first.  Amendment No. 39 rewrites subsection (2) of the new section providing a credit for rates.  The purpose of the subsection is to exclude from the provision of the credit for rates, firstly, farmers with another trade or profession and, secondly, those entitled to marginal relief.  Those <Col N="1060" /> entitled to marginal relief with valuations in the range from £60 to £69 will get the appropriate credit for rates by means of a formula adopted in the new section 19 which provides for marginal relief.  Subsection (2), as it stands, excludes marginal relief cases not alone from the credit position but from the prohibition of the deduction of rates in computing income.  If we left this uncorrected this would result in farmers in the valuation range from £60 to £69 being entitled to both a deduction and a credit for rates.  The amendment corrects this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's description of amendment No. 38 seems to be quite different from how it appears to me. From my point of view the purpose of this amendment is to provide for a carry forward of credit for rates where the amount of rates paid in the previous financial year exceeded the amount of tax charged on full-time farmers in respect of the profits or gains from farming but, since there was no credit for rates prior to 1978-79, acceptance of this amendment would mean a farmer could claim credit for so much of all of his rates paid in years prior to 1977 as would cancel out his income tax liability. This totally nullifies the provisions extending income tax to full-time farmers and so I could not accept that this is a reasonable proposition.</P>
      <P>With regard to No. 40, the purpose of this amendment is, as Deputy Bruton, I think, said, to provide a credit for rates in the case of farmers carrying on another trade or profession &mdash;they are farmers to whom section 16 of the Finance Act, 1974, applies&mdash; provided that the income from the other trade or profession is less than one half of farming profits. from the profession of other trade is less than one half of farming profits. The farming profits of individuals to whom that section applies are computed in the same way as profits from any other trade.  Therefore, a farmer to whom section 16 applies&mdash;in other words, one who is carrying on a profession or another trade&mdash;is entitled to a deduction as distinct from a credit in the computation of his farming profits in respect of his rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> We know that prior to 1974 there were a number of examples of people engaged in business and professions who were escaping from tax liability on their non-farming profits by attributing such profits, or part of such profits, to farming and section 16 of the 1974 Act was introduced as an antievasion measure.  If we accepted this amendment No. 40, I am afraid we would be restoring to a great extent the pre-1974 facility such people had for evading tax on their non-farming profits because, of course, what they would tend to do would be to inflate their farming profits so that the tax they should pay would be sufficient to absorb the whole of the rates by way of credit and, by doing this, they would effectively avoid liability for tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: They would inflate their farming profits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes, to the level whereby it would take the whole of the rates credit to absorb it.  They would inflate them by putting in as farming profits, profits derived from another occupation. That is what was done before and there is no reason to think it would not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  Since there was no tax on farming profits before 1974 they inflated their farming profits by attributing to farming profits they derived from another business or occupation and did not pay tax on them and what would happen here would be that they would attribute to farming their profits from another business or occupation in order to set them off against rates and, while it might not be as bad as the situation I described, I am afraid it would be getting close to it and defeating the object of the anti-avoidance provisions of section 16 of the 1974 Act.  I could not, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is correct, I am. I am getting help from the Minister. That is wonderful.  I would like to see this operating.  While not operating retrospectively in relation to rates paid prior to 1978, I would like to see a provision along the lines I have mentioned operating forward into the eighties.  The Minister's criticism of the amendment as at present drafted would not apply to an amendment which was redrafted to have that more limited effect.  I hope to be able to do that between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will concede that there are a substantial number of farmers who are carrying out small non-farming trades or professions which are socially beneficial.  While nobody wishes to facilitate the type of evasion of tax he mentioned, I would ask him to consider, if not accepting my amendment which proposes that the trade or profession must be less than half in terms of income of the farm income, accepting an amendment if the figure were a quarter, or something like that, in order to provide for <Col N="1063" /> the cases where the trade or profession is genuinely subsidiary to the farm and in no sense could the farm be used in the manner he described for tax avoidance.  Would he be prepared to consider an amendment along those lines?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would have some difficulty in doing so because it seems that the main point about the proposals involved in these amendments for rates is that they are equating rates with income tax.  This would mean that not alone would the rates be set against the current charge to tax but they would wipe out future liability to tax.  In effect we would end up with a situation where we would be having claim for refunds wherever the rates exceed the tax.  The overall effect would be that we would be repaying part of the rates paid in any year by way of a refund of income tax.  That is the basic effect of approaching the rates position as it is approached in these two amendments.  The Deputy will understand that I cannot accept that approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1978 made last week by the Minister for Industry, Commerce <Col N="1064" /> and Energy under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  This order extends for another year a statutory ban on the operation of company-owned motor spirit stations by oil companies.  The order was due to expire shortly.</P>
    <P>I have extended the order to allow the Restrictive Practices Commission time to carry out a general review of the various orders made regulating the supply and distribution of motor spirit and motor vehicle lubricating oil and also to allow them to look into certain related issues.</P>
    <P>The first inquiry into the trade under the fair trading legislation was in 1960.  It was concerned principally with examining the merits of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system&mdash;the system under which a retailer undertakes to handle one brand of motor spirit exclusively. It found that the system had certain merits but needed to be regulated because of its tendency to encourage an excessive number of petrol retail outlets. An order to regulate the system was made by the Minister in 1961 and shortly afterwards the Fair Trade Commission and the petrol companies reached agreement on certain guiding principles designed to limit the increase in outlets.</P>
    <P>There was concern throughout the sixties that the guiding principles were not having their intended effect of limiting the number of outlets and that the regulation of the solus system was leading companies to increase the number of directly operated outlets. At the Minister's request, the commission held an inquiry into this growth in outlets in 1970.</P>
    <P>In their report, the Restrictive Practices Commission argued that the extension of control by the oil companies over the retail market by means of company-operated stations needed to be curbed in the public interest as they felt that this development would lead to dominance by the oil companies over the retail trade and increase the risk of such restrictive practices as price fixing and market-sharing. An order to halt this development for a three-year trial period was made in 1972.  It was reviewed in 1975 by the commission and on their <Col N="1065" /> recommendation extended for another three years until the summer of 1978.</P>
    <P>Following their 1975 review, the commission had suggested that when next they would review the ban they should also review the orders as a whole.  During that review they also received representations on matters relevant to the orders which their terms of reference did not allow them to consider.  I have decided that they should be free to consider other matters germane to the orders.  I have also decided that they should look into a matter which has been the source of grievance to some people in the trade for a number of years.  I am referring to the agreements under which persons who are not the company's employees operate their stations under licence.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 I have asked the examiner to transmit my request to the commission to hold an inquiry under the terms of reference that I have mentioned.  The extension of the order will give the commission the time needed to do this.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill now before the Dáil is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the order.  The order, however, may not be amended but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.</P>
    <P>This is an uncontroversial measure and I have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome this Bill which, as the Minister has said, is uncontroversial. I ask the Minister once again to facilitate those interested in these orders by making some effort at consolidation.  This is a measure to facilitate the commission to carry out a comprehensive review and to give them extra time to do so because under the last order their time will be running out shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said, there are areas in this industry which need to be looked at in depth.  In the third paragraph of her statement she said the Bill would allow the commission <Col N="1066" /> to look into &ldquo;certain related issues&rdquo;. I do not know what these issues are but I would hope the commission would go into matters other than the location and number of retail outlets. As I mentioned last week in relation to the order concerning the grocery trade, there is a danger&mdash;I do not think it is imminent but it is always in the background&mdash;that, because of the volume of oil sold here in relation to the overall volume sold by the companies worldwide, the companies through agreement might begin to fix prices and create a monopoly situation and the end result would be that purchasers of oil, car users, would suffer.</P>
    <P>Because of the smallness of the Irish market in the context of the worldwide volume of oil sold by these multinational companies, there is that danger.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to facilitate the people interested in these orders by consolidating the orders.  This order amends two orders, statutory instrument No. 150 of 1972 and statutory Instrument No. 121 of 1975.  There is no reference to the amended statutory instruments in this Bill.  Last week in relation to the grocery order I said it would be more practical to have these orders consolidated for cross-checking and reference purposes.</P>

However, I feel we should wait until such time as this inquiry has been completed. He asked what the other related matters are and I refer him to the report of the special review carried out by the commission in 1975.  In the conclusions and recommendations paragraph of the report they stated there were various matters which they considered to have an indirect bearing on the operation of the order which at the time they did not have the power to investigate.  These matters will be investigated during this inquiry.  They relate to petrol outlets in new suburbs and satellite towns, the effects of various types of agreements, the significance of <Col N="1067" /> promotional schemes, and hours of trading.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is desirable the inquiry be held as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment and passed.</P>

    <Title>Land Bond Bill, 1978: Second Stage .</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to increase from £60 million to £80 million the total amount of land bonds which may be created to pay for land acquired by the Land Commission.  The bonds are created from time to time by the Minister for Finance under Land Bond Orders which fix the rate of interest for each particular series. The most recent series bear interest at 12½ per cent and are redeemable in 32 years.  The existing limit of £60 million, which was fixed under the Land Bond Act 1975, has now been reached, and additional bonds are needed to ensure that there is no holdup in the current ongoing land settlement programme.</P>
      <P>In commending this Bill to the House, I should like to make it clear that the Government are not committing themselves to an indefinite continuation of existing land policy. Far from it.  As Deputies know, the Government have indicated already that they propose to reform land policy.  To this end, it was indicated in our election manifesto that we would establish a new land development authority which would be responsible for structural reform.  The Interdepartmental Committee on Land Structure Reform recently submitted their final report, which is at present being printed and will be published within a few weeks.  The whole position in regard to land policy, including the committee's report, is being examined currently by my Department, and I will be putting comprehensive proposals before the Government later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> These proposals will have to involve some fundamental changes in policy.  I think it is now generally accepted that the traditional land policy based on the acquisition and resale activities of the Land Commission is not suitable for the conditions of 1978 or the conditions that will exist in the years ahead.  This traditional policy was quite satisfactory for decades and has made its contribution to improving land structure.  But in recent years the pace of change has greatly accelerated and new measures are clearly required to cater for the altered situation.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture is on the move and the land of Ireland has acquired a new importance in the nation's economy.  The substantial increases in agricultural prices in the past six or seven years, coupled with the opening up of export market outlets, have completely revolutionised the agricultural scene and have brought a new era to rural Ireland.  One of the major results of these developments has been a sharp rise in the value of agricultural land.  At the same time, however, other factors have entered in to boost land prices to levels which are far beyond what is justified by normal farming returns.</P>
    <P>Inflation is one of these factors.  It may well be asked why people seeking a hedge against inflation should be allowed to force up the price of land to the point where the small- and medium-size family farmers have little or no possibility of getting a few extra acres, or at any rate getting them at some kind of reasonable price.  Far too many non-farmers have been using land as a safe haven for their excess money and have been doing so in a way which has brought little lasting benefit to the agricultural industry.  The speculator who purchases farm land is more interested in money profit than in developing the land and utilising it to the national advantage.</P>
    <P>Another factor which has been raising land prices has been the buying up of land by large farmers who have enough already, and in some cases more than enough land.  While I would have reservations about preventing a highly <Col N="1069" /> progressive farmer from adding to what may already be a substantial enterprise, I do not consider that he should be allowed to do so freely if the result of his action is to prevent some of his smaller neighbours from acquiring the extra acres that would make all the difference between struggling on an inadequate farm and reasonable comfort on a viable holding.</P>
    <P>In drawing up new policy proposals, my particular aim will be to help the expansion and development of small-and medium-size family farmers and to see how best they can be enabled to acquire some extra land where they need it.</P>
    <P>Much attention is always given to land provided through the Land Commission. This, however, represents a small proportion only of the changes of land ownership that take place. In any event, the escalation in the price of land must necessarily affect the volume of acquisitions by the Land Commission.  A price of £2,000 per acre, which is far from the top of the current price range, represents at present an annuity of over £250.  There is no general farm activity which would finance such an annuity.  If it is expected that the Exchequer should step in and meet a substantial part of the cost, it has to be remembered that the State's coffers are not overflowing and that the State just cannot expend ever-increasing amounts of taxpayer's money to compete with speculators.</P>
    <P>By far the most important channel through which farm land ownership changes is inheritance.  There is much to be said for encouraging earlier transfers within the family.  This, however, is a very sensitive area and it is necessary to be very careful in providing outside advice and encouragement. Associated with family transfers and inheritance is the question of retirement. The EEC Commission has put forward proposals for amending the Farm Retirement Directive, and these are being considered at official level in Brussels and will come before the Council of Ministers in due course. When considering farm inheritance and farm retirement, it is necessary to bear in mind how the whole picture has altered, not merely since the start <Col N="1070" /> of the seventies, but even in the past couple of years.  The value of the family farm can now be very substantial&mdash;well over £100,000 for even a modest holding.  The huge amount of capital now involved in a farm has implications for distributions among members of the family and in the years to come may well have a dramatic impact on inheritance and retirement practices within the family.</P>
    <P>Another major channel of change of land ownership is sale on the open market.  This, of course, is where the price factor really enters in.  From time to time, the purchase of some land by a non-national arouses considerable controversy, but I would suggest that the Irish speculators can have far more serious effects on our small- and medium-size farmers.  When such farmers see the land needed for viability gobbled up by someone who did not really need more land, it makes little difference whether the purchaser was foreign or Irish.  The end result is the same.</P>
    <P>How can we improve the situation to deal with the current high land prices and the new thriving condition of our agricultural industry?  Various possibilities are being considered by my Department, and after my proposals have been considered by the Government, I will be bringing legislation before the House.  The main essential must be to ensure that the small and medium farmers who badly need additional land are not at a disadvantage in competing with non-farmers and with larger farmers with ready access to capital and credit.  One possibility would be to have varying charges on purchases by non-farmers and those who already have substantial holdings.  In other words, a handicap system would be introduced into the competitive race for more land.  If such a system were in operation, the position of the small man would be greatly improved, and sellers of large areas of land might, indeed, have an incentive to sell in smaller lots so as to meet the demand of those farmers who would not be subject to any charge.</P>
    <P>Another possibility would be to require some agricultural qualification <Col N="1071" /> for persons buying agricultural land. For example, purchases might be limited to those who have been farming or working on the land for a number of years or who have spent some years receiving agricultural training.  I must say I have particular sympathy for farmers' sons and other young persons seeking to enter farming at present.  Current prices for land make it extremely difficult for them to start out on their own and, even if they raise the huge amount of capital required, the burden of servicing it is almost intolerable.</P>
    <P>Yet another possibility would be to give some degree of priority to development farmers needing more land. These and other possibilities must be carefully considered, and it is not possible at this juncture to say which measure, or what combination of measures, will be introduced.  However, one thing is clear.  Change, indeed fundamental change, is needed.  It must be such as to benefit the small and medium farmer.  It may in the process reduce the price of land.  But this may well be to the overall national advantage if it enables the progressive farmer or the potential young farmer to get his hands on the land he needs.</P>
    <P>In any new measures, the national interest in securing expanded agricultural output will, of course, have to be given appropriate weighting.  At the same time, the social and emotional attachment of the Irish farmer to his farm will have to be taken into account. Some of the procedures under the existing land legislation are rather slow because of the need to protect the rights of the individual.  It would, indeed, be a sad day if in our anxiety to bring about change we were to trample on the rights of existing landowners.  But change cannot be made without causing some upset, and I would certainly not worry about upsetting those who have been speculating in land or who may be considering doing so.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I hope to put proposals before the Government before the end of the year and subsequently to bring legislation before the House. I have mentioned a few of the many <Col N="1072" /> considerations arising and the options open so as to stimulate public discussion of this major topic over the coming months and also to give notice to those who do not really need additional land that it may be unprofitable to assume the price of land will continue to escalate as it has done for several years past.</P>
    <P>Until new legislation has been enacted however, it is necessary to provide funds to pay for lands taken over by the Land Commission under the existing legislation.  That is the purpose of this Bill which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy D'Arcy, who is spokesman on agriculture for our party, will also contribute to this debate. Since the Minister has introduced the Bill it is appropriate that I should say a few words.  The impetus to the reform of land policy derives from the decision and the initiative of the former Taoiseach, Deputy L. Cosgrave, to set up an inter-departmental committee on land policy.  The committee worked speedily and issued an interim report which provided a topic for lively discussion in agricultural circles. I am glad the Minister has indicated that the report will be published in the near future.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Minister recognises decisions should be taken reasonably speedily on the issues involved. It is important that there should be discussion on the proposals emanating from the report and on the Government's tentative decisions thereon. The time for discussion must not be unduly long lest those we wish to discourage should avail of delays to further consolidate their position and see in anticipated legislation an opportunity for doing so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the general tenor of the Minister's remarks.  Although his speech was quite long the essence of it is contained in his remark that small and medium farmers who badly need additional land should not be at a disadvantage in competing with non-farmers and larger farmers with ready access to capital and credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentions as one possibility of dealing with this, a handicap <Col N="1073" /> system of varying charges for non-farmers and for those who already have substantial holdings.  I am obviously not in a position to give an unqualified welcome to the handicap system until I and my party have an opportunity of seeing precisely what the Minister has in mind, but I think this contains the germ of the solution to the problem. I have heard the idea of a handicap system discussed in many quarters in recent months.  Care will be needed in devising the precise criteria to be applied in relation to the handicap. People who buy land may be in a category that should be discouraged. Such people should be asked to pay a substantial handicap at the outset.  I am referring to people who might appear at the outset to be speculators whose main intention is merely to buy the land, not to employ anybody on it, to open the gate, to put cattle on the land, shut the gate, never come near the land again until they open the gate to sell the cattle, and do not develop the land beyond sitting on it in order that they may be able to make use of the capital gain that occurs when they, hopefully, come to sell the land at a higher price.  That sort of activity in agriculture ought to be strenuously discouraged. The imposition of a handicap on people who are liable to do that because of their lack of background in agriculture or because they have sufficient land which they are not working as they should, is a good idea.</P>
    <P>However, there are always exceptions. There may be farmers or people who buy land and when they come to use it engage in a very substantial land improvement programme and employ a substantial number of men as permanent employees.  It is not possible to differentiate between the pure speculator and the non-farmer without all the qualifications the Minister says he should have, who subsequently shows his good business sense and his dedication to work.  It is important that he develops the land.  It is important that he employs a substantial number of men.  I know people in my constituency who at the time they purchased the land might have been described as speculators.  When they got the land they engaged in a very <Col N="1074" /> large scale land improvement programme. We all accept that there are a million or two million acres in this country in need of improvement and if people have the capital to do it they should not be discouraged from bringing that capital to bear on the problem. With proper safeguards, there could be provision for a rebate of part of the handicap that might be charged initially to such a man, if he met certain defined criteria in relation to the improvement of the land by substantial investment in it and the creation of permanent jobs on it.  This would place him on the level of a person who would not have to pay the handicap.  Such a rebate would have to be devised in such a way that it would not create an unfair situation and would assist only people who undertook exceptionally substantial, important and necessary work on the land and who gave employment.</P>
    <P>A surprising absence from the Minister's contribution is any significant reference to the idea of long-term leasing of land.  There is a lack of interest among farmers at the moment in the idea of a long-term lease.  This is based to an extent on historical factors and considerations and on recollection&mdash;not personal of course but from one's grandfather&mdash;of the problems that leasing your land led you into in the latter part of the last century before the land legislation culminating in Wyndham's Land Act of 1903 was put through.</P>
    <P>That understandable and perfectly just fear of a leasing system based on our historical experience should not blind us to the possible merits of leasing in certain circumstances and subject to proper safeguards.  One of the problems is persuading farmers in the first place to make their land available for a long-term lease.  The first thing you have to have is farmers who are prepared to offer a long-term lease, and then you have some means of assessing how much demand there is for it.  At present few, if any, farmers are prepared to make their land available on the basis of a long-term lease. In the provisions of the farm retirement scheme there is an option to lease which on the face of it should have a <Col N="1075" /> greater attraction for farmers and which is preferable to the sale of their land because it will revert to them or their successors after 12 years. Under the sale option in the farm retirement scheme the land is gone.</P>
    <P>However, the lease option has not been used to any great extent even in the retirement scheme.  One reason for this is that there is a doubt in farmers' minds as to their right to recover the land at the end of 12 years because of certain aspects of legislation introduced in the nineteenth century to protect leaseholders.  This was very appropriate and necessary in the context of the type of lease then available and the distribution of social and economic power within society at that time.  It is not necessarily appropriate to a properly drafted lease at present.  We wish to provide a lease with safeguards for all parties which would be fair both to the person whom we wish to encourage to make his land available, not on the 11 months system which is a bad one, but on a longer lease which enables the farmer taking the lease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: Would the Deputy please forgive the Chair for intervening?  I accept that the Minister is responsible for what is happening now, but we are inclined to lose sight of the Bill before the House.  We are dealing with land structures and I take it that there will be a complete opportunity to discuss these other matters at a later stage.  However, the Minister in his opening brief introduced this but we have not had a word on the Bill as yet.  Deputy Bruton to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Chair has no responsibility as far as speeches of Ministers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will not get into an argument.  That is not so.  As far as relevance is concerned the Chair is concerned with the contributions of all Members of the House.  There are not two categories of Members in the House as far as relevance is concerned.</P>
      <P>It was in that context that Macra na Feirme suggested the idea of a model lease which would be underwritten by the State and would be fair to both sides.  It would encourage long-term leases.  The Minister should not put that out of his mind because it was a good suggestion.  We should either introduce something along those lines or change the legislation, or both. It is necessary to encourage long-term leasing.  The advantage of long-term leasing is that people at the maximum period of activity in their lives as farmers, a period of from 12 to 20 years, can get extra land on a long-term lease for that period without necessarily having to buy it and pay a huge capital sum for it, and, perhaps, having to retain it in their latter years when they may not be as well able to work it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of a long-term lease allows the farmer, without a huge capital outlay, to start off with a relatively small farm and leave the larger farm for his maximum period of farming activity.  When that lease expires and he is a little older and only able to operate a smaller amount of land the lease would cease.  That allows more mobility of land, more flexibility and relationship between the amount of land worked at any given time by a farmer and the amount he is able to work by virtue of his age and so forth.  In the course of his contribution the Minister mentioned the idea of the encouragement of farm inheritance.  The Minister pointed out, correctly, that the amount of land passing through the Land Commission was only a small part of the total land market.  He said that the amount <Col N="1077" /> passing by inheritance was much larger and that early inheritance should be encouraged.  He told us that farm inheritance was a sensitive area and it was necessary to be careful in providing outside advice and encouragement.  I do not know how careful one needs to be in providing advice and encouragement because they do not compel anybody to do anything. I wonder if the Minister is being hyper-cautious about giving advice. His party in their election manifesto indicated that they intended to introduce a farm inheritance counselling service and I was surprised that the initiation of this service was not mentioned by the Minister today.  The Minister may intend incorporating it in the new arrangement under the long delayed Bill.  If that is the case will it be in effect quickly enough?  The Minister should take steps to charge county committees of agriculture with the responsibility of encouraging farm inheritance at an earlier age.  He should set up a programme for information and advice as to the various technicalities involved.  He should initiate training programmes immediately for one or two advisers in each county in relation to the problem of farm inheritance so that action can be taken straight away.  I am only inferring that it is the Minister's intention to incorporate this in the new Bill but if that is not so he should tell us what his intention is in relation to farm inheritance counselling.</P>
    <P>I should also like to raise the question of socio-economic advisers in each county.  Such advisers are envisaged in a directive dealing with farm modernisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Chair is really in trouble now because the Deputy is going beyond what the Minister said in his brief.  The Deputy is extending it further.  There is nothing before the House but a simple little Bill dealing with land bonds.  I accept that the Minister in his brief extended that considerably but the Deputy is extending it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept that I am but what I am saying is no more irrelevant than anything the Minister said. <Col N="1078" /> What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>
      <P>Socio-economic advisers should be linked to the farm inheritance work I mentioned and I should like to have the Minister's views on that matter. It is not our intention to create any difficulty in the passage of this Bill. The provisions of the Bill are necessary to curb land speculation here, to curb the unfair advantage which people, foreign and Irish, non-farmers and large farmers, have as against small farmers in the purchase of land. Such measures are necessary but they should be devised in such a manner as to create fair competition, something which does not exist at present in the purchase of land.  They should encourage the maximum amount of investment of capital in agriculture and the maximum development of our land, its drainage and its improvement. The important consideration is not so much who farms the land as how well it is farmed and how many people are engaged full-time in its farming.  That should be the overriding consideration and I hope the Minister will keep the factors I mentioned in mind when devising the proposals which will arise from the inter-departmental committee report which was commissioned by the previous Government and will be presented by this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>: We have been caught off guard somewhat by the Minister's introduction because it was not along the lines we expected.  He has broadened the scope of the debate considerably and we are entitled to deal with some of the material he has presented.  It is a pity that the Minister introduced this Bill before the inter-departmental committee reported. If we are talking about land restructuring here the one section that has the personnel, the technique and money to do so is the Land Commission. I am not pleased with the present system of paying for land with land bonds.  This system has been unfair to the sellers of land.  I can never understand why some unfortunate person has not brought the Land Commission to court.  As far as I am concerned, we are acquiring land <Col N="1079" /> by compulsion and paying for it as we see fit, in many cases to the detriment of the person selling the land.  I admit that the raising of the interest rate to 16 per cent made land bonds attractive to people selling land, but some land bonds are absolutely useless. Officials of the Land Commission often attend auctions as observers.  When the land reaches a certain price per acre and is knocked down to a bidder, the Land Commission then step in and put a stay on the sale.  They declare their interest in it and that they intend to pay for it with land bonds.</P>
      <P>A different system should be introduced now.  I wonder whether the Land Commission could create a climate in which a seller would approach them in regard to the sale of land, knowing that they should be buying the land because they will divide it among needy farmers.  If we could create such a climate we would satisfy the seller.  I know that large farmers who have a rough idea of the Land Commission's price have brought people with them to sales to force the bidding in order to make the land uneconomical for the commission.  The Minister must be aware of this because it happened less than 50 miles from his county.</P>
      <P>When the Land Commission put a stay on a sale the buyer can take his case to the land courts.  I know of two cases in Wexford where the Land Commission have been beaten in court by strong farmers.  I state these cases to point out to the Minister the difficult problem he has on hand.  The problem of land purchase should be solved for the people who need the land.</P>
      <P>There has been no mention of interest rates in the Bill.</P>

Am I right in saying that there is a 16 per cent land bond?

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is essential to remember that 12½ per cent may look good now but it may be inadequate in six months' time.  For that reason the Minister should vary the rate as the value of money increases.  I believe it could take two or three years to solve problems in regard to the sale of land through the courts.  The person who sells the land cannot get his money until the problems are solved. Therefore, the Land Commission are in a difficult position in that they are holding up the sale of land, deferring payment of money to the seller of the land and at the same time they have to fight the large farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a figure of £2,000 requiring a repayment of approximately £250 per annum.  It seems that the present price of land is £2,000 per acre, in many cases higher. The Minister has not said how he intends to try to maintain present prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking of the larger farmer buying land with a very high acreage it is essential that there be enforced a varying stamp duty rate to decrease their strength in buying land at top prices. At the same time in order to give some hope to the smaller farmers, and there are hundreds of thousands of them in the 40, 50 and 60 acreage group, it is essential also that their capacity at the <Col N="1081" /> bottom of the scale be augmented.  If it were possible to decrease the capacity of the man at the top and increase the capacity of his counterpart at the bottom of the scale, then the latter would have some hope of going to an auction to acquire badly needed land in order to make his present holding viable.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rightly said, inflation is one factor that must be taken into consideration in land prices.  It used to increase yearly but is now a six-monthly event and this has been the situation for some time now.  Perhaps the Minister has something to do with that or he could claim that his predecessor had but certainly in the last four years, we have seen the steepest increase in land prices and inflation has been one of the inherent factors, as the Minister himself said.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>It may well be asked why people seeking a hedge against inflation should be allowed to force up the price of land to the point where the small- and medium-size family farmers have little or no possibility of getting a few extra acres,...</P>
    <P>That is a very true statement.  It is only right that we should examine who is buying this land.  But I am prepared to state that there are syndicates buying land who, by pooling their resources, have become very powerful.  Indeed it has reached the stage in some counties that they are calling the tune.  The sooner legislation is enacted to ensure that these people can no longer force the issue as far as buying land in an area is concerned the better.  It is a dreadful situation, one which has developed particularly in Leinster.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were prepared to suggest a formula by which our small farmers could go off to the market place to buy land he would be doing a great job not alone for them but for the country as a whole.  Some of these large tracts of land in many areas are merely well fenced off, are used for grazing cattle and are not giving the type of production or employment it is essential that we reap from our land at this juncture.  The farm retirement scheme is another facet that I feel should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: The Minister has said that a handicap system will be introduced into the competitive race for more land.  That is a very interesting statement.  He went on to say:</P>
      <P>If such a system were in operation, the position of the small man would be greatly improved, and sellers of large areas of land might, indeed, have an incentive to sell in smaller lots so as to meet the demand of those farmers who would not be subject to any charge.</P>
      <P>That is a statement warranting an enormous amount of action before such a situation is realised.  I should love to see such a situation obtaining.  But an enormous amount of legislation will have to be brought before this House, and there will be a lot of opposition to it, because&mdash;I am a large farmer myself and am not ashamed to admit it&mdash;the large farmer is a greedy man and he is very fond of his land.  If land goes up for sale beside him, my goodness will he go for that.  That is the position obtaining at present and that is what the Minister must meet with legislation.  I would urge that the land bond situation be met by a variable interest rate so that we would not have to do so much dragging and pulling out of the Minister for Finance to get him to change this interest rate in line with changing times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years the Land Commission have had the bad habit of retaining land.  I asked the Minister in the past month to give me a list of holdings in my own county held by the Land Commission and I was more than surprised to see the amount of land held by them, even in County <Col N="1083" /> Wexford.  When the Land Commission acquire land they should devise some speedy system of dividing it.  I shall not describe such land as a liability because at present the Land Commission set it but, if they divided it, the farmers would be satisfied and it would put an end to all of the present kind of pressure within an area, where people press for this, that or the other portion.</P>
    <P>I know the Land Commission are at present, on a limited scale, selling land for cash.  I would advocate wider use of this practice.  I believe that both the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the commercial banks would advocate that the Land Commission devise a system of payment in cash for as much land as possible, thereby increasing the Land Commission's capacity to buy land.  It has been said that the Land Commission are in a position to buy practically all land available and that there are no cut-backs but the retention of land over a long period is a mistake.  We have seen this obtain for many years.  I can recall one area in County Wexford where land was held by them for ten years, a great mistake in a congested area.  I welcome the change in policy that, when the Land Commission are selling land, they are prepared to offer it to people with small acreages, no longer putting it up for public auction and allowing the larger landowners to come in and take it up on the yearly basis.  This is a very welcome step by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I believe the main emphasis in their policy should be the sale of land for cash&mdash;thereby giving them more cash available to buy land&mdash;which I believe would be welcomed by the ACC and the commercial banks at present.  I worked in the ACC for a period and I have mentioned this matter on a couple of occasions already.  I understand that the commercial banks would also welcome a policy under which all people interested in land should purchase it for cash.  I am endeavouring to safeguard the interests of people selling land to the Land Commission. It is essential in that regard that we retain the interest rate and vary it in <Col N="1084" /> accordance with the changing values of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I thank Deputies for their contributions.  We would appear to have the same general purpose and recognise the same obstacles.  The obstacles are very great.  The purpose is to ensure that there is not unfairness in the land market and we acknowledge that there is at present.  The task is to devise the means by which this unfairness may be disposed of.  As Deputy Bruton and Deputy D'Arcy have been saying, it is fraught with a great many difficulties and one will have to incur the displeasure of some people in seeking after the greater good, the introduction of the fairness we have been talking about to the land market.  I believe it can be done, but it will not be easy.  It will not be done at all unless we make a start.  We start through legislation and I have told the House that it is my intention to put proposals before the Government before the end of this year and thereafter, with the approval of the Government, to introduce legislation to deal with this question.  Possibly I overstepped my limits in relevance when I was opening and if I did, please forgive me.</P>
      <P>On the question of leasing, Deputy Bruton must recognise, coming from where he does, the anxiety that besets people at what they describe as seeing a stranger in the yard.  We must recognise the attachment of the Irish farmer to his land and the personal view that he takes of it.  The emotional link between himself and his land is a very real thing and every rural Deputy knows that.  If anybody tries to intrude on that attachment he is heading into trouble.  People in the socio-economic advice sector must be very careful in this regard.  In relation to family counselling and counselling with regard to inheritance, I would not apologise for extreme caution in this field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am referring to inheritance counselling.  In that area, unless I misread my own neighbours, <Col N="1085" /> people will seek advice of a particular kind when they require it, but it would be wrong to have such advice thrust upon them.  I appreciate Deputy Bruton's point that the availability in each county would probably be a good idea.  Possibly the availability of advice of a kind different to that we are used to, agricultural advice, would be a better indicator.  That is work for another day, but it is certainly a worthwhile thought.</P>
      <P>Regarding closed lettings, the closing of the letting of land to eligible people in an area, that is an idea that is being practised by the Land Commission. It is something I often advocated in the House, both from the Government and the Opposition benches. We recognise the common problem, the hogging of letting land in an area by the big operator.  We have no quarrel with the fact that he is a big operator but we quarrel with the fact that he is interfering with other people who cannot fight back.</P>
      <P>I apologise for any misunderstanding when Deputy D'Arcy asked a direct question regarding interest rates. I am told that if a higher interest bearing land bond is current when a sale takes place, the higher interest bearing bond is used on that occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 46, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The supplier of the animal or animals, or an agent appointed <Col N="1086" /> by him, shall have the right to be present while the carcases of his animals are being classified.  This provision shall not apply to the classification of individual cuts of meat but only to the classification of whole carcases.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure in relation to the classification scheme that the farmer has a right to see his animal being classified.  We encourage farmers to sell animals to the factory, and it is important that we do so because if cattle are sold to the factory they are slaughtered and processed there and employment is given. If they are sold in the mart they may be exported live and employment which could be given is not given.  If a farmer sends his cattle to the mart and he does not like the price he is offered, he can withdraw the cattle. If he sends them to the factory and he does not like the price, they will be dead and he will not be able to get them back.  The price will be determined by the factory on the basis of the classification of the animal and the farmer should see that an animal is being fairly classified.  If he is to accept the price he is getting on the basis of the classification scheme and if he is to accept the scheme itself, he must have confidence in that scheme.  If he feels than an unfair system is being operated in classifying animals in factories and that as a result he is not getting the price he should get, he will not send his cattle to the factories; he will send them to the mart where, if he does not like the price, he can withdraw them.  That is a very strong argument in favour of the amendment. It will encourage farmer confidence both in the classification scheme and in sending their animals to the factories.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well argue that this could create difficulties for the factories.  I do not believe it will. Cattle are usually sent in in loads and one farmer sends in one load.  At any given time there will be one or two farmers present wherever the animals are being classified.  It is not a question of having crowds of farmers coming in from all corners of the country.  This amendment confers <Col N="1087" /> a right only on the farmer whose own cattle are being classified or on an agent appointed by him.  The possibility of appointing an agent is inserted in the amendment because I understand that in some cases the IFA are prepared to ask someone to act as an agent in the factory for farmers in a particular area.  I have some personal connection with people involved in this aspect of the activities of the IFA.  If that arrangement were entered into, it would not even be necessary for individual farmers to go in and out of the factory looking at their animals being classified because there would be someone on the spot representing them and seeing that there was fairness.  That is a reasonable proposal.</P>
    <P>Another point that the Minister made in dealing with this on Committee Stage was that the factories were private institutions and did not have to allow anybody into their premises.  The reality is that most factories, if asked, are prepared to allow people in voluntarily as it is.  I think there is one group that has a policy of encouraging farmers to come in to see their cattle being slaughtered. We all know how essential it is for farmers to realise the importance of breeding the right type of animal to get into the top class in the classification scheme.  How better could this message be brought home to farmers than by their seeing their animal being classified in a relatively less desirable class compared with another animal from another farmer that they may well know, which may be pointed out to them and which has been classed as top grade?  A farmer will be able to say then: &ldquo;I know now: I can see the difference between my animal and his.  I can see why the classification is made as it is.  I know how I fed my cattle; I know how he fed his cattle and I can see the difference.  I know why he got into the I class while I only got into the L class.  There could be no more graphic object lesson in the better management and breeding of cattle than seeing one's own animal classified.</P>
    <P>We know the great reluctance of <Col N="1088" /> farmers to accept anything in words unless they can see it for themselves. That is why there is so much emphasis in agricultural extension on farm demonstration, farm walks, on bringing farmers to other farms to see things actually working.  It is not enough to take a farmer to a lecture hall and say: &ldquo;This is how your farm should be run; these figures prove that a particular system is more successful than another.&rdquo;  The farmer will not in many cases be persuaded by that but he will be persuaded by a visit to another farm to see the system being spoken about in action so that he can actually look at the cattle, see the buildings and see the system working. That is well accepted in agricultural extension here and abroad.</P>
    <P>This amendment merely seeks to apply the same principle to the slaughter of animals and to achieve a better type of animal by letting the farmer see things for himself in a way nobody can achieve by telling him or by sending him facts, figures and data. It cannot be achieved in that way as effectively as it can be achieved if the farmer goes into the factory, sees the animals being slaughtered and classified.</P>
    <P>We have a big task ahead in selling the classification scheme because, mark my words, there will be strident criticism from some quarters once the scheme is introduced.  The scheme is based on the personal judgment of different inspectors in different parts of the country, some in Kerry, some in Monaghan, but all supposed to be operating the same scheme to the same standard.  Of course the classifications they apply will relate very significantly to the price paid and I am sure there will be complaints from farmers, not all of them, but from individuals that different standards are being applied in different places, that if you send an animal to one factory it is easier to get into the I class than if you send it to another.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that largely if not wholly these complaints will be unjustified because I am confident that the Minister will ensure, as he said, that those doing the classification will be well trained.  But that does not take <Col N="1089" /> from the truth of my prediction that complaints will be made and made stridently.  If they are made often enough they will undermine the farmer's faith in classification.  How better to make sure that his faith is maintained and that this sort of criticism is not sustained than by ensuring that the farmer can go into the factory and see his animal being classified?  It is a safeguard against the undermining, for good reasons or ill, of faith in the future of the classification scheme if this amendment is accepted.  I hope the Minister will accept it.  I have modified it to make it easy for the Minister to accept it by providing that it may be an agent of the farmer appointed by him.  This could avoid the necessity to have individual farmers going into the factory one after the other.  I am not asking for classification of individual cuts of meats in the farmer's presence because that does not arise until the animal has been cut up and by that time it may not be possible to say that a cut belongs to a particular farmer's animal or to some other farmer's animal.  It would not be operable if that took place.  Therefore I confined the amendment to the classification of whole carcases which I think is a reasonable suggestion to ensure farmer confidence in classification and hence its success in its stated objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to support the amendment which I think is a very reasonable and essential one in order to protect the interests of the farmer.  I have not heard the arguments from the Minister on the other side but classification is something new, we know how much of the price can be for A, B, C and D&mdash;I presume these will be the symbols used as they have been used up to now&mdash;and we know of the great difficulty that arises when there is an over-supply.  When there is an over-supply they are all Bs, Cs and Ds; when there is an undersupply they are all As.  We have seen this in practically every sphere of agriculture and I am sure the Minister has seen it.  We saw it with wheat.  When there was an over-supply the wheat was all unmillable; when there was an under-supply it was all millable.  These <Col N="1090" /> are areas in which we must protect the farmer as regards the sale of his stock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The scheme will be an extension of the existing probation and welfare service. Its distinctive feature will be the small number of offenders which each welfare officer will have to supervise at any one time.</P>
      <P>The scheme will include offenders in the prisons and places of detention considered suitable for release before the normal date of expiration of their sentences and likely to benefit from close supervision in the community.  Initially those involved will be offenders in the 16 to 21 age group.</P>
      <P>Authority has been obtained by my Department for the recruitment of an additional 27 welfare officers and three senior welfare officers for the purpose of servicing the scheme.  Furthermore, plans are advanced for the provision of a day centre at Marlboro Place, Dublin.  This centre, in addition to being a point of contact between the welfare service and the offenders, will provide a setting for individual and group counselling and will be a base for work-training and education programmes for the offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> If the welfare officer posts can be filled from competitions being held this year, the scheme could be in operation before the year is out.  The scheme will to some extent be experimental but I have hopes that it will achieve worth-while results in keeping a substantial number of persons from relapsing into crime.  I am afraid, however, that it would be foolish to be unduly optimistic about this or any other scheme.  Moreover, I think it right to say that only a proportion of offenders could be considered as suitable for this kind of scheme and, accordingly, it would not be realistic to regard this scheme as a first step towards the closing down of any prison or place of detention.</P>

      <P>The usual suggestion made in this context appears to be that the Garda Síochána should have power to arrest without warrant where it appears that there has been a breach of a barring order.  I do not exclude this but, apart from the fact that there are certain objections to it, I am not yet satisfied that it provides any real solution even from the point of view of the other partner since the arrested person could not arbitrarily be kept in police custody nor could he be refused bail while his case was awaiting hearing except on specific grounds which might not be present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards access to children, however, I am not very confident that this can be satisfactorily resolved in the context of a barring order by the District Court, since that is inherently and unavoidably in the nature of a short-term decision made to meet an <Col N="1094" /> immediate problem of threat to the safety of a spouse or children.

      <P>and <b>Mr. Harte</b> asked the Minister for Justice the details of the security precautions in force in relation to the transport of the large amount of money taken in the armed robbery near Newcastle West, County Limerick on 7 June 1978; if he considers them to have been adequate in view of what happened; and the additional measures that he proposes in order to check the continuing wave of armed robbery in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the type of security provided to the bank van involved in the recent Limerick raid is in accordance with departmental requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The question whether security arrangements in a given case are adequate depends on the criteria to be applied.  If the test is that the arrangements should prevent a robbery, then clearly in the case referred to the arrangements did not meet that test.</P>
      <P>The decision as to the protection arrangements to be applied in a given case is for the Garda Síochána and this has been the position under successive Ministers for Justice and that is how it should be.</P>
      <P>In recent years, mainly because of inflation, cash amounts in transit have increased substantially.  Inflation is not, however, the only factor and the development of industry, commerce and related activities in our society has had the result of very frequent movements of cash in amounts that are very large.  It is totally impossible to provide continuous protection even of all large consignments of money that are being moved about from place to place.</P>
      <P>It may be alleged that what is involved is the protection of very substantial sums only.  I have some difficulty in dealing with the whole question of the designation of &ldquo;substantial sums&rdquo;, and, for reasons which the House will appreciate, a discussion of the protection measures that are operated in the case of particular cash consignments in transit could only benefit those who plan these robberies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> When I assumed office I found that the policy being pursued then provided for very little protection on cash movements. I am stating this as a fact and not as a criticism.  The policy I found in operation was a deliberate policy which could be defended but I thought that the level of protection should be increased.  The level of the protection was in fact increased but, whatever level of protection is applied, there can be no guarantee against robberies occurring.  In the case of the robbery referred to in the questions the amount of money was substantial. I am not saying that sums as large as this are commonplace but I must stress that very large sums indeed are regularly in transit throughout the country&mdash;much more so than is generally recognised.  To cover all of them with Garda protection would impose such a demand on manpower and resources that it would not be possible to meet it.  This is the reality that we must face.  My information is that we in this country are by no means unique in this.  On the contrary, I understand that this situation is commonplace in many countries.</P>
    <P>Last week's robbery raises very important questions.  If we are now moving into a situation where semi-military-type operations are planned and carried out against property then we, as a community, must consider what measures must be taken to combat this type of threat even if this means measures that may sound very harsh.  The necessity not only to impose very long sentences and to ensure that those very long sentences are fully served by persons convicted of such offences is one consideration that has to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The current strategy of providing Garda escorts for cash in transit is being reassessed by the Garda authorities and amongst the matters to be considered by them will be the effectiveness of the existing escort arrangements.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the diversion of police resources to protection arrangements of this nature is exceptionally costly in terms of manpower and has the result of diverting those resources from other areas of <Col N="1097" /> police needs.  Measures that might suggest themselves at first sight as a solution to this particular problem are not the measures that commend themselves to experienced police officers with the expertise and professional competence to assess what has to be done.</P>
    <P>Some public references have been made to the possible use of Army escorts.  Once again the problem lies in the very large number of transfers of very large sums and, even if Army manpower were to be employed, I think a problem could arise about the level of what I might call militarism that would then be on daily display on our streets and roads.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution because it is an extremely complex problem and I am satisfied that in the current review being carried out by the Garda authorities they will take into account all relevant considerations with a view to improving the situation.  The gardaí will be discussing with the banks the further action that might be taken on their side to reduce the volume of bank cash in transit at the present time.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that any proposal to transfer money by light plane was made as suggested in Question No. 5. It is not a proposal that commends itself to the gardaí as offering any real assistance.  It may be that a limited use of helicopters would be beneficial and this is being considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: In regard to the Minister's statement that he had arranged for an increase in the level of protection for cash in transit, does he seriously suggest that having what appears to have been one Garda escort car in attendance on a van carrying £500,000 would fit in with that statement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister indicate from what level it was increased? Does he suggest that the provision of one escort car was an increase in the level of protection available?  Is <Col N="1098" /> he saying that there was no escort available in the past for the transport of substantial sums?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister accept that transferring money at a time of national crisis by an unarmed police escort is ridiculous when he thinks it necessary, and I support the need for it, that there be an armed guard with a police escort in tow? Does he not consider that it undermines confidence in him that he would allow his Department, through the gardaí, to escort sizeable sums of money unarmed?  Is he aware of a robbery a few minutes ago in this city <Col N="1099" /> of £30,000 which has been stolen from the Gas Company?  Will he now accept that there is a crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: My original answer more than adequately covers anything that has been raised by Deputy Harte as far as security on shipments of money is concerned.  His comparison of security for any member of the Government or members of the last Government does not warrant any comment by me at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>: The point I wanted to make and I am not making this lightly, is that this could have been a trap to kidnap the Minister.  Where was he when this was taking place? It could have been any member of this Cabinet, of the former Cabinet or any Member of the House.  This is a grave situation and he does not seem to appreciate it.  Would he confirm that this escort was unarmed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Regardless of inflation £400,000 is a substantial sum and the Minister admitted that the escort provided for the conveyance of this money did not measure up to departmental requirements.  What was the reason for this?  Were the transmitters, particularly those in the Garda car, effective or defective, and if they were effective what was the reason for the inability of the Garda to communicate with outside sources, a failure which may have helped the raiders to get away?  Having regard to the substantial amounts of money taken from banks and other public premises in recent years and taking into consideration also some of the statements made by the Minister while he was in Opposition, would he not agree that it was inexcusable that such an incident should occur at his doorstep?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will issue a statement dissociating the Irish Government from the action of our fellow EEC member state, France, in invading Shaba Province in Zaire, in defence of foreign investment there; and if he will lodge a formal protest with the French Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the statement issued by the French Government that the invasion of Shaba Province, Zaire, was undertaken in close collaboration with other European Governments, prior notice of the action was given to the Irish Government; and, if so, if the Irish Government endorsed the proposed action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the action taken by the French Government was taken at the request of the Government of Zaire and was explicitly stated to be for the purpose of extending protection to French and other foreign citizens and to re-establish security pending the restoration of Zaire government authority.  In the circumstances I do not accept that it is correct to characterise the French action as an invasion &ldquo;in defence of foreign investment&rdquo; as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand also that the action was preceded by consultation with certain other governments directly concerned, in particular Belgium, which also sent troops.  The Irish Government were not given prior notice nor consulted in the matter. <Col N="1104" /> Subsequently on 20 May at the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Nine at Hesselet the French Foreign Minister informed his colleagues of developments.</P>
    <P>The developments which led to this action and the present situation in the area are by no means clear at this distance and our sources of information are necessarily limited.  In these circumstances, and as no question of our being asked to endorse or to associate ourselves with the action has arisen, I do not believe it would be appropriate to issue a statement as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is it not the case that Mobutu is well known as a corrupt and decadent puppet of the western capitalist countries and that he has allowed his country to be pillaged by France, Belgium and so on while the unfortunate people of the Shaba Province, which is one of the wealthiest provinces in the world, live in conditions of extreme poverty?  In the circumstances should we not express our dissatisfaction with this nineteenth century act of aggressive imperialism?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the hunger strike in Chile to which the Deputy refers.  The Deputy will be aware that the hunger strike has been suspended since those involved are waiting to ascertain if the Chilean authorities will announce an independent inquiry into the disappearances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been reported recently that the Chilean authorities have agreed to admit the <i>ad hoc</i> Working Group on Chile appointed by the UN <Col N="1109" /> Commission on Human Rights.  I have been informed by our permanent representative at the United Nations in New York that discussions are at present taking place between the working group and the Chilean authorities in this regard.  I would hope that the Chilean authorities will indeed agree to hold an independent inquiry and that it will make all relevant information available to the relatives of persons who have disappeared.  I hope also that the <i>ad hoc</i> group will be admitted and that the Chilean Government will co-operate fully with it, particularly in regard to the unexplained disappearances.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have been gravely concerned about the general human rights situation, and in particular the unexplained disappearance of many people in Chile, since September 1973.  At the most recent session of the UN General Assembly the Irish delegation again cosponsored a resolution on this subject.  This resolution called on the Chilean Government to restore and respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and in particular demanded that the Chilean authorities &ldquo;put an immediate end to practices of inadmissible secret arrests and subsequent disappearance of persons whose detention is systematically denied, or never acknowledged, and clarify forthwith the status of such persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The nine member states of the EEC, in a common statement in this debate, expressed very grave concern about the unexplained disappearances. They referred to the hunger strike undertaken by relatives of some disappeared persons in June 1977 and expressed regret at the totally inadequate manner in which the Chilean Government carried out its undertaking to the UN Secretary General to make serious inquiries into the disappearances. The Ambassadors of the EEC countries in Santiago had previously with our approval made an approach to the Chilean authorities in July last year on behalf of all the members of the Nine about the unexplained disappearances.</P>
    <P>The Government remain very concerned about these disappearances. <Col N="1110" /> Ireland does not have formal diplomatic relations with Chile.  However we are considering whether any further representations can usefully be made in conjunction with our partners in the Nine or in an appropriate UN forum to reiterate our grave concern to the Chilean authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to thank the Minister for his reply.  The question is somewhat out of date because of the postponement of the hunger strike.  However, in view of the situation that now exists, would the Minister consider, on behalf of the Government, writing directly to the Chilean Government and expressing the concern of the House with regard to the 2,500 missing people?  Would the Minister consider attempting to ask the United States to exercise their considerable influence with the Chilean Government in this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to tell the Deputy that we are constantly considering the most effective way of making our concern known to the Chilean Government but we have no direct diplomatic link with the Chilean Government.  The channels open to us are the ones I referred to, namely, in consultation with our partners who are actively looking at this position.  Our position is fully recognised not just by the Chilean Government but by some concerned and interested people in Chile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister aware that there are a number of Irish citizens in Chile who have first-hand knowledge of the situation?  In view of that involvement and the concern of the House, would the Minister consider, in the event of the Chilean Government not making an adequate response to the requests from the Nine, sponsoring sterner action in the Council of Foreign Ministers of the EEC directed against the Chileans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I can assure the Deputy that if the response is not <Col N="1111" /> adequate we will be looking at what further steps we can take to bring pressure to bear on the Chilean authorities to guarantee the safety of people who have been apprehended and ask them to explain the disappearances which are the subject of the questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the course of his reply the Minister referred to the holding of an independent inquiry. Did he say &ldquo;to permit the holding of an independent inquiry&rdquo; or &ldquo;the holding of an independent inquiry by the Chilean Government&rdquo;, which is a farcical suggestion?  Would the Minister clarify whether it is to be an independent inquiry by outsiders or by the Chilean Government?  Will the Irish Government seek to be a member of the <i>ad hoc</i> investigating committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: When the Deputy has had an opportunity of reading my reply in detail, he will note that I talked about an independent inquiry which will not just be conducted by the Chilean Government.  I talked about the consultations which are at present taking place between the UN and the Chilean Government.  As a consequence of this, I hope there will soon be a satisfactory independent inquiry. As to whether or not Ireland would serve on that inquiry is a matter not just for Ireland but also for the UN.  Our readiness to serve is beyond question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The question of economic sanctions on the part of the Community against countries that have a gross disregard for human rights is being currently considered.  It is a delicate and difficult topic because the countries concerned in the various areas in which the EEC has aid programmes have different perceptions (a) of human rights and (b) of the right of the Community to set standards for them which they might reject.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the death by hanging of Brain Maguire in Castlereagh Interrogation Centre, and the overwhelming evidence that the five techniques which the British Government renounced at Strasbourg have been replaced by numerous similar disorientation techniques, he will make representations to the British Government to establish the precise circumstances of Mr. Maguire's death, and to secure the abolition of all remaining disorientation techniques.</P>

      <P>: Through the regular contact maintained over the years with reliable sources in Northern Ireland, I am aware in considerable detail of the reports of ill-treatment of suspects in Castlereagh and elsewhere in Northern Ireland.  Some of these reports are disquieting and I can assure the Deputy that the British Government is fully aware of the concern of the Irish Government that the interrogation of suspects in Northern Ireland <Col N="1114" /> should be carried out with full respect at all times for the human and legal rights of the suspect and that, where an event such as the tragic case referred to by the Deputy gives rise to misgivings or suspicions in any part of the community, it is in the interest of all concerned to dispel such suspicions by establishing the circumstances surrounding the case.  In regard to the precise circumstances of Mr. Maguire's death I am informed by the British authorities that an inquest is to be held on 26 June.</P>
      <P>Arising out of recent allegations about interrogation methods at Castlereagh, I have been in contact with the British authorities who have assured me that they stand by the undertaking given by their Attorney General before the European Court of Human Rights.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 18, 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The answer to the first question is in the negative.  The non-aligned movement, ever since the first conference of non-aligned countries in Belgrade in 1961, have held many meetings at various levels and continue to play an active role in international affairs.  Whether a more formal organisation than that which already exists is necessary is a matter for the non-aligned countries themselves.</P>
      <P>Since Ireland is not a member of the non-aligned movement, we have naturally not been in a position to mould or help determine attitudes of the non-aligned countries from within that movement.  At the same time, we have frequent contact with non-aligned countries, as with other countries, both bilaterally and in a multilateral forum, and our policies are well-known to them.  On disarmament questions, for example, we have consulted with Yugoslavia a number of times during the past year in connection with the Special Session of the UN General Assembly on Disarmament: Yugoslavia is a particularly influential member of the non-aligned movement.</P>
      <P>When the Deputy refers to &ldquo;the recent UN session of all eligible world nations on nuclear disarmament&rdquo;, I assume he means the Special Session I have just mentioned, which is meeting at present in New York and which, in fact, deals with conventional as well as nuclear disarmament.  Ireland supported the convening of this Special Session when it was proposed in the General Assembly in 1976, and the Taoiseach addressed the session on 25 May 1978.  The Irish Delegation at the Special Session continues to play an active role in its deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>: Might I ask the Minister what he means by saying that we are not a member of the non-aligned movement?  Why are we not a member of the non-aligned movement in so far as we are not a member of NATO?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: When I say that we are not a member of the non-aligned movement I state a fact; as a formal movement we are not a member of it. It numbers at present approximately 48 African states, 28 Asian states and 7 Latin American states.  That is a fact.  I have indicated to the Deputy that we have been in consultation from time to time with individual members of the non-aligned movement, as with other groups of countries, and that we work closely with them and other countries in the formulation of aims towards establishing world peace and order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

It is generally accepted that there are three States in the world at present&mdash;the USSR, the United States and the NATO powers and then the non-aligned world.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the first instance the fact is we are not a member of NATO and the following questions turn on that.  In the second instance, there are many countries within the non-aligned movement who perhaps are less non-aligned in the real sense of the word than we are, such as Cuba.  Therefore membership or otherwise of this movement is not in any way a comment on the consistency of the foreign policy being pursued by the persons or countries who are either members or not members of that movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: This section, which deals with the taxing of farming profits and reliefs to be offset against farming profits is fundamental to the Finance Bill and to the economic and fiscal strategy of the Government.  It is our contention on these benches that the reliefs being given are in many cases excessive and that there are no real safeguards to ensure that the reliefs will produce the kind of investment in agriculture that the Minister is presumably hoping will take place. Reliefs in relation to direct taxation of farmers are such as to ensure that comparatively small numbers of farmers will be brought into the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Tuesday, 23 May in answer to a parliamentary question the Minister <Col N="1137" /> gave the information that in 1978-79 as a result of the change in the rateable valuation and the change in the multiplier there would be approximately 26,000 farmers assessed for tax on their farming profits.  This would include people who would appeal against their assessment.  Out of a total of 170,000 farmers, this represents some 15.3 per cent.  The largest percentage increase and global increase in the number of farmers being brought into the tax net was between 1976-77 and 1977-78 when it almost doubled from just over 9,000 to almost 19,000.  We are talking about the 15.3 per cent of all farmers who will be assessed for tax on their farming profits in the coming year.  This is not a large proportion of farmers.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about the need to establish a progressive policy which will establish horizontal equity and fairness of contribution to the Exchequer between the farming community and the rest.  We are not asking for penal taxation of poor farmers any more than we ask for penal taxation of workers whose incomes are below the same sort of limits.  It is worth while pointing out that the reliefs being given to the farming community in the Finance Bill are proportionately much greater than the reliefs being given to the ordinary wage and salary earner.  The total amount which the authorities expect to collect in tax from the farming community this year is about £24 million and the value of the reliefs is about £5 million, which is roughly one-fifth.  The total amount expected to be collected from PAYE and other direct income tax payers is something over £600 million and the amount of reliefs that have been given in that area are approximately £60 million or £70 million.  In other words, the ratio of relief to income on the farming side is about one-fifth and on the non-farming side is about one-tenth.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of substantial reasons why we quarrel with some of the provisions in this section and they are related to the fact that we are still persisting in treating farming, and very substantial farmers in particular who should be treated as any other businessmen, with a very special <Col N="1138" /> degree of care and consideration which most of them, if they are any good at their business, simply do not need any more as protection.  In this section we are making substantial reliefs available to very large farmers without any evidence of re-investment. We spent a long time yesterday talking about the need to create investment and to create jobs and many of the reliefs we were talking about are actually contingent on re-investment. There is no such contingency in this section.  There is no need for any farmer to invest any money he is saving in any form of further investment in his farm, much less job-creation. There is no need for him to invest any of the savings in providing jobs on his farm for individual human beings.  This is in direct contrast to the reliefs being extended to other industries, where the reliefs are contingent on increasing employment quotas.  We were arguing against the quotas chosen because we believed that they were not high enough but at least the principle was there&mdash;if you provide more jobs you get more relief.  Here the relief is not contingent on the jobs.</P>
    <P>I would point out in relation to our attitude on this section that what we believe holds good for the town holds good for the country as well.  We are a party which believes in re-distribution from the well-off to the not-so-well-off and we therefore logically believe in re-distribution from the well-off farmers to the not-so-well-off farmers, just as we believe in redistribution in city and town areas.  This section contains no hint of redistribution.  There is nothing for the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>My final point is in relation to the subsection to which we have put down an amendment, which we have now withdrawn with the possibility of putting it in on Report Stage.  That is the subsection relating to the possibility that very large farmers now have of offsetting their payment of rates as a direct payment against their tax liability.  We oppose that for a number of reasons: first, because it is part of the technique of treating the best developed end of an already favoured industry more favourably <Col N="1139" /> than any other business or industry; secondly, because it represents an extraordinary development of the Government's fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>What we call things here is important.  I have argued with the Minister before regarding his tax splitting provisions whether they should be called allowance splitting, tax splitting or transfers within the family.  What we call things is politically important, but as a result of this subsection which now allows farmers to set off rates as a direct payment against tax we have a very anomalous situation created in which farmers with over £60 rateable valuation will be able to set off their rates entirely against their liability for tax. Farmers under £20 rateable valuation will pay no rates because they will be exempt from rates on agricultural land.  We are left with farmers with a rateable valuation of between £20 and £60, a very large and numerous group.  They will continue to have to pay rates on a graduated basis, but they will have nothing to offset rates against.  The irony of the situation is that the Minister and the Government, while in the process, in section 36, of abolishing wealth tax, are leaving in rates on farmers of between £20 and £60 rateable valuation as the only form of tax on fixed assets not capable of being offset against another liability that now exists.  The farmers of between £20 and £60 valuation will be the last people under Fianna Fáil to continue paying wealth tax. Effectively, the rates on their property amount to a wealth tax and Fianna Fáil are going to insist that they continue paying it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I hold it is relevant in the sense that the larger farmers are able to borrow money to purchase further lands, and offset the interest against taxation, something which farmers not in the tax net cannot do. Something should be done to prevent very large farmers being able to offset interest on money borrowed to purchase further land against their tax liability.  It might only do a little good but I think it should be included in this section.  As things stand, it is far more attractive for these large farmers to purchase land.  This is against the common good because they are buying land to add to already large farms.  Something should be done to prevent people outside the agricultural sphere&mdash;and these are many&mdash;as well as those in the top ten in the valuation list in the various counties from borrowing money and claiming the interest against tax in order to add further to the irregularities in our land structure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Reference was made to the connection between employment creation and tax.  One of the features of taxation is the allowance for depreciation on buildings and investment. There is evidence of very substantial investment by the farming community, particularly by some farmers who are within the tax net.  This does not necessarily create direct employment on the farm, but when assessing the employment impact of investment in agriculture it is important not to look at the matter solely from the viewpoint of employment on the particular farm because much of the employment created by agricultural activity is indirect.  For instance, you can have <Col N="1141" /> employment in contracting firms supplying services to agriculture.  I think figures here would indicate a significant increase.  You also have&mdash;and this is very significant&mdash;increased investment in buildings by farmers.  We all recognise that the fixed capital on farms in terms of buildings, yards and so on has been insufficient in the past to meet the needs of modern agriculture.  There has been significant investment in this area, which is giving employment in rural areas to small building contracting firms.  The employment thus created directly relates to agriculture and can be offset against tax.</P>
      <P>One should see the provision in that context.  Lest one might think this investment was not taking place I would point out that under the farm modernisation scheme there is evidence that last year alone farmers invested approximately £100 million in various improvement works.  Most of that, certainly in so far as it involved buildings on farms, created direct employment using Irish materials within Ireland.  There is the further employment created further downstream in the processing of agricultural goods and the percentage of goods being processed within the State as against being exported live in the case of cattle is improving.</P>
      <P>One of the objects of taxation and economic policy generally is the achievement of what might be described as a regional balance in population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sorry that the Minister has not seen fit to make any comment on my suggestion that the anomalous situation created by this subsection is a situation in which <Col N="1142" /> farmers of between £20 and £60 valuation will continue to pay rates while those over £60 valuation will now be using their rates to pay their bills.  That seems to me extraordinary, because, if that is true, the continuing rates burden&mdash;I will not say anything about the rights and wrongs of rates in general&mdash;on the farmers in this particular income tax amounts to a wealth tax.  Would the Minister not agree this is a legitimate definition of it?  If it is a wealth tax, what are the farmers of the £20 and £60 valuations going to think of the fact that they alone of the farming community, in an era in which Fianna Fáil promised to abolish wealth tax, will continue to remain liable for it? Finally, what is the attitude of the Minister and the Government in general to the concept of average income tax to which, I understand the Government were committed at one stage?  That is something which should legitimately have found its way into this particular section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: If Deputy Horgan made that point before&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: On that point then, that is one of the items forming part of the discussion between the Revenue Commissioners and the farming organisations to which I referred in another context.  It does not appear in this Bill because some of the factors involved are rather complicated and require detailed working out to ensure they operate as intended and without causing disruption for farmers who are paying tax.  I expect that, arising out of the discussions, it will be possible to make that kind of provision in next year's Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the payments to be made by farmers between £20 and £60 valuation, I am not quite clear what Deputy Horgan has in mind since these are farmers who do not pay income tax and will only be paying rates.  If Deputy Horgan, as he appears to be doing, is urging that they should not be liable for rates, I suggest he is urging they should not be liable for either rates or income tax, which does not seem consonant with what he was saying earlier.  It is not clear to <Col N="1143" /> me what exactly he is advocating in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the question of the number of farmers liable, I think there is a good deal of&mdash;I will not say misrepresentation except, perhaps, in the case of a few people&mdash;misunderstanding of the position.  First, the generally accepted figure of the number of farmers is 170,000.  We do not know more accurately because the last census in the quinquennial system was not carried out, but the information available from An Foras Talúntais suggests that the correct figure is probably about 140,000. Of necessity, that has to be tentative. It is also quite misleading to talk about the number of farmers and the percentage of them liable for income tax, misleading because we all know that many people who are included in the category of farmer are people who under any system of income tax, as we have it today, would not be liable for income tax and, therefore, to include them as part of the calculation in arriving at what percentage pays tax is misleading.</P>
    <P>I said before&mdash;perhaps I should say it again now&mdash;that I would regard it as a more accurate measure to take the proportion of national income of different sectors of the community and the percentage contribution they make in income tax.  That is by no means a perfect measure.  Indeed, it suffers from somewhat similar defects as the ones I have pointed out because there would be a number of people categorised as farmers whose share of the national income would be quite small and who would not be contributing to income tax in any event and, to that extent, the figures would be distorted.  If one is looking for a kind of rough and ready measure I suggest it would be much more accurate to approach the calculation on that basis but, if one approaches on that basis, one still finds that the percentage contribution to income tax by the farming community is below that of other sections and there could be a very lengthy debate indeed on whether that should be so, or why it should be so, or why it is so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> I do not propose to pursue that at this stage except to say that I have made it clear all along that I believe that farmers who can afford to pay tax should pay their fair share of tax and that, despite what Deputy Horgan said, steps taken in recent years have not been very effective in this regard. There is good reason to believe&mdash;we dealt with some of the reasons on amendments on previous sections&mdash; that the provisions of this Bill and, in particular, this section will be more effective in securing a reasonable contribution to income tax from farmers who can afford to pay.  Obviously this is a matter that cannot be tested until the measures are in operation but there is good reason to believe, as I say, that they will be more effective than the measures adopted in recent years and, by effective, I do not merely mean effective in collecting more tax, which is an important factor, but in collecting more tax and, at the same time, not operating so as to produce a positive disincentive to farmers to increase production.  It is very easy for people to lose sight of the fact, when discussing this topic, that increased agricultural production in general accrues to the benefit not only of the farmers who produce the increase but to the benefit of the whole community.  This arises for two main reasons.  First, the great bulk of our agricultural products are exported and, secondly, and this point was touched on by Deputy Bruton, the off-farm employment, or employment which is in some sense a spin-off from agricultural production, is very important indeed.  Taking agriculture and employment in agricultural-based industry together we find that that accounts for more than half of our workforce.  For these reasons it is important that the tax structure should not operate to be a positive disincentive to farmers to increase production.</P>
    <P>While the provisions of this section could not by any stretch of the imagination be said to be ideal I believe they are a considerable improvement on the previous provisions in relation to income tax of farmers both from the point of view of yield and from the point of view <Col N="1145" /> of encouraging production or, at the very least, not discouraging production. Time alone will tell whether or not that is true, but that is my belief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister said he was unclear as to what precisely I was advocating.  I was not specifically advocating anything.  I was merely stating, and I contented myself with stating, the irony of the situation in which he has effectively removed a tax on fixed assets for the larger farmer and allowed it to remain on the smaller farmer, and this, from a Government which campaigned against the wealth tax.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 20, before section 14, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;Section 14 of the Finance Act, 1977, is hereby amended so as to allow free depreciation to be claimed for farm buildings in addition to the items of capital expenditure already listed therein.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow free depreciation to be claimed for farm buildings.  As I understand it, free depreciation is already allowed under the Finance Act, 1977, to farmers in respect of most investments, land improvement, constructing fences, roadways, holding yards, drains, land reclamation and so on&mdash;I understand similar provisions apply in relation to machinery&mdash;but there is not any allowance for farm buildings.  In my opinion there should be an allowance for farm buildings on the same favourable basis. The erection of farm buildings is labour intensive.</P>
      <P>In the case of farm buildings the allowance is at a rate of 10 per cent for ten years.  The case for free depreciation on farm buildings is strong in view of the high employment content involved in the construction of these buildings and also the fact that the materials are indigenous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: In certain kinds of cases and for certain types of farmers and <Col N="1146" /> the work they are doing, a good case could be made for this amendment. Obviously, acceptance of this amendment would have to apply across the board. I would have no difficulty with this if the system of taxing farmers was the same as the system for taxing other traders and businessmen, but of course it is not.  There are, and there have to be, substantial differences if one is to recognise certain distinctive features of farming.</P>
      <P>A short time ago we dealt with one of the special features which had been introduced and that relates to the treatment of rates.  That treatment of rates is not provided for any other kind of taxpayer.  That is just one example and there are a number of others.  In present circumstances it seems that the allowances and concessions which have been provided for in relation to farmer taxation are considerable and I would not feel justified in extending that at this time.  I am not saying this should never be done or that it would never be appropriate to farmer taxation, because it might well be done at some time, but I do not think it is at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am still not entirely happy about the comparison between the allowance a farmer can get for a farm building and that for farm machinery.  I am subject to correction by the Minister on what I am about to say, but I understand that the capacity for depreciation for the farmer is more favourable for machines than it is for buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is bad from a national point of view.  As the Minister is aware, the bulk of our farm machinery is imported&mdash;we manufacture very little farm machinery&mdash; whereas the labour and the bulk of the material for farm buildings are indigenous. There is practically no import content in farm building whereas there is a very substantial import content in farm machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the general considerations of tax equity introduced by the Minister into this discussion, from a <Col N="1147" /> national point of view there is a case to have at least equivalent encouragement for farm buildings as there is for farm machinery.  I would ask the Minister, if he cannot meet my amendment immediately to see how the position of farm buildings can be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The basic reason for the difference in treatment of farm buildings as against farm machinery is that we are talking here of depreciation and machinery will depreciate much faster than buildings.  The allowance therefore is bigger in respect of machinery.  The other factors I mentioned are applicable in considering free depreciation on farm buildings.  I have already indicated that I do not rule out the possibility of this at some time in the future but I do not think it is appropriate at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Considerable play has been made of the importance of relating tax concessions generally to employment content and creation.  In terms of agricultural taxation there is no way one could have a greater and more immediate effect on employment in rural areas than by the encouragement of building on farms.  I would ask the Minister to look at this again from the point of view of (a) employment and (b) the import/export situation. If he analyses the case I am making on those two criteria he will find the argument is as strong in the case of agriculture as it is for industrial buildings.  There is free depreciation for industrial buildings but there is not for agricultural buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not want to repeat what I said, but for the record perhaps I should say that the present position in regard to the depreciation of farm buildings is not ungenerous.  It provides for an initial allowance of 20 per cent and then an annual allowance of 10 per cent.  This means effectively 30 per cent in the first year and 10 per cent each year thereafter.  This is not as generous as free depreciation but it is not ungenerous.</P>

      <P>: I support what has been said by Deputy O'Leary.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what is the <i>rationale</i> here, because it appears that no fundamental objection could be advanced to the original way of doing things in the sense that many farmers will have their harvest in by 31 October.  They would have got two months' grace in any case from the Revenue Commissioners in which to pay their tax bills.  It seems extraordinary to maintain that the double payment will involve the farming community in any real hardship.  It could almost be maintained, not only in relation to farmers but in relation to other taxpayers, that the ideal way to spread liability would be to spread it over the whole year, for example, by way of a number of monthly payments. Why was the Minister so impressed by the case made for the need to change the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: This was primarily because of the system of tax payment introduced by the Government supported by Deputy Horgan and which lead to enormous difficulties and complications especially in the case of farmers and of which I expect the Deputy has some knowledge. Certainly, there has been a good deal of public comment on the difficulties that arose.  The problems relate to the method of assessment, of appeal and of the calculation of what one thinks is due and then liability for interest <Col N="1149" /> in certain circumstances if the calculation is not accurate.  These various factors operated particularly harshly in the case of farmers.  With due deference to Deputy Horgan, I do not think he can suggest seriously that a system of payment by the month would be appropriate to farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am puzzled by the exact legal implication of this section which appears to have the effect of wiping out by law debts to the Revenue Commissioners that were created under law.  We all know of situations in which the Revenue Commissioners can waive liabilities in certain circumstances which appear to them to be genuine.  Despite their reputation the Revenue Commissioners are not always the most hard-hearted people in the world. However, I am wondering whether the Minister can indicate that there is any precedent for this kind of provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy may not realise that the debts to which he refers are debts that were created artificially in the sense that the mandatory method that applied to farmers obliged them to make a payment in September that was based on an imaginary figure. It might well transpire that they did not owe any income tax although they were obliged by law to make a payment. Failure in that regard would make them liable for interest at 1½ per cent per month on the payment that was not made.  As I have said these were artificial debts in many cases and not the kinds of debts Deputy Horgan is referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section gives effect to an announcement I made on 21 October 1977 that farmers who appealed against their 1977-78 assessment and who paid the first instalment of the tax before 1 January 1978 would not incur any interest charge on the overdue tax.  Deputies may recall that, in line with the provisions of last year's Finance Act, full-time farmers were <Col N="1150" /> in the first instance to be assessed to tax for the year 1977-78 on a mandatory notional basis and that they were required to pay the first instalment on the due date, which was 1 September 1977, notwithstanding any appeal or election for assessment on the accounts basis.  If the tax were not paid within two months from the date due there would arise an interest charge of 1½ per cent per month.  It was represented by the farming organisations that these special provisions which applied only to farmers constituted a hardship, particularly as the amount charged on the first instalment might represent the full amount of tax due for the year.  Accordingly, I made the announcement that where the first instalment was paid before 1 January 1978, the interest charge would not arise.</P>
    <P>This section gives effect to that proposal and provides also that any interest charge which arises&mdash;for example, where the tax was not paid in full before 1 January 1978&mdash;will be calculated by reference to the amount of tax which is found to be due on determination of the appeal and not by reference to the amount charged on the first instalment, the artificial amount, if I may call it that.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 43a:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (1), line 9, in the definition of &ldquo;exempted transactions&rdquo;, after &ldquo;agency&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and, for the purposes of this exclusion, the sale of a commodity by an agricultural society or a fishery society to a person other than the intervention agency shall be deemed to be a sale by the agricultural society or the fishery society, as the case may be, to the intervention agency if that commodity is ultimately sold to the intervention agency&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to prevent a society from benefiting from indirect sales into intervention.  A co-operative society that sells directly to an intervention agency would be excluded from <Col N="1151" /> the relief in the existing provisions in section 17 (1), excluding sales to the intervention agency.  However, there is a distinct possibility that dairy products may be sold by a co-operative society to a subsidiary company or even to another co-operative society for resale to an intervention agency.  A society might sell their products at a normal profit to a subsidiary company.  Such a sale would not be excluded in accordance with the present wording of section 17 (1) and the transaction would be an exempted transaction of the society.  The subsidiary company would then sell to the intervention agency at a low profit or at cost so that tax on the true profit on the sale into intervention would be minimised or avoided totally.</P>
    <P>This amendment would secure that such sales would not be regarded as exempted transactions of the society in the event of the commodities being sold ultimately to the intervention agency by an intermediary.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 23, subsection (2) (d), between lines 3 and 4 to insert a new subparagraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii)  shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is given&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments in the names of various Deputies from these benches seek to tighten up the method of registration, of recognition and of the granting of certificates by the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Minister for Fisheries entitling certain organisations and societies to be treated in an advantageous way for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments and the subsection to which they relate refer back in a sense both to the definition of a fisheries society and to subsection (2) (b) in relation to the granting of certificates. I am aware that effectively these subsections constitute a reenactment <Col N="1152" /> of the 1963 Act.  There is something of an anomaly here in the sense that, whereas a fishery society is defined in a certain way, subsection (2) (b) suggests that the Minister for Finance may on the recommendation of the Minister for Fisheries give a certificate entitling a society to be treated for the purposes of this section as a fishery society notwithstanding that one or both of the conditions in paragraph (a) of the definition of &ldquo;fishery society&rdquo; is or are not complied with in relation to the society.</P>
    <P>This creates possibly an anomalous situation in which the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Fisheries can recognise almost anything as a fishery society they choose to.  While we are not suggesting that they will necessarily go out and recognise something totally different from a fishery society as a fishery society, we feel it is time to put into the legislation greater negative safeguards to ensure parliamentary scrutiny of any certificates granted by the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Minister for Fisheries.  The first part of our amendment insists that a certificate of this sort shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is given. This is common with many statutory instruments and we see no reason why a certificate like this, which could have substantial tax implications for the society concerned, should not be added to the list of statutory instruments which are required to be presented to us here.</P>
    <P>The second amendment, if agreed, would create a situation in which the Dáil may take the initiative in revoking such a certificate if it believes that the procedures have been in any way abused.  As far as I know, there is no other provision in the legislation for the revocation of a certificate other than by the person who granted it, namely, the Minister for Finance. We believe that this is a power which should more properly be exercised by the Oireachtas as a whole rather than by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The provision here is one which was incorporated in section 70 of the Finance Act, 1963, and for <Col N="1153" /> the same reasons it is incorporated here.  The purpose of the provisions in subsection (2) of the section is to enable a society to qualify for relief under this section where its membership is less than the prescribed number &mdash;50 in the case of an agricultural society or 20 in the case of a fishery society&mdash;and/or a majority of its members are not farmers or fishermen. The reason it is provided in this, and was contained in the 1963 Act, is that it was found impossible to frame a definition of an agricultural or a fishery society which would be flexible enough to cover all societies to which it was desired to give relief. For instance, a genuine agricultural society might have fewer than 50 members or its membership might include other agricultural societies. That is a common situation.  Sometimes it can include a few local traders or professional people who may be of considerable importance to the success of that society.  The certificate of the Minister for Finance is given only on the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Fisheries after a thorough examination of the affairs of the society involved.  Such an examination may well entail the production to the Ministers of confidential information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The certificate, when issued, is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  If objections are raised or if abuse of the tax privilege is shown, the Minister for Finance may revoke the certificate. Notice of revocation must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  In all, 56 co-operative societies were certified as agricultural societies for the purposes of the former relief, mainly where fewer than 50 farmers were involved or the society had members who were themselves agricultural societies. Certification was refused in one case. No societies were certified as fishery societies.  If, as is proposed in this amendment, there was to be a meaningful review by Dáil Éireann of a certificate given in respect of a society it would almost inevitably lead to the disclosure of confidential information on the basis of which the certificate was given.  It is possible that in some circumstances the disclosure <Col N="1154" /> of such information could be quite damaging to the competitive position of a society.</P>
    <P>I consider that the existing safeguards&mdash;consultation by the Minister for Finance with another Minister, publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of the fact that the certificate has been issued and the power of revocation&mdash;which were all incorporated in the original legislation in 1963, are sufficient to prevent any abuse of the relief.  I am not aware of&mdash;I do not think Deputy Horgan is sugesting this&mdash;that there has been any case which would give cause for complaint under the existing legislation.  If any objections were raised by Deputies or other persons with regard to the certification of a particular society those objections would be fully taken into account and the powers of revocation that are provided for in the section can, and will be, resorted to if it can be shown that a certificate was wrongly given.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas where this kind of procedure operates. Under section 70 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, which is concerned with Shannon relief the Minister for Finance may give a certificate that such trading activities of a qualifying company as are specified in the certificate are exempted trading activities. He may revoke the certificate on the breach of any of the conditions which are set out in it.  The Minister's powers to certify include the certification after consultation with the Minister for Tourism and Transport of trading operations which in his opinion contribute to the use or development of Shannon Airport.  If such certificates were to be subject to the requirement that they be laid before the Dáil, with the possibility of revocation after the debate in the Dáil, the kind of procedure suggested here, the climate of uncertainty that would result, would hardly be in the interests of the development of Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>A similar provision operates in regard to the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Act, 1974, which provides that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy may issue a certificate and directions may be given by the Minister for Finance for the <Col N="1155" /> purpose of reducing tax in respect of marginal mines under section 10 of that Act.  This kind of procedure is not confined to co-operative societies. The procedure proposed in the amendments would not be an improvement for the reasons I mentioned.  I am not aware of any complaints in regard to the manner in which the existing procedure has operated since 1963.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 59 and 60, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) (a)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, where, a company to which this section applies, claims and proves as respect a 1978 or 1979 period <Col N="1156" /> that it complies with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (d) of subsection (2) of this section, corporation tax shall, notwithstanding the provisions of sections 1 and 79 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, be charged on the profits of the company from the sale of goods manufactured in the State at the rate of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>(b)  Paragraph (a) shall apply in relation to a 1978 and 1979 period, subject to the provisions of subsections (4), (5) and (6).</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to amend an amendment to section 25 of the Finance Act, 1977, which gave certain reliefs from corporation tax to companies that complied with two rules.  One rule was that their sales volume increased by a certain percentage and the other was that the number of people they employed increased by 3 per cent as measured by the insurance stamps they purchased.  Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1977 is the relevant section, which reads:</P>
    <P>... &ldquo;specified trade&rdquo; means a trade which, in each relevant period for which a claim is made under this Chapter consists wholly of the manufacture of goods in the State: Provided that&mdash;(a) a trade shall be regarded as consisting of the manufacture of goods in the State in a relevant period if the amount receivable by the person carrying on the trade from the sale in the period of goods manufactured in the State in the course of the trade is not less than 90 per cent of the total amount receivable by the person from all sales made in the course of the trade in the period ...</P>
    <P>This was a novel idea when it was introduced in the 1977 Act.  The Minister is wise in removing the sales necessity clause from those who are applying for the relief because the sales and employment sections overlapped.  Most companies would not increase their staff unless they had an increase in sales.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that the number of people to whom it applied appeared to be restricted and I am sure the Minister has had representations <Col N="1157" /> in that regard.  The 90 per cent manufacturing level excluded companies that were engaged in manufacturing and were also distributors of other goods.  Instead of having a 90 per cent level of sales as a condition for a claimant, the Minister should adopt the format in the export tax relief which is that that proportion of their sales which is manufacturing and which complies with the other conditions would entitle them to claim a 25 per cent rate of corporation tax on that proportion of their total sales that is manufacturing, whether it be 40 per cent, 90 per cent or 75 per cent. The profits on the balance of their trade would be liable to a 45 per cent rate of tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have received representations from different quarters in regard to this matter, as Deputy P. Barry has surmised.  In reply to those representations I pointed out what the problem is and I also tried to point out the solution.  Any company which feels itself to be adversely affected by the provision in the Bill can transfer the non-trading income it has to an associated company and thus ensure that its non-trading income will not prevent the application of the 25 per cent rate of tax to its trading profits.  It is a relatively simple solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry's amendment would require different rates of tax to be applied to different elements of a company's profit.  The whole basis of the corporation tax system is that a company's overall profit is taxed at one rate. There is a procedure whereby the various elements are brought together and a single rate of tax is finally applied.  Deputy Barry's amendment would unfortunately affect that basic element and would create serious complications. If there was no other way out of it I suppose we would have to contemplate that, serious as the complications would be.  There is a relatively simple way out of the difficulty for any company that feels itself adversely affected.  In the circumstances I feel that that solution to the problem is preferable to the one advocated in this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: How are companies assessed that are engaged in selling on the home and export market and whose profits from exports are free of tax and whose profits on home sales are taxable?  I presume there is an answer hidden somewhere in what the Minister said earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is hidden in what I said in the sense that the proportion of the total profit attributable to exports is taken to determine the amount of export sales relief on the basis of a single rate of tax, but it is a fairly rough and ready method.  By adopting the method of hiving-off the non-trading profit, one could get an accurate measure of the profit which should be subjected to the special 25 per cent rate of tax.  In the case of the export tax relief, only one rate is applied and this is basic to the whole system.  The method used in export sales relief does not give as accurate a result as would be given by hiving-off the non-trading profit, which would overcome any of the difficulties envisaged. On reflection I think Deputy Barry would probably agree with me that since there is a relatively simple solution to it it is better to take that rather than attack what is the fundamental element of the whole corporation profits tax structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Obviously the Minister and his advisers are much more knowledgable in this field than I, but I cannot see how this attacks any basic concept.  The amount of profits earned from export must be assessed in the case of a company that trades in both the export and home markets; otherwise one cannot arrive at a tax charge for that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I may have misled the Deputy in what I said earlier.  But I understand that the method used in the case of export sales relief is that the company's profit, overall, is assessed to tax at one rate.  Then there is a remission of portion of that tax which is calculated by reference to the proportion of the company's turnover which is exported as against the proportion which is not exported. That division is made on the basis of <Col N="1159" /> turnover rather than profit.  I think I may have indicated earlier that it was done on the basis of profit; in fact it is done on the basis of turnover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: That makes it simpler because if one credits that company with the proportion of tax that is due and one gets that proportion of the ratio of its home sales to its export sales to total turnover, then it seems to me to be a simple thing to do exactly the same under this subsection so that the turnover would be divided between the manufacturing sector of the company and the agency, or whatever other section it would be, of the company.  One would divide the profits accordingly and charge one at 25 per cent and the other at 45 per cent.  It is a different set of sums on one portion of it only.  I do not see that it is any great problem.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept the Minister's word for that but they do not appear very obvious to me nor do they appear to be insurmountable.  The Minister's second solution&mdash;the hiving off of one company&mdash;of course is the neat way of doing it.  I am talking about small companies who would not have an experience of that kind in the breaking up of companies, nor would they necessarily have the money to set up a separate company.  Their traditional method of trading for perhaps 100 years has been to lump it all together where there might be two, three or four different sources of turnover and, consequently, different sources of profit accruing in bulk to the company. Their auditors&mdash;and probably the income tax people&mdash;could make a very accurate guess as to which amount of profit was apportionable between any section of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> If the amendment I am suggesting to the Minister is not acceptable, there is another way which would certainly help the employment situation and would allow many more firms to claim under this section, and that would be to reduce the 90 per cent to the 75 per cent.  Many companies in Ireland&mdash; if they manufacture something, if they have a sales force and a distribution network covering all of the Republic &mdash;have tended over the years to take on other lines on an agency basis to offset some of the overheads of the heavy distribution costs there are here where too high a proportion of the population is concentrated on the eastern seaboard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am rather afraid that adoption of Deputy Barry's last suggestion might not be as helpful to the overall national interest as he thinks. For instance, by making the requirement 75 per cent, one could find that the other 25 per cent was the sale of imported goods and that one was not contributing at all to employment.</P>

      <P>: Yes, it is not terribly attractive.  On the other hand, the solution I have suggested, considering the difference in tax rates involved, would not be regarded by most people as unduly troublesome or expensive. Indeed, they could carry on administration of their business in virtually the same way as before except that there would be separate accounting for the different companies.  On balance I feel it is the easiest and neatest way of approaching the problem.</P>

      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;which are a very important part of our economy and to which I do not think any of us ever paid sufficient attention or seen sufficiently the problems they have.  These are businesses passed on from father to son, who have not <Col N="1161" /> been dealing with solicitors, bankers, accountants to any great degree except perhaps for the purpose of drawing up wills, forming a limited company and once a year bringing in accountants to audit their books and whom they consider charge them too much anyway.  They have tended to avoid the professional side of their businesses, wrongly.  There might be great scope for each of those small firms increasing their work force by two, three, four or even five people under this section if they could be persuaded that they could claim without too great a cost or effort to themselves. Small businessmen generally tend to fear accountants, solicitors and people of that type.</P>

      <P>In page 27, line 60, to delete &ldquo;paragraph (c)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;paragraphs (b) and (c) (i)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned here that the amended sales test for 1977 brought in under this paragraph would permit <Col N="1162" /> a company to claim that the amount receivable from sales in 1977 was not less than 119 per cent of the amount receivable from sales in 1976.  But the income test itself under the section has not been amended.  So there is the position that this, rather than the sales test, now becomes a bone of contention. Therefore the provision, without amendment, remains illogical, because if a company meets the test then all of its income is taxed at 25 per cent, whereas if it misses the test by a small amount&mdash;all of its income is taxed at 45 per cent.  That is the point to which we seek in this paragraph to draw attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I think it would be correct to say, and no doubt Deputy O'Leary will correct me if I mis-state the position, that the effect of these amendments in respect of 1978 and 1979 would be, first, to remove the requirement that not less than 95 per cent of the total income of a company is to be income from a specified trade and to confine the 25 per cent rate of corporation tax to income directly attributable to manufacturing; secondly, to provide for an annual increase in the employment contribution of 5 per cent instead of the 3 per cent provided for in the Bill; thirdly, to retain the requirement regarding an increase in current money terms in sales of goods manufactured by a company, the annual increase being the increase in the consumer price index, or other appropriate index, plus 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the first point, the removal of the 95 per cent limit, that in effect was the substance of Deputy Barry's last amendment and I do not think I need go back over that again. With regard to confining the special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax to income directly attributable to manufacturing, I think I dealt with this on an earlier amendment by Deputy O'Leary when I pointed out, putting it in simple terms, that a job is a job and as far as we are concerned a job in manufacturing is very desirable in the sense that it would apparently lead to the creation of at least one other job in services or distribution.  It does not follow from that that one <Col N="1163" /> should not encourage the creation of jobs in services or distribution.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into detail on this because we went into it on another amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to increasing the requirement for employment content from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, obviously there is room to argue in relation to this but I think that the guiding principles must be, first of all, to accept that the object is to get an increase in employment, but if you set the target too high then you will achieve less than if you set a lower target.  If the attainment of the target is too difficult many companies will not attempt to attain that target, despite the incentive given. You have to try to balance the incentive against the target.  The target of 3 per cent is, as the Deputy knows, one that was not set by me but by him and his colleagues in the previous Government.  I do not know that we have sufficient information at this stage to say either that that target is too high or too low, but certainly I would be slow to increase that target of 3 per cent unless there was evidence to show that the 5 per cent suggested in the amendment could be attained by the incentive provided here.  Our overall consideration and care must be to try to ensure that additional employment does accrue as a result of giving this incentive.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggested amendment of the test relating to increased sales, quite apart from the method by which this should be measured, and that is dealt with in these amendments, as the Deputy is aware I have proposed in this Bill to abolish altogether that requirement of increased sales.  I have done that basically for two reasons.  One of them was referred to by Deputy Barry when he said that a firm would not in the normal way engage further staff if they are not increasing their sales.  That is a reasonable proposition.  The other reason is that the principle we have here is the encouragement of the creation of jobs. To the extent that we can encourage increased sales and increase production this is very much to be desired but I would think it very unfortunate if the <Col N="1164" /> incentive could, if related solely to jobs, potentially cause jobs to be created but if it is also related to sales would prevent the actual creation of those jobs.  That would be a result which we would all regret and deplore. The best way to ensure that it does not happen is to remove the requirement in regard to increased sales and to concentrate on the real object of this incentive, that is, the encouragement of the creation of new jobs.  For these reasons, I feel that these various amendments, if I summarise them correctly, would not improve the position and might in some cases disimprove the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: In these amendments we have a rather puritanical lining to these exemptions to be given to companies by tying them to particular results or ensuring that the exemptions would elicit particular actions on the part of the enterprises concerned, either in sales or in employment. I take the Minister's point that if there are too many criteria built in here conditions could be considered, perhaps in some justice, in conflict one with the other.  However, surely there is a case to be made for attempting to link the concessions made here to a reasonably high employment target. The Minister is right in saying that we do not have any scientific evidence of the result of the 3 per cent target of the previous administration but if it is very frequently on the lips of the present administration that the private sector remains the major engine of growth, surely we should be insisting on targets, if not in the sales area then in the employment area, in return for which in the manufacturing area these exemptions would be afforded.</P>

      <P>: I am concerned over all this section as to the relative return in extra employment, whether we have worked it out fully or whether we are flying in the dark in handing out these exemptions while not quite clear about the size of company that will give us the greatest yield in expanded and increased employment, which is presumably the social reasoning behind this on the part of the Government. I question whether the kind of employment which they expect to come from the private sector will, in fact, eventuate.  But, if that is their thinking, let us assume that they are working towards it, if there is any point in it.  On past performance one tends to doubt that the kind of results they are looking for would come.  Is the Minister fully satisfied, even accepting his criteria and assumptions that he is getting the maximum employment yield for the exemptions handed out to companies under these various tax bands?  Has any work been done on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Obviously the question whether this kind of incentive will work or not can only at present be a matter for surmise.  It will be some time before it can be tested.  So, I do not think there is much point in wasting time arguing on something that cannot be determined and will not be determinable for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the category of firm involved in this, I am sure the Deputy will <Col N="1166" /> appreciate that it would be unwise to rely unduly on the larger firms to produce the extra employment required. There is a strong case for saying that one may well get better results from smaller firms that are growing and many of which, hopefully, will become larger firms.  These are the kind of firms that would have the dynamic to produce employment in a way that some of the larger firms will not.</P>
    <P>There is also the factor that most of the smaller firms coming within the category dealt with in this section tend to be Irish-based and Irish-owned&mdash; not all, but most.  Within the international constraints under which we have to operate I think that in general the House would favour concessions which would at least encourage if not strengthen the position of Irish-based but particularly Irish-owned companies. It is true, as Deputy O'Leary either said or suggested, that we have no scientific evidence in regard to the particular category of firm affected by this&mdash;at least it is not available to me at present&mdash;but it is also true that experience suggests that in the category of firms concerned here there is a number of potentially dynamic firms, those most likely to avail of concessions of this kind and thereby not only benefit themselves but also assist in the attainment of our overall objective; the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>The other factor I have mentioned in regard to Irish-owned firms is, I think, also a relevant consideration in relation to this section.</P>

    <P>This is the amendment in which we are seeking that, in the case of hotels, writing down allowances will only apply to hotels registered by Bord Fáilte.  We seek to ensure that standards will be upheld in the establishments covered under the section.  That is the intention of the amendment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support the amendment. I am sorry I did not think of it myself as an ex-Minister in charge of tourism.  It is essential that the Government do nothing that appears to encourage or help people who supply accommodation to tourists and who do not meet a certain standard, the standard that has been traditionally very carefully overseen by Bord Fáilte.  So, in their interest as well as in the general interest of the economy, we should ensure that the State does nothing that appears to encourage or by omission or implication could encourage people who are not registered with Bord Fáilte as providers of accommodation for tourists.</P>

      <P>: I am in considerable sympathy with the case made for this amendment but, as usual in cases of this kind, the matter is more complicated than it appears on its face. When industrial building allowances were introduced in 1956 one of the categories included in the definition of an industrial building was:</P>
      <P>a building or structure in use for the purposes of the trade of hotel keeping.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;hotel keeping&rdquo; was not defined.  Presumably it was not intended at the time that the allowance should be confined to registered hotels, because if it had been it would have been possible to achieve this by the appropriate definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: I think there was.  We are talking here only about a very <Col N="1168" /> small number of businesses, because under the Tourist Traffic Act it is unlawful to describe any premises as a hotel unless the premises are registered with Bord Fáilte.  All we are talking about, in effect, are premises that are not described as hotels but which are carrying on a trade which is that of hotel keeping and claim that to the Revenue Commissioners.  Under existing law such people are entitled to certain allowances, initial allowances and annual allowances.  What is involved in this section is something new, free depreciation.  The difficulty I have is that, if we confine the provision to registered hotels, I am advised that that will have the effect of removing from the admittedly small category I described, who are carrying on the trade of hotel keeping but whose premises are not described as hotels, what they have already, which is the initial allowance and the annual allowance.</P>

As only a small number have enjoyed this facility up to now, surely there is a possibility of a short phasing-in period to ensure that these people, who are not registered, come up to the standards set by Bord Fáilte? We are anxious to ensure that standards are uniform from the point of view of excellence and any exemptions given of a tax nature should be tied to the necessity on the part of the beneficiary to ensure that his facilities come up to the same standards as those of others in the business. Surely there should be some means of phasing-in the small number involved. This Bill could be used to bring that about.</P>

I am primarily concerned with the taxation aspect but, as I have indicated, I am in full sympathy with the idea behind the amendment, which is to confine the new concession of free depreciation to hotels registered with Bord Fáilte.  The best I can do is to ask Deputies, given that I favour the principle, to withdraw the amendment and I will have another look at it between now and Report Stage.  I imagine we will be able to <Col N="1169" /> find some solution.

The broad purpose of it is to provide that, where a taxpayer would have been entitled to tax allowance in respect of capital expenditure made by himself, he will be entitled to the same allowance if he makes the contribution through a local authority.  Some cases have arisen, and more are likely to arise, in which for various reasons, including perhaps economy, a scheme is carried out by a local authority rather than by an individual firm but the local authority obliges the firm to contribute its share of the cost.  As the law stands, if the firm were paying the money itself for the carrying out of the work, it would be entitled to the allowance.

      <P>: I move amendment No. 68:</P>
      <P>In page 32, between lines 41 and 42, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Section 31 of the Finance Act, 1975, is hereby amended by the substitution for subsection (2) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Subject to the following provisions of this section, if&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> (a)  a company carries on in an accounting period a trade in respect of which it is within the charge to income tax under Case I of Schedule D, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the value of the company's trading stock at the end of the accounting period (in this section referred to as its `closing stock value') exceeds the value of its trading stock at the beginning of the accounting period (in this section referred to as its `opening stock value'),</P>
    <P>the company shall, in the computation for the purposes of income tax of its trading profits, be entitled to a deduction under this section by reference to the amount not exceeding the increase in the Consumer Price Index, as applied to the opening stocks, for the period of that excess as if the deduction were a trading expense incurred in the accounting period; and in the following provisions of this section the amount of that excess is referred to as the company's `increase in stock value'.</P>
    <P>This is our amendment to the section on stock relief.  The Minister's argument is that the amendment will not be required because inflation is supposedly now under control and there is probably less reason for retaining it in its present form.  We are not as sanguine as the Minister and that is why we put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The purpose of this amendment seems to be to restrict the excess of the value of a company's closing stock for an accounting period over its opening stock value for that period to an amount computed by applying to the opening stock the percentage increase in the consumer price index for that period.  The restricted deduction would, therefore, be calculated by reference to the price increase during the accounting period as measured by the increase in the consumer price index on the assumption that the volume of trading stock remains unchanged between the commencement and the terminal date of the accounting period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> The CPI is not the most effective way of measuring matters of this kind.  It is, perhaps, less effective in this area than in some other areas. Certain kinds of stock may rise much more rapidly in value than the CPI. Far fewer cases, but there would be some, would rise less rapidly than the CPI.  One can think of cases where the rise would be far greater than the rise in the CPI and therefore the application of CPI could give quite unrealistic results.  The purpose of stock relief is to ease liquidity or cash flow problems for traders whose resources are strained owing to increased investment in trading stocks. The relief makes no distinction between the increase in value of trading stocks attributable to price changes, to volume changes, or to a combination of both.</P>
    <P>The consumer price index does not provide a basis for measuring price changes in trading stocks which would be acceptable to traders generally. Even if it were possible satisfactorily to isolate changes in stock values attributable solely to price increases, it is questionable whether as a matter of policy stock relief should take account only of such increases.</P>
    <P>Traders can minimise the effect of price rises by judicious purchase of commodities at prices which in their judgment are likely to be lower than the prices which these commodities would ultimately reach.  The average cost price of the commodities is thus kept lower than it would otherwise be.  In some cases at least the benefit of that would accrue to the customers of the trader.</P>
    <P>If we were to accept this amendment it would have a very serious disincentive effect on that kind of anticipatory purchases of commodities by traders and could as a consequence have an effect, possibly serious, on employment and on the price levels of finished goods.  On these grounds and on the grounds of the unsuitability of the consumer price index for measuring changes in stock values attributable to price changes, I do not think the amendment is acceptable.</P>

      <P>If one accepts the principle of stock relief&mdash;at the moment stock relief only applies to manufacturers, builders, farmers and those who directly supply these three categories&mdash;it should be available to all traders.  The purpose of my amendment is to give stock relief to all traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The categories to which stock relief applies are, as stated by Deputy Barry, manufacturing, construction operations, farming and the sale of goods, excluding passenger road vehicles, to a person engaged in any of these three activities.  The effect of what the Deputy is proposing would be to extend stock relief to all trading operations, wholesale and retail. It is true, and Deputy Barry may have personal knowledge of this, that when stock relief was introduced representations were made to this effect.  Obviously there is a limit to the extent to which relief can be given in this field having regard to the resources of the Exchequer.  I understand that the approach at the time was to try to place the relief where it would do the most good and where it was most needed.  It was felt that that was in relation to manufacturing, construction and farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal idea behind it was to relieve companies which had particularly difficult liquidity problems but <Col N="1173" /> it would seem to be impossible to produce an extension of the existing scheme which would be restricted to trades with particularly difficult liquidity problems.  Therefore, if you want to extend the existing scheme in practice you would have to extend it to all trading activities.  As I said, the primary consideration in not extending the relief to all traders was the cost, which is now estimated at £8 million in a full year.  Accordingly the relief was confined to manufacturing, construction and farming and persons supplying them, because it appeared that the need for expansion of production and employment, and the possibilities of doing so, were most evident in those areas.</P>
    <P>The granting of stock relief to persons who carry on, say, distributive trades, would be unlikely to increase, except perhaps marginally, their volume of sales or to achieve a significant increase in employment in those trades. If you did extend it in that way, cash businesses&mdash;such as supermarkets and other distributive businesses which have quick turnover of stocks and obtain a reasonable period of credit from their suppliers&mdash;might I think with reason be said not to merit the advantage of such stock relief, at least to the same extent as persons supplying goods to the manufacturing, construction or farming sectors.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should mention.  It is incidental to this but is of considerable relevance from the point of view of the Minister for Finance.  As the Deputy knows, unlike Britain, we do not have advance corporation tax which is payable in Britain to the Revenue by companies when they are paying dividends.  What happens here is that there is no advance corporation tax but people are credited with tax in respect of dividends paid and in some cases, depending on their individual circumstances, can actually claim refunds of cash from the Revenue.  This happens even in cases where because of various allowances available to the companies paying the dividends, the corporation tax to cover the refunds, or the credit, is not received by the Revenue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> To provide stock relief of this kind across the board would add to that problem.  It arises at the moment in regard to the various kinds of allowances given, depreciation and so on, but the proposed amendment would add to it.  It is a problem at the moment that the Revenue are obliged to give credit and in some cases actually make cash refunds out of tax notionally received from companies but in fact not received.  In a few cases it may be received later, but in all other cases it will never be received, unlike the position in Britain where they have an advance corporation tax.</P>
    <P>While the Deputy may not regard this as a relevant argument on this amendment, as Minister for Finance I have to regard it as relevant.  Anything that would extend that situation is something I would have to view with great concern.  However, even on its merits, I feel the case for the amendment is not sufficiently strong to justify the arguments against it.</P>

      <P>: I understand the point the Minister is making about supermarkets and people further down the line not getting extended credit from their suppliers and not being affected to the same extent by the increase in the cost of their stock, but the restrictions in this regard are rather stringent.

      <P>: Therefore, if inflation is decreasing, closing stock compared with opening stock is unlikely in many cases to exceed 20 per cent of the profits of a company.  I would accept the point made by the Minister about some traders at the retail level who get extended credit and who are not affected to the same extent by increased stock values, but there are similar categories of suppliers not supplying to the three categories mentioned here&mdash;the manufacturers, the builders and the farmers &mdash;who are supplying people other than those and who see their competitors <Col N="1175" /> being able to avail of stock relief while it is not available to themselves.  As inflation decreases the numbers benefiting from stock relief will become fewer.</P>

      <P>: I appreciate the problems that arise in the kind of cases outlined by the Deputy but perhaps this kind of apparent anomaly is inevitable unless one extends the relief across the board.  If a line is drawn anywhere there is bound to be the kind of problem mentioned by Deputy Barry.  If we were to extend the relief across the board we would have problems of cost and there would be inappropriateness in the kinds of cases I have outlined and there is also the consideration that the relief was intended primarily to assist firms with particular liquidity problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: In so far as it would assist particularly difficult liquidity problems it would help employment. That was the thinking behind it but the kind of difficulty mentioned by the Deputy whereby a firm would not benefit from the relief while their competitors would so benefit is only marginally a case for extending the relief as proposed by him.  It is much more a case for more equitable treatment as between one taxpayer and another, a sentiment that is laudable in its own way but which is not very easy to achieve especially in the context of a relief which was not introduced and which is not intended to be introduced for the purpose of achieving equity of taxation but to meet an <i>ad hoc</i> problem of difficult liquidity situations arising out of inflation and other factors that were very acute when the measure was introduced.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 69a:</P>
      <P>In page 35, subsection (2), lines 2 and 3, to delete &ldquo;and 167 (2)&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;, 167 (2) and 178&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is required for the purposes of the next amendment, which is No. 69b.  The two amendments relate to fixed rate distributions, such as preference dividends, on stocks and shares which were in existence prior to 6 April 1976.  The present amendment provides that section 178 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, shall have effect, in relation to distributions made on or after 6 April, 1978, as if the standard rate for the year 1978-79 and subsequent years of assessment were 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>The amendment is a technical one necessitated by the proposed alteration by the next amendment of the rights of holders of the stocks and shares to which section 178 of the Act referred to applies.  The two amendments, taken together, will mean that companies will be required to pay to the holders of their fixed-rate stocks and shares in existence prior to 6 April 1976 net dividends amounting to 70 per cent of the former gross dividends, rather than 65 per cent thereof so that the proposed tax credit of 30/70ths and the dividend paid will together equal the former gross dividend.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 69b, section 27 provides that the normal tax credit in respect of a dividend paid by an Irish company on or after 6 April 1978 will be reduced from 35/65ths of the dividend to 30/70ths of the dividend.  This amendment and the one immediately preceding it are concerned with fixed-rate distributions such as preference dividends on stocks or shares which were in existence prior to 6 April 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 178 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, was enacted in order to enable preference stocks or shares issued before 6 April 1976 to be classified on the same basis as preference stocks or shares issued on or after the date, that is, on the basis of the net dividend payable.  The Corporation Tax Act introduced <Col N="1177" /> a new concept in relation to dividends under which, broadly speaking, what was previously a gross dividend became a net dividend which carried a tax credit equivalent to the amount of the income tax formerly deductible from the gross dividend.</P>
    <P>Section 178 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, provides in effect that the right to a dividend on or after 6 April 1976 on fixed-rate stocks or shares is satisfied by the payment of a dividend equal to 65 per cent of the former gross dividend at the fixed rate.  The proportion of 65 per cent was fixed by reference to the year 1966-67 when the tax credit in respect of a distribution was 35/65ths of the distribution. The result was that the reduced dividend and the tax credit applicable equalled together the amount of the former gross dividend at the fixed rate. As the tax credit in respect of a distribution is now being reduced from 35/65ths to 30/70ths of the distribution, a distribution amounting to 65 per cent of the former gross dividend, together with a tax credit of 30/70ths, would no longer be equal to the former gross dividend and would amount only to 93 per cent approximately of that former gross dividend.  If the House wishes I can give an example of how this works out.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment provides that from 6 April 1978 the right to a dividend on fixed-rate stock in existence prior to 6 April 1976 will be satisfied by payment of an amount which, together with the tax credit applicable thereto on the date of payment, will equal the amount of the former gross dividend.  The purpose of the two amendments is to maintain the gross income to which holders of such stocks were entitled when the stocks were issued.  Prior to the introduction of corporation tax such persons received the gross dividend less tax at the standard rate but many holders of such stocks were exempt from tax so that effectively they were in receipt of a guaranteed income at the gross rate so long as the company could pay the dividend.  For that reason the amendments are designed to maintain at the same level the gross incomes to which <Col N="1178" /> the holders of these fixed-rate stocks were entitled.</P>

      <P>: I move amendment No. 69c:</P>
      <P>In page 36, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) (a)  This subsection applies to a distribution that is made by a company on or after the 6th day of April, 1978, and to which section 64 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, applies.</P>
      <P>(b)  The reference to certain tax credits in the definition of B in subsection (2) of the said section 64 shall, in relation to distributions to which the said section 64 applies and which&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> (ii)  were made before the date aforesaid,</P>
    <P>be construed as a reference to thirty-nine forty-ninths of those tax credits.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 64 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, provides for a reduced tax credit in the case of distributions out of income which has been relieved from tax under the exports sales relief.  In many cases, particularly where groups of companies are involved, this income will consist not only of trading income but of distributions from other companies which themselves carry a reduced tax credit because of export sales relief.  Where these distributions were received prior to 6 April 1978 the reduced tax credit is computed by reference to the standard rate of 35 per cent.  Where these distributions are redistributed by the recipient company on or after 6 April 1978 they will carry a tax credit computed by reference to the rate of 30 per cent.  Accordingly, it is necessary in relation to distributions received prior to 6 April 1978 to scale down the tax credits attaching to such dividends, that is B in the formula A + B/C in subsection (2) of section 64, by applying to them the fraction 39/49ths which represents the ratio which 30/70ths&mdash;the new fraction for calculating tax credits in respect of distributions made on or after 6 April 1978&mdash;bears to 35/65ths, the fraction for calculating tax credits in respect of distributions received before 6 April 1978.  This amendment is in relief of the general body of taxpayers, that is those liable to tax at the standard rate or higher rates.  I imagine that Deputies present will be relieved to hear that because I am sure my explanation is not very clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have referred already to points I raised on Second Stage and the effect this section will have on investors in Irish companies. I had hoped that the Minister's amendments would cover the points I made but they do not do so.  The Minister has told us that this section is consequential on last year's Finance Act when the rate of corporation tax was reduced from 50 per cent to 45 per cent.  With the tax credit applied this year at the new fractions shareholders generally in Irish companies will be receiving 7 per cent less in the way of dividends than they received up to now.  Shareholders in this sense means ordinary individuals and, just as important, it means charities and pension funds.  The Minister told me when replying to the Second Stage debate that if this was so it was a matter between the shareholders and the company involved if the dividend had been reduced by this amount.  The snag about this is that if the shareholders press for an increased dividend it can only be paid out of profits that were intended by the company to be retained hopefully for further investment and increased employment.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes of reducing the corporation tax last year to the 45 per cent level was to get companies to retain a larger proportion of their profits in the company rather than paying it in tax in the hope that they would invest this in job creation.  This year a measure is being introduced that will have the effect of the shareholders at their annual general meetings insisting on a greater proportion of the profits allowed to be retained by the companies to be distributed to them. If that is the case we are nullifying any good the introduction of the reduced rate of corporation profits tax brought about in the 1977 Finance Act.</P>

      <P>: In regard to the point made by Deputy Barry, it is possible to get into a very detailed and complicated argument on this issue but I do not think it is necessary to do so in order to understand what is involved. I am not making a party political point of this but it is important nevertheless to put it on the record that what is being done in this section was contemplated by my predecessor as a necessary consequence of the reduction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: I conceded that point when we were dealing with an earlier section, the 3 per cent increase in sales.  When these new measures are introduced there are things that appear necessary to be done at the time but with the experience of reliefs or concessions of this nature it is possible in 12 months time for one to change one's mind without any loss of face but for the good of the community. That is all I am doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy would be right to change his mind about certain matters to which he subscribed before if he thought it would improve the position to do so but I do not think he would be right to change his mind on this amendment.  My predecessor, speaking on the Second Stage debate on the last Finance Bill, as reported in the Official Report of 10 May 1977 at column 494 said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that provision is not being made in this Bill as regards the rate of tax credit which will apply to distributions made by companies which will have benefited from the reductions in corporation tax provided by these chapters; this matter will arise for attention and will be appropriately dealt with next <Col N="1182" /> year when distributions will fall to be made out of 1977 profits.</P>
    <P>I am saying that because I want to make it clear that it seemed to my predecessor, as it seems to me, that if you reduce the rate of corporation tax it follows logically that you must adjust the tax credit provided for in law. If you do not, you are simply providing for a bigger tax credit.  The fraction already laid down is inappropriate when there is a new rate of corporation tax.  This would be true whether the corporation tax rate were increased or reduced.</P>
    <P>If we look at what is involved in this matter it is clear that, if a company, in determining the dividends it is going to pay, distributes the same proportion of its post-tax income as last year, the shareholder is not going to lose anything; in fact he would be marginally better off.  If the company decides to distribute a smaller proportion of its profit in dividends than in the previous year, then the income of the shareholder will be reduced. That is an inevitable consequence for any shareholder of any company which decides to distribute a smaller proportion of its post-tax income than it did in the previous year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>: Unless the profits have grown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes.  The question of whether or not a company decides to distribute the same proportion as the previous year, or a larger proportion, or a smaller proportion, is a matter for the company and its shareholders and not a matter for the Revenue.  The Revenue are concerned with the tax levied and the tax credit to be given on the dividends.  The decision on the proportion of profit to be distributed is one for the company and its shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the company has 5 per cent extra available as a result of a reduction of 5 per cent in corporation tax and decides to maintain the proportion that it distributed last year, the effect of that would be to divide the additional money available between the company and the shareholders.  That will mean that the shareholders will more than <Col N="1183" /> maintain their income while the company will be getting a larger proportion of its profits available for reserve or re-investment than it had before. It is conceivable, and could be good practice, that a company would decide to reduce the amount of profit that it distributes by way of dividend and to plough back a bigger proportion of its post-tax income into the business. That is a matter for the company to decide.  If that decision results in a reduction in the income of the shareholders, it increases the value of the shares at the same time because there is a greater investment by the company. If he is losing in the short term he is gaining in the long term.  Either way, whatever happens to him is the result of a decision of the company and not of a decision of the Revenue. That being so, I believe that a number of the views expressed in regard to this section have been misconceived and have ignored or overlooked the point I have been making: that the decision in regard to the proportion of a company's profits to be distributed by way of dividend is not a matter for the Revenue.  The Revenue is concerned only with the method by which such profits and dividends should be taxed and tax credits given.</P>

      <P>In page 39, after line 17, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(3)  Section 47 of the Finance Act, 1977, is hereby amended by the substitution of `31st day of December, 1979' for `31st day of December, 1978' in each place where it occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment introduces an additional subsection to section 33 which deals with stamp duty on contracts <Col N="1184" /> relating to office buildings.  Subsection (1) abolishes stamp duty on contracts made on or after 14 April 1978 for the construction, alteration or enlargement of such buildings.  Contracts made before that date remain liable for duty.  Under existing legislation relief from stamp duty is available in respect of such contracts.  That relief is related to so much of the Construction, alteration or enlargement as is carried out in the period from 26 January 1977 to 31 December 1978.</P>
    <P>I have decided that this period should be extended to 31 December 1979 so that work undertaken next year will be taken into account to give relief to contracts that remain liable for stamp duty.  This decision is in line with the underlying reason for the abolition of the duty on new contracts, namely, to encourage the construction industry to boost its employment potential.  I might say also that it would seem to me to be illogical to have the position where earlier contracts were free from stamp duty, later contracts were free from stamp duty but the ones in between were liable. Part of the work under some of those in-between contracts might be exempt from stamp duty and part liable.  It seems to me that it is not a very logical position.  This amendment is designed to take what I might call the contracts in the middle out of liability, like those before and after them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>: This is the part of the Bill putting into effect Government proposals on the wealth tax.  It does not abolish the Wealth Tax Act itself.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>Wealth tax shall not be charged, levied or paid under the provisions of the Act by reference to any valuation date occurring on or after the 5th day of April 1978.</P>
      <P>We, in this House and outside&mdash;on other Stages of this Bill and again on this section&mdash;made the point that, in the first place, this section will mean a loss to the Exchequer in the current year of £8.5 million.  This amount of revenue to the Exchequer has been lost to the benefit of those who, if anyone is able, are certainly in a position to pay their fair contribution to the upkeep of the economy.</P>
      <P>The defence has been made by the Minister and his colleagues that the tax operated as a disincentive to industry and employment creation.  We would reply that no sound evidence whatever has been produced to show that the wealth tax, as operated by the previous Government, was a disincentive to industry or to employment creation.  There are perhaps some who would argue to the contrary.  The Minister made the point in his budget speech earlier this year&mdash;and would do so presumably now&mdash;that the wealth tax, in addition to being a disincentive to employment, operated as a disincentive to foreign investment here.  Again there is no evidence to support that view of its consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made throughout the controversy that the wealth tax&mdash;which this section seeks to delete&mdash;was some kind of unique measure unknown in any other country. Variants of the wealth tax operate in a great number of countries&mdash; Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Iceland, India, Sweden, Norway and for all I know, elsewhere further afield also. I am not convinced that its abolition would create one extra job.  A great deal has been made of the point that its abolition would bring about conditions in which extra jobs would be <Col N="1186" /> created in the economy.  No sound evidence has been adduced to suggest that these consequences would follow.  Possibly the strongest argument of all for its retention&mdash;if we are to hold autonomous groups in our community to fair bargains, if we are to maintain consensus in our community&mdash;is that justice must be seen to be done in the tax area.  By the elimination of that measure introduced by the previous Government I am afraid the Minister and this administration have given the all-clear to the creation of an even more unequal society than the one they inherited when they came into office.  The deletion of this section is at the very centre of the kind of actions this administration have been taking since coming into office, the kind of management of the economy which is producing, every day, even greater inequality in our already divided society.  It is obvious that it will not stop there.  By pinning our hopes on the kind of incentives offered in this section, by rewarding those already so amply rewarded in our society, by defending that action with such tawdry argument that employment would follow in its wake, we are giving the all-clear to the wealthy in our society that their day has come.  We are certainly suggesting that the only means of survival in the Ireland of today is to claim more, seek more and not worry about the justice of what one's position should be or what is one's claim.</P>
    <P>We made the point that by abolishing the wealth tax this administration gave an annual bonus of £2,000 to the 5,000 most wealthy in our society.  It is far from being the case that any benefits would accrue to the economy by this measure; in fact the reverse is the case.  It gives the all-clear to those who want to throw any objective criterion out of the window, those who desire no objective criterion when it comes to seeking monetary reward. The Government should be working towards&mdash;as they often say publicly they are working towards&mdash;bringing fairness into the economy, ensuring that inflation does not start up once more on a domestic basis.  Of course we all know that whilst a good deal of inflationary pressure comes from <Col N="1187" /> abroad, we also know that at home we can add to it by our actions.  If we at home suggest that the impact of our actions on employment can be ignored, that the administration of the day can put forward the argument that the economy will be improved by releasing from fiscal obligation in the taxation area the upper portion of our society, it is clear that we are releasing into our society an even stronger dose of envy than there is there already.  It is clear also that we encourage those whose slogan is comparability, those whose slogan is&mdash;out with objective reasoning in relation to claims.  Certainly we encourage and usher in the kind of casino society which is on the way here already.</P>
    <P>This measure has not been defended on logical grounds by this administration. They have suggested that this measure somehow, in some strange way, has an impact on employment. That case has not been made adequately and we have not been convinced by anything they have said.  If anybody from this administration could prove that employment would benefit by the deletion of this section, we would look at it again.  That case has not been made.  It is a specious argument, a very thin one which has been used over and over again and which does not stand up to rational argument.</P>
    <P>If there were sustainable complaints about the incidence of the wealth tax, if there were those who could maintain that their economic operations were suffering as a result of it, and if the Minister could say that cases had been brought to him where this tax appeared to damage good economic enterprise and could give the reasons to the House, this party would have heard his case and would give a great deal of attention to any changes he would suggest.  We were not treated to this kind of approach.  We were treated to an unsustainable case for the complete abolition of this tax.  It is important in the tax area that justice be seen to be done.  Justice was not seen to be done when this rather modest imposition on those who were <Col N="1188" /> in a position to pay was removed at one stroke as part of an election commitment&mdash;not on the basis of its benefit to the economy but, one suspects, for reasons having little to do with the economy.</P>
    <P>If a well-proven case could have been brought forward by the Minister to suggest that employment was suffering, that business had departed from the country, that others were contemplating departure, that investment was being pulled out, we would certainly have heard what objections there were to the tax and how the tax was bringing about that situation. I am not aware of any well-argued case being brought forward to prove these consequences of the tax.  I believe the tax was removed without a great deal of thought as to the consequences for the economy.</P>
    <P>Those people who welcomed its departure and who thoughtlessly came to the conclusion that this was a measure to restore business confidence may yet regret it.  It suggests to wage and salary earners that there is very little equity left in our taxation system.  They see this as the sign that this administration are not interested in justice in our taxation system. They understand the necessity for greater investment in job creation, but they cannot understand the order of priorities in which we have to borrow so much abroad and £8 million to £10 million is spent in the capital area in giving this kind of exemption.</P>
    <P>The case has not been made that employment will be improved by it. There are no sound economic arguments for this measure.  Highly emotive arguments have been put forward which have not been sustained. A good deal of the so-called unpopularity of this measure with the business community was based on a misunderstanding of its incidence and exaggerated claims about the numbers who would be involved.  It was a very modest measure which lay very lightly on those who came within its net.  I believe that they will be the first people to regret its passing when they see the consequences it may have on other sections in our society.</P>

      <P>: I suppose no measure introduced by any Government has provoked such controversy as section 36 of the Finance Bill, 1978, with the suspension of the wealth tax. The reason put forward by the Minister and his other colleagues in Government is that it caused the flight of money from this country during the years of its operation.  On the Second Stage of this Bill, on 24 May at column 1770 of the Official Report, I said to the Minister: &ldquo;The Minister is saying that there is evidence that the money went out&rdquo;.  The Minister replied: &ldquo;The Deputy is saying that there is evidence that the money did not go out, so we are in the same position&rdquo;. That is true.  The Minister has made this assertion on a number of occasions and has never produced one bit of evidence to support his contention that the wealth tax was responsible for money leaving the country.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that the wealth tax was one of the taxes which was introduced by the previous Government in substitution for estate duty, which was abolished by that Government as being an unfair duty.  We understood estate duty to be responsible for the breaking up of many farms and small businesses because it had to be paid at the time when the owner or principal shareholder in the business died and a fair sized proportion of what he owned had to be paid in estate duty.  We then introduced a number of taxes in substitution for what we considered to be a most unfair tax.  One of these was the wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the charges against the wealth tax is that it was responsible for money leaving the country.  In the three years before we came into office, the proportion of GNP which was devoted to fixed investment was 21.6 per cent in 1970, 22.7 per cent in 1971 and had been declining to 21.5 per cent in 1972.  In 1973 and 1974 the amount of investment increased and in 1975, at the height of the depression, it decreased again; but it decreased to 23.7 per cent and this is when the wealth tax, according to its opponents, was supposed to be biting hardest.  The level of 23.7 <Col N="1190" /> per cent of GNP devoted to fixed investment was 2½ points higher than when we came into office in 1973. Last year, when the wealth tax was still in operation, 25.2 per cent of GNP was devoted to fixed investment. The argument that it was responsible for chasing money out of the country is ill-founded.  Any rational person who is in the category paying wealth tax&mdash;and they are very small in number&mdash;would prefer, I believe, having thought about it, to pay over a period of years prior to his death a reasonably small sum of money annually rather than have his farm or business sold off after his death to pay a fairly large sum of money.</P>
    <P>If we look at section 36 in conjunction with the Schedule, where the tables are included for capital acquisitions tax, we will see that in a kind of backdoor way the wealth tax is now being substituted for by the capital acquisitions tax inasmuch as the thresholds at which these taxes are payable have not been raised at all in the category where most people are caught, that is, the transfer from one spouse to another, from a spouse to a widow or widower or to a child. It would seem to me that the present Government are intent on introducing another form of estate duty by a backdoor method and are at the same time now abolishing wealth tax and the fair amount of income collected by it in the last three or four years.</P>

      <P>: There are a number of aspects of this matter that I want to mention, but perhaps I should first deal with the one referred to by Deputy Barry when he referred back to the debate on the Second Stage when I was concluding.  He says, rightly, that I made a few references to the fact that I believed the wealth tax had caused money to leave the country but what I actually said in this regard, as reported at column 1767 of the Official Report for 24 May 1978 is:</P>
      <P>There is some evidence of an outflow of money as a result of that being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was not a very forceful statement, but it provoked Deputy Barry and Deputy Garret FitzGerald and I wondered why it did so, especially as <Col N="1191" /> I had received in the Department of Finance evidence to support the statement I had made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said&mdash;and not for the first time&mdash;&ldquo;I have nothing in writing, but the month before we left office I specifically asked and was assured that there was absolutely no evidence in this regard, unless some came up since.&rdquo;  He also said: `I inquired and was assured there was no evidence and it was very carefully watched for the three years.&rdquo;  Apart from the merits or demerits of this argument, I confess that Deputy Barry's and Deputy FitzGerald's reaction seemed to me to question my credibility and integrity in this matter, because I said that I had information in the Department of Finance which would justify the statement I made which was:</P>
    <P>There is some evidence of an outflow of money as a result of this wealth tax being introduced.</P>
    <P>I said on the occasion that it seemed that either I was right or Deputy Barry and his colleague were right or there was a lack of probity on the part of public servants and that I would pursue this matter.  I have pursued it and I find that there is no evidence whatever in the papers in the Department of Finance and nobody there has any recollection of Deputy Barry asking for or receiving information on this topic from the Department of Finance. He may well have sought and obtained information from some other source.</P>
    <P>The departmental files show that the question of capital flow in the context of capital taxation was first looked at on 2 April 1974 just before some of the capital taxation measures were due to come into operation.  The analyses show that it was not possible at that stage to identify particular capital outflows and it was concluded that there was no evidence to show that such outflows had resulted from the proposals about the taxation of capital. This was brought to the attention of the then Minister for Finance by the former Secretary of the Department, Mr. C. H. Murray, on 4 April 1974. Subsequently officers of the Central Bank intimated that they had heard <Col N="1192" /> reports in banking circles of funds being transferred abroad.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may add here that they were not the only people who heard these reports.  Although the Central Bank was unable to substantiate this or produce any further information, monitoring began in the Central Bank to detect possible flows of funds and by the latter half of 1974 there were some indications that resident balances with the associated banks outside the State were increasing.  Increased inflows under other heads, however, meant that there appeared to be no net loss of funds in so far as the banks were concerned.  Subsequently, monitoring revealed a broadly similar pattern and in early 1975 it was concluded that, while it was impossible to isolate the magnitude involved, it seemed a fair inference that financial flows had been influenced both inward and outward by taxation proposals here and in the UK.  This conclusion and the results of further studies were also submitted to the then Secretary of the Department but the files do not indicate whether he showed them to the then Minister or gave him copies.</P>
    <P>I have available here a table setting out the figures as the Department of Finance now see them.  For the period 1972-1976&mdash;it is based on data published in the <i>Irish Statistical Bulletin</i> for December 1977&mdash;the figures show that there has been a significant net capital inflow in every year.  However, when normal inflows and outflows are identified&mdash;for example, Government foreign borrowing, changes in the banks' net external position&mdash;there remains a residual item which is regarded as private capital.  This item was positive in 1974 but has been strongly negative suggesting outflows, in 1975 and later years.</P>
    <P>This bears out the result of the departmental and Central Bank monitoring since 1974.  I may add that the Central Bank in its annual report, 1977, at page 37 stated with reference to the balance of payments and official external reserves that the figures indicated &ldquo;that residual net capital outflows amounted to about £50 million&rdquo;.  The bank's annual report is laid before both Houses and a copy is <Col N="1193" /> supplied to every Deputy and Senator. The Central Statistics Office in statistics published in the <i>Irish Statistical Bulletin</i> for December 1976 and 1977 also recorded net outflows of other private capital in Table 6.</P>
    <P>However, a much higher degree than is normal is associated with this figure. The identification of capital flows presents many difficulties and involves a good deal of estimation and even published figures should be treated with a good deal of caution.  That is why I said on 24 May last that &ldquo;there is some evidence of an outflow of money as a result of the wealth tax being introduced&rdquo;.  I worded that very cautiously.  I think any objective observer listening to what I have just said and with the information available of the results of the monitoring of the situation by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, will agree that in the circumstances I was not making a meal of the evidence available.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise two points arising out of this.  First, there can be no doubt that the evidence available, such as it is, and with the inherent defects that I referred to indicates that there were outflows of private capital from 1974 with the introduction of the wealth tax.  The second point is that, whatever inquiries were made by Deputy Barry, whatever denial was made by Deputy Garret FitzGerald in this regard, I trust it will now be accepted that, when I said that, I had received advice and information in the Department of Finance on this matter and I was telling the truth.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the wealth tax I said, I think at the time it was introduced or shortly thereafter, that it seemed to me to be somewhat similar to the situation of Nero fiddling while Rome burned.  I must say it still seems that way to me.  It is no good people talking, as Deputy O'Leary did, about justice and justice being seen to be done, if unemployment is mounting, which is precisely what was happening when the wealth tax was introduced. The primary requirement of justice is that people get the opportunity to work.  That is the first requirement. Even if one adopts the somewhat <Col N="1194" /> neutral argument put forward by Deputy O'Leary in relation to this aspect of the matter&mdash;I think it would be fair to say his argument was there was no evidence that the introduction of the wealth tax had cost jobs&mdash;I would argue that there is no evidence that the introduction of the wealth tax has produced any jobs.  It was introduced at a time when the primary requirement was more jobs and I would disagree with Deputy O'Leary when he says there is no evidence of any loss of jobs.  I know, and I imagine most people in this House, if not all of them know of the specific jobs lost directly as a result of the introduction of the wealth tax.  It is impossible to quantify the ones lost indirectly as a result of the introduction of the wealth tax.  Different people have different information on this matter but there can be little doubt in the mind of anybody who makes any kind of reasonably objective inquiries into this matter that some jobs were lost indirectly as a result of its introduction and that the number of jobs which could have been created were not created.  Indeed, that is borne out by the information I gave earlier in relation to outflows of capital.</P>
    <P>Deputies should realise that, quite apart from the direct effect involved, there is the matter of what might be referred to as confidence.  Now confidence is a vital element in the climate required if the economy is to grow and jobs are to be created.  You cannot quantify it or put a value on it in terms of money but we all know that, if it is there, even somewhat inefficient firms and defective schemes may operate successfully.  If it is not there the most competent firms and businessmen will not succeed.  In this area the introduction of the wealth tax, on the one hand, and its abolition on the other was a vital matter.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Leary who said he believed a great many business people were under a misconception about the wealth tax and its effects. Now, whether they were right or whether they were wrong, the fact that it was believed to be a barrier and a disincentive to private enterprise was sufficient to have caused damage and <Col N="1195" /> should have been sufficient to have caused the then Government to have paused and thought again about the effect of what they were doing.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that the requirements of justice were that it should be introduced for the redistribution of wealth.  Those who say, and there are people who say it, that it was at such a low rate it could not be said to have dissuaded capital investment cannot really argue at the same time, as they have attempted to do, in favour of wealth tax as a redistribution of wealth and the achieving of social justice.  In the three years of the existence of the wealth tax the amounts collected were £3.7 million in 1975, £6.5 million in 1976 and £5.8 million in 1977.  This can scarcely be said to represent any worth-while redistribution of wealth in the context of a current budget in excess of £2,000 million. Surely not worth while at all, if there is anything at all to be said for my argument about the immeasurable but unmistakable disincentive effects of such a tax.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the wealth tax, which it seemed to me, and it still seems to me, the supporters of the wealth tax have tried to avoid.  But it is a very important and a very relevant issue.  It is that the wealth tax operated so as to discriminate against the Irish entrepreneur in favour of a foreign one.  We gave numerous examples of this.  That fact was not denied and I hope no one will attempt to deny it now so that we do not have to get involved in that argument as to whether it did or did not.  I think it is now accepted that it certainly did operate in that way because it was applicable to Irish people&mdash;I am speaking now in broad, not technical terms&mdash;and not to foreigners. How can one in a context in which we are trying to encourage growth, in which we are trying to encourage the creation of jobs, justify that kind of disincentive?  In particular, how can one justify it when it works against Irish people and in favour of foreigners? This is not just an incidental <Col N="1196" /> effect.  It is a fundamental aspect of any wealth tax introduced here.  For technical reasons it works out that way.</P>
    <P>I would pose the question to any Deputy who now retrospectively wants to support the introduction of the wealth tax in 1974 to say clearly how does he propose to justify the application of wealth tax to Irish people and its non-application to foreigners competing with those Irish people in this country in the same trade?  I could not possibly justify it.  On practical and theoretical grounds and on the evidence available, the introduction of the wealth tax was a major mistake if one's object was to get our economy into growth and to create as many jobs as possible as soon as possible. It was a mistake.  I suggest that Deputies opposite, whether from Fine Gael or Labour, would do better if they cannot bring themselves&mdash;and this is probably expecting too much&mdash;to acknowledge that mistake, would do better to forget about the whole thing, and, when they see that the mistake has been remedied and can see already around them the consequences, leave the matter alone and let us get on with the job of building growth into our economy and creating employment.</P>
    <P>Let us not waste too much time going over the mistakes that were made in 1974.  In case anybody thinks that that last remark implies that no mistakes are being made today and no mistakes will be made next year, I am not saying that.  We all make mistakes, but that episode introducing the wealth tax was a most unfortunate mistake for this country and especially for our unemployed.  Most people who understand what is going on welcome the fact that the Government have corrected that mistake and that the results are already being seen with beneficial effects for all those people who are looking for jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I was not a Member of this House in 1974 nor a member of the party to which I now belong.  I am inclined to believe that if I had any doubts at this time about the wisdom of the application of a wealth tax as part of our general approach to economic and social problems, the <Col N="1197" /> Minister's speech might almost have convinced me of its value.</P>
      <P>There was one particular aspect of his speech I would like to take up and follow down the road a little&mdash;he did not follow it very far and if he is to be logical he has to follow it down the road&mdash;and that is in relation to a particular criticism of the wealth tax. He made a number of generic criticisms, criticisms of principle if you like.</P>
      <P>He made a minor meal, to use his own phrase, of the fact that the wealth tax was introduced in 1974 at a time when unemployment was substantial and was increasing.  Therefore, we are entitled to ask: what weight does this factor hold in his argument?  Are he and his party against wealth tax in principle?  If so, why was it not included in the manifesto?  Or was he simply saying that the bad thing about the wealth tax was that it was introduced at that particular time in our political and economic history and in relation to the general economic and psychological climate of the country? If one of the main problems about the wealth tax was its timing, we are entitled to ask the Minister and Fianna Fáil this question: if it is wrong to introduce a wealth tax when unemployment is high and rising, how and when is it right to abolish wealth tax when unemployment is being reduced and prosperity is increasing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Deputy putting a rhetorical question or does he mean it?  If he means it I will tell him that I have repeatedly said when it was introduced and since what our stance on that was.  If he is putting it as a rhetorical question I know I need not bother to reply to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am unaware of precisely what the Minister's position is in this regard.  If he is saying and if he proposes to reply to me to the effect that he, his Government and his party are in principle opposed to a wealth tax of the kind we introduced in 1974 in any circumstances regardless of the degree of prosperity in the country, it is legitimate to ask why Fianna Fáil did not make it one of the points at issue in the document they presented to the people.</P>
      <P>On section after section of this Bill the Minister has fallen back ultimately on the argument that he is putting this, that and the other into the Finance Bill because it was part of a programme which was presented to the people in 1977, accepted and endorsed by them and that is the mandate which entitles them to put that in here.  When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition I believe&mdash;my memory may be incorrect&mdash;that they were pressed to state whether they would actually repeal the wealth tax if there was a change of Government.  I do not recall an unambiguous commitment in that regard.</P>
      <P>As I said, that was not in the manifesto.  It formed no part of the written commitment given to the people by the then Opposition a year ago and we are entitled to ask why not. I believe the answer to that is very simple, that is that the Minister's party depend on the electoral support of a considerable number of people whose only possible attitude to the wealth tax could be one of approval and if there were a decent and properly organised wealth tax as part of a general system of redistribution of power and resources in society they could only stand to benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis the Taoiseach made considerable play of the statements and the attitude <Col N="1199" /> of the present Opposition in relation to the then announced decision by the Government to abolish the wealth tax. He did not need to use the platform a Taoiseach is given at the Ard-Fheis of his party to poke fun at the Fine Gael Party or this party.  It was quite clear that he was responding to a growing sense of unease in the rank and file of Fianna Fáil, a sense of unease which no doubt he was astonished and dismayed to find had been fuelled by the persistent and unrelenting criticism of the Government's newly announced plans in that regard in relation to the wealth tax.  The Minister was trying to reassure the critics but I doubt that he succeeded. If any message goes out from this House today it should be that we will lose no opportunity to continue to emphasise the retrogressive nature of this proposal in such a way as to continue to add to that sense of unease which I am sure is experienced by the less well-off members of the population who support the Minister's party.</P>
    <P>We are talking of the decision to decline to make any further assessment of the wealth tax after the beginning of this financial year.  We should not be deceived into thinking that this is all that is involved because when the wealth tax was introduced it was not something that sprang fully armed from the soil or which was totally unrelated to anything else.  It was part of a package of capital taxation that was designed to replace another package of capital taxation.  Consequently, it does not make sense to deal with the wealth tax in isolation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has argued that the redistributive element of the wealth tax was slight and that not a very great amount of money was collected. That may be true compared with some of the money that the Minister is giving away in this Finance Bill. However, the amount that would have been collected this year by way of wealth tax would have paid twice over for school books for every primary school child in the country. That is the sort of equation that will <Col N="1200" /> make sense to the people and which will be made to make sense to them by the remarks from this side to the House.  If anything, the Minister's remarks about the weakness of the redistributive element of this tax are almost an indication that we were too cautious, that when the Government which I supported later introduced wealth tax, they acted in the worst way possible by introducing a good principle but by not pressing it to the point where it would begin to make a difference.  When we consider the various thresholds and reliefs given in respect of wealth tax in the 1974-75 Act, it will be seen that of all the countries that operate wealth tax, we were one of the most generous.</P>
    <P>The Minister made play of the new-found confidence which he alleges the Government are responsible for by reason of the abolition of wealth tax.  I find it impossible to understand how the same tired economic formulae, which have not produced in the past the sort of dramatic results which the Minister says are needed now, can achieve that result in the future.  This talk of confidence is talk on the level of soap powder advertising.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a considerable issue also of the fact that the wealth tax as it operated tended to discriminate in favour of foreign entrepreneurs and against Irish entrepreneurs. Listening to the Minister one would think that Ireland was the only country ever to introduce a wealth tax and that Irish entrepreneurs were the only domestic entrepreneurs discriminated against by reason of wealth tax.  I am not aware of the details of the wealth taxes that operate in other countries but if the defect which the Minister ascribed to our wealth tax is a fundamental and inherent defect of wealth taxes in general&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In relation to the redistributive element it is true that in at least one of the countries in which I am aware of there being a wealth tax, that is, Sweden, this tax has contributed materially during a substantial period of time to a shift in the balance of resources in society and to a greater equilisation of wealth and incomes.</P>

As usual the Minister was non-committal and said the matter was one for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, I am pleased to learn that a Bill was introduced in the Seanad today.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister did not publish that Bill yesterday or this morning.  It is a pity that it was not available for our spokesman, Deputy Deasy, when he introduced our Bill. We feel strongly about this issue.  The Minister should give us an assurance that this legislation will be passed before the summer recess.  He is a very astute man and he has seen the three Deputies who have contributed from this side, Deputies Deasy, O'Keeffe and myself&mdash;Waterford, Cork and Kerry. It is a well known fact, as Deputy Deasy pointed out, that our corvettes are monitored by the Spanish so that when a corvette makes a capture the other Spanish trawlers zoom in and plunder our fishing grounds.  Our stocks are being depleted dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking in the dark because the Minister's Bill is ready to float but we have not had an opportunity of studying it.  The problem that is bothering me, and a lot of other well-intentioned Members, is the question of penalties for Irish fishermen under the Bill.  I should like to know if the Minister has had consultations with the fishermen's organisations when he was drafting this Bill.  There is no comparison <Col N="1203" /> between the type of people who own trawlers in Spain and those who own trawlers here.  It is well known that a fisherman caught with a salmon on his deck is liable to a bigger penalty than the skipper of a Spanish trawler. In his sense of justice the Minister should make a special case with regard to Irish fishermen.  I make that statement unaware if the Minister has met representatives of the fishermen. I hope the Minister will accept that suggestion in the spirit intended.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable coincidence that the Minister's legislation surfaced this week in view of the fact that we had a vice-President of the European Commission, Mr. Gundelach, here recently. Did the Minister have any consultations with Mr. Gundelach about this legislation?  This is a delicate area because the legislation will hurt Mr. Gundelach's friends, the people who have taken away our 50 miles.  Has the Minister compromised his position so much with Europeans that he has left the Irish fishermen groping?  It was ridiculous to read in a press report that £80,000 would be spent on a survey on fisheries.  That amount of money would not build a small pier.  That is the reality of the situation.  Three acres of land in Dublin would cost £80,000. Mr. Gundelach did not make the long journey to Ireland to announce that he was giving us £40,000&mdash;I am sure we will have to put up £40,000 for this survey.  Mr. Gundelach was on another mission and I should like to know what one?  Was it this legislation?  If that is the case was the legislation watered down to suit the Europeans? If the Minister's legislation is to be implemented there are other areas that will have to be immensely improved.  I want to specify one area, Valentia railway station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not know how the Deputy can introduce Valentia railway station into this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>: My apologies, I wanted to refer to Valentia radio station.  The Minister is aware that Valentia radio station must monitor all the trawlers that come into the 200-mile zone.  I do <Col N="1204" /> not know whether the Minister visited this station but if he has not and he takes a trip to Valentia in the near future&mdash;from what is happening in Kerry at present I have no doubt that he will keep far away from the county for a while&mdash;he will see the terrible conditions and bad equipment these hard pressed civil servants must operate.  It was never visualised that the radio station would have to monitor trawlers coming into the 200 mile zone. If the Dutch are only to enter with a certain number of boats and the Spaniards can only catch hake off the Blasket Islands, there must be careful monitoring.  I urge the Minister to communicate with the Minister for Tourism and Transport with a view to modernising that station and employing extra staff.  I would make that appeal if Valentia was in any other part of the country.  I hope the Minister accepts that appeal in the spirit intended.</P>
      <P>In the proposed legislation will the Minister include anything about fishery offences in relation to the drift-net controversy?  I have no doubt that the Minister is aware of the chaos in Kerry today.  It is ridiculous that some boards of conservators can issue 200 or 300 licences and in all of Kerry only four drift-net licences.  It is unfortunate that scenes are taking place down there because our fishermen had a tremendous respect for the Navy.  The Minister should do everything in his power to defuse what could become an explosive situation.  I would go further and say to the Minister that he may not be aware that his Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, in an interview on Radio na Gaeltachta four days before the election, gave an assurance to the Kerry fishermen that he would rectify the disgraceful situation.  That interview is on tape and I heard it a week ago on Radio na Gaeltachta.  I would ask the Minister to ask his Taoiseach if he gave such an undertaking.  If he gave such a solemn undertaking to those people he should be big enough to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister mentioned fines of £500, which is a ridiculous sum and should be increased.  It is well known in fishery circles that we have only three fishery protection vessels at <Col N="1205" /> sea at a time.  If one of the vessels is after the salmon men and another has made a capture, that leaves one to patrol the coast.  The Spaniards are only laughing at us at present because they know the situation better than ourselves. Some time ago the Minister said he had contact with Spanish officials.  I appeal to him to make overtures to the Spaniards.  Everybody knows what they are doing.  As Deputy Deasy pointed out a short time ago, they only want to establish a quota.  When they become full members of the EEC they will be entitled to that quota.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the legislation and he should have issued it two days earlier.  He should give the House an assurance that the legislation will be implemented before the recess.  If we go into recess without implementing the legislation we are giving the Spaniards an open sea for six months.  This is an emotive issue.  There is no point in being flippant with the fishermen. They are as good a body of men as any other Irish people.  They feel threatened by the further restrictions that are contemplated, according to today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  If the fishermen in Kerry cannot catch herring they will have to catch some other kind of fish.</P>

      <P>: There is general acceptance of the need for amending legislation.  The Fine Gael Party have put forward a comprehensive Bill and I feel there is general acceptance of the merits of the Bill.  The Labour Party support the measure introduced by Deputy Deasy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister outlined his proposed amending legislation.  Therefore, the only issue before the House is whether we can enact that legislation before the recess.  It is not beyond the capacity of both Houses to enact the ministerial Bill before the recess. I suggest, and I have no doubt that Deputy Creed will agree with me, that we reach an accommodation with Deputies P. Lalor and Geoghegan-Quinn whereby the Seanad could discuss the Bill and take all Stages between now and the end of next week.  If the Seanad were to have all Stages taken <Col N="1206" /> by then we could give an assurance to discharge all Stages here before the recess.  I assure the Minister that Deputy Creed and I will be willing to make time available for this purpose. We may take issue with the Minister on the £500 limit.</P>

      <P>: When the Bill comes before the House we will not be found unco-operative.  One or two amendments may be necessary at that stage.  I appreciate the position in which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle finds himself, but it should be possible to enact the new legislation before the end of the month.  I compliment Deputy Deasy.  He deserves credit for bringing forward the issue in the form of this Bill.  The Minister has responded and that response can be enshrined in a statute of this House in a very short time.  I have no doubt but that the other House of the Oireachtas will co-operate as effectively as possible.  I have already had a discussion with my fellow Whip there who is willing to co-operate in every way.</P>
      <P>All in all, the value of Private Members' time, Private Members' Bills of this nature, and of a speedy response from the Government on this occasion will ensure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: Certainly on the point raised by the Chair, certain progress has been made <Col N="1207" /> in regard to the processing of the Government measure in that it was introduced in the Seanad at 2.30 p.m. this afternoon, First Stage.  It is now in course of printing and will be in Deputies' and Senators' hands in the morning.  The Seanad is agreeable to taking the Second Stage also in the morning.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy B. Desmond has suggested here, while not pre-empting what the Seanad will do but on the presumption that, having given it consideration, whether finally tomorrow or on some subsequent day, we get it into the Dáil, either next week or, if time is available even during the following week.  Having the Bill enacted before the recess so that we do not have a void situation is all important. This, I think, is what Deputies O'Keeffe and Deasy last evening were anxious to avoid&mdash;a situation in which we had really no legislation to cope with the problem during the busiest sea fisheries period of the year from now until October.  We have made certain progress along these lines.  Perhaps at this stage that might be met by withdrawing the Bill.  Deputy Deasy is the person in whose hands this lies.</P>

In so far as we may have some reservations about the outline of impending legislation by the Minister, naturally we are precluded <Col N="1208" /> from commenting on that at this stage. Therefore in that context, that is our contribution to the debate, and I have no doubt that Deputy Deasy, when replying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to congratulate our spokesman on fisheries, Deputy Deasy, for introducing this Bill.</P>
      <P>As far as we on this side of the House are concerned the Minister will find us very co-operative.  We are willing to withdraw our Bill as long as we get a guarantee from the Minister that his Bill will be circulated tomorrow and will become law before the recess.  Of course we must emphasise that all Stages must be taken and that the Bill must become law.  Even if we have to sit late the week after next to do so, it will be in the interests of our fishermen.</P>
      <P>But for our Bill, we would not at present have a Bill from the Minister for Fisheries.  Certainly he was caught on the hop in the last couple of days, as shown by the rushed job he is doing on the introduction of a Bill on his side of the House.  In the last couple of months we have been very concerned about the problems our fishermen have been facing.  All sides of the House are agreed that it has been absolutely ridiculous that foreign vessels have been fined only £100 by our District Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing the Bill introduced by the Minister we will have to study very thoroughly every single <Col N="1209" /> section to make sure it is in the interests of our fishermen.  It is worth mentioning that from January to May of this year 14 arrests were made.  In the month of May alone seven arrests were made by our fisheries protection vessels.  I read the speech made last evening by the Minister.  I am delighted to see that he proposes to bring in minimum fines of up to £100,000.  We cannot give a complete verdict on his Bill until we have examined every section of it.  Certainly there are very serious matters we must consider.  For example, we must consider the possibility of a foreign vessel coming before our courts and being found guilty, when their gear must be confiscated.  We must ensure that all of the catch found on board the vessel&mdash;whether it is proved that the catch was caught inside our territorial waters&mdash;is confiscated.  We agree with what the Minister said yesterday, that the time for dillydallying as far as our fishermen are concerned is over.  We must introduce strong legislation to ensure that anybody caught pilfering our fish will pay for the time and trouble caused our fisheries protection vessels.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that in the Minister's speech yesterday he spoke about new fishing limits off the Clare coast. He said that one of our fisheries protection vessels would be there at all times to keep a check on the 15 boats that will be there every week.  When these fishing boats come into this area they should be made check with the fisheries protection vessel there and our fisheries protection personnel should board the foreign trawler to ascertain the type of gear it is using, what size mesh, the type of fish they catch and ensure that they do not catch the small fish as we know so many of them have been doing.  When that foreign trawler is leaving again it should be re-checked on all of those aspects.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley was quite correct in saying that at present we have three, perhaps four, fishery protection vessels circling our coasts at present.  If there is one looking after salmon, one protecting the coasts of North Clare and Galway, it means that the maximum number of boats we have available to <Col N="1210" /> patrol our fishery limits is certainly not more than two because of neglect of our Naval Service down the years. It is common knowledge that probably we have not sufficient men to man all our naval vessels at present.  I was delighted some months ago when the Minister for Defence told the House that our naval establishment would be increased.  It is high time this was done.  At present we have not enough men or boats and we must make this a top priority.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the spotter planes.  We have only one such plane, the King Air.  We certainly need a second one very urgently.  That plane has radar, but it has not photographic equipment such as other fishery protection spotter planes have in other areas.  We must install photographic equipment in this plane as soon as possible and purchase a second plane. It is stated in paragraph 21 of the 1978-79 EEC working document 39/78 that the Community envisages the financing of one aircraft by one member state.  The Minister goes to the EEC next week and I hope he will come back with the news that this second spotter plane will be purchased as soon as possible.  These planes are extremely expensive.  It is reckoned that about 40 per cent of the cost is for the aircraft, 40 per cent for radar and surveillance equipment and 20 per cent for radio, navigational and camera units.  Like some of the other speakers on this side of the House.  I hope that legislation will be enacted whereby, with proper aerial proof, these fishing boats coming inside our waters will be charged in the same way as if they had been apprehended by our boats.  It is high time this was done.  It is done in other countries and the Minister should insert a section providing for this.</P>
    <P>It is reckoned that it costs something in the region of £5 million to build each naval vessel.  We are proud of the <i>Deirdre</i> and the <i>Emer</i> which are as good as anything in European waters at present.  I am disturbed by the talk in EEC documents about chartering five fishery protection vessels.  Does this mean that the EEC will pay for the charter, the equipment and the personnel?  We have <Col N="1211" /> two very good boats and there is another being built at Cork, but we are faced with the problem that it is estimated we can build only one boat every year.  The quicker we can get boats of our own with naval personnel, the better off we will be.</P>
    <P>There is another section which I hope the Minister will include when he introduces his Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are discussing Deputy Deasy's Bill.  It is the only thing before the House. We are spending all the time discussing the Minister's Bill which, I understand, will come up for discussion next week.  Only Deputy Deasy's Bill is before the House at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The only reason the Chair intervened is that the Deputy was suggesting to the Minister sections that he should have in his Bill.  The Minister's Bill is not before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept that.  As far as the Fine Gael Bill is concerned, I accept as Deputy Deasy accepted, that there are not things in the Bill which should be in it.  We accept that this Bill is not the best Bill in the world, but we brought it in because we could not leave the Irish fishing grounds at the mercy of foreigners.  If a naval vessel brings in a Spanish trawler to one of our ports that naval vessel can be tied up for a considerable length of time, and this Bill should have covered that.  The naval vessel should be free straight away to go back to its work of patrolling our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Parliament on 10 May decided on the progressive establishment of a body to patrol the fishing zones on behalf of the Community. That means that the Community are seeking to patrol our fishing waters. It is bad enough not to have sovereign rights over the whole of this country but it would be complete madness if <Col N="1212" /> we had not sovereign rights over the fishing areas around our coast.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Deasy introduced this Bill.  It has certainly made the Minister wake up and bring in new legislation.  This is what we want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Opposition will be most accommodating in that respect. We will be only too glad to help.  We accept that it is a most complex piece of legislation.  The Minister said that it was a much more comprehensive Bill than this one.  There will be a lot of legal argument but we will be easy to deal with as long as we know that we will not have to wait until next November.  This is what would have happened and this is why we brought forward this Bill.  The law is being flouted left, right and centre and we as a responsible party in Opposition could not allow this to continue.  The Minister has seen our point and we welcome the initiative he took today in having the First Stage in the Seanad. We are told that the Second Stage will be taken in the Seanad tomorrow and Committee and further Stages will be taken at a special sitting of the Seanad next Tuesday.  We are gratified to hear that.  The Minister will find at all stages in the Seanad and the Dáil that the Fine Gael and the Labour Party, from what Deputy Desmond said, will make his task quite easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> We have been disturbed as the incidence of poaching increased in recent months and we were forced into this measure which we put down in the form of a Bill.  I refer in particular due to vast overfishing and the increase in poaching off the west coast in and off the south coast.  We make no excuse for introducing the Bill.  I think the Minister admitted last night that if he were in Opposition it is the very thing he would have done himself. We were worried that the measure might not come in before the recess and that the Spaniards in partifishing, or virtually free fishing, for cular and the Dutch would have free the next six months.  A fine of £100 was no deterrent.  We could not allow that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>I do not know specifically what is in the Minister's Bill.  He has given us an outline of it but I hope he makes provision for the acceptance by the courts of aerial evidence.  This is an extremely important aspect of the whole thing.  Fines are one thing but to obtain evidence by aerial observation is vitally important.  I hope the Bill will cover that aspect of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>: In approaching this matter I want to be as responsible as possible in my criticism of the Minister's actions or lack of actions and be as little political as I can be.  The question of Garda overtime did not start this evening; it goes back to the Conroy Report which recommended that the Garda were entitled to overtime. In 1974, the figure was in excess of £6 million; in 1975, it was £8.5 million approximately; and in 1976, £5 million.  In 1977 it was the same figure and in 1978 about £5.4 million. I am told on good authority that the amount available this year will be less than half of what is required, something less than half the figure for 1974&mdash;£6 million.  My information is that there will be approximately £3 million for overtime this year, that there will be a substantial cutback.  I am not in favour of overtime or astronomical figures for it but I support the argument that the Garda are entitled to be compensated for the hours worked, bearing in mind that a garda recruit gets as little as £56 per week and when on full scale about £84 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently filled in an application form for a county council loan for a garda and I was shocked when I saw his earnings, particularly the net pay. But for the fact that their income is supplemented in many cases by the earnings of their wives or by some <Col N="1215" /> sideline or family business in which they cannot be directly concerned, they would be living below the breadline. It is not good enough for a Government, whether the present Government or the Government in which my party participated, to expect the police force to work for nothing.</P>
    <P>At this time of crisis, of national emergency, with the crime rate rising, the least we can expect from our police force is good service.  But to get that service we must pay them a reasonable wage.  I do not believe their present pay is sufficient for their job. Their job is a most important one.  A garda is in the same wage bracket as a person working in the public service whose responsibility is confined to office work, dealing with papers, taking instructions from an officer immediately above him who is never more than next door from him or at the end of a telephone.  We must consider the responsibilities of a garda who has to handle delicate matters relating to individuals and to the community. I believe that with their job they are working for buttons.  It is time the Government realised the problems that have been created by the Garda having to do duties for which they are not properly compensated.</P>
    <P>It may be argued&mdash;and I have some sympathy for it&mdash;that many garda in receipt of very large amounts of overtime considered that this would be the practice, that if they were giving a good service to the community and to the Government and if they were prepared to work hard and long hours they would be properly rewarded.  They committed themselves by building or buying new houses or living on a higher standard, as we all do when our incomes are increased.  They now find themselves financially embarrassed since they are not being paid overtime and have not the same opportunity for work.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that increased numbers of garda makes it less necessary to have large provisions for overtime. I do not accept that.  I believe that Garda Border duty unknown to the general public has been drastically reduced.  Without having hard facts <Col N="1216" /> at my disposal I reckon that on a head count there are 10 per cent fewer Garda on Border duty now than there were this time last year.  I take umbrage at the Minister's action because his whole contribution as Fianna Fáil spokesman in Opposition was to tell the then Minister, Deputy Cooney, to pay the Garda overtime and so reduce crime.  Deputy Cooney argued that he was prepared to give the Garda better pay but every time the present Minister spoke in Opposition, whether by means of parliamentary or supplementary question or adjournment debate, such as I am now engaged in, he made the same case.  I have fine-combed the Official Report for the four years during which Fianna Fáil were in Opposition and the main contribution of Deputy Collins as Opposition spokesman on Justice was a castigation of the then Minister, Deputy Cooney, for reducing overtime, overtime which was granted by the National Coalition Government but which, because of the economic situation, had to be cut back.</P>
    <P>What, I wonder, will happen in the immediate future?  I want to be very blunt about this.  If I were a member of the Garda Síochána or if any other Deputy in this House was a member of that force he or I would not be prepared to work for buttons, for wages as low as £56 a week.  In the last 24 hours I have seen a wage cheque for a very responsible member of the force, the princely sum of £64 net, and he is in the top bracket of £84 a week. How can the Minister expect a man to support a wife and family and do his job at £60 odd a week?  It simply is not possible.  That man cannot be happy in his job.</P>
    <P>Before Deputy Cooney left the office of Minister for Justice he commissioned a report on the Garda Síochána, the only report ever commissioned by a Government since the force was set up in the 1920s.  The report has been available in the Minister's office since last June.  He has not acted on it.  I am not aware of the details of it though I have got leaks here, there and everywhere.  But the Minister has done nothing to implement the recommendations made in that report, recommendations <Col N="1217" /> as a result of a study to find out what is required to provide this country with a good police force. Because the gardaí are no longer being paid for doing overtime they are not available on the ground.  We have abundant evidence of the result of that every day of the week.  Every day there are armed raids.  One was the subject of a parliamentary question here today.  It related to an armed raid in the Minister's old constituency. Rumour has it&mdash;I hope the Minister will tell us whether or not it has any substance&mdash;that the Minister's car was diverted by the robbers.  I trust the Minister will either confirm or deny that.  It could easily have been the Minister.  We had two unarmed gardaí protecting £400,000.</P>
    <P>I am not on the side of subversion, and far be it from anyone to point the finger at me.  Criticising violence is a lonely job in this country, but I do not fail in my duty to criticise.  I support the Minister and will support him in every Bill he brings before this House if it is designed to secure the law and order essential to a modern society.  What would have been the position had the Minister arrived on the scene when the trap had been laid by a group of armed bandits? What if they had decided, instead of taking the £400,000, they would kidnap the Minister?  That is a very serious thing to contemplate.  But that could happen with any Minister or any Member of this House.</P>
    <P>We are the laughing stock of Europe. Security is at a minimum.  In the North of Ireland it does not pay to rob banks or anywhere else because those who might do so know their chances of escape will be very limited. The amount of money coming in from the USA to back up the Provisional IRA has fallen drastically. Now they play havoc with our police force here.  The least the Minister can do is to give the gardaí a proper wage on which to support their wives and families.  He cannot expect them to do unpaid overtime.  If the situation is not rectified speedily we will find ourselves in a very serious position indeed. The 1977 crime report is not available but I am told there is an increase of <Col N="1218" /> 25 per cent in serious crimes involving the use of arms.  The Minister must know this.  I have been told that is the position, but I could be wrong.  If crime is tending in that direction, even if there is no increase on last year's figures, it is just not good enough that those who should combat crime are not properly paid for doing so.  There should be an independent body to assess the needs of the force.  There are not enough gardaí on the ground.</P>
    <P>The violence in the North over the last decade has had direct economic repercussions on this part of the country.  We must not close our eyes to the situation.  It is not just good enough to say &ldquo;Well, boys, we made lots of promises to you before we were elected but it is not now possible to keep those promises.  Paddy Cooney was right.  He could not pay the overtime, but he told you that, but now, after we are elected, well, tough luck. We made a mistake or we bluffed you&rdquo;.  That is how the gardaí are looking at the Minister now.  I have spoken with a number of them over the last 24 hours in the northern part of the Republic and they do not have very pleasant things to say about Minister Collins.  They say Minister Collins convinced them before the election that Pat Cooney was the dog in the manager and under him they would never get a good deal.  Their conditions would never be what they wanted them to be.  He promised them overtime and then took it away but, if there was a Fianna Fáil Government in office and Gerry Collins TD was appointed by Taoiseach Jack Lynch as Minister for Justice, all these faults would be remedied.  No one could fault the gardaí for thinking along those lines. Under this Minister a garda has less money in his pay packet and he is expected to to more hours of duty.  That is fair comment.  If the Minister does not tackle the problem seriously and make available the report that Deputy Cooney, as Minister for Justice commissioned, he should set up a Committee of this House.  Unless he introduces it as quickly as possible, I forecast he will have a crisis on his hands, and if that develops it will not be in the national interest.  I am not wishing it on him: I am spelling out a reality. <Col N="1219" /> The immediate problem is the cutback on overtime, which is directly related to the wage packet.  I would recommend strongly that the Minister have an independent body, a Committee of the House, look at both sides of the argument.  Naturally the Garda Síochána Representative Bodies would be making arguments to the Department for more money for this and that, that is all part of the act.  It will be argued by the civil servants that we cannot afford this and they will have to do with less.  I am asking the Minister to set up an independent body which would act without bias and have an open mind and make recommendations to the Minister and the Department that will give us a contented police force.</P>
    <P>That is what we need.  We can ill afford to do without our police officers. They are doing a tremendous job and get very little thanks in many cases.  If something goes wrong in a village people ask where are the local gardaí. They are criticised because they are not present if something happens.  I had such an experience over the weekend and had to listen to local people criticising the police.  It is impossible for gardaí to be everywhere.  There are not enough gardaí in the villages and towns throughout the country.  There are insufficient gardaí doing Border duty and doing the number of hours required to make sure that the country is secure and that people can feel safe when they go to bed and have a good night's sleep.</P>
    <P>It is a strange state of affairs when private firms operating security companies pay their officers more than we pay our gardaí.  I am told by a friend at Dublin Airport, who made no secret of it, that the security officers at Dublin Airport have more money than he has as a garda.  Yet, if anything happens, he has to give his services.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  Now that the honeymoon is over, I am not satisfied he is tackling the responsibilities given him by this House.  I know his job is hard, but I believe without criticism he would not react as I want him to.</P>

      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;shown by Deputy Harte, that if I want a quiet ten minutes I can only say what he wants me to say, let the House take careful note of that.  If, as he says, I am going to have a crisis on my hands, the one man who would fan it out of all proportion, or create it if none existed, is the same Deputy.  I regret to note that the Deputy, in the course of the text of the Private Notice Question circulated today and which the Ceann Comhairle has not allowed, made allegations about drastic overtime cutbacks.  I understood that tonight's discussion was to deal with that.  Instead we rambled from the kidnapping of myself to other things that were farfetched and irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harte's allegations are unfounded. To some extent they seem to be linked with a newspaper report of statements attributed to the Garda Representative Body about allocations of Garda overtime.  Even if this were so, that does not mean they are well founded.  They are not.  I regret it is necessary to say that in my view, together with what Deputy Harte said, they are likely to encourage criminals. The simple fact of the matter is that in the second half of the last year, after <Col N="1221" /> I took office as Minister for Justice, expenditure on Garda overtime was increased substantially.  This immediate measure was taken because it would take some time to get extra gardaí recruited and trained.  The additional manpower is, and has been for some months, becoming available, and the higher level of policing which was established in the last five months of 1977 is being maintained.</P>
    <P>It is quite misleading to speak about overtime expenditure for the month of December last for two reasons.  First, December is not a typical month because of the special demands on Garda services arising from Christmas trading; and, second, the comparision made takes no account of the extra manpower which has become available since December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: I repeat that the higher level of policing which I succeeded in introducing, and for which I got Government authority, is being maintained.  There is no question whatsoever of a drastic cutback in overtime. The provision for Garda overtime in this year's Estimate is not less but marginally greater than last year's, despite the significant increase in manpower and the fact that additional funds are being provided to offset the effect of increased pay rates in the course of the year.</P>
      <P>I regret the need to say that references to the lack of Border security and any reduction in our strength there are not only unfounded but are also highly dangerous.</P>

      <P>: I do not suggest that the Deputy would deliberately seek to create a situation in which a few unbalanced people North of the Border would feel they were justified in engaging in retaliatory action in one of the towns south of the Border, but I cannot afford to mince words on this issue.  This is the kind of risk that statements like &ldquo;lack of Border security&rdquo; and &ldquo;serious security crisis&rdquo; create.  When there is no justification for them, the least I can say is that they are deplorable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>: We know that a number of members of the force would like to earn more overtime than the very substantial amount they are already earning.  This is a legitimate aspiration, but we must recognise it for what it is.  In order to avoid damaging the level of policing being provided for the public overtime allocations to each Garda division are carefully tailored to mesh in with the allocation of additional manpower to these divisions.  No doubt some members may be disappointed to find that overtime for their division is adjusted because extra gardaíhave been assigned to the divisions concerned, but this does not justify allegations that the overall level of policing in the area has fallen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of principle I do not intend to begin to announce specific monthly allocations of overtime for gardaí but I can say that the figure quoted in the recent newspaper article referred to is substantially lower than the actual figure.  I do not accept the proposition that individual members of the Garda find their morale damaged because of such incidents as bank raids. Nobody blames an individual member of the force in such cases unless he has been careless.  But that is not what we are talking of.  There is a clear suggestion <Col N="1223" /> in what has been said that higher overtime worked at the end of 1977 is taken out of this year's allocation. There is no foundation for that suggestion. Technically it is correct that overtime worked in December is paid for in January or February.  That is normal and inevitable and cannot be interpreted in the way suggested.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that there cannot be variations in the level of police provided at local level.  Neither am I saying that there may not have been teething troubles at local level in relation to certain assignments, but where such difficulties have occurred they have been resolved by Garda headquarters. There remains the central fact that across the board the level of policing is now much higher than it was in the first half of last year.  It is as high as it was in the second half of last year, and that high level is being maintained.</P>

If he is not satisfied with the number of gardaí on the ground let me remind him that for the four years he sat on these benches, during which time he should have had an influential voice with the then Government, he did not speak even once for the gardaí or about the lack of the presence of police on the ground.

      <P>: The higher education grants schemes contain provisions as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a student is following a course of studies which could be approved of under the scheme and where such student had not qualified for the award of a grant solely on the ground of means, a grant may be awarded with effect from the beginning of the first academic year following the production of evidence that the means requirements of the scheme would now be fulfilled in his/her case.</P>
      <P>(2)  If the local authority are satisfied that the income of the grant-holder's parents or guardians has decreased during the period of tenure of the grant to the extent that the amount of the grant held no longer corresponds to the income category in the schedule in relation to which it was originally determined, the amount of the grant shall be adjusted to that appropriate to the category corresponding to the new income.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these provisions are suitable to meet the needs of a situation arising from a change in the incomes circumstances of parents during the period of the course of study of the student.  I have no proposals in mind for an amendment of them.</P>

      <P>: Centres jointly assisted by my Department and the Department of Health have recently been established by voluntary bodies in a number of areas in which training is provided for moderately mentally handicapped, and a small number of mildly handicapped school leavers in order to prepare them for employment&mdash;either in an open situation or in sheltered workshops. My Department's assistance takes the form of grants towards the cost of the instructional programme at the centres.</P>
      <P>I have not received any proposal regarding the establishment of such a centre in Waterford city.</P>
