      <Col N="1108" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £201,684,000 be granted to defrey the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of December, 1978, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for the Environment.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his introductory speech drew attention to the very large size of the Estimate for his Department.  The total, including the Supplementary Estimate, amounts to over £206 million, which is a sizeable amount and an amount which identifies the Department as one of the most vital and important areas of Government and Government policy.  The change of name from &ldquo;Local Government&rdquo; to &ldquo;Environment&rdquo; was long overdue and is appropriate because, as the title suggests, it embraces many aspects of our everyday lives, our homes, the air we breathe, the streets and roads we travel on, the public parks and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are specific aspects of the Department which affect some people more than others.  Housing and the cost of housing affects every family, and it is this subhead that stands out above all others.  The total sum to be directed to housing is something in the region of £143 million.  This covers housing subsidies, private housing grants and the abolition of rates on private residential accommodation.  The removal of rates was long overdue.  Rates in the form we operated them were grossly unjust because they were a penal tax for having one's own home.  This tax has not been wiped out completely on residential accommodation because a number of landlords, especially in Dublin, have not passed on the benefit of the abolition to their tenants. The whole purpose of abolition is to give relief to householders and <Col N="1109" /> residents, and many flat dwellers need this relief very badly.  The Minister should investigate the many complaints being received and this House should ensure that justice is done where flat dwellers are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is geared to create badly needed improvement in the building and construction industry.  If this industry is active and in a healthy condition many benefits accrue to other sectors.  That is true today, more so than ever before.  During the last two years when depression hit the building industry in a really serious way many other facets of our industrial economy were equally badly affected. Building and construction has many tentacles stretching out into many other industrial and commercial spheres giving, or taking away, as the case may be, many thousands of jobs dependent on the condition of the main industry.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has made improvements in housing loans, SDA loans, low mortgage loans and improvement grants and loans.  I would dearly wish that improvement grant payments could be speeded up in some way.  In many cases the grants have not been paid out for what seems to be an extraordinarily long period. Those on fixed incomes who carry out very necessary and long overdue repairs or improvements depend on these grants and expect reasonably fast payment of the grants.  Long and seemingly unnecessary delays cause great hardship and worry.  I would ask the Minister to see if this situation could be improved from the administration point of view.</P>
    <P>Representing a Dublin constituency, I sometimes despair when I pause to consider the very serious environmental and housing problems that exist, especially in the north city inner area. The problem is so vast and varied that it is obvious that only a very large capital crash programme will bring about a reasonable solution to the problem.  Some Opposition Members who have been public representatives for some years seem to have only recently discovered, since last June approximately, what is now commonly referred to as the inner city problem <Col N="1110" /> both inside and outside this House. The inner city problem has been festering for many years, and during the period in office of the previous Government the deterioration accelerated at an alarming rate.  One has only to walk around the city within a radius of a mile from O'Connell Street to see the undeveloped state and the decay of what was once a really living fair city. Taking a look at some of the houses, which I would describe as just standing, is an experience in itself, but to think that there are families living in many of these houses should make every one of us ashamed.</P>
    <P>We also have what are commonly referred to as high rise flats.  These areas have been run down over the years.  As a result of this some of these areas are now slums with all the social problems of juvenile crime, vandalism and the lack of real opportunities for the children and young people from these areas.  Not alone do such areas affect normal domestic life, they also affect employment opportunities for the people living there.  I can assure the House that the majority of people who live in those areas are decent people. Unfortunately they lose job opportunities which they are entitled to because of their addresses.</P>
    <P>We must look at the whole question of urban housing and change many of the decisions that were previously taken.  At one time multi-storey flats such as Ballymun seemed to be the answer to the housing problem, but in the past few years we have discovered that the social disadvantages of these flats outweigh everything else. Many of our city flat complexes are depressing, and they tend to breed the type of social problems that we hear about every day.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation housing department have made great progress in their approach to those seeking accommodation despite the serious shortage of dwellings in the city.  In his speech the Minister said that 1,640 dwellings were completed last year and he estimates that 3,000 families were rehoused in 12 months.  It should be borne in mind that much of the rehousing would not be acceptable to a family seeking a decent home.  A great <Col N="1111" /> part of the existing corporation housing is substandard.  I believe that the number of people seeking corporation housing will increase in future.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems that I encounter at my weekly clinic deal with housing and I am sure that other Dublin Deputies can say the same.  At present, many of the deserving housing cases have little chance of getting decent acommodation because of the points system of allocating houses.  Any Dublin city public representative knows that the number of applicants for accommodation in any scheme being developed by the corporation exceeds availability by as much as eight to one.  The most sought after area is Dublin north central where the limited available acommodation is mainly in flats.  This is a real identification that many people prefer to live in or near the city centre.  There is an onus on all of us to effect changes for improvement in the housing situation.  Dublin is still developing at a fast pace and in a few years the population will exceed one million.  Other capital cities have had to face the same problems, and many European countries are presently working on gigantic plans for finance at national levels.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation housing programme includes areas which are commonly known as open areas.  An open area means that you can be easily rehoused because few people will accept a house in such an area.  As a result slum areas are being created in the heart of the city.  The city centre and surrounding area should be a showpiece in a capital city, which is normally the hub of attention.  It is usual for visitors to tour the city centre and I imagine that many of them leave Dublin with a poor view of it which will not encourage their friends to visit Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are about 800 families squatting in Dublin at present.  Many of them have been evicted for non-payment of rent and for squatting.  Following eviction by the corporation these families are pushed into the open areas that I referred to, mainly in the city centre in areas such as Seán <Col N="1112" /> McDermott Street, Gardiner Street and Sherriff Street, areas in which repairs and maintenance are at a minimum level.  Before long these areas become known as ghettos or slums and are so bad that not even squatters will take accommodation in them.</P>
    <P>The onus is on us to come up with a new deal for the deprived areas of the city.  This will take a big financial injection but it must be done.  If it is not, we will stand accused for all time for not making an effort to rescue our society from the depths of despair. Our Party is committed to urban renewal and work must commence without too much delay.</P>
    <P>Many landlords are charging exorbitant rents for old and decaying houses, and the system of taking out closing orders or CPOs should be speeded up.  There are a large number of such houses in my constituency and some of the landlords are using the law cleverly to delay the processing of closing orders.  Meanwhile, there are tenants in those houses&mdash;old people and married couples with young children&mdash; which most of us would not consider suitable for our animals.  Many of them lack proper sanitary facilities and are in such bad condition that rain water comes through the walls and the roof.  In some cases, conditions are so bad inside that beds are constantly moved around because they are going through the floor boards. These conditions are real.  Until some legal process is speeded up and completed, the housing department cannot and will not do anything for such tenants.</P>
    <P>This is not right in this day and age. Certainly it is morally wrong.  As we all know, bad housing is a real and important factor in the generation of poverty and its perpetuation.  The most determined efforts of families to improve their conditions and raise themselves above the poverty line are defeated by the miserable conditions in which they are often forced to live. The whole basis of society can be seriously damaged.  A considerable number of young couples are under terrible strain because of their inability to find suitable accommodation, or because of the terrible surroundings in which they live.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> The new housing grant of £1,000 for first time buyers has been very well received, particularly by young people anxious to buy their own homes.  It is a vast improvement on the older type grants which have now been discontinued.  I know of many cases so far where the new grant has proved to be the decisive factor in a couple's decision to purchase their own home.  This has also meant and will mean, I hope, a further upsurge in the private house building industry.  From figures available so far, it has meant an additional 1,100 jobs up to the end of 1977.  The additional demand for private housing unfortunately attracts its dangers in the way of selves above the poverty line are dehigher prices caused by speculators. This has the effect of defeating the Government's whole objective, which is to help people buy their own homes and to create additional jobs in the building and construction industry.</P>
    <P>It is appreciated that there will be natural price increases due to increased labour and material costs, and so on. The Minister must do everything possible to ensure that builders, developers, or speculators, or whoever, do not inflate prices merely to cash in on the present market upsurge and the increasing demand for new houses. Nowadays more and more houses are going up on estates, generally at prices ranging from £23,000 upwards. The emphasis which at one time was on a house price to suit young couples has swung over very decisively to the more luxurious home.</P>
    <P>This may be fine for the established family choosing to change house, to change area or district, but it makes it extremely difficult for those setting up home for the first time.  It does not give them wide selectivity or choice.  It is common now to hear of couples paying over £120 per month in repayment of a mortgage.  Therefore it is not surprising that the working wife must continue working to help to meet such large repayments together with the usual outgoings involved in running a home.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the low mortgage scheme which is available <Col N="1114" /> for local authority housing.  This scheme is very well intentioned and could undoubtedly fulfil a specific purpose but, in its present form, it is of very little benefit to those for whom it was originally set up.  The maximum amount available is £7,500 and a means test or a means limit is a condition.  The irony is that there is no means test for those applying for corporation housing tenancies.  There is no encouragement for an applicant to consider purchasing a house privately.  The Minister should look into this point with a view to bringing some reality into it, particularly in the light of the serious housing shortage in the city at present.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is planning to increase the money to be spent on road development by as much as 40 per cent over last year's expenditure. Generally speaking, some of our main roads, such as the Dublin-Cork road, the Dublin-Limerick road and so on, are quite good, but many link roads are in a deplorable condition.  In this area much increased employment can be achieved.  Under this Estimate an additional 1,200 road workers will be employed.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city, traffic has become a major headache.  Traffic jams continue to be a very big problem.  The newly erected Talbot Bridge has done nothing to ease traffic coming from the north side.  Indeed, I have received many complaints that the opposite is the case.  Workers are finding that they must leave their homes earlier as longer delays are taking place in getting to work and in coming from work in the evening.  Even during the day we now have traffic building up as far back as North Strand Road. This is something we did not experience previously, and particularly during the off peak hours.</P>
    <P>The whole question of heavy commercial traffic through the city centre during the day and at peak hours should be re-examined.  It is ridiculous to see juggernauts and heavy containers being driven through the city centre at peak times.  Apart from the fact that many of our streets are not suitable for such heavy traffic, people coming to and going from work are <Col N="1115" /> seriously affected and, in many cases, are actually pushed off the roads.  The size of the traffic is intimidating to the average motorist.</P>
    <P>Such heavy traffic is also a serious cause of air pollution when one considers the fumes rising into the air when traffic blocks the streets.  For instance, if one is going through Pearse Street any afternoon from 5 o'clock to 6 o'clock one has only to look at the condition of the buildings and cannot but be seriously concerned. Constant checks should be maintained and deliberate offenders causing this pollution should be quickly brought to book.  There must also be a very strict monitoring of industries, particularly industries engaged in chemical processing.  The environment should not be put at risk even due to the expected increase in industrial activity.  This is very important to the health of our people, our children and future generations.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the death toll and the number of accidents on our roads continue. Every weekend there is a serious accident resulting in death.  Alcohol plays a very big part in too many road accidents.  There is concern that the breathalyser has had to be suspended. This was due to the various technical loopholes that were brought to light.  If we are to judge by the numbers of cars to be seen outside the many public houses there are many people who drive after heavy drinking.  I am not referring to the person who takes a drink socially and who is responsible in regard to his driving, but there are far too many of the other kind.  These people are a menace not only to themselves but to all other road users. There should be more Garda activity in this area.  Slaughter on the roads has reached alarming proportions and has been responsible for as much loss of life as has been experienced in Northern Ireland as a result of the troubles there.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy whatever with the James Hunts who drive to their destinations as if they should have got there hours earlier.  However, on good open roads there is a case to <Col N="1116" /> be made for increasing the speed limit to 70 miles per hour.  This could provide the safety value that is needed by so many of our drivers.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made, too, for more consistency in the courts in relation to traffic offences.  The various district justices deal with such offences in different ways.  The average motorist is very careful in a certain southern area, for instance, in regard to speed while in other areas motorists are prepared to take chances.  There is a big difference between the prospect in one area of a 12-months suspension and the prospect of a small fine in another area.  Another important factor in regard to road safety is the condition of cars and other vehicles.  There are far too many vehicles on the road that are in such condition as to render them a danger.  Consequently many accidents are caused without any apparent reason.  In this city there are many backlane garages and in some of these premises cars that are written off following accidents are literally put together again.  A person can be fooled by a good repaint job when he goes looking for a car at a reasonable price. When a vehicle is considered a writeoff by an insurance company the onus should be on the company to ensure that that vehicle is scrapped beyond reassembly, thereby eliminating the possibility of an unscrupulous car dealer putting together again what were twisted chassis and frames.</P>
    <P>In a country where there is so much dependence on tourism it is regrettable that many of our main roads are not properly signposted.  Although there has been much improvement in this regard down through the years, not enough has been done.  Anybody travelling around the country will find signposts that have been turned in opposite directions by vandals or immature people.  This causes much confusion to travellers.  Local councils should use a more sturdy type of signpost in order to eliminate this vandalism.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that in Dublin the Royal Canal should be filled in and developed as a motorway, but in this city, as in any other city, efforts should be made to improve <Col N="1117" /> whatever amenities remain.  A water way in a city can be very attractive but it must be properly maintained. Unfortunately the general condition of the Royal Canal leaves much to be desired.  Last weekend I walked along the canal bank for some distance from Jones's Road, and apart from the very dirty water that had receded almost two feet from the bank I saw in the canal such items as old bicycle frames, prams and a collection of other rubbish as well as two animal carcases.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation appointed a committee for the purpose of maintaining the canal and an effort was made recently to clean it up.  Such efforts should be sustained.  The condition of the canal is disgraceful.  I trust that those people charged with the task of maintaining the canals will ensure that the situation improves.  The imposition of penalties for dumping refuse in our waterways would be a deterrent in this regard.</P>
    <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, local authorities may assist those engaged in animal welfare.  However, I do not think that authorities are flexible enough in this respect.  In this city there is an enormous number of stray cats and dogs.  This situation causes very serious problems, particularly in large housing areas.  These animals are set free and go hungry around the streets.  I note that the Minister will be advising local authorities of new powers to deal with this problem.  The ISPCA are doing a very good job in difficult circumstances, but they continually engage in what can be called a clearing up process, that is, the removal of stray animals from the streets.</P>
    <P>For some time people involved in the area of animal welfare have been advocating the neutering of dogs and cats in order to control their numbers. Such operations are being carried out privately but unfortunately not enough people realise how serious is the problem of strays.  Recently a hotel in this city found it necessary to call in animal welfare specialists because the hotel grounds had become over-run by wild cats.  During a couple of weeks 200 <Col N="1118" /> wild cats were caged, many of which were badly deformed.  There are similar problems in the city centre. Unless some form of control is imposed, this problem will have very serious consequences in the future. There are great demands on the Department of the Environment.  I wish the Minister well in the expenditure of the large sums of money on various environmental improvements and the completion of the programmes envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has gone out of the House.  I only want to speak on one aspect of his Department's activity which almost amounts, probably not intentionally, to a confidence trick in regard to the £1,000 new house grant.  This grant is available, by definition, to what are termed first-time buyers.  If a couple are involved neither the husband nor the wife can previously have owned a house, either here or abroad.  I am sure 90 per cent of the applicants for this grant are young couples getting married who will not have the same experience in life as people 40, 50 and older have.  The normal way they go about buying their house is that they see an advertisement on some newspaper saying that a new estate is opening.  This advertisement invariably has the words &ldquo;grant-type houses&rdquo; inserted in it.  The person who puts in the advertisement means by that that the physical dimensions of the house are those laid down by the Department of the Environment for a grant under the old grant scheme.  The description is still being used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The young couple, whether they are just married or engaged, find great difficulty in bridging the gap between the price of the house and the amount of money they can borrow.  They know that £1,000 which would be of great assistance to them in bridging this gap, is available under what is called the £1,000 new house grant. They go out, generally on a Sunday, to see this house.  There is usually a show-house available and the girl is attracted to it.  An agent for the builder is on the site.  Those young people are not as fully informed as they should be when they sign up to <Col N="1119" /> purchase what is the major investment they will make in their lifetime.</P>
    <P>This young couple go to a building society and tell them that they have been to see a particular estate and the price of the house is £12,000, £13,000 or whatever it may be.  The building society, the insurance company, the local authority or whoever is dealing with them agree to advance them a proportion of the money to purchase that house.  They frequently use the same solicitor as the builder through ignorance and because in many cases they have no solicitor of their own or they do not know a solicitor.  In 99 per cent of the cases this builder is a very competent, well known, and reputable person.</P>
    <P>The principle of having the same solicitor for the purchaser and the seller is wrong.  In a television programme last Sunday dealing with this matter it was shown that in the case of one in three or maybe more of the young people who bought those houses, the contract was drawn up on their side by the same solicitor acting for the builder.  The young couple sign a contract to purchase this house and they are committed to purchasing the house at the price the builders put on it, which building societies are now accepting and giving loans on as being houses worth the money the builders charge.  When they have entered into this contract the young couple write to the Department of the Environment applying for their £1,000 grant.  They are sent back an application form which they fill up and they are told to return this form signed by the builder and enclosing the certificate of reasonable value which the builder has so that they can be paid their £1,000.</P>
    <P>The young couple go back to the builder, who says that he cannot get a certificate of reasonable value from the Department, that he has applied for one and he has been turned down at the price he is charging for the houses.  They go back to the Department and are told that the price being charged by the builder is higher than they think is reasonable for those houses and they will not issue a CRV to that builder for that house.  They <Col N="1120" /> are told they cannot get their £1,000 house grant.</P>
    <P>This young couple have contracted to buy a house at £12,000, £13,000 or whatever the price is.  If it is £13,000 the Department say it should only be £12,500 so they cannot get the £1,000 grant.  There seems to be no way of unlocking this problem for young couples.  The Department are perfectly right in seeing that the houses being erected are of reasonable value. The builder considers that the price he is charging for the house is the price that allows him to pay for his materials and wages and also make a profit.  The building society evidently agree with the builder because they are willing to lend him money on the basis of the builder's price, but the Department say that the house should be priced at less than that.  I know of one case where they said the house should be £3,000 less.  There is obviously some thing very wrong there.  In most cases the gap is less than that.</P>
    <P>This young couple feel they have been conned.  I can see the Department's point of view quite clearly.  The young couple feel they were promised £1,000 if they bought a new house, but they are not getting that because the Department say that the house they have contracted to buy is not reasonable value at the price the builder is charging.  It is obvious that the Department must make an effort to control the price of houses.  I believe somebody said here last week that the price of houses in the last six months had gone up by over 20 per cent.  It is obvious that the builders will get as much as they can for the houses they are building.</P>
    <P>Of course, the brake on the builders up to the time the new grant was introduced was that they had to apply to the Department for it.  Therefore the builders were going to keep on the right side of the Department by keeping their house prices within a certain limit so that they would qualify for the certificate of reasonable value. That position has changed because it is the purchaser of the house who gets the grant.  A builder does not care as long as he gets his price for the house.  He does not mind how the purchaser <Col N="1121" /> finds the finance.</P>
    <P>In the last few weeks the Department issued booklets and had advertisements inserted in the newspapers warning young couples about the trap they might be letting themselves in for. From conversations I have had with other Members I am aware that there are hundreds of young couples who, because of their lack of experience, have contracted to buy houses which will not qualify for the new grant. In contracting to buy the house the couples understood that they would qualify for the £1,000 grant but because some builders will not agree to the level of price the Department demands they will not issue the certificate of reasonable value.  I should like to add that the Department rightly ceased to control the price of housing. Those couples are worse off than they were before the introduction of the grant.  Houses have increased in price but I cannot say if the increase is justified or not.  I contacted the Central Statistics Office to find out the level of increase in the price of building materials over a period and I learned that it has increased by more than the normal rate of inflation.  However, it is certain that materials have not increased by the same figure that houses have increased, as mentioned last week in the House, 20 or 25 per cent.  The Minister will have to find some way of protecting those young couples who have never had any experience of dealing with builders, solicitors or the Department before.  He should see to it that they do not suffer because of a dispute between his Department and building contractors. He should see to it that they are not led into a position where they sign a contract to purchase a house on the understanding that they will qualify for the £1,000 grant but discover later that the house does not qualify.  They should not be left in a position of having to find an extra £1,000 over and above the amount needed to bridge the gap between the loan they will obtain from the building society or the insurance company and the builder's price of the house.  In view of the escalation in house prices over the last six months the Minister will have to do something about this situation.  Can <Col N="1122" /> builders of private houses be made apply to the National Prices Commission, as normal traders and manufacturers have to do, before they increase prices?  Can the Minister of State answer that question?  I am aware that it is not his field but I would be obliged if he would find out that information for me.</P>

      <P>I have been trying to get in on this debate for the past three weeks because I cannot get any progress for the people in my constituency who approached me about this matter.  Those people feel they are being done out of £1,000.  I understand the position of the Department in not allowing house prices to go through the ceiling.  If the figure in relation to the increase in house prices in the last six months which was quoted here last week is correct there <Col N="1123" /> is a greater onus on the Department to sit on the private house builders and make them justify the prices they are charging.  Obviously, the Department do not wish to tie a builder to an unprofitable price because of the danger of putting builders out of business. All too frequently in the last few years we have heard of builders going into liquidation and we know of the problems that caused.  I am sure the Department are reasonable when dealing with builders, but caught in this web are the young couples who set about purchasing their own home on the assumption that they would qualify for the £1,000 grant.  They are now faced with a problem because of a fight between the Department and the builders, something which is none of their business.  I accept that in one regard the Department are protecting the interest of house buyers.  The houses concerned may only be £300 or £400 over the Department's limit but the house-buyers still do not qualify for the grant.  I am aware that one house was held to be £3,000 over the limit by the Department. That is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the public relations in regard to this grant scheme improved recently, but as against that I am now informed that builders are not interested in erecting houses that will qualify for the grant.  They are moving on to houses costing between £20,000 and £25,000 which, because of the ground floor area, will not qualify for the grant.  I am making a plea to the Minister to do something for these young people who are not well off.  In most cases the young wives must work for some period after marriage in order to earn the money needed to furnish the house.  The Minister should consider that they are making the biggest investment of their lives.  Admittedly, in most cases it is being made without adequate preparation but they are making the investment in the euphoria of an engagement and a prospective marriage.  I know of dozens in my constituency who are in that position and I expect there are hundreds in the same position throughout the country. It is essential that the Minister do something very urgently to control the <Col N="1124" /> price of houses by referring them to the Prices Commission, or by devising some method whereby he can refuse to issue a certificate of reasonable value to the builder but at the same time so that he would not deprive young couples of their grant.</P>
    <P>This is not the biggest problem for the Minister and his Department, and it is not the problem which will cost most money, but for each one of these couples it is probably the biggest problem they will ever have to face and the Minister must, in fairness, do something to sort out this problem.  It is the Minister's responsibility; he issues the certificate and deals with the builders, and he is offering the £1,000 grant which many young couples felt they had been conned into signing for when it was not available to them when they actually went to get it from the Department. The Minister was missing for most of what I have said, but I am sure his officials will inform him.  I received a letter from one young couple who informed me that they had gone to a Deputy, who is now a Minister, in a neighbouring constituency of mine. That Deputy wrote to the Minister and received a reply saying that the price being charged for the house was outside the limit for the certificate of reasonable value and that the £1,000 grant could not be granted.  I would ask the Minister to look into this problem and not to wait until he is replying to the debate.  I know that when replying to the debate the Minister will say that it is his duty to see that people get reasonable value for the houses they buy.  I agree with that, but there is a human problem here in relation to people who have no experience in dealing with Ministers, Government Departments or solicitors, who are caught in this trap where they expected to receive £1,000 because they were first-time house purchasers.  I know it is not an easy problem to solve but I would be grateful if the Minister would look into this as a matter of urgency to facilitate these couples.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Environment, formerly the Department of Local Government, is the most important Department in the <Col N="1125" /> Government because it is designed to regulate the progress of the country and because of its involvement with local authorities, town commissioners and urban councils throughout the country.  It is only proper that an Estimate of this significance should receive adequate consideration in the House.  When the Minister took office in July last year he had to deal with an enormous task relating to the entire activities of the former Department of Local Government.  The housing grant schemes were practically non-existent. Local authorities had not the necessary finance to embark upon any ambitious housing programmes.  Funds for water and sewerage schemes were insignificant to meet the high cost of the services in each country.  I am glad to see that a start has been made in relation to these problems.  Local authorities throughout the country are being notified of generous allocations from this Department to enable them to get on with the work which they were set up to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new house grant was dealt with at length by the previous speaker, who referred to it as a confidence trick. The £1,000 grant has reinvigorated the building industry.  It has encouraged many people to build their own homes, and if it had not been for the introduction of this grant many of the houses now being constructed throughout the country would not be under construction.  That we have something like 11,000 applications for the new house grant is a clear indication of the interest people are showing in this new grant.  It is a clear indication that they are willing to avail of this scheme to provide themselves with new homes. We must remember that everybody who provides a new home is creating something of value to the nation.  He is making a major contribution towards the jobs creation programme which is required at present.  The building industry which makes full use of Irish manufactured goods is one of our greatest sources of employment. Practically all the materials required for house building can be produced in Ireland.  We have an abundance of gravel, sand and rock.  We have an abundance of cement being manufactured in Ireland.  Due to the advancement <Col N="1126" /> of our forestry programme over the years we have a sizeable amount of native timber which is now available for the building industry.  We also have the materials for roofing, doors, windows and so on.  The building industry has taken remarkable strides in the recent past because of the £1,000 grant.  Despite what anybody else says about a confidence trick, there is no confidence trick as far as I can understand. The grant has encouraged people to set up their own homes. As the previous speaker said, the most important step in the lives of any couple is when they set out to provide themselves with their own home.  This £1,000 grant has gone a long way towards assisting them in their efforts.</P>
    <P>The raising of the income limits for SDA loans has also proved to be a boost to the building industry, but we seem to be arriving at a situation where a further increase in the income limits will be necessary if people are to be encouraged to continue with the building programme.  Many people are earning beyond the £3,500 per annum and do not qualify for the local authority grant and therefore must must go to the building societies or somebody else.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing costs in general, I question the remarks of the previous speaker that housing costs have increased enormously during the past seven or eight months.  The Deputy should get a few more figures and should try to discover the percentage increase which has taken place during the past few months, and the increases that took place in previous years when house building was practically at a standstill.  To pay the £1,000 grant in one lump is the correct approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>Heretofore local authorities had a haphazard method of processing applications.  We discovered that the Minister's predecessor introduced a regulation under which a person qualifying for a local authority grant could earn no more than £39 per week. We all know that anybody earning only £39 per week could not attempt to provide himself with a home.  That was the qualifying limit for grant purposes, and there was a similar regulation <Col N="1127" /> for the local authority supplementary grant.  We should all be delighted that the grants regulations scheme has been simplified, that it is now easier to get the £1,000 grant.  There may be the odd case of somebody building a house with a total floor area beyond 1,344 square feet&mdash;incidentally the old regulation specified a total floor area of 1,249 square feet&mdash;but people can now build a slightly larger house and qualify for the £1,000 grant.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also have been receiving increased allocations for the provision of local authority houses.  Indeed all local authorities are now gearing themselves to the provision of increased housing in the ensuing year. That is a step in the right direction because, irrespective of grants and loans, we will still have an enormous pile of applicants for rehousing by local authorities.  Therefore it is highly important that all local authorities be guaranteed the necessary finance to continue the provision of houses for those people unable to provide for themselves.  Local authorities should not be hampered by the fact that they must now pay greatly inflated prices for suitable building land.  I would recommend that all local authorities endeavour to extend services to areas beyond our major towns where land can be bought for building purposes more cheaply.  Unfortunately we find now that outside of Dublin in our major towns we have housing ghettos. All of the building efforts have been concentrated within the town circle and there have been many resultant problems.  The idea was that if the land was available one should try to provide as many houses as possible within the urban boundary and, in some cases, where those boundaries were extended.</P>
    <P>I believe a new approach is about to be adopted and needs to be encouraged in the development of our towns and villages adjacent to major industrial centres.  It is very important today.  Indeed the creation of new activities in our towns and villages is essential, where building land is cheaper and services can be provided.</P>
    <P>The increased allocation for water <Col N="1128" /> schemes is to be welcomed also, something very much required if we are to achieve and secure the type of development needed for a growing population.  The Minister should make a special effort to ensure that more sewerage schemes are implemented.  I can speak only of my own country.  I find that a village known as Tyrrells-pass, which was chosen to represent Ireland in European Architectural Heritage Year, is still without a proper sewerage system.  The same village has also lost valuable industry on that account.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that greater efforts are made in the allocation of funds to carry out those types of sewerage schemes, in turn, ensuring development in our smaller towns and villages.</P>
    <P>We have also the problem of disease.  It is a pathetic sight to see children dabbling in an open sewer system without proper protection.  The Minister must ensure that our towns and villages have proper sewerage systems to ensure their proper growth and development in future years. Unfortunately the Minister's predecessor did not give adequate attention to this field.  A backlog has built up and the Minister is left to carry the can.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that sewerage schemes are reinvigorated because that is the only way in which we can guarantee the basis of job creation enterprises, about which we are all so concerned at present.  The Department of the Environment and local authorities are the greatest employers we have at present.</P>
    <P>The additional moneys allocated this year will go a long way towards creating additional jobs in addition to improving the appearance of our towns and villages.  The fact that so many local groups have come together and entered their towns and villages for the Tidy Towns Competition must be applauded and encouraged.  The money for the environmental work the Minister has allocated will go a long way in encouraging other groups&mdash; tidy towns committees and so on&mdash;to enter their towns and villages for the competition.  It is a scheme that has <Col N="1129" /> been worth while, and the Department of the Environment and local authorities have played a major role in assisting local groups, which must be commended and encouraged.</P>
    <P>The group water schemes have played a vital role in the extension of important services to rural areas.  We are all indeed pleased to note that the grants towards such schemes have been greatly increased in recent months which will encourage more groups to avail of them and have the necessary works carried out.  In that way work can be undertaken much faster than waiting for years until the local authority would eventually implement a scheme.  The fact that the grants are liberal at present should be an adequate inducement to the various groups to provide this service themselves.  It is one that will benefit rural areas and encourage more people to establish homes there.</P>
    <P>The sewerage schemes for reconstruction work have been increased also, as have been the grants for re-construction work, ensuring that the life of existing housing stocks will be protected for longer periods by the owners availing of those increased grants and undertaking the necessary work.  Also it will provide greater job opportunities for the small building contractor, the man who is not able to enter the big time business, who is commencing in the building industry. Such people will be afforded new opportunities with the recent increases awarded in reconstruction and water and sewerage grants.  The increase in the grant for the provision of additional accommodation for the physically disabled is something that has to be commended also.  It has now been increased to £1,300.</P>
    <P>With regard to improvement of our roads network, we all realise that we have a long way to go yet before we can say we have a road structure system comparable with other countries. Unfortunately, we are a country still expanding and it will take many years before we can expect to have a roads network which will be equal to that of other more advanced and highly industrialised countries.  The increased injection of capital by local authorities this year will result in a <Col N="1130" /> higher proportion of their roads being brought to main road standards.</P>
    <P>One thing I should like to see is a standardised practice in regard to the construction of roads.  In some counties local authorities put up temporary fences which are allowed to remain there for possibly five years.  The last job they do after the road work has been completed is to erect permanent fences.  That is inconvenient for many reasons.  It deprives the land owner of the use of his land and it creates danger as well as inconvenience because the defective fencing allows livestock to wander on to roads to be killed and to cause accidents.  Therefore I advocate standardised practice by local authorities in this respect.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have been noticing a vast increase in traffic on our roads, and the behaviour of many drivers leaves much to be desired.  I suggest that the time has come for the imposition of rigorous speed limits, particularly for the juggernauts which have become so much a part of our country road scene.  I appreciate they are obliged to travel at a speed not in excess of 40 mph, but I have had difficulty overtaking them at 60 mph, and they were heavily laden.  Their drivers do not seem to show proper concern for law-abiding road users and the result is that a high proportion of road accidents are being cause by juggernauts, either through carelessness or defective vehicles.  We have had serious accidents in which people have been killed or badly injured and property damaged.  This is not peculiar to Ireland alone.  It happens in many European countries, but until we can lay down lanes on our roads for the exclusive use of juggernauts, we must appeal to those drivers to move more slowly in order to ensure a greater measure of safety.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made during the debate to the behaviour of motorists. A great deal remains to be done by way of legislation to compel drivers to have greater respect for other road users.  For instance, it is a common practice at night to meet drivers with full headlights on not making any effort to use their dimmers.  Indeed some of them, when they are being <Col N="1131" /> approached, turn on two extra headlights, forcing oncoming drivers to pull up.  They are the road hogs and I do not think it would be difficult to devise legislation to bring them to heel. They are the blackguards of our roads because of their complete disregard for ordinary, careful drivers.</P>
    <P>I expect that the drunken driver will be the subject of much comment later in the debate.  There should be better legislation to deal with drivers who drink to excess, because those who want to use our roads in safety must be protected.  This seems to be more serious here than in other countries and I am sure the Minister is aware of it and that he will take early steps to remedy it.</P>
    <P>This Department are also responsible for the country's organised development. During the years, we have had Bills dealing with organised planning and development but it is regrettable to have to say that our legislation seems to be more liberal in this regard than in other European countries. I refer especially to applications for planning permission, particularly in regard to house building and industrial projects, and the system whereby third parties can lodge objections and hold up proper planning and development, including the construction of houses which would give people the right to own their own homes and the building of factories to provide work for our people.</P>
    <P>This right of objection is being used widely by people in privileged positions. The objectors may be in State or semi-State employment or they may be employees of local authorities&mdash; what we call sheltered employment. They are the type of people who get together in organised groups to prevent development in some areas because they think it is their exclusive right to have peace and seclusion at the expense of those who want houses and those in labour exchange queues who want jobs in new factories, in other words, the under-privileged from whom we never seem to get objections in regard to project development plans. These objections always seem to come from people in permanent pensionable <Col N="1132" /> employment.  It is deplorable and the Minister will have to introduce legislaton to control it.</P>
    <P>When dealing with housing grants earlier I forgot to mention the grants made available recently for the construction of flats or, rather, for the conversion of existing properties into flats.  There is, however, another area in which people erect new flats.  They do not qualify for grant assistance and I fail to understand why a person converting an old building can get £600 but the person building new flats and providing a needed service does not qualify.  In Mullingar and Athlone a number of flats provided in recent years have been taken up because they are a desirable type of accommodation. Therefore I ask the Minister to extend the scheme of grants to such people.</P>
    <P>We should have more of that kind of development.  Childless couples and single people would also avail of such flats.  The trend towards this kind of accommodation has been developing in recent years and it should be encouraged. One way to encourage it would be to include new buildings in the scheme for grants for flats.</P>
    <P>My country is in the midlands and people travel through it on their way from the west and from other areas. Such an area should receive additional road grants because of its geographical location and because of the enormous amount of traffic that uses the roads. In my county we are in the centre of a road from Belfast to Cork and from Dublin to Galway and, consequently, a considerable volume of traffic must travel on our roads to get to their destinations.  A case could be made for further road grants so that roads in the county might be brought up to a good standard.</P>
    <P>There is also the serious problem of the second by-pass bridge over the Shannon at Athlone.  This must be foremost in the mind of every person driving to Dublin from the west.  The project has been held up by planners for a long time.  The Department have been tossing this problem back to the local authority for years asking that further tests and borings be made.  The <Col N="1133" /> Minister's predecessor referred the problem back to the local authority three or four times in recent years and the result is that we still have congestion. Motorists can be held up for one hour trying to get through Athlone.  I would ask the Minister and his officials to ensure that no obstacle will be placed in the way of constructing the by-pass bridge and road over the Shannon at Athlone.</P>
    <P>We have a serious pollution problem.  In a way it is a problem that is associated with progress.  Unfortunately Westmeath seems to have suffered more than other areas in recent years because of pollution.  I think the title &ldquo;Department of the Environment&rdquo; is most appropriate. When somebody complimented the Minister on changing the name of the Department I am sure they were thinking specifically of the problem of pollution.  This problem will have to be tackled seriously if we want to encourage the growth of the tourist industry.  Tourists want to fish in our lakes, to enjoy the recreational facilities available and to enjoy the scenery.  They should not be faced with the prospect of a polluted lake where there is no fishlife.  The efforts being made to control or prevent pollution should be encouraged and in this connection the Minister and the Government should be complimented on what they have done.</P>
    <P>In Westmeath we have had serious pollution problems.  Lough Sheelin was affected.  This was most important because it is a valuable tourist attraction and it earned considerable revenue.  Then there was pollution in Lough Ennel, a lake close to where I live.  I am glad to report that that pollution problem seems to have been resolved.  The approval recently of a tertiary treatment plant by the Minister in respect of Lough Ennel will go a long way towards alleviating any pollution in the area.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is also the problem of air and other types of pollution which are caused by our changing society.  Research must be continued to ensure that industries will not cause pollution.  I am pleased that the IIRS and An Foras Forbartha are <Col N="1134" /> active in this area.  However, I think the problem can be over-exaggerated by certain people.  As I said, these people are not in the dole queues, they are not the young people seeking employment.  They are people who are retired or else have guaranteed employment themselves.  Frequently the newspapers go overboard in highlighting pollution problems that do not exist.  We have organisations that are adequate to ensure that safeguards are built in respect of dirty industries so that pollution does not occur.  I am satisfied that pollution does not exist here to the extent that is stated in the press and by local pressure groups.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are playing an important role in the planning and development of the country.  Members of local authorities have given valuable service during the years.  They are elected by the people.  I should like to see legislation introduced to strengthen the powers of local authorities, thus allowing them to play a greater role in the development and planning of their areas.  Recently members of local authorities expressed fears that their functions were being diminished by the abolition of rates and by the payment of road grants at State level.  The role of the local authorities continues to expand.  When the health boards were established many people thought the local authorities would have less to do; but having regard to the development that has taken place throughout the country and the amount of roadworks being carried out and remaining to be done, the local authorities still have an important role to play.</P>
    <P>I should like to see legislation introduced so that the members would receive some form of compensation for their work.  They are the only unpaid servants in our society.  They give their time, advice and help and they get nothing except travelling and subsistence allowances.  I understand in the urban areas they get nothing at all. Their contribution to the economic growth of the country is not fully appreciated or understood.</P>
    <P>I should like to see something done to compensate them for what they <Col N="1135" /> have been doing for the community and the country over the years.  I should like to see their status strengthened so as to assure continuation of local democracy.  People prize nothing more than having local councillors available at all times to assist in various problems.  Every new scheme brings additional work for local authorities and their members. There is greater need for co-operation between county managers and elected members.  Unfortunately, some officials like to play down the role of elected members, but I feel sure that the Minister, who is fully aware of the value of local authorities, will want to ensure that the local councillor is appreciated.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have enormous power, and this must be continued. They should be encouraged to secure more and more development in rural areas and ensure that legislation and plans are available so that more people may avail of a healthy environment in rural areas.  It is not sufficient to have the farmers in rural Ireland. People should be encouraged to provide houses for themselves in rural areas and enjoy the better quality of life and the healthier conditions than those that exist in built-up areas.  That is why I should like planning regulations eased, to enable this type of development to proceed in rural areas. At present planning regulations seem to prevent it but I want it encouraged, and all local authorities should be advised to go easy on such development so as to ensure that it can proceed. If there is more development in rural areas this will relieve the burden in urban areas, relieve traffic congestion and ensure that more services can be provided.  It will ensure that more rural shops will survive.  It is tragic to see a village decay and go off the map, a tragedy when the local postoffice, school and church disappear, because a community dies when those things go.  Therefore, the work and responsibility of local authorities is very important in this field.</P>
    <P>The Department now carries the cost of financing local authorities where the rating method operated in <Col N="1136" /> the past.  I understand it will cost £80 million approximately this year to replace rates.  That benefits the community in general.  The abolition of rates on private houses and farm buildings was not mentioned here today but it is very important that people generally can enjoy the benefit of this scheme while the Department of the Environment recoup the local authorities to a very great extent.  In fact, in some cases I think local authorities this year will get finance 100 per cent greater than under the old rating system.</P>
    <P>Now that rates on private houses are abolished, the greatest contributors to the rating system will be the farmers. In view of this, they will expect and demand greater services from local authorities.  They are entitled to this, and a great deal of attention must be focused on that area from now on. They will require field drainage, land drainage, making of roadways and so on.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that the present Minister decided to increase the contribution under the Local Improvement Scheme.  Some counties availed of that scheme to a very great extent while others did not.  Unfortunately, my own county did not avail of it when it was introduced, with the result that some years ago money was returned to the Department unexpended.  I think the scheme will be availed of much more in future because people in rural areas realise that they are contributing through the rates and will expect greater benefits.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that local authorities make full use of that scheme, which is a worthwhile one designed to benefit those in rural areas and assist farmers to improve their land in areas not covered by land projects schemes or by the Board of Works schemes.  Groups of farmers may now come together, avail of the Local Improvement Scheme and have worthwhile development carried out benefiting themselves and further increasing farm production.</P>
    <P>In referring to SDA loans earlier I neglected to mention the Low Rise Mortgage Scheme introduced by the Minister's predecessor.  This is a useful scheme that should be utilised more <Col N="1137" /> freely.  I appeal to the present Minister to try to liberalise the regulations governing qualification of applicants under that scheme.  If the scheme is fully availed of it will benefit the local authority and the Department in the long run.  People on the housing waiting list who see no hope of being rehoused would avail of the Low Rise Mortgage Scheme if some of the red tape could be discarded, making it easier for them to qualify.  I have no costings, but I understand that if some minor adjustments were made and more people were allowed to qualify it would benefit both the Department and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would make a special appeal to the Minister to examine that scheme with his officials and see if changes can be made so that more people will benefit from the scheme.  It is only now that it is being understood, and for that reason we can expect a noted increase in inquiries with regard to the possibility of securing loans under the low-rise mortgage scheme.  People take pride in owning their own homes, and the more private development we have the better it is for the community in general.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that no effort is spared in continuing on the road towards development.  If we are to have the type of economic development we want we must give our full support to the best efforts of the Minister, who is endeavouring to ensure that everything possible is done with regard to job creation, the construction of highways and the improvement of the environment in general.</P>

      <P>Deputies were required to give the titles of any documents from which they quoted.  The new feature is regrettable and did not occur in any former Dáil.</P>
      <P>When the Minister introduced the Estimate I wished him well in his Department. He had as much understanding of local government matters as any other member of his party.  The major question concerning the Department of the Environment is the abolition of rates, and this was referred to in the Minister's speech.  The amount involved is £80.75 million.  Were it not for the defeat of Fianna Fáil in 1973 and the election of the National Coalition, there would not be any question of the abolition of rates.  This matter would not have arisen, nor would the abolition of motor tax.  That is a statement of fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who had been asking for relatively small concessions were told that money was not available to make these concessions. We must assume that the moneys promised by Fianna Fáil in their manifesto were provided for the sole purpose of securing office again and getting a sufficient number of the electorate to change from support of the Coalition.  That is quite factual.  I mentioned this recently during a debate, and I know that the Coalition Government were also addressing themselves to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that we all benefit from the abolition of rates, or we think we do.  The bigger the house we own, the more we benefit.  The owner of a <Col N="1139" /> house with a valuation of around £100 benefits very much indeed, taking into account an average rate this year of £11 or £12 in the £.  There was not any great demand from such people that they should be excluded from the obligation to pay rates.  People have been paying rates since the foundation of the State.  It was felt that rates were necessary to provide services, to improve roads, to help in the provision of houses and to help needy sections of the population.  In recent years, and particularly at the instance of the former Minister, Deputy Tully, there was a provision in the Estimates to meet the demands of necessitous people, whereby the State and the local authorities combined to provide a fund in order to waive the rates of people deemed to be necessitous. What could be done with even a fraction of this money were it now available?</P>
    <P>A family may calculate that since they do not pay rates this year and pay only a nominal £5 in car tax, if their car is less than 16 h.p., they have saved a certain amount of money.  During my period in this House I never heard any Deputy claiming that car tax should be abolished.  It is evident there was not a demand for it.  I have not heard of any local authorities passing resolutions to that effect.  This was one of the main ploys of Fianna Fáil in winning over the support of the electorate, particularly of young people who own cars.</P>
    <P>The abolition of rates and car tax would be desirable and welcome were it not for the fact that according to the Minister's budget statement we must borrow the money.  We were told in that statement that it is essential to get £821 million by way of borrowing for the current year and of the £821 million we secure&mdash;I understand that is the maximum we can borrow&mdash; £416 million will be current expenditure and £405 million supposedly for capital works.  It is evident from that that we do not have this money.  How will we continue?  Some Members here&mdash;I presume they are economists and so on&mdash;should tell us.  It would be interesting to hear them explain how we will continue.  We will borrow <Col N="1140" /> £416 million and I assume the interest rates will be 7, 8 or 9 per cent net. Will the outlook be any brighter next year?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite in order in dealing with car tax and rates and their abolition but he is not in order in going into the budget, loans and so on. That would be for the debate on the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">

      <P>But where will the money come from?  Can we afford to continue this kind of system in the future?  Is there some truth in the rumour that the Government are proposing to put a higher duty on new cars to help to recover what was lost by the abolition of road tax?  Rates and car tax have been abolished and we have to borrow to offset their abolition.  The Minister should explain where the money will come from.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have referred to the fact that some of the burden has been transferred to the farming community. In the case of farmers with valuations in excess of £75 there will be no relief this year and I understand next year there will be no relief for farmers with £60 valuations.  This is the policy of the party which, in Opposition, advocated the derating of agricultural land.  Of course that was done to secure a few votes here, there and everywhere, at marts and fairs, and so on.  It was implied that Fianna Fáil were the party which would derate agricultural land.  I think they said land had been derated in Northern Ireland and why should we not do that here.</P>

      <P>Local cumainn here and there.  I am sure the Minister has a good idea how that sort of thing happens.  In any case some of the burden has been, as I said, transferred to the farming community and another part of the burden has been transferred to the self-employed.  If you are a small builder or a small industrialist the tax man is on your doorstep much more frequently than he used to be. Of course, the Government must get <Col N="1141" /> the money somewhere but there are people now, following the return of Fianna Fáil to power, suffering a great deal of frustration in trying to meet the demands of the tax man. I agree that everyone should contribute his fair share in income tax.</P>

      <P>The pressure is on because of the abolition of rates. Great credit is due to the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, for the way in which he put life into the building and construction industry during his term of office.  The housing targets set were met during the four years he was in charge of Local Government.  Private house building and local authority housing improved very much.  In Cork County Council (West) we built more local authority houses in those four years than we built in the previous 16 from 1957 to 1973 when Fianna Fáil were in office.  That is an easily verified fact. That gives an idea of the progress we made.  The Cork County Council (West) area fares badly.  We kept our demands down to the lowest possible level because we believe in being realistic and we appreciate there is a limitation to the amount of money available.  I wonder is it a good idea to be too realistic?  We got £85,000 to pay for schemes completed.  We then demanded a modest £268,000, a deliberately reduced figure we thought would be allowed without question, but the Minister reduced it to £115,000. That may be the pattern all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister replied to a question tabled by Deputy Tully on 18 April about the amount of money allocated to local authorities.  Cork County Council (West) has undoubtedly fared very badly and I would ask the Minister to review our position.  We have fared worse than any other area.  We have asked the Minister to receive a deputation of the three public representatives at some suitable time to discuss the matter.  I have the list here in the reply given on 18 April.  Cork County <Col N="1142" /> Council (South) is not doing so well either.  The allocation there is £125,000. They got £1,120,000 to pay past commitments; we got only £85,000.  What sort of figure is this?  The amount allocated for housing for North Cork is £100,000, for South Cork it is £125,000 and West Cork it is £150,000. That is £340,000 for the three areas, and £340,000 at £10,000 to £11,000 per house would cater for only 30 houses.  I cannot understand how that position obtains in the three Cork areas because that amount is inadequate.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the Minister's reply that the demands of county councils and local authorities of all kinds were greatly reduced.  Naturally, the Minister will say that we have not got the money.  I am relating this matter to the abolition of rates and car tax and the £521 million that was borrowed. How much of the money that was borrowed for current expenditure this year will go towards the provision of houses and sanitary services?</P>
    <P>I believe that, in so far as it is possible, people should build their own houses.  To entice people to build their own houses the Government should give loans at cheaper rates to those who qualify for local authority housing.  That is not happening and the cost of housing is steadily increasing. The new housing grant was referred to in detail this morning by Deputy Barry.  He seemed to imply that there was some kind of a test to qualify for a house, that if it was over a certain figure an application would be rejected.  He did mention that the grant was only available to first-time house owners.  If a person owned a house either here or abroad they would not qualify for the grant.  The 27 May is the date set for the commencement of the scheme.  It is true to say that the £1,000 housing grant was bandied around before that date.  As many people had commenced the erection of houses before that date, is there any hope of substituting 1 January 1977 for May 27 1977?  The date for the old scheme varied on the recommendations of local authorities.  I appeal to the Minister to consider varying the date.  It would be of advantage to <Col N="1143" /> many people if the grants were paid retrospectively to 1 January 1977.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the case of a man who has a house that cannot be renovated or that is not worth renovating and who needs a new house.  Does he get a grant irrespective of his income or valuation?  If he is a farmer with a valuation of £60 or less he would have been entitled to a grant of £650 under the old scheme. A farmer with a valuation of less than £25 got £900 under the old scheme. This was at a time when houses were cheaper than they are at present and when income levels were set down for wage earners.  Many public representatives are frequently asked about the position of such a man.  If I were approached in the morning by someone who told me that his house was very bad and who wanted to build a new house, does the fact that he owns a house exclude him from qualifying under the new scheme?  I should like the Minister to clarify that point in his reply as there is still great doubt about it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to planning, which is closely connected to the subject of house building.  Everybody appreciates that we must have planning laws but there is a great deal of controversy about the administration of the planning regulations.  The Minister should give clear instructions to the county councils in regard to their powers and functions.  When these planning regulations were introduced it was thought that members of county councils would have the right to draw up plans, formulate proposals and have rights of consultation in their implementation.  The procedures vary from county to county. In some counties approved plans are handed to the executives for decisions.</P>
    <P>There is also the unusual position that an elected member of the council has no right to see a file on an application for which he has made representations. It is my view that planing files should be made available to members of councils and to applicants and objectors who wish to appeal. How can a person make a case for an appeal if he does not see the file and <Col N="1144" /> if he gets only a summary of the reasons why his application failed, as happens at present?  There may be five or six recommendations on the application up along the line from the junior engineer to the top.  In some cases 50 would be in favour of granting the application and 50 against.  The applicant does not know.</P>
    <P>The job of engineers, planning officers and technical officers is to make a factual assessment of the application. When that job is done, it should be open to inspection by members of local authorities who may be interested in the application, or available to people to help them to submit an appeal if the decision is unfavourable and they so desire it.  I understand that is happening quite legally in some counties. The managerial or executive side and the members are in close harmony in the determination of planning applications.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the question of planning.  Why should an engineer or a planning officer fear the exposure of his report? Is the report not supposed to be factual? If you go to a lower court and you decide to appeal, you have the advantage of hearing the other side of the story, the other person's case.  If the file on a planning permission is kept out of your reach, you have no hope of getting the information which is essential and desirable.</P>
    <P>In some areas we are going too far with planning restrictions.  I come from the Berehaven peninsula which is almost at the extreme end of this country.  It is one of three peninsulas in west Cork, Berehaven, Sheep's Head and Mizen Head.  The land is not too good in any of the three areas. Its agricultural content is not great. We have a great deal of hilly land, some mountains and indifferent land. It is a marvellous area for tourism. West Cork has scenic advantages and we would like to preserve them, but we are going too far.</P>
    <P>Our population declined in the thirties, forties and fifties.  People had to leave because they could not eke out a living at home.  Employment was scarce and there was a great deal of comment about the declining population, <Col N="1145" /> quite justifiably.  Now if a farmer gives a plot to his son, as has happened and is happening, he is not supposed to get planning permission to build a house if he wants to stay at home and work in the neighbourhood. There is a difficulty about getting planning permission and, in some cases, permission will only be granted if the site satisfies the planning authority.  It costs as much to build a house on a good site as on a bad one.  People are asked to build houses in a valley or on a poor quality site.  That is unfair. Members of families who get sites on their own farms should be treated more leniently.</P>
    <P>I know the peninsula from one end to the other and I cannot see how building additional houses will take away from the scenic advantages of the area.  If you travel from Bantry to Kilcrohane and out to Sheep's Head you will see that the valley on the left hand side is so deep that houses would not take away from the view of the sea or the islands.  The same could be said about Berehaven peninsula.</P>
    <P>Most of these people were poor and many of them are not endowed with too much of the world's goods.  A site of no agricultural value will fetch £2,000, £3,000 or £4,000.  Look at the advantages of getting approval for that site to a small farmer in the areas I am speaking of, or in Kerry, Galway, Mayo, and so on.  Look at the benefit it would be to a man with a young family.  It would give him a chance of providing additional education for his family.  It would give him a chance to develop his existing holding.  In many cases without justification people are deprived of that source of income by a planning board.  They are told a piece of land must be preserved so that the Germans, the British, the French and people from Northern Ireland can look at it.  They are not allowed to touch it.  That is a fair analysis of what is happening.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I agreed with planning.  I will not refer to them as pressure groups as Deputy Keegan did, but the people say: &ldquo;Look at what this means to me and to my family.  Tell me how a house takes away from the amenities of the area.&rdquo;<Col N="1146" /> There are acres and acres of hills and rocks and an extra 300 or 400 houses scattered around will not make too much of an impact.  Our population is going down.  Are we to keep it down because people cannot get permission to build a house?  This is outrageous. People who were born and bred in the area are being refused permission to erect houses on their own farms.</P>
    <P>What about the time taken for determining planning applications?  In some cases this takes years, and house prices are increasing steadily.  An application is sent to the county council and it is supposed to be determined within two months.  In two months you get a letter looking for information, and that keeps it on the open file for months and months.  The planning regulations should be reviewed and councils should be told exactly what their powers are and whether it is necessary to increase those powers or to curtail them.  They should know what their rights are.  At present it seems that their role could be compared to that of the messenger boy, to do what they are told.  Any junior clerk can read the files.  As far as confidentiality is concerned, councils have not that type of integrity.  It is a scandalous reflection on people elected to county and borough councils in the same way as Members are elected to this Dáil.</P>
    <P>The appeals position is an impossible one.  The files are kept away from the appellants.  They do not know what is set down in the file.  As Chairman of Cork County Council for some years I had an opportunity of reading the planning files and I could see what an advantage it would be for people submitting appeals to have that facility.</P>

      <P>I know that, it has not gone away from my memory. We had a discussion here during the week on Bord na Gaeilge.  I do not agree with farming out boards.  We are supposed to have a central fisheries board in the not too distant future.  I oppose that, and I object to the eroding of the authority of the Government of the day and of this House.</P>
      <P>Appeals to the planning board take a long time to determine and people suffer a great deal of frustration, almost as much and if not more than when the appeals were determined by the Department.  There should be some streamlining of regulations, particularly in simple cases such as the erection of a single dwelling house.  Why should it take 12 months to determine the approval or otherwise of that?  It is outrageous that so much time should elapse while house prices are jumping up and up.  In my own area, between Ballydehob and Skibbereen, a local young fellow, a worker, got a piece of land for the building of a house.  I cannot see for the life of me why there should be any objection, good, bad or indifferent, to granting him planning permission at county council level, but for some peculiar reason he was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This piece of land is two miles from the sea.  He had to appeal and the appeal came up to the board last May. This is April and the matter has not been determined yet.  It is as simple a question as could be.  In the mean time the young man had a contract with a local contractor to build a house for <Col N="1148" /> him at a low cost.  The price of the house has now increased by something at least equivalent to the grant, if he qualifies for it, of £1,000, while he is waiting on the deliberations first of all of the county council and now of the board.  I do not see why there should be such a delay when house prices are increasing.  One can understand the frustration of such a young man who hopes to marry as soon as the house is ready.</P>
    <P>This is one case.  How many more such cases would you find if you travelled around the country, in Donegal, Mayo, Galway and so forth?  These people are being treated with contempt. Their applications have been put into some corner on some shelf and left there.  I do not want the board to get away with merely treating these applications.  At least let them write and tell people the causes of the delays. I appreciate that the board may have a large number of appeals to deal with, I do not know how many, but I see no justification for the delay in determining the appeals.  I hope the Minister will inquire into this.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House, but I would like to refer to the availability of loans.  Taking into account the present value of money and that sometimes wives are working as well as their husbands, the qualifying rate of £3,500 for a local authority loan&mdash; and in the case of a couple who are both working this refers to their combined income&mdash;is rather low and it should be looked at with a view to increasing it.</P>
    <P>Regarding water supply and sewage the demands on local authorities for money are very high, but every effort should be made to get water and sewage schemes under way without delay.  Every help should be given to the rural water supply group schemes. That system had almost disappeared at the time Deputy Tully assumed office. In many instances money had been refunded to groups who had already paid but Deputy Tully as Minister made great strides in the area of group water schemes and I trust that this Minister will follow that example.</P>
    <P>The question of roads is a major one for the Department of the <Col N="1149" /> Environment.  The amount allocated for road works this year is 11 per cent greater than the amount allocated last year.  Having regard to inflation it is unlikely that this amount will allow any extra work to be done.  In the first instance every effort should be made in regard to major roads because these have to carry the heaviest traffic.  While the Cork-Dublin road is reasonably good there are some counties in which it is not what it should be.  I refer particularly to County Kildare and to that stretch of roadway from Kildare to Newbridge. This is the road across the Curragh and I can see no reason, having regard to the scope for development there, for this road not being developed and if necessary a dual carriageway built.  Any Minister must examine the road question on the basis of importance.  Many of our roads are first class but there are many that need attention.  Some county councils seem to be more capable than others so far as this question is concerned, particularly in regard to smooth surfaces.  The major roads linking Dublin with Cork or with Donegal or Galway should be as good as possible having regard especially to the fact that a third of our population reside in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Those of us who represent constituencies such as South-West Cork or Donegal find that in regard to roads the main representations made to us concern the improvement of smaller roads.  We do not have many inquiries about the major roads, Those smaller roads are usually improved under the Local Improvement Scheme.  The figure for that scheme this year is £1.75 million and the Minister has told us that he will be bringing in an environmental improvement scheme that will cost £4 million.  As I said during the course of the debate on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works&mdash;this is perhaps more relevant to the Department of the Environment than to any other&mdash;we are handing out money for nothing instead of providing work for the people concerned by way of road improvements, drainage and so on. Most of these people would prefer to be working. The money that is paid <Col N="1150" /> to them while they are unemployed would go a long way towards financing improvement schemes of the type I have mentioned, schemes that would be of much benefit to the country and particularly to people in remote areas. I have been advocating such a policy since I became a Member of this House.  There is no justification for a situation in which a casual worker with a local authority who is earning £45 per week is laid off and thereby forced to go to the labour exchange as a result of which he will be paid as much money as if he were working but for doing nothing.  There is no sense in that.  Surely it would be possible to formulate a programme whereby there would be co-operation between the Departments concerned to keep that man at work.  We could rechannel much of the money that is paid out by way of social welfare allowances and utilise it in work on various schemes such as the local employment scheme and environmental improvement scheme works.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have a word with the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and also with the man who is supposed to be the kingpin of all our economic planning with a view to ascertaining what arrangement could be made to implement schemes that are necessary and useful and which could be carried out with little or no additional cost to the Exchequer.  This could be done by utilising the subvention from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It is degrading for a man who is anxious to work to have to sign on at an employment exchange or at a Garda station.  By implementing the kind of schemes I have in mind the Minister would be taking some of the people from the Live Register and would be going some way towards fulfilling the promise of 30,000 extra jobs that we have been hearing so much about and which are in addition to replacements.  So far there is not much sign of action in that area.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what criteria is laid down by the EEC regarding funds for local improvement works such as water and sewerage schemes. I would like to know the amount of <Col N="1151" /> money made available to the Department of the Environment last year and during the current year for development works and what are the future prospects.  The EEC was supposed to act as a fairy godfather.  Once we became a member everything was supposed to be rosy in the garden.  We find that is not the case.  The amount allocated for improvement works is very small taking into account all the demands made by community councils and development associations.  It is a good thing to see towns and villages throughout the country trying to develop their areas.  It would be a great advantage to those people if they got good amenity grants.  It would, as I said earlier, relieve the unemployment position.</P>

      <P>This is my first opportunity to wish the Minister well in his portfolio. He is a practical man, a man of common sense, the type of qualities which are needed in this portfolio. When one reads the Minister's speech one is struck not only by the magnitude of the projected expenditure for 1978 of £206 million but also by the variety and the complexity of the services for which the Minister carries the ultimate responsibility.  For some years the capacity of local authorities to discharge their functions adequately has been frustrated by the lack of money.  It has long been acknowledged that the rates, about which there was a lot of comment this morning, which provided a considerable part of the revenue of local authorities, was not an adequate source of income.  Apart from that rates as a form of taxation <Col N="1152" /> suffered from the fundamental defect that it did not have regard to the ability of ratepayers to pay the amount levied on them.  The rates waiver scheme and the right to pay rates by instalments, although helpful, did nothing to deal with the basic flaw to which I referred.</P>
      <P>I welcome the abolition of rates on domestic and other property.  The effect of that decision will be to hive off to the taxpayer, whose liability will be related to his income, the responsibility for moneys hitherto collected from people who in some instances were not in a position to pay the amounts demanded.</P>
      <P>A lot has been said today about housing and the new grant and loan and also the increased reconstruction grant.  It is the policy of Fianna Fáil to encourage people to erect their own dwellings.  It behoves them to give young people the incentive to do that. The right type of incentive has been given by the introduction of the new £7,000 loan and the £1,000 grant.  The more people we can encourage to erect their own homes the more local authority houses will be available for those in the lower income group, the people who would not be able to avail of the facilities of the £7,000 loan because of their inability to repay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy spoke a lot of sense with regard to the planning authorities throughout the country.  It is an interesting coincidence that when I spoke on the budget Deputy Willie O'Brien came after me and he did not agree with me.  He probably will not agree with me today either.  Planning authorities often apply the letter of the law too much in regard to planning applications. Deputy Murphy spoke about the young man in Cork who looked for planning permission to erect a house because he wished to get married. We must not be too bureaucratic in a situation like this.  Planning officers in the various planning offices throughout the country are inhibiting.  It is a pity that when a person wants to erect his home, not just somebody who wants to erect a scheme of houses and make a lot of money out of it, and avail of the facilities which the Government are providing in a loan and a grant, <Col N="1153" /> he comes across this inhibiting situation in his local planning office.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand some of the problems which exist in Deputy Murphy's county council.  I have been on the Meath County Council since 1974 and I have access to any file I wish in the planning office.  As far as I am aware any member of the public can go into a planning office and ask to see a file which might be relevant to him.  Since I was elected to Meath County Council I have never been refused permission to look through a file in the planning office. The situation may vary in different counties and it is obvious that it is different in Deputy Murphy's constituency.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with An Bord Pleanála.  I tend to be sceptical about boards and I was wary about this board when it was established. The board which the Minister for the Gaeltacht is seeking to establish may be a healthy thing in relation to that ministry, but even though there is merit in a board such as An Bord Pleanála I am sceptical of it.  It is possible that a Minister for the Environment might not welcome the tremendous responsibility of having to make decisions on planning appeals, but it is not correct that such appeals should be dealt with by a board that people do not have access to.  While I cannot criticise the performance of this board to date it appears that it is endorsing the decisions of local authorities in refusing planning permission.  During the course of my contribution on the budget debate I suggested that if the Government found that this board was in any way inhibiting their policy they should consider its abolition.  I reiterate that suggestion now.</P>
    <P>Many Members have referred to the condition of public roads.  There is no doubt that all our county roads are carrying a lot more traffic than they were built for.  They are not in a healthy state and have not been so for many years.  In Meath we were proud for many years of the fact that we had the best roads in the country, but in recent years, in common with counties like Kildare, because of the extra <Col N="1154" /> volume of traffic they are carrying they have deteriorated.  Those roads carry all the heavy traffic from the north and the west destined for the city, traffic they were never intended for.  I agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Keegan this morning that counties adjoining Dublin should be given special consideration by the Minister in relation to the allocation of money for road improvements.  I accept that it is the intention of the Minister to provide more than £37 million for road works in the current financial year and I should like to state that in referring to the condition of our roads it is not my intention to reflect on our policy makers.</P>
    <P>Until comparatively recently the ownership of a motor car was the privilege of a minority, but such ownership is now the expectation of the majority, and long may that be so.  A proper road system is essential and economically desirable.  Such a system would have great advantages. It would eliminate delay, thus ensuring a saving in the consumption of petrol and oil, reducing the wear and tear on vehicles, expenditure on repairs, and make for safety and the saving of lives.  It would avoid the frustration and pollution caused by traffic jams. The provision of such a road system will call for considerable expertise and expenditure of vast sums of money.  It is my belief that the Minister will have to embark on a crash programme to rectify the situation in relation to our roads.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning for the future it is essential that Departments, such as the Department of the Environment, are armed with vital statistics.  Such statistics can be gained from the population census, and for that reason it is regrettable that the previous Government decided not to proceed with the census.  We must now wait until 1980 to get such vital information so that we can plan ahead, even as far as the year 2000.  In the course of my trips to Europe I learned to appreciate how lucky we are to be living on an island with so many centres of the population within close proximity to the seaside.  I am fortunate in that I live within 20 miles of a beach.  The <Col N="1155" /> people of Meath are fortunate in that they have seven miles of coastline but we all envy those who live in counties like Donegal, Kerry, Cork, Wexford and Clare which have such excellent beaches.  Three miles of the Meath coastline is not accessible because of Gormanston Camp and the remaining area is attracting many people from north County Dublin who formerly made the journey to the beaches on the south side.</P>
    <P>All local authorities should try to preserve our beaches from coast erosion and from all types of litter. We are fortunate in being a small island with access to beaches.  The major continental countries have no access to beaches.  Litter is a worldwide problem but we seem to be inept in tackling it.  In industrial towns, such as Navan, where I live, it is hard to control the disposal of litter.  People are somewhat careless in relation to the disposal of litter no matter how many litter bins are provided.  It should be emphasised in schools and on television that it is important to act responsibly in relation to the disposal of litter.  On the Continent the people are very litter conscious.  Even in London, which has huge population, the people are more meticulous than we are in relation to the disposal of litter.  The collection of litter in most areas has helped to arrest the problem to some extent.</P>
    <P>This service is a draw on the Exchequer, but is well worth while. Many people do not appreciate the service.  In some rural areas where litter cannot be collected people seem to dispose of litter at the nearest crossroads. There is nothing so distasteful, when driving through the country than to see litter all over the place at crossroads. We depend very much on the tourist industry and tourists are very particular about hygiene.  The Minister should encourage people to ensure that reasonable standards are maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the itinerant problem.  Those of us who are members of local authorities are aware of the problems of housing itinerants. As Christians it is our duty to make every effort to integrate these people <Col N="1156" /> into the community.  There are some avenues which have not yet been traversed in the solving of the itinerant housing problem.  There is a scheme in the Department of the Environment whereby the Department will subsidise any local authority to house an itinerant family, but this scheme is not being properly used.  Many religious communities have land which could be used for this purpose.  Near most religious communities there are schools and shopping facilities.  These religious communities in small parishes could integrate a few intinerant families so that the children of itinerants would be educated and would associate with the other children.  There is also a problem in relation to the housing of roadside traders who are not really itinerants. Most of these people are very well off and, with the aid of the £1,000 grant and the local authority loans, they would be able to purchase their own houses and should be encouraged to do so.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been mentioned frequently this morning.  I speak not alone as a member of Meath County Council but as a member of the General Council of County Councils.  The Minister will be our guest at the end of the month at our annual conference in Wexford.  At local democracy level one finds much wisdom in the contributions of speakers.  Motions are frequently passed which reflect the Government opinion of the day.  Some excellent ideas have been put forward at the level of General Council of County Council meetings.  Any Minister for the Environment should have, shall I say, a good Acker Bilk ear for the ideas emanating from local authorities at these annual conferences.</P>
    <P>The danger has been mentioned here that because the State will be providing most of the funds to be expended by local authorities the Minister will be over-involved in local affairs and that, as a consequence, local democracy will suffer.  I freely acknowledge the danger of such a situation.  The principle that he who pays the piper shall call the tune applies generally.  The Minister will have to exercise great vigilance in this <Col N="1157" /> regard.  Over a century ago the philosopher, John Stewart Mill, when discussing the relationship between central and local governments, declared that, speaking generally, no persons were better equipped to discharge any function than those directly affected by it.  I believe Mill was correct and that his views accurately reflect the position today.  I am heartened to hear that the Minister is conscious of the need to preserve the independence of county councils and other local authorities.  If the services now provided at local level were to be administered from the centre the inevitable result would be uniformity of service and inflexibility where regard could not be had to the varying demands and needs of different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  He has a most important portfolio and a hefty task.  The question was posed: was it wise to have changed the name of the Department to the Department of the Environment?  In general I think it was.  It embraces local government up and down the country, the concept of local government as we have known it.  I assure the Minister, as a member of a local authority and of this Dáil, of my full co-operation.  I shall endeavour to ensure, whenever I can, that the facilities he is supplying will be availed of.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been levelled at the £1,000 grant.  If Members of the House who criticised it had read its intent they would have found that it was clearly emphasised that the grant would be paid to people when they were living in their dwellings. Many questions have been asked about the number of grants already paid out.  Since the scheme has been in operation only since 26 May last how in heaven's name could a tremendous amount of grants have been paid out?  How many houses could have been built since that date?  Those who have criticised that grant&mdash;if they repeat their question to the Minister in 12 months' or two years' time&mdash; will find that they will be given a very different answer.</P>
    <P>I wish this most competent, practical <Col N="1158" /> and common-sense Minister the height of success in his portfolio.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate&mdash; what used to be that of the Department of Local Government&mdash;always aroused a certain amount of interest in the House.  I believe that was so because of its closeness to the community and, above all, to the many Deputies of this House.  We are all aware that 90 per cent of the Deputies here are deeply concerned with the environment, by virtue of their membership also of county councils, corporations and urban councils.</P>
      <P>One must refer to the change in title of the Department.  It is a regrettable fact that the title &ldquo;Local Government&rdquo; has disappeared.  There was a Department of State that always dealt with local government.  Since the first Dáil Local Government had a life of its own.  On the foundation of the State it was associated with the Department of Health in an informal way but since 1947 has operated on its own.  For that reason many people are prompted to pose the question: why a change of name at this stage?  There must be some significance in the change of name and in the fact that in a brief of 58 pages the Minister did not refer to such change until the very late stages and then a mere reference only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope that there is no move afoot to kill local government in the sense in which we knew it and that it will not be replaced by a Department controlled from the centre. I believe there is simple justification for such apprehension.  In letters recently from the Department to local authorities we have felt that a certain effort is being made to erode the responsibility of the public representative. Local government should be something more than a mere provision of services.  It is part of a democracy which is closest to the grass roots.  There is not a public representative who is not aware of the close ties of local government with the ordinary man and woman of the country.  In the White Paper on local government reorganisation in 1971 it was clearly pointed out that local government organisations exist for a practical <Col N="1159" /> reason as well as a democratic one and that therefore they should be in a special position.</P>
    <P>Many people have pointed to the dangers attached to inhibiting local representatives.  As public representatives we have an obligation to protect the rights of local representatives who have given so much service throughout the years.  Now they have received a circular from the Department outlining their functions in regard to the striking of a rate.  During the years we in local councils felt we had some power in the matter of providing services for our community but because of this circular we might as well stay at home.  It ordains that in striking a rate we must not exceed the previous year's rate by more than 11 per cent.  I was intrigued when Deputy Keegan spoke about the fact that farmers are now making the greatest single contribution to the rates and that they therefore are entitled to expect more and better local services. How can local representatives make provision for such services when their hands are tied?  In this matter, dedicated representatives, county managers and county engineers cannot make any new provision for extra services because of the impact of this circular.</P>
    <P>Local Government has been the part of administration most acceptable to the average citizen.  Indeed it is right to say that it has been a school of citizenship.  Most Deputies and Senators served their time in the best training schools, urban district councils, county councils and corporations.  Now their powers are being clipped by more centralisation and this circular represents further erosion of the powers local representatives had.  Local government fulfils a higher function than that of providing roads, sewerage and water.</P>
    <P>One of the great virtues of local government has been the variation from area to area.  Different local authorities had different problems and different methods of dealing with them, but today there is no longer the council exchequer, the kitty as we call it locally, with which to deal with the many problems such as road and land deterioration because of storms or heavy rains.  We will not be able to <Col N="1160" /> deal with such emergencies in future to the satisfaction of dedicated local representatives.  I had been looking forward to the day when the Department of the Environment would institute a special fund to deal with roads in rural Ireland.  With the exception of city Deputies, everyone in the House is familiar with the long lonely roads leading to farmhouses, and people living in such isolated areas have begun to expect the minimum services being enjoyed by urban dwellers.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will, if at all possible&mdash;I am sure he will&mdash; arrange for a special fund for the adoption of roads by county councils so that farmers and others in isolated areas will obtain some of the many concessions enjoyed by urban dwellers. If a county council must work within a straitjacket local government as we know it will become a farce.  It may be said that those who pay the piper call the tune but I do not think it is right that the people who pay the piper 66 per cent should call the tune 100 per cent.  At least local authorities should have much more say than they have.  This applies to roads.  We get a block grant but we are told what to do with that money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I am wrong but when we get the grants the services are marked out for us.  If that is not telling you what to do, I do not know what it is.  I have no intention of quarrelling with the Minister's opinion but Limerick County Council&mdash;and I trust there is a unified policy throughout the country&mdash;have not the right to do what they like with the money.  If I am wrong, the Minister will have an opportunity of correcting me.  There was always the weakness of centralisation in the Department but now more than ever we must be on the lookout because if power moves from Dublin to Brussels it becomes more important that a greater amount of power should be brought to the local scene.  It is right that our power should be protected because if we lose local power, local government as we know <Col N="1161" /> it will be gone.  Of that I am certain, but I hope it does not happen.</P>
      <P>One wonders what is the real significance of the new title of the Department other than a slavish imitation of what happened across the Irish Sea where there is nothing in common with us.  The British system of local government has not worked.  It was made impossible for it to work because of the larger authority.  That is happening to us and I fear it may continue.  Let us hope that we shall not follow the example of countries that have nothing in common with us.</P>
      <P>Apart from the financial control arising as a result of the abolition of rates, housing grants have become a problem.  There was much said about these grants here today and I shall not deal with the £1,000 grant to any great extent because I think the Minister is overloaded with queries and I am sure that when he is replying I shall be in the same position as any other Deputy regarding information on that point.  But I want to mention centralisation. The vast majority of rural public representatives&mdash;I am not talking politics but I speak as a public representative&mdash;feared what might happen in this respect.  From time to time we raised the matter with both Governments but I think the position has worsened.  In my county up to a fortnight ago it was not possible to get a new house form in the council office. In fairness, somebody told me that in the past fortnight 40 or 50 of those forms went to Limerick.  We used to pay reconstruction grants under the old scheme and I cannot see why, even with the £1,000 grant, 50 per cent of it could not be paid by the Department and the other 50 per cent by the county council.  Why not decentralise?  Why are more jobs being made available in the city here than in rural Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When somebody is about to build a house the first place he will make inquiries will be in the local county council or corporation office.  Recently, we could not get a form.  The public representative who is asked to make inquiries or query the delay in regard to the £1,000 grant is told that he <Col N="1162" /> must contact the Department.  There is great waste of time involved and the local representative is completely out of the picture.  These people have very little contact with the Department unless they are Deputies.  I cannot see why 50 per cent of that grant could not be paid through the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The same applies to reconstruction which is something at least with which people in the local authority should in some way be associated as regards grants.  Perhaps there are good arguments in favour of paying directly through the Department but I shall anxiously await the Minister's reply because to me it does not make sense. In the case of group schemes the same thing applies.  In passing, I am delighted that the grant for these schemes is increased because those associated with group schemes deserve the greatest credit, because they are prepared to put that money into schemes which would have to be financed in the ordinary course by local authorities. These people have given wonderful service and I am delighted that the Department have acknowledged that fact and increased the grant.  It was badly needed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the involvement of local authorities in some small way in dealing with reconstruction grants and new house grants.  After all, one has to go for planning permission to one's own local authority.  It is difficult to explain to people that they must now send their forms to Dublin.  It is felt by the managers and staff of local authorities, as well as by most local councillors, that their offices are being downgraded and that as time goes on fewer people will be employed.  In spite of the fact that the amount of work involved would be light and would require the employment of a small number of extra personnel, these should be employed in urban areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The present system is a matter of annoyance for the Dáil Deputy because much of his time is wasted in seeking grants when other work could be done.  In spite of the dedication of the public official, he has not the <Col N="1163" /> same commitment to the ordinary people. He seldom meets the people in the country, whereas the local official would be in closer touch with them.</P>
    <P>The amount of this Estimate is colossal.  Much has been said about housing in the past.  Looking back over the figures I wonder why we did not avail of cheaper money in the past. Could many of the people who waited for houses until the seventies have been housed in the mid-sixties?  Deputy Keegan, who is not now present, referred to the progress in housing.  I was prompted to go back over the figures and I found that during the 16 years of the Fianna Fáil Administration prior to 1973 the average number of new houses per year was roughly 10,400.  At that time money could have been borrowed at a much cheaper rate. All countries in Europe were doing well and we were told that it was a boom period.  If that was a boom period, how would one describe the 1973-77 period when 25,000 houses were built per year?  I am not using these figures for political purposes, but this is the reason why so much money is provided in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that housing progress will continue and that there will not be a deterioration in the position. It was often said to me when I referred to the amount of money spent on housing between 1973 and 1977 that we did not take into consideration the value of the money and the rate of inflation.  Inflation cannot change the fact that during that period 25,000 houses per year were built.  Comparing that with the average of 10,400 houses during the previous 16 years, I feel that those on the other side of the House are responsible for this huge Estimate. This is conscience money for the people who were denied houses in the mid-sixties. When the Government changed we saw what happened.  This change roused the present Administration from their slumber and made them realise what was happening.  During that period comparable figures in other areas, including London, fell by 33 per cent.  That is an indication of the service rendered here at that time.  It <Col N="1164" /> is right to make comparisons and I intend to continue on this line.</P>

There are no proposals at present to make regulations in regard to the adequate guarding of such shafts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1 January restrictions in intra-Community agricultural trade apply only to a few products not yet subject to a common organisation of the market.  Of these, the main products of interest to us are potatoes and sheepmeat.  The European Commission has already initiated the procedure leading to legal action against the member states operating these restrictions.  As regard sheepmeat, however, Irish exports now have unrestricted access to all Community markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have only partial access when we were entitled to full access and, in my view, to compensation because the French kept our sheep out of their market.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is found necessary to apply more phosphate I am sure the farmers will do that regardless of whether the subsidy is withdrawn. This subsidy was introduced in 1958 when farm income amounted to £99 million.  The estimate for 1977 is £720 million, so farm income has increased substantially since this subsidy was introduced in 1958.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the points made by the Deputy but I do not think the withdrawal of this subsidy will deter farmers from using phosphate if it is found necessary to do so.  We must take into consideration the need for extra moneys in other sections, such as animal disease eradication, which is more important at present.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 12 to 17, inclusive, together.  There is no formal agreement with the French authorities.  Following consultation with producers and carcase lamb exporters only high quality carcase lamb of good conformation and within a specified weight range is being exported to France.  Having considered the development of this trade during January and February and after further consulting with representatives of producers, exporters and CBF I had stricter quality standards formulated which are being enforced uniformly by my Department's veterinary staff permanently based at exporting factories.  The special stamp applied to carcases suitable for the French trade is not being applied to hogget ewe carcases as it is generally agreed that hogget ewes should be retained for breeding purposes. It is my aim and that of producers' and exporters' organisations that the lamb trade with France should develop on the basis of a top-quality product and I intend to ensure that the achievement of this aim is not prejudiced by the export of substandard carcases by any exporter.</P>
      <P>My Department's technical advisers are conducting meetings with county committees of agriculture advisory services to establish patterns of breeding and feeding designed to produce lambs suitable for the French market.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated publicly, the purpose of my decision is to encourage, as far as is possible, the retention of heifers for breeding and thereby to promote the expansion of the national herd.  The December 1977 livestock count showed a 7 per cent fall in the number of in-calf heifers compared with December 1976, and if this trend is not reversed a serious obstacle could arise in the development of our beef industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>From my own knowledge of the livestock industry I could not but agree with the Deputy.  The main idea behind this is to encourage an increase in the national herd.  For that reason the Minister found it necessary to withdraw heifers of this kind from intervention.  Should any difficulties arise in the market at some future date, the question of reintroducing intervention for heifers can be reconsidered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the number and total acreage of farms acquired under the farm retirement scheme; how these are allocated; and the number and total acreage allocated to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of farms released to date by retiring farmers under the farmers' retirement scheme is 403 comprising an area of 17,351 acres.</P>
      <P>Three hundred and fifty six of these properties (15,597 acres) were sold to the Land Commission while the balance were either sold or leased directly by the outgoers to potential development farmers needing extra land.  To date, the Land Commission have allotted 57 of the farms purchased by them totalling 2,163 acres. In the allocation of such lands priority is given by the Land Commission to applicants whose approved development plans under the farm modernisation scheme indicate a need for additional land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the reports of the local agricultural inspectors state that the farms were allotted to applicants who have development land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The local agricultural instructor plays a very important part in the allocation of this land because he has to report who is a development farmer and who is not.  He has to report on the applicants for this land, and priority must be given to development farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an acreage of 2,000 out of 15,000.  It is rather small. Many potential development farmers <Col N="1194" /> are being stifled in their efforts to reach proper development status due to their inability to acquire land under this scheme.  Can the Minister do anything to expedite the allocation of land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is necessary to speed up the allocation of land under this scheme.  It takes considerable time to do the investigation. I hope that the Land Commission will try as far as is humanly possible to allocate the land with the least possible delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of those farms requires considerable investigation, not alone from the Land Commission staff but also from the advisory staff.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he favours a reform of the existing land law so as to permit long-term leasing of land for agricultural and forestry purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing legislation allows landowners to make long-term leases of their lands with the consent of the Land Commission.  I understand that such consent will be readily forthcoming provided the leasing proposals do not conflict with land settlement operations.  However, it is obvious that there is a marked reluctance by landowners here to engage in long-term leasing and this attitude will have to change before leasing assumes any significance as a means of providing better land use and mobility. The Inter-Departmental Committee on Land Structure Reform are considering this problem including the incentives that might be offered to encourage leasing and I await their recommendations with interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the reasons for the reluctance of farmers to enter into long-term leases is that there is some doubt regarding the right to recover land at the end of the lease under some tenants' rights enactments of the last century and that until this doubt is removed the reluctance will continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there are many doubts in this area.  Perhaps the reason referred to by the Deputy relates to one area of doubt.  But the slow progress of the scheme may be due also to historic reasons because Irish farmers have always favoured outright ownership rather than leasing. I would say this is the biggest factor involved.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that there is widespread speculation in agricultural land. I do accept, however, that there is evidence that the land market is at present significantly influenced by wealthy non-farmers interests and indeed by larger farmers to the disadvantage of the smaller progressive farmers needing additional acreage. The Land Commission through their acquisition activities exercise a moderating and controlling influence on this situation but I do not think that this is sufficient.  The Interim Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Land Structure Reform refers to the desirability of regulating the market in land so as to improve the competitive position of the smaller landholder and propose that all land sales be made <Col N="1200" /> subject to the appropriate authority&mdash; a land agency.  When the final report of the committee is available, the whole question of introducing an overall system of control on rural land transactions will be considered fully by the Government.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell the House when the report is expected? Is he not aware from his experience in the farming field of the utter frustration of these small- to medium-sized farmers who find it impossible to compete on the open market against speculators and others such as those mentioned in the reply?  Surely they need some help at departmental level to enable them to compete and to acquire additional land.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to say because there will be individual cases. No matter what scheme is introduced there will always be people who will be excluded from the scheme for one reason or another.  If the county committees of agriculture publish their notices in the local papers and the Department publish them in the national papers there is no reason why those people should not be fully informed and should be aware of the closing date, that it is necessary for them to have their applications submitted and to have their applications very high up before they purchase the machinery.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply on 15 December 1977 about the proposal put forward by the EEC Commission which envisages Community funds being provided for drainage work in the west of Ireland.  The proposal relates to the drainage of certain rivers under the arterial drainage programme as well as to ordinary field drainage work of the kind dealt with by my Department.  It would apply to operations in the western region.  Until the proposed <Col N="1205" /> measure is finally adopted and its precise terms are known the criteria and procedures to be adopted in implementing it cannot be settled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no particular breakdown at present.  There have been suggestions made that one-third of the money allocated be devoted to arterial drainage and two-thirds to field drainage. There is nothing specific about that.  Until we have the scheme in our hands and have the money allocated by Brussels I do not think we should come down too fast on any particular idea.  I would prefer to wait to see what we get and proceed from there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware of the importance of drainage in the west.  Is it likely that a cost-benefit analysis survey will have to be carried out on each of the smaller rivers or catchment areas that could come under this scheme?  If that is to take place it could delay the implementation of it for quite a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will a cost-benefit analysis have to be carried out in the case of rivers which would never come on a priority list for arterial drainage and which could be eligible for drainage under this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. There are plenty of small streams in the west, as the Deputy knows, which could be done and which could provide a very sizeable acreage of land to be reclaimed under the other scheme.  I see no reason why something like that could not be done.  A cost-benefit analysis will have to be done even in the case of some of the rivers mentioned in this scheme from Brussels and it is quite possible that they might not be ready to proceed.  The only one that is actually ready is the one in the <Col N="1206" /> Deputy's constituency, the Corrib-Mask, and that is ready to proceed at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister three questions in relation to this matter?  Firstly, could he give a guarantee that this money will be used to do additional works in the arterial drainage field and not merely be used to prop up the programme of drainage which was to be done anyway whether or not the aid was made available? Secondly, could the Minister state in the case of field drainage for farmers whether or not this aid will be available to all farmers regardless of whether or not they are fulltime and qualify for the farm modernisation scheme?  Thirdly, would he not agree that there is need for a land drainage authority in view of the fact that the Board of Works, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture have their fingers in the pie at the moment and are not sufficiently co-ordinated in this important area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this money will be additional to any money that is available at the moment.  With regard to the question of the land drainage authority I do not know if that is practical at present because the Office of Public Works are responsible for all work carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act.  I believe they are quite capable of doing that type of work.  As far as the land reclamation field drainage is concerned we have the different agencies under the Department of Agriculture and I believe they are the best qualified people to carry out that type of work with the co-operation of An Foras Talúntais.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a source of great disappointment to me that the Minister, in the course of his 58 page brief, did not refer to local government <Col N="1218" /> reorganisation.  That vital topic should not be treated so lightly.  The Minister admitted that this involved a study of earlier proposals for reorganisation. I should like to know if the local authorities will be given an opportunity to discuss this matter and if voluntary organisations, such as the ICA, will be consulted.  It is vital that such organisations are given the opportunity of discussing the reorganisation of local government.</P>
      <P>A lot remains to be done with regard to sanitary services.  I am not so naïve as to think that the Minister has unlimited resources, but there is a great waste of time with regard to the approval of such schemes.  I do not wish to point a finger at any Government because this has been a complaint for many years.  There is too much dragging of feet, presentation of documents and holding of inquiries. The result is that many areas must wait years to get sewerage schemes approved.  I hope the Minister will speed up that matter.  As he comes from a rural area I am sure he is aware of this problem.</P>
      <P>I should like to warn the Minister that the system of local government needs to be properly financed.  It should be more member-orientated.  We want real local government and not local administration.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of comment this morning about the raising of the ceiling for housing loans.  This matter was debated here on many occasions and the arguments put forward for increasing the amount of the loan were valid. It was felt that the amount of the loan was inadequate to meet the cost of erecting a house.  People were faced with the problem of having to raise up to £3,000 to bridge the gap between the cost of the house and the amount of local authority loan.  The position at present is worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who borrow the maximum of £7,000 almost certainly must find £4,500 to purchase a house.  It should be remembered that even rural cottages cost in the region of £10,000. The monthly rate of repayment over a 30 year period on a £7,000 loan is £69.50 or £25,300 over the entire <Col N="1219" /> period.  In addition, that person must repay the £4,500. It is not possible for young people to meet such repayments. In my view the only solution is to introduce a low-rise mortgage scheme, a scheme that is grossly under-estimated. Under that scheme the Department and the local authority make a contribution with the remainder being made up by the purchaser for the first ten years.  During that time the purchaser is given an opportunity to furnish the house.  It is well known that the first ten years of married life can be the most difficult years financially.</P>
    <P>For that reason this proposed scheme should be properly utilised.  At the moment to qualify under this scheme one must give up a local authority house and be 12 months on the waiting list.  This scheme should be extended to include more people.  I know that would be expensive, but it would increase the number of houses being built and it would create an incentive for people with limited incomes to build their own houses, and this would make way for people in lower income brackets on the local authority housing list.  I would ask the Minister to consider this suggestion.</P>
    <P>In relation to the reconstruction loans scheme which is administered by the local authorities there is a ceiling of £2,500.  That ceiling should be raised.  Reconstruction loans are mostly sought after somebody has already purchased a house.  The vast majority of people who purchased houses, purchased them with the aid of local authority loans, or bank or building society loans.  The mortgage company holds the first charge on the house and if a man is seeking a re-construction loan outside of the local authority he has no hope of getting it because the banks and the building societies are not prepared to accept a second charge.  I would ask the Minister to examine the situation to see what can be done.  I am sure the Minister has received complaints from many people who are not happy about that situation.</P>
    <P>The £1,000 grant is definitely an incentive to people with limited incomes to buy their own house, but I often <Col N="1220" /> wonder if people get the full benefit of the grant.  The price of houses has gone up considerably and the value of the £1,000 has decreased.  The price of houses in my area has gone up by £3,000.  That figure can be checked by Department inspectors if they are prepared to investigate the price of houses in Limerick.  The £1,000 is given to people when they go to live in a house.  I argued previously that £500 should be given when the roof was on the house and the other £500 when the house was complete.  However, there may be some argument for the system which has been adopted so I will not labour the point.  I hope the Minister will take into consideration that at present people are not getting the full value for the £1,000 because of the increase in the price of houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister in referring to the itinerant problem pointed out the necessity to encourage itinerants to go into settled communities.  I agree with that suggestion.  In my county, the county council manager and the staff there played a major part in helping to solve the itinerant problem.  Mrs. Ryan, our social worker, has been very active in this area.  We have housed a lot of itinerants in Limerick, Newcastlewest and Abbeyfeale.  Itinerants camping on the side of the road are not alone an obstruction but a health hazard.  Many people who have put their last £ plus what they have borrowed into the erection of houses find that every second week the areas in front of their house have been destroyed with litter of every description left there by itinerants.  The itinerants cannot be forced to clean up this sort of mess and county council workers are forced to face this very obnoxious and difficult job.  It takes a certain amount of dedication and sacrifice to clean up this mess.  We are asking the settled community to make a great sacrifice.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to note that some itinerant children are now going to school in my area and that they have settled into society.  I would ask the Minister to encourage these children to attend the national schools.  I know it is difficult to get such parents to get <Col N="1221" /> their children to attend the schools, but it is still possible.  I hope that the best use will be made of the moneys allocated in this Estimate and I hope that the Department will achieve the objectives for which it was set up.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the Estimate they have put to us which, as several Deputies have said already, is an enormous increase on the previous vote for this Department to a figure of £205 million.  As has also been pointed out the Department have responsibility for funds of the order of £560 million, which is an enormous responsibility for any Department.  I congratulate the Minister for restoring confidence in the building industry.  The Minister has delivered on the election manifesto promises, he has increased income limits for the SDA loans, he has increased the loans, he has given us the £1,000 grant and he has removed the rates.  The Minister has also given us some new house extension and improvement grants which are very important to people in this day and age and he has improved the assistance for the handicapped.</P>
      <P>These are all contained in the Estimate. I mentioned some of them merely to indicate the size of the task before this Department since this Government took office and of the task which has been before this Minister and to which he has given his time very capably. This time last year there was considerable despondency in relation to this sector, particularly in relation to the building industry.  Then positive plans were put&mdash;admittedly the economic environment improved at the same time&mdash;at a time when very few were prepared to put forward such positive and decisive plans and objectives.  This is the way I should like to see many Departments behave in relation to many of our problems&mdash;be prepared to take on the challenge of change and not be afraid to step out and do something which is new and different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is a vital need in our society. As a country traditionally we have aimed at home-ownership, a very reasonable aspiration, but one which can become difficult.  The Minister has <Col N="1222" /> highlighted some of the difficulties he has experienced in this respect.  He has talked about the problems of land, the cost of land, building costs, market prices and their vagaries.  He has spoken about the difficulty of the scarcity of houses.  He has an extremely difficult area with which to deal here. Nevertheless we need continuous planning and review of housing finance. We need first a constant supply of money for the purchase of houses and, secondly, to be concerned about how this money is allocated.</P>
    <P>Looking through the Estimate I note that, in relation to the supply of money, the building societies now are by far the greatest provider of finance for housing.  If one looks at the 1977 figures one finds that building societies provided £120 million of the £170 million paid out.  The associated banks provided £27 million, local authorities £17 million and assurance companies £6 million.  I find that somewhat disturbing in that I should like to see the assurance companies' contribution being of a higher order.  In the past they provided more money for housing.  Certainly I would be concerned about the obligation on various organisations within our society to make some provision for this social need.  This year the building societies will provide £150 million which will be, again, by far the biggest slice of the cake, with the associated banks rising by a relatively small amount, a figure which is really only of the same order as that of 1977, that is, £30 million, and local authorities, £39 million.</P>
    <P>A good supply of houses will help to stabilise their prices.  I do not think anybody can deny that, but that can come only from an increased and reasonable supply of money.  I am concerned about the size of the assurance companies' contribution in this respect.  If we look at the other financial institutions we may say to ourselves: what contribution do they make to this social need?  There are the non-associated banks, the high-profit merchant banks, the high-profit subsidiaries of the associated banks, even the credit unions&mdash;where do all these financial institutions come into <Col N="1223" /> the total mix?  One could go further and say that one would like to see finance coming from a much wider range of organisations.  I shall refer to that later.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which has been referred to here by Deputy Tully, in particular, and some others.  This I would describe as the gap between wages and home-ownership.  As we know the building societies lend up to two-and-a-half-times one's salary. They provide 70 per cent of the loans.  The banks and assurance companies have similar terms for their lending.  That leaves SDA loans with only the equivalent of 10 per cent of the total at this stage.  I would be very much concerned that there would not be sufficient money available to the lower income groups.  Deputy Tully made the point: can these people afford to pay the interest charges and mortgages in any event?  It is our duty to ensure that there will be a sufficient supply of money for moderately-priced houses for people in this category.</P>
    <P>Of course stability of wages is essential to economic development and job creation.  Combined with increasing house prices, it can only diminish the prospect of home-ownership for young married couples and the lower income group generally.  Here we must be particularly concerned.  While saying that I recognise that the Minister has taken very dramatic steps to offset, in a major part, this gap by facilitating home-ownership.  These steps include the £1,000 grant, which is of particular benefit to people in this situation, the removal of rates, which is an aid to them in starting out the reduction of SDA interest rates from 12½ per cent to 11½ per cent, the increased SDA loans to £7,000 and the increased availability of loans to local authorities from £17 million in 1977 to £39 million in 1978.  I am not saying that the Minister is not doing his part currently; he is, and is doing it very well.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is concerned about the situation further along the road.  He has said also that, in relation to the £7,000 loan limit, he will revise this if it becomes necessary.  Of course, this would place <Col N="1224" /> an increased burden on State financing. Here we revert to our original equations in which building societies are providing the major share and some other bodies are not providing anything.</P>
    <P>I tend to look at the country as a place in which we all live and hope to work happily together, to share things to whatever extent is reasonable. Consequently I should like to see more participation in these areas by these various financial bodies.  Perhaps the Minister would consider setting up a Home Loans Fund which could be financed by the banks, assurance companies, credit unions and commercial organisations&mdash;here one comes to mind particularly, Cement Roadstone, a very large, efficient and successful one.  This organisation is dependent on increased building and house-purchasing.  If we look at the various bodies throughout the country and ask ourselves what is their social contribution, I should like to see coming from them some voluntary social contribution, especially in the areas which will be of most benefit to them ultimately.  It is said in the Cement Roadstone Annual Report of 1977 that Cement Roadstone Holdings is Ireland's leading supplier of raw materials to the building and construction industry and has its head office in Dublin.  Its total assets are £171.4 million.  It is said also that since 1971 sales have increased from £33.1 million to £134.4 million and profits from £4.1 million to £14.8 million. The report goes on to talk about dividends per share and that sort of thing.  One can see the growth of the company in line with the growth in the economy.  The report mentions specifically that a wide range of materials is produced for the construction and furbishing of houses, factories, hospitals, schools, offices, roads, agricultural buildings, harbours and for other civil engineering projects.</P>
    <P>I do not think we need to labour the point.  This is an example of a commercial organisation with a very substantial interest in housebuilding and property development generally, and I would appeal to similar organisations to make a contribution to such a home loans fund.  There are <Col N="1225" /> other commercial companies who could contribute even a percentage of their essential reserves, and the building societies could contribute, say, 5 per cent to be used in this way, with the State matching it, £1 for £1, or on some other ratio.</P>
    <P>I regard this concept as a good one. Certain people might wish to contribute to it as a long term investment. We are all vitally concerned with the economic growth of the country and the position of young married couples and their ability to cope with economic situations.  The use of such a fund would be to provide long term, say 30 years, loans at fixed low interest rates for first time purchasers of the standard traditional type home which is the normal family objective.  I accept that if people are to progress from that sort of arrangement for their housing finances it should be to building societies, but the first objective should be to take people off the road, as it were, and put them into houses.</P>
    <P>The present value of the standard home is open to discussion because of the changing nature of house prices. The Minister is working hard to overcome this, in which there is an important element of scarcity.  The present value of such a home would be between £12,000 and £18,000. When I made the notes from which I am speaking a couple of weeks ago I was thinking in terms of £15,000, but in the meantime I have looked at it and it seems the standard objective should be a little more.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should adopt this as a reasonable aspiration or objective. On the continent there are different circumstances, but we have always valued the home, the family and home ownership on a different basis and it would be a pity if we should drift from the reasonable aspirations we have had. It is a matter of bridging the gap between incomes and home ownership, a function which the SDA did in the past.  The people who would benefit first would be newly married couples and others on low income.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House&mdash; there are many matters I should like to deal with on this very interesting Estimate&mdash;but it would be remiss of <Col N="1226" /> me not to refer to mortgage interest rates and to congratulate the Minister on fixing the interest rates for guaranteed loans in relation to approximately 1,000 houses at 9 per cent and restoring them to the original rate.  This has been welcomed by the people concerned, and the Minister's sympathy with the problem which was created for many of those people is appreciated. The Minister has noted that there has been a welcome fall in mortgage interest rates, from 13.95 per cent to the present 9.5 per cent.  The very high rate of 13.95 per cent placed an excessive burden on home owners, families in particular.  I know of cases where it actually took bread from their tables.</P>
    <P>We must have a more rational and sane approach to interest rates, and I would ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of having building societies' interest rates fixed, even for limited periods, and reviewed at, say, the end of two or three years.  That would give some element of stability to owners who had purchased through such societies.  It affects the vast majority of our people, and I would be concerned about it in the future because of the kind of mortgages and the variations which can arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister and the Cabinet have been doing tremendous work in relation to inflation and that in the indefinite future such a problem might not arise, but we should be prepared for the future.  Therefore, a rational approach to housing is vital to our people.  The Minister might consider setting up an interest stabilisation fund.  I am not a financial expert in this area&mdash;I am more a practitioner at the family end&mdash;but I am concerned at the general operation of the building societies and the methods of allocating finance for housing by the societies, the insurance companies and the banks. Therefore, it would be valuable if the supply and allocation of housing finance could be examined periodically by the Minister with the assistance of an expert review body.</P>
    <P>In regard to the tenant purchase scheme, the Minister has increased the grants to local authority tenants from £900 to £1,300 and the interest charges have been reduced to 11½ per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> He has also maintatined the maximum discount.  That is very worth while, a positive contribution to tenant purchase. The scheme has been successful, though at times controversial, and has been well worth while in our society.  House prices have tended to increase because of inflation, and a great deal of it occurred immediately before the Minister assumed office.  He took immediate steps to deal with it, and the 1977 scheme is a considerable improvement on the 1976 one under the previous Government.  I ask him to keep the scheme under review to ensure that low income families will be enabled to purchase their homes.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  It is the provision of dwellings for elderly people, and I will not let this opportunity pass without congratulating the Minister and the community and environment department of Dublin Corporation for the excellent work they have been doing in this respect.  In the past five to seven years the work has been of a somewhat experimental nature, and a very successful experiment it has turned out to be.</P>
    <P>I think it is demonstrably so in a variety of areas.  The schemes that have been established by the local authority in areas like Raheny, Baldoyle, Donaghmede, Kilbarrack and Killester are functioning very successfully and, as the Minister knows, there is tremendous demand for these flats.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned about the position of wardens in this respect. I should like the Minister to keep that matter under review because it is an area that has developed rapidly very recently and could do with re-examination at this stage.  I am particularly glad to see the extent to which the local community have become involved in the centres or flats for elderly people.  They are doing wonderful work and deserve every credit from the Minister and the House.</P>
    <P>The possibility of reversionary interests in relation to elderly people's homes received a lot of publicity recently&mdash;the idea that the corporation or local authority might consider a scheme whereby they would buy back <Col N="1228" /> homes from elderly people and maintain them over a period.  I shall not go into the matter, but there is an aspect in relation to the practical findings on the ground as I have seen them.  It is the tremendous need for sheltered and cared flats for the elderly. There is a tremendous response where they are provided.  The Minister will probably find far more people seeking entry to these flats than there are flats available.  The idea offers independence and security.  As I have experienced them in Dublin they are separate, self-contained flats with a warning bell to a central warden.  They also have central community facilities, such as canteens and recreation rooms.  One can, in advancing years, have the full benefit of independence, which is so much valued by elderly people, and at the same time have on call the facilities one may need.  I have found people quite anxious to sell their private houses to get into some situation like this where they have a degree of care.  It should be worth considering the possibility of introducing a scheme to provide more of these sheltered flats for those who need them and allocate space in communities for them before all the space is gone.  There is not much space left in Dublin now.</P>
    <P>We were particularly fortunate in my area, when the corporation scheme was being developed close to us, in that we went into consultation eight or nine years ago with the corporation about the development of the scheme.  We then realised, because we sat around the table, that there would be no provision for the future for elderly people in the area.  The officials in what is now the community environment department were very keen to have something established in that line.  It was established, and has been extremely successful.  The problem now is that there are far more people there, young people who want to bring their parents to live close to them where they can still have independence.  There are other ways of approaching this problem, such as the granny flats, and the Minister has provided for extensions in this regard of which many people will avail.  In our case this was something <Col N="1229" /> of an experiment which has been successful.  The idea could well merit fairly urgent attention particularly as regards setting aside sites for such flats throughout the city.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to note that the Minister is considering what reforms are necessary in local government structure and that he will examine all the area proposals.  He says that he has under consideration the question of what reforms may be necessary and that it will involve a study of all area proposals for reorganisation.  I know this is a very thorny question.  Let us be honest.  It is a question of power and its devolution; but we must recognise that in recent years we have had a tremendous growth in community organisation, particularly in the last five years.  There is a challenge to us to provide the structures which will provide for the devolving of more responsibility to local communities.  The Government Departments need the co-operation of responsible local communities in doing their work.  I emphasise &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; and I recognise such involvement can only come if the local communities rise to a level of responsibility.  The Department of Justice repeatedly emhasises that if we are to have peace they must have the support of local communities. In the case of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare we can readily see that they are concerned with the care of the aged, handicapped and the sick and the means whereby these people can have a full life in their community.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Department of the Environment, tremendous work has been done, particularly in relation to community and environment.  In Dublin, as I found it and throughout the country generally I am sure, the work being done in tree planting and landscaping is long overdue, but it will do a great deal to improve the environment. The information centres that are being set up are also very valuable and in future people will increasingly use them.</P>
    <P>But we need more devolution and decentralisation of all services.  We need structures which will ensure responsible local control and involvement. Local community organisations must <Col N="1230" /> be recognised in planning decisions for their areas.  We have not been noted for this as a country in the past but it is time to introduce structures which more clearly and definitely recognise the function and role of the local community in planning decisions affecting their areas.  I shall not go into some of the decisions that have been made in recent years.  They have been anything but good for communities in certain instances.  I should like to see that people who are going to live and bring up their families in an area would be given more of a say in what happens in relation to their area.</P>
    <P>It is easy to make decisions at a distance when one lives somewhere else.  It is too easy to take the line of least resistance in that respect.  We should provide for public administration and structures which will cater for people in their own communities. For instance, who is planning for the employment needs of particular areas in Dublin?  I am concerned with the Raheny area as a centre which includes Edenmore, Grange Park, Mount Olive, Swansnest, Millbrook, Saint Donagh's, Kilbarrack, Bayside, Baldoyle. Each of these areas is as big as a small town in the country and consequently an area like Raheny could readily serve as a centre for local government administration which would be very close to the community. We need more effective local structures and the allocation of staff and resources to the local community. It is, of course, a two-way process.  It calls for responsibility from the local community and for an enlightened and adventurous approach to public administration from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>It is time to make advances in the structure of local government and the involvement of communities and I welcome the Minister's commitment to an early review of proposals for reorganisation.  I congratulate the Minister and his Department on improvements to date and I wish the Minister every success.</P>

Ba mhaith liomsa a rá chomh maith go bhfáiltím go háirithe roimh athrú teideal na Roinne sin ó Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil go dtí an Roinn Comhshaoil. Aontaíonn sé sin le polasaí gach Rialtas ar fud na hEorpa agus b'fhéidir an chuid is mó de na Rialtais ar fud an domhain.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to know where to start in commenting on this Estimate and particularly on the very elaborate speech by the Minister.  The most significant aspect of the Estimate is its sheer size.  I welcome the change in the title of the Minister's Department which brings this country into line with most of the countries of the western world.  It reflects the growing concern of communities, national governments and international bodies with environmental matters.  It is a recognition of the fact that not by bread alone does man live.  Economic development and social progress must be carefully monitored, guided and influenced while bearing in mind environmental factors and problems.</P>
      <P>During the four years when I had the privilege of being Minister for the Gaeltacht I had the responsibility of presiding over much economic and social development in very remote areas where previously economic development was virtually unknown and there was little, if any, industrial development. We had to be conscious of the unique environmental factors involved in Gaeltacht development.  We had to bear in mind the cultural environment which is a vital and precious part of our national life.  These are matters which impinge on and contribute to the evolution of our distinctive quality of life.  I welcome the fact that this has been recognised in the change in the title of the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us a brief indication of his own thinking and that of the Department and, <i>en passant</i>, the thinking of the Government in relation to the environment.  The Minister's credibility will be determined by the speed with which he takes steps to formulate and implement a national environmental policy.  He must be seen to do this as a matter of urgency.  It <Col N="1232" /> was commendable of the Minister to give so much information to the House. This national environmental policy must take cognisance of the fact that we are as yet underdeveloped and we are faced with the major challenge of creating full employment which will give a wide variety of opportunities to meet the job aspirations of a growing population.  Economic development is fundamental to the generation of jobs and national development and it should proceed in the full realisation of the vital importance of environmental factors and their influence on the quality of life.</P>
    <P>These questions relating to the environment, the quality of life and cultural development are different aspects of the one thing.  We are preoccupied at the moment with the enormous unemployment problem and I referred to this recently when speaking at a youth seminar in Galway.  It is difficult to arouse enthusiasm and interest in non tangible things such as the quality of life, national identity and the factors that go to make up our uniqueness as a nation.  The Minister has an opportunity to ensure not only will necessary acceleration of economic development take place but that it will be harmonised with the environmental requirements of the nation.  The Minister said that he felt this question should be examined in a realistic way in order to harmonise economic development with the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>Most of the talk one hears about this question is very emotional and unbalanced.  Industries and much needed jobs have been lost in the battle between the environmentalists and the job promoters.  I will not comment on the pros and cons of some of the major issues in recent times.  There was a controversy at Ringaskiddy in Cork, the loss of a shearing plant at Clonmel, the problem in the mid-west in the Minister's constituency and in my constituency too about the future of the Beecham plant near Shannon.  I recall in 1974 or 1975 the decision to proceed with the building of the Burlington plant at Raheen Industrial Estate and I am sure the Minister agrees with me that we are very fortunate to have the <Col N="1233" /> Burlington plant in that area.  It is a high technology textile plant.  The factory is beautiful internally and externally. The most rigid and meticulous pains were taken to guard against pollution or any infringement of environmental rules and so on.  But that industry was very nearly lost to the country because a certain group had strong objections to it and only the personal intervention of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Jim Tully, allayed the fears these people had and, when their fears were allayed, they withdrew their objections and the company went ahead.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about achieving a balance between industrial and economic development on the one hand and environmental conservation and development on the other.  There is need for very close co-ordination. The Minister referred to the fact that economic and social development impinges on Departments other than his Department and so there is great need for close co-operation between all the Departments concerned.  Economic development must take place.  It is of paramount importance to the country now and it will be of paramount importance to the country in the future. Side by side with that economic and industrial development we must ensure a national planned strategy and that strategy must be cognisant of and take full account of environmental factors.</P>
    <P>We are a very small country and as yet we are relatively free from the major hazards of highly industrialised societies which have problems of pollution and so on.  One great national asset we have is our beautiful scenery. Tourism is a major industry particularly in those areas which I represented for four years, namely, the Gaeltacht areas.  There is need for a national environmental policy as a matter of urgency.  The cranks and the fanatics may be well-meaning people but we must ensure that the economic development so essential for the creation of jobs takes place within the ambit of a national plan which will prevent uninformed objections or an emotional reaction on the part of those who are possibly genuinely concerned about the environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> One of the big arguments with which I used to be confronted in my time as Minister for the Gaeltacht was that I was industrialising the Gaeltacht by promoting economic development there and I was thereby killing the Gaeltacht. I do not believe the Gaeltacht will be killed by economic development because, if we do not provide jobs to keep the people there, then there will be no Gaeltacht at all and, if there is no Gaeltacht, there will be no language.  What we need is harmonisation. It is vital there should be close co-ordination between the Minister's Department, the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and other Departments.</P>
    <P>My interest in environmental matters was aroused during the period in which I was a member of the Government. That interest was buttressed by the special responsibility I had.  This is not the only aspect in which there is need for co-ordination between Departments. The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy is the main job creating agency.  Take the case of Asahi.  The location and development of a huge plant like this impinges on the local authorities concerned and therefore on the Minister's Department. Facilities, such as water, sewerage, power and access roads, must be provided. At various times we had considerable trouble in getting a meshingin of the necessary action by the relevant local authority to provide the essential prerequisites.</P>
    <P>The Alcan project is going ahead now in a region where unemployment is a very serious problem. I pay tribute to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and Limerick County Council for the great work they did in relation to the examination of the environmental implications of that factory. Dick Haslam, the county manager, and Tom Callanan, the general service manager, did tremendous work. They travelled abroad to study similar plants and they did their job so well most of the fears people had about the environmental implications of the factory were allayed.  Limerick County Council had to plan for the huge infrastructural needs of the plant&mdash;water, sewerage, access roads and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> Co-ordinated development at regional level is vital from a national environmental policy point of view and from the point of view of economic development as well.  This leads me to the functions and possibilities of regional development organisations. The Minister referred to these organisations.  A national environmental or economic development plan must be implemented at regional and local level.  Now there appears to be a change of thinking environmentally by this Government in relation to the whole concept of regional development.  The changes in the functions and powers of SFADCo and the decision not to proceed with the western development board indicate a very fundamental change in regard to regional development. I do not know what the policy of the Government is in regard to regional development.  I respectfully submit that national plans for any aspect of development cannot hope to succeed unless through properly co-ordinated regional and local development strategy.  As I said, there appears to be a fundamental change in thinking and regional development is a non-event so far as this Government are concerned and I believe that now is the time the Minister should look at the RDOs to which he referred.</P>
    <P>The regional development organisations were set up several years ago. They were never given clear terms of reference; they were never given their head, so to speak.  They serve as a co-ordinating agency and have no statutory authority.  I suggest that now is the time to look at the future role of the RDOs.  The time has come when a hard look must be taken at the possibility of giving them statutory authority as regional co-ordinating development agencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister has personal experience of the role and performance of the RDOs governing the mid-western region.  He knows of the tremendous work they have done and can do on a co-ordinating basis.  The final step must now be taken in relation to making them statutory authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> There is a vital need for co-ordination at local level which depends very much on the Minister's Department. The outstanding example of that is a plant like the Alcan plant which entailed the provision of roads, water supplies, sewerage and so on.  There is need for this type of co-ordination.  Another example is the development of Rossaveal harbour where a major £1 million development programme was initiated by the late Henry Kenny, God rest him, who was then in charge of the Board of Works.  This harbour development entailed the provision of water supplies, access roads and so on.  It involved the Board of Works, the Minister's Department, Galway County Council, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and many other Departments and agencies, but there was no agency with statutory authority to co-ordinate the input of these agencies into that overall development programme.  As Minister for the Gaeltacht, I had to act as co-ordinating agent in relation to this and many other developments.</P>
    <P>This is the type of function which the RDOs could fulfil effectively.  They are doing it in an informal way.  They have the pre-requisites for doing the work and should now be established on a statutory basis and become the foundation of a regional development policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to RDOs in relation to their actual financing as follows:</P>
    <P> The regional development organisations continue their work.  A number of useful projects were completed during the year.  An important role for the organisations is that of assisting their relevant local authorities and other bodies in coordinating their development plans and investment programmes to deal with the expansion prospects I have referred to earlier.  Assistance in working out and deciding priorities is one of the purposes for which the organisations were set up some years ago.  My Department will contribute £38,000 towards their running costs in 1978. </P>
    <P>Thirty-eight thousand pounds out of a budget of £201 million.  I do not know the method of financing the RDOs but this is an indication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to be argumentative, but I saw a paragraph on the RDOs and I made the point that there was neither head nor tail to them; that the poor regional development officers themselves have no statutory authority.  In view of whatever responsibility the Minister has in relation to RDOs I would ask him to get together with his Government colleagues, particularly with Deputy O'Donoghue, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, to explore the possibility of putting the RDOs on a proper statutory footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having looked at the global aspect of this, particularly the need for a national environment policy, I should like to comment on some of the other headings.  The Department of the Environment impinges on the life and fortunes of all our people.  They are responsible for housing, the basic need of the family unit, and they are responsible for the administration of local authorities, the provision of roads, sewerage, water supply schemes and a wide variety of the basic requirements of a modern society.  Like many of my colleagues I have not been present for much of the debate but I have been carefully reading the Official Report.  This is a Department in which every Deputy and every public representative is interested.  Of paramount importance in relation to the Minister's Department is the question of housing.  Deputy Willie O'Brien, who is a long-time member of a local authority, and many of my colleagues on both sides of the House have a great deal of experience in this <Col N="1238" /> matter.  I do not intend to go into detail but I am concerned with one or two aspects of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's £1,000 grant, which was included in the manifesto and on which there was a great deal of discussion, has been eroded by the enormous escalation in housing costs. I have seen figures in a report in one of the daily newspapers, which carries a property feature each week, of an increase of 20 per cent in the cost of housing over the last 12 months, and it was forecasted that there will be an increase of 20 per cent in the current year.  This raises serious and fundamental issues in relation to the housing policy.  If this is so, then the £1,000 is cancelled and the advantages of it have certainly been eroded if not entirely wiped out.</P>
    <P>Inflation, we have been reading, is coming under control but the inflationary spiral in relation to the cost of housing is not being stabilised.  The colossal increase in the cost of houses creates serious social problems because it affects the basis of our society and the family unit in particular.  A situation will be reached where fewer and fewer families will be able to afford a house.  This has many serious social implications.  A fortnight ago I happened to be at a bus stop on my way into the Dáil when a lady very kindly pulled up and offered me a lift in her car.  On the way we were chatting about this very issue.  She said to me &ldquo;If there is not something done about the colossal increase in the cost of houses there will be no need for Deputy Charlie Haughey to introduce a Bill dealing with contraceptives&rdquo;.  It may be a jocose way in which to say it but it has significant implications for the development and quality of life.  I do not know what is causing the enormous increase in the cost of housing.  The Minister should do something about it and he should let us know why there is a projected increase of 20 per cent in the cost of houses this year, at a time when other Government Ministers are blowing and bragging about their success in controlling inflation.</P>
    <P>The question of roads is of special interest to me because I have the responsibility <Col N="1239" /> of being made my party's spokesman on transport.  Yesterday we had the Committee Stage of road transport legislation.  The point was made on the Second Stage of that Bill that road development is becoming a matter of great national urgency.  I read a very interesting speech by an officer of the Minister's Department at a seminar or function in Dún Laoghaire recently. He referred to the enormous increase in the number of vehicles on the roads, and the enormous cost and the enormous national problem of improving our national road network and making it adequate.</P>
    <P>Among the organisations mentioned by the Minister are An Foras Forbartha. Perhaps I might have referred to An Foras Forbartha more appropriately in the context of my comments on the question of the environment, but I can do so now on the question of roads.  An Foras Forbartha are a State-sponsored body under the aegis of the Minister's Department.  They have done an enormous amount of research work on road development. I was in the Library recently and I was amazed at the amount of research work they have done.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a very special tribute to An Foras Forbartha.  During my period as Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I had personal experience of the work they are doing.  They carried out the best, the most comprehensive, the most realistic survey of Gaeltacht development in 1968 or 1969.  I found them most approachable.  They are ready and willing at all times to help in the vital problem of Gaeltacht development.</P>
    <P>They carried out a most interesting study in Rath Chairn, a small Gaeltacht pocket in County Meath where we started in 1973 to provide an industry, a community centre and a housing programme.  We were anxious that the environmental factors in that rural area would be protected and An Foras Forbartha were asked to prepare a development strategy.  They responded readily and I was greatly impressed with their dedication and commitment and the efficiency with which they carried out the work.  I am glad the Minister has given a substantial <Col N="1240" /> increase in the subvention to An Foras.  If my memory serves me, it has gone up from £750,000 to £1,250,000.  An Foras Forbartha are one of the lesser known State bodies. They hide their light under a bushel. Much of their work is highly scientific. It is research work and it does not hit the headlines.</P>
    <P>An Foras have carried out very substantial and very extensive research into road development.  I should like to refer to one or two figures to give an indication of the magnitude of the problem of road development.  I want to quote from a very interesting report on road freight transport carried out by the Confederation of Irish Industry and published in 1974.  They referred to the increase in the vehicular traffic of all kinds and the enormous increase in the size and number of vehicles. This is also relevant to the Road Transport Bill to liberalise road haulage.</P>
    <P>An enormous task confronts the Minister and the Government to keep our roads up to standard.  There is an enormous backlog of work to be done. The report puts the roads into various categories, A, B, C, D, E, and so on and says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;D&rdquo; is regarded as a minimum level of service in the &ldquo;Road Needs Study&rdquo;.  It is defined as &ldquo;A condition approaching unstable flow. Fluctuations in traffic volume and temporary restrictions may cause substantial drops in operating speeds.  Drivers have little room to manoeuvre and comfort and convenience are low&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Road Needs Study&rdquo; found that many of the National Primary Routes are inadequate and cannot give level of service &ldquo;D&rdquo;.  The routes include all the Dublin/Belfast route south of Ballymascanlon, the main route from Dublin to the west as far as Enfield, the main southern route between Naas and Kildare, the south-eastern route between Dublin and Rathnew, and the Cork/Limerick route between Cork and Mallow. </P>
    <P>These are the national primary roads. They are inadequate to provide a minimum level called category &ldquo;D&rdquo; in the report.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" />  On these routes the level of service falls from &ldquo;D&rdquo; to &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo;.  The definition of &ldquo;E&rdquo; is an unstable flow condition with traffic volumes at or near absolute capacity and complete stoppages occurring from time to time.  Level of service &ldquo;F&rdquo; gives an unstable flow conditions with queues of vehicles backing up from restrictions and with traffic flows below capacity. </P>
    <P>This sums up very dramatically the enormous problem of road development with which the Minister and his Department are confronted.  In his speech the Minister made enormous play with the additional money allocated this year for the improvement of roads, an extra £10 million I think it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister for attending.  He has a great deal on his plate these days and I have no wish to add unduly to his burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, the dispute between Aer Lingus management and certain staffs of this company has now continued for some five weeks.  During this official strike the company have maintained partial services in two ways, by transferring staff to the functional areas from which staffs have withdrawn their labour, and by leasing in outside carriers for such services.  I put it to the Minister that this action has begun to give rise to some apprehension both within and without the company, and I am raising this question because I feel that the public at large, and indeed the staffs concerned, are entitled to absolute assurance from the Minister that the very highest, most stringent air safety standards are being maintained in the most rigorous manner possible in all of that company's current operations. I assure the Minister and the House that I do not raise a matter of this <Col N="1242" /> nature lightly on any occasion.  I do so in the context of the outstanding record of the company in regard to air safety.  That record we, as Members of this House, are well aware is one of the foremost in the world.</P>
    <P>I raise the issue in three aspects.  It has been strongly represented to me that, for example, the <i>ad hoc</i> cabin staffing and crewing arrangements of the company are somewhat open to question.  It has been seriously suggested to me that the staff transferred into those areas of work could not possibly have been adequately trained in the periods suggested, that necessarily they would not have had sufficient experience in many aspects of the work and that their individual suitability to meet the stringent requirements laid down, not only by the company but also by the responsible Department, might not have been fully certified.  I ask for specific assurance from the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it has been represented to me that in this dispute there has been some relaxation apparently in some of the procedures, particularly in what we call the paper work procedures which have been meticulously and stringently enforced by the company over the years.  That has given ground for comment and concern.  I ask the Minister to note it and if possible to comment on it today and to assure us in that regard also.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, a view has been expressed to me that perhaps greater care and caution and greater check-outs are needed and should be exercised in relation to the leasing of aircraft.  For example, it has been alleged that one of those leased craft was involved in a serious emergency incident in London airport and that it was not fully equipped for that incident.  I ask the Minister to take note of that situation and if possible to have it reviewed. He may wish to make some observations in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I know each other personally quite well, and senior management staff of Aer Lingus and I over the years have had some dealings, particularly with the trade union concerned, and I am well aware of the <Col N="1243" /> situation.  I trust that the Minister, his staff, the company and their staff will accept that I am making these observations in a cautious and responsible manner.  As a public representative and as a regular passenger with Aer Lingus I have the utmost regard for the role of our national airline and it is my wish&mdash;and the wish, I am sure, of every Member of this House&mdash;that not only should Aer Lingus and their staff prosper but that their outstanding record be maintained.  I look forward, as I am sure the Minister does also, to an amicable settlement of the protracted dispute and to an improvement in the climate of industrial relations in that company.</P>
    <P>I would be entirely lacking in my responsibility as a public representative when points are made to me if I should fail to bring those matters to the attention of the Minister and the House and to seek the Minister's observations and assurance on them.  It is, therefore, in that setting that I raise the matter here this evening.  I appreciate that the Minister may not be in a position to reply, or that with the delicacy of an industrial relations situation within the company he may be very constrained in his reply.  Having said as few words as possible on the matter and having taken as little time as possible here, I have nevertheless raised the matter and I ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised directly to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the manner in which Deputy Desmond raised this matter.  I am glad to be able to inform him that there has been no down-grading of the civil aviation safety standards and that my concern in this area is to ensure that the high safety standards in which Aer Lingus take a justifiable pride are maintained. The Irish civil aviation safety standards are embodied in various air navigation and transport Acts and are based on standards and recommendations promulgated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the European Civil Aviation Conference. Our orders made under the Principal Act detail the various technical and <Col N="1244" /> operational requirements.  The purpose of these Orders is to provide criteria of safe operating practice and to contribute to the efficiency of international air transport.</P>
      <P>All Aer Lingus aircraft operate in accordance with our safety requirements. The Deputy mentioned the leased aircraft and I can tell him that the aircraft leased to Aer Lingus operate in accordance with the requirements of both the ICAO and the state of registration.  The aircraft are wetleased&mdash;that means cabin and flight crews are provided by owners&mdash;from companies who, to the knowledge of Aer Lingus, operate to high safety standards.  The leased aircraft are mainly registered in western Europe and the United States.  Aer Lingus have declined to accept lease offers from certain owners, who, to their knowledge, did not meet high air safety standards.  I am not aware of the case made by Deputy Desmond in relation to one aircraft but I can look that up.</P>
      <P>Article 22 of the Air Navigation (Operations) Order, 1964 requires operators of public transport aircraft to provide an operations manual, usually consisting of general safety policy, pilots' technical manual and flight guide, for the use and guidance of flight crew members and operations personnel.  Aer Lingus, as operators of leased aircraft, ensure that they are operated in compliance with this operations manual.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of safety standards is carried out by officers of the aeronautical section of my Department mainly by ensuring that aircraft are maintained and operated in accordance with approved schedules, by licensing and checking personnel where appropriate and by maintaining a general overview of aviation activity.  I can assure the House that in no circumstances will there be any relaxation of the high safety standards on which civil aviation here has always been operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question of cabin crews.  I understand that a number of management grades underwent a course in safety procedures.  This course was conducted by Aer Lingus <Col N="1245" /> training pilots and on completion of the course the people concerned passed an examination prepared by Aer Lingus to standards that are approved by the aeronautical operations section of the Department.  All of these cabin crew replacements have long service with Aer Lingus.  Some of them have operated as flight crew members. Aspects of aviation safety covered in the course included cabin evacuation, fire, loss of cabin pressure, emergency landing and so on.</P>
    <P>The normal cabin crew training for new recruits extends to a five-week period and includes many other items apart from safety precautions.  So far as I am aware there is no relaxation in the standards necessary for the paperwork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I join with the Deputy in expressing the hope that there will be an amicable settlement soon to this dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA Industrial Plan 1977-1980 which has been published by the Industrial Development Authority, estimates that a total of 49,500 jobs will be created between 1977 and 1980 from IDA job approvals; 47,000 of this total relates to manufacturing industry and 2,500 to grant-aided services projects.  The phasing of these jobs will depend in the main on economic circumstances and it is not practical at this stage to make estimates for individual years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimates of future job creation are composed of two elements.  The first is the number of jobs to arise from projects already approved.  This is estimated mainly by reviewing individually <Col N="1211" /> the progress of the various projects. The second element is the number of jobs to arise from projects to be approved during the planning period.  Past performance is the guideline used to project when these jobs will actually be created.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available.  Apart from the fact that the annual measurement of gross changes in manufacturing employment was first undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority in 1973 it is not possible to relate employment creation to job approvals except in the case of newly established firms.</P>
      <P>However, an analysis of the new projects which can be related directly to IDA grant approvals shows that approximately 60 per cent of job approvals are translated into actual jobs in the five years after the year of approval.</P>

The regulation, when adopted, will require undertakings to notify the EEC Commission of proposed mergers and will empower the Commission to investigate and prohibit these if they are considered to be incompatible with the common market.  The regulation would apply, however, only where the turnover of the proposed aggregation in particular commodities would account for 20 per cent of the total turnover of those commodities in the European Economic Community, and as this condition is unlikely to be met by any newspaper grouping it seems improbable that the regulation would have a practical effect in relation to press ownership.</P>
