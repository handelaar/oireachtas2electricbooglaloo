      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is cutting me fine.  For the five minutes that I spoke on the last day I talked about the Employment Action Team and their role and performance to date and I was asking a few questions about them.  One of the questions was: what has become of this action team since last November?  We have not heard much of them since their report.  A pertinent question is: what is the future of this team?  We are all concerned about youth employment.  We must be serious about it and we must not have any type of smoke-screen action to try cover up the serious problem.  The Employment Action Team have not been given the resources to do any kind of job whatever. What area have they been given <Col N="1817" /> except broad terms of reference?  When they try to operate they are told that AnCO look after this or the IDA or some other body look after that.  That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Changes took place in the personnel of the team.  Were the replacements from the various Departments of the same rank as those they replaced?  My view is that they were not, and if not, that is a clear indication that no real role is envisaged for this team.</P>
      <P>What is required here is a national agency for youth employment and not some <i>ad hoc</i> committee.  With the situation and structures as they are there is no agency whatever dealing with youth employment.  This is an area which could and should be looked at with some degree of urgency.  When we talk about youth employment we seem to think of purely the industrial end of it.  But surely in an agricultural country one must examine the rural and agricultural aspects of youth employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there an area here in which we could get young people gainfully employed?  I believe there is but that seems to be overlooked.  If the Employment Action Team are to work they must be given a clear mandate so that they can be independent.  Because they lack this independence they are floundering and are not getting the support they deserve.  How often has the Minister been in touch with this action team?  How many of their meetings has he attended or how many meetings have they held?  These are reasonable questions to ask, especially since that team were set up with such a fanfare of trumpets.  We need a national agency for youth employment which would encompass every aspect of industry, whether it be agriculture or in the manufacturing or service sectors, an agency that would have available adequate staffing and which would have access to all the advice necessary. We must be more serious about tackling the grave problem of youth employment. If the Minister finds that the action team are not operating in the way in which they were intended to operate he should be honest enough to say so and to say that something else is <Col N="1818" /> required in order to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The idea of a national manpower service is good but that service is restricted because of the many firms and organisations who do not avail of it for recruitment purposes.  That is unfortunate. We must endeavour to make the service attractive enough to encourage firms to recruit all their staff through that channel.  Although the term &ldquo;labour exchange&rdquo; is associated with the Department of Social Welfare, it has connotations in so far as the Department of Labour are concerned. The National Manpower Service and the labour exchange are not complementary to each other.  There is overlapping and consequently we should endeavour to rectify that situation.  It would be much better to have the whole area of employment within a body such as the National Manpower Service.  A person going to a labour exchange in the hope of finding work will be likely to lose hope quickly whereas a person seeking employment through the National Manpower Service would at least have some hope.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the employment exchange system concerns people who are out of work for, say, more than two years and who at that stage may have become unemployable and may be lacking self-respect, confidence and so on.  In these circumstances we should consider the possibility of retraining. First we would need to undertake a survey of the situation and try to ascertain at what stage the break-off point is reached.  A good training course prepares a person for work because the programme would not be unlike that of full employment.  However, the main concern should be to retrain people where necessary in order to give them confidence in themselves, to give them the feeling of being wanted in society. In other words, we must create for them a hope situation.</P>
    <P>There is mention in the Minister's speech of the employment of disabled persons.  Not enough is being done in this area.  On a couple of occasions I have suggested that the special employment premium be incorporated in a scheme that would help and encourage employers to engage disabled persons. <Col N="1819" /> It is bad enough to suffer from a disability but it must be soul destroying for a disabled person to be told simply that he is not suitable for employment. If we purport to be a caring society we must do more for these people. More could be done in this regard in Government Departments and in semi-State bodies.  Such example would encourage private employers to become involved in providing employment for the disabled.</P>
    <P>There is reference, too, to the Irish Management Institute and to the input into that body by the Department.  It is important that that input be maintained because we must have effective and efficient management.  In particular we must have good personnel management.  We have a long way to go in improving personnel development. Many of the ills in industrial relations may stem from that area. Therefore, in talking about the IMI we should put greater emphasis on personnel training and development.  In many industries the personnel officer is described by the workers as an antipersonnel officer, one who is regarded as the buffer between management and workers, as the person who must say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the workers.  The role of the personnel manager should be that of bringing both sides together.  He must not be seen as the tool of management but as the person who makes for good industrial relations and who has the confidence of both sides.  When there is that confidence we can hope for good industrial relations.  For too long we did not develop our industrial relations along that line.</P>
    <P>AnCO are doing a good job, given the resources they have.  Their training programmes are excellent and they have become involved in community projects.  This is an excellent outlet for young people.  The difference of opinion regarding apprenticeships between AnCO and the Construction Industry Federation does not augur well. It is important that we should have a steady input of apprentices.  There is talk about putting apprentices into the local authorities, but I do not think this is the best way to train them.  I would rather see apprentices working <Col N="1820" /> on building sites.  The situation is ideal if the local authorities are using direct labour.  In my local authority area a number of craftsmen are employed but their work is generally of a maintenance nature and I do not think apprentices would get the right type of training.  This whole question needs to be examined and we should ask the federation for their views.  I would rather send a lad into a good construction firm than into the local authority area because I believe he would be better trained and would be a more rounded person.  If it is decided that apprentices are to go into the local authorities it is important that they should be properly trained and equipped to match the apprentices trained by the building industry.  If that can be done I will be happy, but I have fears on that score.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about worker participation and he said recently that workers have a right to such participation.  It is easy to say that but if a worker demanded his right he would be told exactly where he stood regarding participation.  We can be a little glib in discussing worker participation. We should not think that by putting three or four workers on a board we will solve all the problems. That might even alienate the workers. We could create an élitist type of worker who would become remote from the shop floor.  Workers on the board might not be able to play an effective role through lack of numbers and they could become disillusioned. We must look at the global aspect of this question and begin structuring from the bottom.  This would solve many of our industrial relations problems. One cannot legislate for good industrial relations; they must be created by goodwill.  Workers must participate from the shop floor level up to board level.  There must be an interrelationship without any void in the middle.  It is such a void which causes problems.</P>
    <P>We talk about the evil of unofficial strikes and what we can do about them.  It is said that a fellow would not move his tool box or something like that and that this was the cause of a strike.  If we took the trouble to <Col N="1821" /> examine the reasons we would find that this was only the fuse which ignited the situation and that the problem had been going on for some time and manifested itself through some simple incident.  The problem had been allowed to develop because of lack of communication.  Where there is such a lack of communication there is a tendency for unofficial strikes to take place.  It is not good enough to criticise the workers because of unofficial strikes when they could be the fault of the management or even of the trade union who have become aloof from their members.</P>
    <P>If we can create the right structures we can prevent most official and unofficial strikes.  If there is a malaise we must find a solution.  We may have inherited structures which are not suitable for our type of development.  If they are not suitable let us cast them aside.  I believe we should have works councils at shop floor level and this would lay the foundation for successful participation at board level.  It is not enough just to give several places on the board to the workers.  This development must begin at the bottom. Workers and management will respond because most industries are owned by companies and from the managing director down to the man on the shop floor they are all employees working to the same end. There should not be any dichotomy of views here but unfortunately there is, because in my view management have failed to communicate with the workers and they do not have a good industrial relations structure.  The IMI should help in the area of industrial relations.  This will take time but we must do it well because this is a very worth-while exercise.</P>
    <P>For too long workers have been used as units to be manipulated.  They must be given responsibility.  I have never met anybody who did not respond favourably when given responsibility.  We must give workers a pride in their work.  They must be consulted by management.  They should be involved in decision-making. If a firm is in difficulties the workers should not be told at the last <Col N="1822" /> minute that the firm is going to close. If they are involved in decision-making they will know well in advance and will do their utmost to help the firm to survive.</P>
    <P>If we are to survive as an industrial nation we will have to restructure our industrial relations.  This will not be done by legislation.  This has to be thought out and encouraged.  Incentives will have to be given and there must be the right type of approach to and from industry and to and from the trade union movement.  If we get that we can look forward to a happy industrial relations situation.  Listening to me one might get the impression that we are a nation bedevilled by bad industrial relations but we are not.</P>
    <P>For too long the worker has been ignored as the person who can play a major role in industry.  He has not been treated as a thinking human being who wants to respond and help. If we are to develop industrial relations we must get away from the idea of only putting people on boards.  I welcome such a move but we should not leave it at that because that is too easy a solution and would not solve any problem.</P>
    <P>Workers could be given the opportunity of becoming shareholders in a company.  This would encourage them to increase productivity because their money is involved.  When men go into industry they are giving their lives to it.  In my opinion if men give their lives to something they are entitled to a good and reasonable return.  Only by writing a new chapter in industrial relations can we see ourselves as a competitive nation.</P>
    <P>The nations who are surviving in this highly competitive world are those who have seen this problem, such as the Germans.  They have developed the right industrial relations and the facts and figures are there to prove it.  Their rate of productivity is much higher than that of other western European countries.  As a result they are more competitive and can employ greater numbers of people.  No matter how we encourage industries to come here unless we can create the right climate at shop floor level we will be always struggling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> Management and the unions have a great responsibility in this area.  Management will have to be courageous and ensure that the worker is an integral part of the business.  We hear a lot of talk about the shareholder, and rightly so, because if he invests his money he is entitled to consideration, but we hear very little about the man who invests his life's sweat in industry. That is possibly where our problems arise.</P>
    <P>Lately we have seen industrial disputes which manifested themselves because of a breakdown in communication. The Ferenka strike could be seen as a breakdown between the workers and the unions.  There we had disenchantment with one union and a number of employees wanted to align themselves with other unions.  If there had been greater liaison between the unions this would not have happened. Perhaps this is one of the problems with national wage agreements.  Previously every union had to be on their toes and negotiate for their own employees. Now it is done on a national basis.  As a result, it might make the trade unions more remote from their members.  That area should be examined as well.  Both the unions and the management have much in common in creating and building up industry; and they have an important role to play in the development of industrial relations and in creating more employment.</P>
    <P>There is a great challenge to expand. We have the European market at our door which we can exploit if we are competitive.  We can only attract industry by competitiveness.  With the advent of industrial structures in industry, profit sharing, and the right of workers to invest in a company, industrial relations will improve.  Workers can share in the profits of an industry for instance by way of a bonus at the end of the year or they could get shares in the company.  This is not a new idea, but here it does not operate except in a very small way.  Any company that operates in this way is not bedevilled by minor or major disputes.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about providing and maintaining employment we must <Col N="1824" /> consider the whole area of industrial relations very seriously.  The problems will not be solved by apportioning the blame to the unions or by castigating people who go on unofficial strikes.  We must eliminate the causes.  We must pay more attention to the human factor. Employers must respond to the needs and the feelings of the workers. People will respond, will accept responsibility and will co-operate provided employers work with them and not against them.  With the right approach we can have industrial peace and greater productivity.</P>
    <P>If we want higher standards of living we must earn them.  We can earn them by promoting good relationships in industry.  The workers should know how a business is operated, the profits coming in and the amount of money that must be reinvested to create further employment and must know where they stand at the end of the year with regard to shares or profits.  They must also know if it was a bad year because of international conditions. With that sort of knowledge workers will not harbour any grievances against a company.  Workers should have structures within the company to enable them to make known their points of view and the management should also make known their point of view and there should be complete openness.  We have been remiss in the past and have missed a lot of opportunities in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of industrial disputes were badly handled.  During the Post Office strike everybody seemed to stand back and say that they could not negotiate, that they could not climb down and so on, while outside a number of industries were going to the wall because of the lack of communications.  People told me that their businesses were on the verge of collapse because they were losing orders to other people. Our image abroad was not enhanced because of the lack of communications between companies.  Let us not in the future adopt the ostrich mentality of putting our heads in the sand and hoping that the problem will go away. It will not go away; it will have to be solved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> The Labour Court and the other machinery we have to deal with industrial relations are doing an excellent job, and I hope they will continue to do it.  But Ministers of the day should not be afraid, without commitment, to examine serious problems which can have adverse effects on a large number of people.  In the Ferenka situation no action was taken until it was too late. Admittedly it was a delicate area, but when the factory was closed everybody ran around trying to do something.  We should have trouble shooters in the Department who are not shy about getting in and finding out.  When an industry has been closed down it is too late to be talking about whether we did the right thing, whether we should have involved ourselves in the dispute. It has been said that ministerial involvement might weaken industrial relations in other areas.  I do not accept that.  We must look at disputes as they occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not be shy about involving ourselves in any dispute whose continuance might have serious repercussions on industries not directly involved.  In the Post Office dispute the Government acted in a Pontius Pilate fashion, washing their hands while most of the country was held up.  That is what worries me.  At the other end, it is no use patching up a dispute and leaving it without establishing good-will among all involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion is that Ministers and their Departments should get in quickly when disputes arise, whether there are other forms of conciliation available or not.  This is particularly so in the case of the Post Office which caused serious loss of export orders, which in turn could cause serious unemployment because lost orders would not be likely to be repeated.  It is always better to be doing something than standing on our pride and letting <Col N="1826" /> disputes continue, which is what respective Ministers did in different disputes which caused serious trouble.</P>
    <P>If we are to attract employment-giving industries we must be seen to have a properly structured industrial relations scene.  We must be seen to have our workers involved not just in boards but at all levels.  This will not be done by legislation but through the co-operation of all concerned.  If we can achieve this our development as an industrial country will be achieved and we will prosper as a result. It can be done only by thinking out a good policy instead of the piecemeal situation we have now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally with many of the things said by Deputy O'Brien, unlike his colleague last week who caused deep resentment on these benches.  He said there were no working-class people on this side of the House.  I welcome the Minister's speech setting out the Government's goal in this area.  There has been an increase of nearly £15 million in the amount of money available as compared with last year and when one looks at where the money is to go one will see that the Government's priorities have been properly aimed in the last ten months.</P>
      <P>The main task of the Minister for Labour is in relation to employment. The last speaker concentrated on industrial relations but I shall concern myself mainly with the additional funds being made available to employment maintenance schemes and employment incentive schemes.  There has been a huge increase of more than £5 million in this area.  There has been an increase of 30 per cent on the amounts available to AnCO for industrial training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech repeated the commitment to a net 25,000 more jobs this year.  It is a high target but in the last six weeks there has been an increase of 6,000, and the total figure of unemployed is 8,000 less than last year.  About £7 million is being spent on the employment incentive scheme which gives £20 per week and £14 per week in respect of new employees in different categories over a period of six months.  The catering industry, which <Col N="1827" /> was not included heretofore, is now covered as well as the manufacturing and building industries.  It is proving to be a great boost to the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been said by the Opposition that the employment maintenance scheme here is not as good as that in Britain.  It provides £5 per worker for all in the clothing and footwear industries.</P>
    <P>Speaking earlier here, I referred to the employment action team and the various schemes for youth employment, and I do not think I need to go into them in detail today.  To say that we have not been doing anything about youth employment is bordering on the ridiculous.  I have not heard anybody saying all these schemes are totally satisfactory but the test is the employment they will promote.  The apprentice training scheme is an excellent effort because there is no point in having too many untrained or semi-skilled people in the community.  The Ballyfermot work project has succeeded in compiling a lot of useful information which can be of great help throughout the country in general, particularly in the absence of a recent census.  Deputy Mitchell seems to regard it as a sort of joke but I can assure him that the people involved do not so consider it. The environment works scheme has given reasonably paid jobs to 4,000 young people.  In 1977 20,000 people were provided with jobs by the National Manpower Service.  I am not quite sure what the Minister meant when he said he was not satisfied with the set-up there.  I was glad to hear that the 30 placement officers will be recruited this year to get on with the job of finding work for people.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies said that there were very many people on the lists of the National Manpower Service.  In general the organisation does a very good job. It cannot be very satisfactory for the placement officers to find out that a person stays only half an hour in a job and then goes working elsewhere. The vast majority of people on the live register want to work and those who do not want to work should be on <Col N="1828" /> another kind of register.  If the National Manpower Service are to attain their target I think it would be necessary to interview each person. They would need to send out detailed questionnaires.  I know of cases where people got jobs through that organisation but the jobs were totally unsuitable; for instance, an elderly man got a very physical job that he could not do. There may be a tendency on the part of a placement officer to put a person at the end of the list if he finds that the first job he gets for him is quite unsuitable.  It would be advisable to have detailed questionnaires so that misunderstandings will not arise.</P>
    <P>The Government are proposing to allocate a 3 per cent quota for disabled persons for State and semi-State employment and this is welcome.  It may be difficult to carry this out in some areas but there are many jobs that disabled people could fill, especially if they are only slightly physically handicapped.  In the Central Remedial Clinic at Clontarf disabled people get some training in printing, basketmaking and so on.  It might be better if money were given to the clinic to help these people.  There are many handicapped people in the clinic, the resources are limited and they may get only a few hours' training every week.  This does not give them much of a chance to get back on the labour market.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to career information and he spoke of 250 leaflets dealing with 300 occupations.  I remember these leaflets being circulated when I was doing my leaving certificate.  In many cases the leaflets end up in the wastepaper baskets because nobody in the school is interested in doing anything about them.  Even in schools that have career guidance officers, many of the pupils do not know the situation regarding jobs in the public sector.  This may be a matter for the Department of Education but the Department of Labour are spending money here. There should be some communication with career guidance teachers.  Literature regarding career guidance should be circulated and steps should be taken to ensure that the pupils understand it. The entry age for State employment <Col N="1829" /> should be 19 or 20 years.  In 1976 very few people were recruited to the public service and many young people are still unemployed.  Probably some of them would have liked to join the public service but they are debarred because of age and this may be unfair in many cases, especially when the State did not recruit young people in some years.</P>
    <P>A sum of £16 million is being spent on industrial training in AnCO.  This service has expanded massively in the past few years.  There are 13 permanent centres, four temporary centres and more than 20 mobile centres.  The courses that continue for eight weeks have proved successful and many employers have recruited people who have done those courses.  I was speaking recently to some of the teachers involved in this work and they find it most encouraging that at the end of eight weeks the pupils have got jobs. This year AnCO will train 15,000 people and 1,700 apprentices.  The numbers on apprenticeship courses should be increased.  It is essential for the sake of the country that people should have some skill or craft.  If they cannot find jobs it is better that these young people should do &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; rather than cause destruction to property. When the contribution from the social fund is taken into account more than £20 million will be spent on retraining this year and this will be of considerable help.</P>
    <P>Some employers recently criticised the registered apprentices.  I am not fully aware of the grievances but the matter should be capable of being resolved. If there are disagreements between AnCO and certain industries&mdash; the printing industry was mentioned&mdash; they should be sorted out.  In some cases AnCO may have to be rigid with regard to the age of apprentices and it may happen that a young person may not be accepted for training because of his age.  Unfortunately this can lead to bad relations but the matter should be resolved between the parties.</P>
    <P>About 1,800 people will be involved in the youth community training programme. They will work on renovating old people's homes and community centres.  This will be of considerable <Col N="1830" /> benefit, especially in the inner city areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to training for young people, Deputy Fergus O'Brien spoke about managers.  The Minister said last week that he would encourage them to define what training is required in industry.  The 117 AnCO training advisers are catering for almost 11,000 companies and 300,000 people.  The means that approximately 15,000 people were involved in training in 1977.  This is a massive figure, particullarly when we consider that 25 per cent of them are under 25 years of age.  The managers in the firms should be <i>au fait</i> with training regulations and personnel regulations so that we do not end up having frustrated people trained without knowing what is going on in the job.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that £375,000 has been put into the IMI to assist the small and medium-sized industries.  A large sum of money has also been put into CERT for education, recruitment and training for the hotel industry This is very welcome because it will make sure that the organisations which are training people are in a position to educate workers into the different facets of industry so that they have no chips on their shoulders against management.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to see that the Minister will set up an advisory committee. He referred to the major part which manpower will have to play in this.  He said he would be chairman of this advisory committee.  This will give it a very special standing and people will realise that we want to solve the unemployment position.  It is no good anybody standing up here and saying that in two years' time it will be almost the same.  That is only scoring political points.  All Members in the House should be genuinely concerned to have less than 100,000 unemployed in two years' time or as soon as possible and eventually to work for full employment.  The important thing is not to have people walking the street but to have them in some type of jobs regardless of what they are.  All politicians should welcome any project which is set up to provide jobs for some of the people who are unemployed <Col N="1831" /> and prevent them from becoming frustrated and losing the will to work.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hoped that the advisory committee will be able to formulate better information on the employment situation and an understanding of what the needs of the labour market are.  We cannot expect Manpower to have that if the groundwork is not done for them.  I hope the advisory committee will be able to revise the existing schemes in operation for recruiting people and link those with the economic objectives which are there from time to time such as this year's budget or next year's budget.  The fact that the Minister will chair this committee will give it a special standing that something beneficial will be done and that it will not be just a committee meeting with no report coming from it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the worker in employment and the safety of workers in industry, the Industrial Safety Bill is under discussion at the moment and there is no need to say anything about that.  The Minister also referred to the health and welfare of workers.  There is a certain amount of legislation covering those matters with which the Minister has several problems.  We are not too badly off with regard to those matters at the moment because we have the Conditions of Employment Acts, the Holidays Acts, the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Minimum Notice Act, the Terms of Employment Act and the Anti-Discrimination Act.  Those particular Acts cover most of the grievances which workers have.  There should never be need for unjust relations provided we have personnel managers who are willing to interpret those Acts with some degree of flexibility and not always be reading just the words in them.  A worker can read those Acts one way and a personnel manager can read them another way. One has to interpret them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's statement on the possibility of fitting working conditions to the worker rather than to the employer this is a very complex matter.  The employer's first interest, particularly in the private <Col N="1832" /> enterprise sector, is profit.  It is impossible to do everything to suit the worker.  When one talks about a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 30-hour week it is inevitable that that will reduce over the years and that workers will get longer holidays. It will be very difficult to get an employer in private industry to agree to have the regulations more for the worker than the employer.</P>
    <P>We must look at the case of overtime, particularly in industries where overtime is essential.  If a worker has to work overtime on a regular basis and is not getting time off for it that is a danger to his health and it is probably keeping somebody else out of work I see great merit in the flexi-time working so far as the worker is concerned. Workers should be able to work longer hours at particular times of the year.  Between November and February workers in the city do not get much enjoyment going home from work at 5.30 p.m., perhaps taking one-and-a-half hours to get home and then going into unheated flats.  I believe most of those workers would be glad to work longer hours in the winter and have shorter hours in the summer when they could do something with their free time.</P>
    <P>There are many people who say they would not mind starting work early in the morning in the summer, like they do in other countries.  Those travelling to work by car would find it much easier to get into the city at 7.30 in the morning.  The Minister for Finance said last week that flexi-time has been tried in some of the Departments. That should be extended.  In many of those offices, provided workers are there from 10.30 in the morning to 3.30 p.m. or 4.30 p.m. in the afternoon, when the public know they are there, they could work any other hours that are suitable.  They could either start at 7.30 in the morning and finish early in the afternoon or start later in the day and perhaps work until 10 o'clock at night.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of criticism last week about work sharing and some people said that something like that does not work.  This ties in with shorter working hours, holidays and restrictions on overtime.  We should <Col N="1833" /> also consider early retirement in connection with that.  There are many people who would like to retire at an earlier age because of the strains of life.  Many of those people would be glad to retire at 60 years of age if the pension laws were changed to suit them.  There are other people who say that they would like to be able to work until 70 years of age because they cannot afford to retire.  Many people who have their houses paid for and their families reared and are still active would prefer to retire at an earlier age and play golf or engage in some other pastime.  It would help the unemployment situation if people were given the option of retiring at 60 years of age.  I do not think we can force people to retire at 60 years of age.  In America they have now given the people an option of retiring at 70 where formerly it was 60.  It is no good bringing in regulations which have been found to be wrong in other countries. I do not agree to giving extensions because every extension that is given in employment, no matter how good a person is or how much he or she is needed, is doing somebody else out of a job.  It is probably doing that person's health no good when he is working on after 65 or 70 years of age.  Of course we must make sure he is not going out to live on nothing. There will have to be some pension arrangement.  It should be possible to allow people, if they are not in a pensions scheme from the outset, to enter that scheme and be given credit for years of service so that they will have no objection to retiring.</P>
    <P>There are workers in the health boards who have no superannuation scheme and so they go on working until they are almost physically incapable. Now the sooner people are covered by proper superannuation schemes the better it will be.  Take the case of porters in hospitals.  They would be quite willing to join a pension scheme but they are not permitted to join in the scheme operated by the voluntary hospitals.  I believe it would merely be a matter of changing a few words in order to allow them to join the scheme.  It seems ridiculous to have 800 employees in a hospital covered <Col N="1834" /> for superannuation and 200 manual workers debarred from the scheme.  To me that is discrimination.</P>
    <P>With regard to people who draw the dole and pick up jobs here and there while doing so, even if action were taken against them that would not solve the unemployment problem. They do these jobs in order to get some sort of living wage.  They do not make fortunes.  One must always remember, too, the cost of trying to catch them.</P>
    <P>With regard to worker participation, all workers should feel that they matter and they should be given information about what is going on where management is concerned.  Sales figures and productivity figures mean very little to most workers.  They do not understand them.  A simple report would be the ideal, telling the workers exactly what is going on, what contracts are likely to be forthcoming and so on.  The worker would then feel that he was something more than a number on a pay slip.  That could pay a dividend in another way because, if a company were in trouble and the worker understood the position, he probably would be prepared to do what he could to help the industry or he would have an opportunity of, perhaps, finding another job.</P>
    <P>The EEC are spending 8 or 9 per cent of their total budget on youth employment.  There are 6,000,000 unemployed in the EEC and it will take a great deal more than 8 or 9 per cent of the total budget to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to lightning strikes, these are always to be regretted.  Often they are totally unjustified.  Most are caused by people with chips on their shoulders. I have had firsthand experience of these in the last eight or nine years.  Shop stewards just pull the workers out.  Now shop stewards should be representative of the workers.  Unfortunately the shop steward is very often the least representative of the workers.  He has the job because no one else wants it.  There is an apathetic attitude.  Very often when a lightning strike takes place the workers do not know the reason for it until they are outside the door.  That is an irresponsible attitude.</P>
    <P>You have personnel officials paid <Col N="1835" /> good salaries to take up a ridiculous stand against the genuine shop steward.  What we should have is an industrial relations officer.  His role would be quite different.  The personnel officer will dig in his feet, say this cannot be done or that cannot be done.  If a worker is out for a day another worker is asked to make two of himself instead of replacing the man who is out.  That attitude forces responsible shop stewards into being irresponsible.  Definite guidelines should be laid down.  There should be proper training for personnel officials.  Inexperienced people should not be put in the position of negotiating with 300 or 400 workers.  Inexperience is bound to generate lightning strikes.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism about the rights commissioner. If the employer does not want to co-operate with the rights commissioner the worker seems to lose his rights.  I had a few cases of that recently.  There is nothing the worker can do.  There should be some other type of committee before which a worker could have his grievances ironed out.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we must be patient until the policies on employment, and youth employment in particular, are tested out.  Then, if some of the schemes are not reaching the target, I am sure the responsible Ministers will adopt some other course of action. One has to try something out first to find if it works.  The unemployment figures are falling every week.  A great many young people are working. Some have temporary jobs.  The situation definitely is improving and it would be unfair to say it is not.  A year ago there seemed to be no way out. Now there seems to be some hope, though the problem is far from solved.</P>
    <P>Every country in Europe has this problem, but that is no reason why we should accept it.  If everybody is interested in it, as I am sure they are, the problem will be solved. When we find a solution to grievances and arguments about not allowing apprentices into certain jobs, a large part of our unemployment problem will be solved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> I should like to see figures quoted each month giving the number of jobs created and how many people have actually started work rather than what the register states.  Recently in a rural community 40 people were taken on to work and only eight were taken off the unemployment register.  The other 32 were unemployed but they were not on the register.  Many people who are getting jobs are not on the register.  We need to know how many jobs are created month by month.  When people speak in this House, rather than saying what the Minister for Labour has not done, they should speak about what has been done and examine the areas where improvements can be made.  We are not doing any service to young people coming out of school this year by talking about what happened last year.  What happens next year really counts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Estimate for his Department the Minister said his principal aims were twofold, first, to make the greatest contribution possible to improving the employment situation and, secondly, to up-date the procedures and institutions so as to help our industrial relations to operate more satisfactorily.  The Minister has given himself a very narrow brief and, by his own actions, he has downgraded the Department of Labour.  He is totally ignoring the role of the Department in providing minimal legal protection and rights for workers and in the elimination of discrimination against women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To start with I will confine myself to the Minister's narrow brief and comment on his job-creating efforts and his views on industrial relations.  In his comments on Government policy on employment, he said the Government are aiming at the creation of 25,000 additional jobs per year over the period 1978 to 1980.  This is another attempt by a Government Minister to get out from under the commitment made by the Fianna Fáil Party in their election manifesto and made by the Government in their White Paper on national development in relation to employment and unemployment.  In both those documents the Government said their <Col N="1837" /> target was to reduce unemployment by 25,000.  This is an entirely different matter from the creation of 25,000 additional jobs per year referred to in the Minister's speech.  The fact is that if the Government managed to create 25,000 additional jobs per year, you would have to deduct 11,000 to 15,000 extra people who come into the labour force each year in order to get an estimate of the annual reduction in unemployment. Like his Government colleagues, the Minister has been grossly dishonest about this matter and this will be seen in its proper perspective by the electorate in time to come. You cannot fool people easily.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment was to reduce unemployment by 25,000 between the time they took office and the end of 1978.  On the basis of that election commitment, the live register should show an unemployment figure of roughly about 85,000 in December next.  That was the Government's target and we in this party have no intention of letting them forget it.  It is becoming more obvious that the Government's strategy in relation to job creation has failed.  It has failed because they placed their entire reliance on the private sector.  The Minister and the Government are aware that the private sector has failed down through the years to create sufficient employment for our people.  It has refused to create a modern industrial society in Ireland despite all the incentives, grants, and so on.  At the end of this exercise I fear our young people will be told once again that the jobs needed cannot be created.</P>
    <P>A recent survey in <i>Business and Finance</i> showed that approximately 90 per cent of businessmen do not believe the Government's job target can be met.  The recent IMI conference in Killarney showed the interest private enterprise has in job creation.  A spokesman for the FUE is now afraid that the private sector will become the whipping boy for our unemployment problem.  As predicted by the previous Government the Irish economy is booming currently after a period of recession.  Last year we had the highest growth rate in the EEC.  This year we will also have the highest growth rate. <Col N="1838" /> Approximately 9 per cent to 10 per cent growth is expected in total investments and industrial output.  Exports are expected to grow by 12 per cent in volume and over 21 per cent in value, with industrial exports showing the the largest rise, 14 per cent in volume and 23 per cent in value.  Despite that colossal growth and buoyancy in the economy, all the Fianna Fáil Government and the private sector can do is to present us with a few temporary window-dressing jobs and possibly emigration.  Fianna Fáil were always able to export part of the population when they could not create sufficient employment.  Great events cast their shadows, and I wonder was it in anticipation of such an eventuality that the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy advised our young people recently to learn another language before Fianna Fáil once again declared them redundant and surplus to our requirements and sent them to the emigrant ship or, in this day and age, perhaps I should say the emigrant plane.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of this party and the trade union movement, there is an answer to our problems, that is, the development of our semi-State bodies into areas of manufacturing industry where private enterprise has not operated or will not operate with the semi-State companies or on its own.  Food processing, agricultural machinery, fish processing, processing of our mineral resources, and so on, are areas in which we could participate and provide more employment. Like myself, the Minister represents an area where there is quite a good deal of off-shore exploration.  On previous occasions from this side of the House he interested himself in trying to ensure that as many jobs as possible were provided in this area for our own people.</P>
    <P>I accept that the problem with regard to EEC workers was a little difficult to overcome but at present there are many workers from outside the EEC employed in our off-shore oil explorations in areas where they do not need special training.  Many workers in Cork are anxious to be <Col N="1839" /> considered for such jobs but for some unknown reason they have not been taken on.  I appreciate that proper training is necessary for some jobs but if training was available most of the workers in the Cork area would be able to take on responsible positions. The Minister should inquire from AnCO, whose representatives were in Cork more than two years expressing an interest in setting up a training centre for off-shore workers, if it would be possible to bring about a situation where training would be given in the North Sea or other areas for those people.  For instance, I am sure that employers who would have rigs stacked for part of the year would have no objection to them being used for training Irish workers.  There is a lot of agitation about this matter at present and we should try to ensure that jobs that can be carried out by Irish workers are given to them.  If training is necessary it should be provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is making £7 million available for the employment incentive scheme this year.  That seems strange in view of the recent comments by his colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, to the effect that the scheme was grossly inadequate as an answer to our unemployment problem. If that is so it is fair to ask why the Minister for Labour has praised this scheme consistently since taking office. He has told us that it is his hope that the scheme will create between 17,000 and 18,000 jobs and he also extended the scope and duration of the scheme. The comments of the Minister for Labour and those of his colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, are contradictory on this subject.  That indicates a disquieting confusion within the Government in relation to a scheme designed to reduce our appalling unemployment level.  I hope the Minister for Labour will clarify the Government's position on this scheme.</P>
    <P>In the course of his budget speech the Minister for Finance told us that the Government regard youth employment as a critical and priority issue. <Col N="1840" /> The fact that the Minister for Labour admitted that he had only created 300 jobs for young people out of a promised 5,000 jobs shows how cynical the Fianna Fáil promises were.  We have the highest unemployment rate in the EEC.  Our youth unemployment is astronomical compared with other EEC countries.  Almost 50 per cent of our population is under 25 years of age and unemployment in this age group constitutes almost 44 per cent of total unemployment.  Our overall rate of unemployment is 9 per cent but the unemployment rate in the 15 to 19 age group is an astonishing 22 per cent and in the 20 to 24 age group it is 11 per cent.  This year more than 50,000 boys and girls will leave our second level schools but what can the Minister for Labour promise them?</P>
    <P>When the Employment Action Team was established in September 1977 the Minister gave the impression that this team would solve our youth unemployment.  The team submitted their first set of proposals in November 1977.  What has happened to the team since November?  Have the team put forward any further proposals to the Minister?  In the course of his Estimate speech the Minister said he was engaged in a review of the work of the team with the object of developing their role in the Government's overall job creation programme.  The Minister should be honest and scrap that team. He is deliberately wasting the time and energy of some very committed people and organisations.  Some of those will not tolerate this cynical exercise by the Minister and the Government much longer.  It is obvious that the Employment Action Team can only propose schemes to create employment in the public sector or schemes that will involve public expenditure.  It is equally obvious that these schemes will not be accepted by the Government.  The Minister for Finance has issued dire warnings of possible hair-shirt budgets while the Minister for Economic Planning and Development wants public expenditure cut.  In that situation the Minister for Labour will have no alternative but to thank the members of the Employment Action Team for their time and <Col N="1841" /> energy and apologise to them for the cynical use that was made of them and their talents.</P>
    <P>In the course of his budget speech the Minister for Finance said he was providing a special allocation of £5 million to finance schemes for youth employment.  What happened to the £20 million promised in the Fianna Fáil manifesto?  Surely the Government do not expect to fool our young people by promising £20 million towards youth employment and then allocating only £5 million?  The Minister for Finance also told us that the special employment scheme targeted specifically at young people would generate 5,000 jobs but the Minister for Labour in his Estimate speech told us that 4,000 young people would benefit.  In that exercise the Minister brushed off 1,000 jobs from the original figure.  Of course, 1,000 young people will want to know why they were promised a job by the Minister for Finance but denied it by the Minister for Labour.  The fact that the Minister has only managed to create 300 jobs to date may explain the reduction of the figure from 5,000 to 4,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my disappointment at the delay in putting into action the proposals of the Employment Action Team.  Leaving aside the question of whether or not the proposals made by the team would prove beneficial in the long run, their proposals were submitted and accepted by the Minister last November.  Just six months later we find that only 300 young people have been employed as a result of those proposals.  That does not show any indication of concern to tackle this problem on the part of the Minister.  The delay involved in implementing those proposals indicates the difference between Government rhetoric on the matter of unemployment and actual achievement.  The two major schemes proposed by the team were a community fitness programme and a work experience programme. The community fitness programme has been passed over to the Minister for Health.  To date no more has been heard of that.  As regards the work experience scheme submitted to the Minister last November, he tells us in <Col N="1842" /> his Estimate speech that the proposals for its implementation are still being worked out by his Department and that pilot schemes for the first trainees will be under way in July.  This is action indeed when it takes the Minister nearly nine months to get a scheme under way.  With 44 per cent of the unemployed under 25 years of age it is a terrible admission that the Minister has to date created only 300 jobs in the youth employment scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that one of his principal aims was to make the greatest contribution possible to improving the employment situation.  His great contribution has been to increase the funds of the employment incentive scheme, which the Government have just announced has failed as a job creation scheme, and to create 300 of the promised 5,000 jobs in youth employment. The Minister stated that his second aim was to improve our industrial relations system.  This is a wholly worthwhile aspiration, except that the Minister in the same speech seemed to show a lack of understanding of industrial relations.  Firstly, he ignored completely the fact that far too many people ignore procedure.  Too many managers introduce new machinery and work practices, dismiss and suspend workers and declare redundancies without proper consultation, notification and negotiation with their workers and the unions.  Too many managers refuse to enter into serious negotiation with the unions on issues or they delay negotiation for months.  Unfortunately, many workers can feel that the only way to stop instant changes in conditions of employment by management is to declare an immediate strike.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of unofficial strikes, but the Minister should realise that an instant reaction is often forced on workers.  No matter how much we deplore this, it can happen because of some decision made without consultation and negotiation.  I am not saying that this happens in all cases.  I have met representatives of foreign companies who after a period in Ireland are often amazed at the reactionary views of some Irish managers to trade unions and workers generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the old, worn-out <Col N="1843" /> argument that industrial disputes were affecting our competitiveness on the export market and foreign investment in this country.  Irish exports are booming and they will probably increase by over 12 per cent in value in 1978.  A powerful trading performance by our exporters in April produced exports of just under £240 million for the month and narrowed the trade gap to £48 million.  Despite what the Minister said, there is no evidence that industrial disputes are disrupting our exports.  He should be more worried about the fact that, despite the boom in exports and in economic growth, private enterprise are not creating sufficient jobs.</P>
    <P>Regarding foreign investment, the Minister for Labour should have looked at the average rate of return of American industrial investment in Ireland, which has been boasted about on numerous occasions and as recently as yesterday by the Taoiseach, and rightly so.  The average rate of return is 24 per cent.  This compares with 6 per cent in the UK, 8 per cent in Belgium and France, 10 per cent in Italy and 12 per cent in Denmark. This is the situation, and we will not make progress by taking things out of context or making incorrect statements.</P>
    <P>The Minister also raised the problem of inter-union disputes and unions outside ICTU.  Inter-union disputes have not been a great worry.  I can recall only two which caused major problems.  There are only six unions of any significance outside congress and only one of those has been involved in an inter-union dispute in recent years.  Is the Minister saying that as a result of two incidents, and possibly Ferenka&mdash;although there were many more elements involved there than inter-union differences&mdash;and the dispute which was resolved at Asahi, we have a major problem as regards inter-union disputes and unions outside congress?  This sort of scaremongering could have a worse effect on foreign investment than any dispute. We should avoid inter-union disputes and all unions should be affiliated to congress.  Then we would <Col N="1844" /> have a stronger and more united trade union movement.  However, to suggest, without producing any evidence, that the present position is seriously affecting our economic and employment prospects is wrong and may be dangerous if it cannot be backed up by facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister also raised the problem of far too many unions of relatively small membership.  I agree that there are too many unions, and it would greatly strengthen the trade union movement to reduce the number, but it is foolish to describe it as a problem for our economy.  It is a problem certainly for the trade union movement in terms of strength and resources. Let us put this issue into perspective.  Of trade unions members in Ireland 93 per cent are in unions affiliated to congress; 34 per cent of trade union members in Ireland are in one union; 19 unions cater for over four-fifths or 82 per cent of total trade union membership in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Government have made available in the current year for trade union education a grant of £193,000.  This compares with a Government grant of £375,000 to the Irish Management Institute.  The Government grant for management education and training is almost twice that provided for trade union education.  I put to the Minister that this is serious and I ask him to have it reviewed immediately.  Introducing his Estimate the Minister spoke about the National Manpower Service.  I am glad to note that he is not satisfied that the National Manpower Service are well geared to meet their present commitments.  The service is grossly understaffed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear, but let us lay the blame where it should be laid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in Government now.  Morale is not high in the National Manpower Service and so far the Minister has failed to tackle the problem.  It would be necessary and desirable that the operations of that service be linked much more closely with the services of the local <Col N="1845" /> labour exchanges.  The Minister should aim for an integrated unemployment benefit-payment system and placement service so that those in receipt of unemployment benefit would be linked directly to a service that would provide information on where jobs were available.  Local labour exchanges are little more than pay-out offices.</P>
      <P>At a time when there is much thought of industrial relations, of unofficial disputes and so on it is well to remember all those many workers who in a voluntary capacity work day after day in efforts to bring about good industrial relations.  One hears only of what happens when things go wrong but one can never hear of how much trouble is prevented by reason of efforts being made in time to avoid trouble.</P>
      <P>From time to time it would be well to examine the operations of the Labour Court.  I do not think anyone can deny that the Labour Court has proved to be a wonderful institution and has worked as well as any such institution could be expected to work. However, it should be examined from time to time from the point of view of the services it provides, especially conciliation services.  Perhaps it would be possible to organise the conciliation services on a regional basis so that when needed a conciliation officer could be contacted in an area adjacent to where the problem is rather than the people concerned having to telephone Dublin and, possibly, finding difficulty in locating the conciliation officer who cannot be expected to be on call all the time.  I trust the Minister will give consideration to this suggestion.  It may not be possible to have a full court in each region but it would be helpful to have an officer in each of a number of regions so that he would be closer to the people with whom he would be dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk of procedures in the context of the Labour Court we might have regard to the situation that can arise from time to time when workers are a round-and-a-half behind in terms of pay agreements so that while one can be discussing the next round with an employer, one is still involved in finalising the previous round with <Col N="1846" /> another employer.  There should be some way at least of ensuring that such matters are not dragged out unnecessarily. The pay clause may be helpful in this regard but it has not succeeded in preventing disputes.  It is not helpful for anybody concerned to be involved in disputes about pay that last for up to 15 months.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us what is holding up implementation of the legislation on worker participation that was passed in March last.  Is the hold-up on the part of the Department or is it due to delay on the part of one of the Minister's colleagues in the Cabinet?  As far as I know the Minister will be responsible only for making the necessary regulation.  I trust that the legislation can be implemented without further delay.  Some people are beginning to doubt that it will ever be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate the Minister on the obvious in-depth thought and consideration that he has been giving to his Department since taking up office.  In his introductory speech the Minister pinpointed a number of areas that have been a source of difficulty and which have bedevilled Irish industry for too long.  I wish him every success in coming to grips with the more serious of those problems.</P>
      <P>One of the most striking aspects of present-day government has been the growth and development in the Department of Labour and in particular the very important role they have in keeping the cogs of industry running smoothly.  This Estimate exceeds the amount for the previous year by almost £15 million or an increase of more than 70 per cent.  Of this allocation £7 million is directed to the employment incentive scheme for the purpose of encouraging private enterprise to increase employment and to provide the jobs that are needed so badly. Obviously, unemployment will continue to be a major problem for us for some time.  When Fianna Fáil were returned to office the country was on its knees after the previous four years in which thousands of jobs were lost and when the economy was practically in ruins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all accept that the country was caught in the general world-wide <Col N="1847" /> depression but we must accept also that the Coalition did literally nothing by way of trying to curb the almost daily closures of industry and the resulting losses of thousands of jobs. What was worse was that at a time when any capital investment should have been encouraged, the then Minister for Finance imposed a tax on investment.  This proved to be a real disincentive for any business and in turn it cost the country many jobs and destroyed the prospect of at least containing the job losses of that time.  One can easily cast one's mind back to that depressing time.  The memories are still fresh in the minds of many people.</P>
    <P>Against that background one must consider the criticism by Opposition speakers of the real effect being achieved by the Government.  This criticism sounds empty and hollow.  In recent months contributions from the other side of the House have been forecasts of gloom and despair.  Nothing constructive has come across.  The Fine Gael Leader in his address to the Ard Fheis last weekend referred to unemployment and said that the unemployment problem could not be solved easily or painlessly and that they would have to prepare for a task of exceptional difficulty because of our unique population structure.  That, at least, is an honest admission that Fine Gael would have really no ideas or no policies for tackling the problem of unemployment if they were in Government. As happened between 1974 and 1977, they would probably continue to sit still and hope that the problem might disappear overnight.</P>
    <P>In comparison to that negative attitude and approach, what have the Government of today achieved so far? The special action programme has exceeded its target in the latter half of last year.  So far this year the number of jobs provided has totalled 7,000 of the estimated 20,000 new jobs needed to the end of 1978.  The last few weeks have seen an acceleration of the downward trend in the official unemployment figures.  That, I would submit, is the positive action needed, not the kind of airy fairy talk that we have had from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> The building and construction industry is developing and many more jobs will be created during the next few months.  In the housing sector 26,500 houses are programmed for this year. This will be 2,000 more houses than in 1977 and the largest number ever built in any one year.  The improved scheme for home improvement grants must also create a number of jobs.  In the first four months of this year the number of applications for grants is treble the number received in the same period in 1977.  Surely this must mean more jobs, but I question whether it will affect the official number unemployed. The abuse of the social welfare system is a matter for another Department and another Minister, but I believe that a large number of those employed in small building work, such as home extensions, renovations, improvements and so on are officially unemployed according to the live register.  The position during the past few years has worsened in that regard.  This applies not only to the construction industry; it cuts across all forms of occupation and business.</P>
    <P>It is far too common nowadays to hear of firms who cannot get workers to fill available vacancies.  Such firms are asked at interviews whether they stamp a card and unfortunately many applicants lose interest in jobs when it is realised that a company is completely above board and perfectly legitimate as far as social insurance stamps and PAYE are concerned. This is a terrible situation and a dreadful indictment of a Christian country when there are supposed to be so many thousands unemployed. What has got into our people in recent years in regard to this type of abuse?  As a nation we would appear to have become too self-centred and selfish.  I know for a fact that there are many who are genuinely unemployed, particularly young people who are striving to get a start in life, but it is anybody's guess as to the number on the live register who are unemployable for some reason or another.  The Minister will have a tough job in segregating those available for work from those who are not available.  Some day this must be done.</P>
    <P>There are in some western European <Col N="1849" /> countries procedures to contain this type of practice.  A State-controlled employment service, such as Manpower, sends those on the register to available jobs.  If three offers of a job have been rejected by a person for no valid reason, he or she is struck off the register and ceases to receive unemployment benefit.  Such a system would, of course, be extremely unpopular. However, it would serve a specific purpose and, if properly operated, would be fair in the long term to the country as a whole.  It would be one sure way of catching the many thousands who are doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; and who are financially far better off by being officially unemployed.</P>
    <P>Too many of our young people are genuinely unemployed, and next July many thousands more will be coming out of school and seeking jobs.  As the previous speaker indicated, we have a very high ratio of young people per head of population.  The numbers coming on the employment market are exceeding by far the numbers of workers retiring and the pace of new job creation is not fast enough.  There are also other factors that contribute in a big way in modern times.  The technological age is with us and automation has replaced many thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>Another very important factor is the retention of employment by many married women.  This is something that is now with us, whether one likes it or not.  In previous years many thousands of jobs were available to young people in the public service, banks, insurance companies, finance houses, factories and so on.  There was always a very large turnover due to girls leaving to get married.  The vast majority of women are now staying on at their jobs after marriage, with the consequent loss of vacancies and openings for those leaving school.</P>
    <P>There is greater pressure now than ever before on the Government and on the various agencies to create the many additional jobs required to meet those seeking work.  So far the Government are on course and are confident that the steps taken will achieve the set targets for this year and the following <Col N="1850" /> years.  Unfortunately during recent years the infrastructure was seriously underinvested, thus creating a shortage of serviced lands.  This could create serious problems and cause some setback to the IDA's massive investment programme.  This would of course seriously disrupt such programmes and it is due to the absence of proper planning by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service have come in for a lot of criticism in recent times&mdash;much of it, I would suggest, deserved and justified.  The pressures of recent years have been heavy and obviously the National Manpower Service have not been geared or prepared to handle such heavy pressures.  I feel that perhaps they may have become a little too bureaucratic.  There have been complaints that from the employers' viewpoint the National Manpower Service are totally disorganised.  Very often they continue to send candidates for vacancies even after such vacancies have been notified weeks previously as having been filled.  It is important that employers should have confidence in the National Manpower Service and I am pleased to note from the Minister's speech that he has indicated his intention to expand the service substantially this year.</P>
    <P>AnCO have played and are still playing a very important role in training our young people for specific grades. There is concern that industry in general are not catering for the apprentices that are, and will be, required to meet the demands of future years. Many employers feel that apprentices have become too costly.  The Minister must look at this problem urgently and consider how best it can be solved.  If necessary some form of incentive to the employer catering for apprentices could be considered.  This would be a source of encouragement to employers to take on a sufficient number of apprentices, who are badly needed if we are to continue our development.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted nearly six pages of his text to industrial relations. That is an indication of how seriously concerned the Government are about this matter.  Nobody will argue that the strike is not a perfectly legitimate <Col N="1851" /> weapon in any dispute, but the consequences of any strike also imposes on the worker an obligation to act in a responsible way.  It is therefore very disquieting for everybody&mdash;I am sure is it disquieting for the trade unions&mdash;that 60 per cent of the man days lost since 1977 were due to unofficial strikes. There is no doubt that in any dispute there are two sides to the problem and many disputes are brought about due to inadequate and poor industrial relations by management.  I agree with the Minister that it is difficult to condone those who resort to unofficial strike action without going through normal accepted channels.  Very often only a small number will dictate and succeed in getting large sections to follow them, often against their own better judgment and against their will.</P>
    <P>At this time particularly it is of vital importance to us as a country to encourage foreign investment which is badly needed to create employment and jobs.  If we are unsettled in industrial relations there is no doubt we will not succeed.  Some sanity must be restored in the area of industrial relations. The Minister is obviously very sincere in wishing for common sense and goodwill to prevail.  The trade union movement have a grave responsibility to their members and to the country as a whole.  Unions must act strongly and they must have discipline among their membership.  The commission being set up by the Minister to examine industrial relations will no doubt give a great deal of thought to this aspect.  We all hope that some progress will be made in this respect in the interests of the economy and of future jobs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Minister on his efforts. His portfolio is a very difficult one&mdash; very much uphill.  He is entitled to expect the support needed to put his ideas and plans, which will be of benefit to industry, to the economy and to the country in general, into practice.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an Meastachán seo don Roinn Saothair.  Roinn an-thábhachtach í san lá atá inniu ann agus dá <Col N="1852" /> bhrí sin baineann tábhacht faoi leith leis an ndíospóireacht seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate on the annual Estimate for the Department of Labour focuses attention on aspects of Government policy and national activity which could be validly referred to as being crucial elements in national development and progress.  I refer in particular to the question of manpower policy and industrial relations.  Coming from a constituency which suffered a severe disaster by the closure of the Ferenka plant and being spokesman in the field of telecommunications, an area which has been affected by prolonged industrial disputes, it is natural that I am concerned about the aspects of the Department of Labour which impinge on the question of industrial relations.  The Minister in his speech adverted to the question of industrial relations, to the problems that have emerged and to the role of his Department and of a Minister for Labour in relation to industrial disputes and industrial relations.  I am convinced that a harmonious industrial climate is a necessary prerequisite for economic development and social progress in any modern democracy.  The programme of job creation, is a major and daunting challenge to create full employment of a variety and range to satisfy the job aspirations of our young people now that they have better educational opportunities than ever before.  The achievement of this objective depends to a large extent on the creation of a harmonious industrial relations climate. This climate cannot be created on the basis of confrontation, coercion or repressive legislation and it cannot be created through the rosy expectations deliberately raised by a dishonest election manifesto or by the failure of the Government to deliver when in office. A climate of harmonious industrial relations can only be created on the basis of mutual understanding and goodwill founded on the practical application of the principles of partnership and responsibility between the Government, employers and unions. This concept of partnership and mutual understanding which is the ideal formula for a harmonious and stable industrial relations climate is difficult to <Col N="1853" /> achieve in a democracy but our recent experiences, notably the catastrophe represented by the closure of Ferenka and the long telecommunications difficulties which arise because of bad industrial relations in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, are examples of a growing national malaise which if allowed to continue unchecked could be fraught with serious consequences for the economy.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister said in his introductory speech, the Minister and the Government have a major responsibility to create this climate of goodwill.  It is a matter of grave concern to many people that the present Government since taking office appear to have failed completely to appreciate the sensitivity, the importance and the vital element that industrial relations constitute in the development of the national economy.  The Government has a duty to give proper leadership. A very special responsibility rests on Ministers and Government Departments who have large State and semi-State bodies under the aegis of their Departments to ensure that an example of industrial democracy in action is given to the nation.  That has not happened.  The Minister for Labour has been reluctant to intervene in industrial disputes.  I accept that the Minister must not intervene at early stages in every problem but there comes a time in relation to an industrial dispute, particularly one that can have major economic and social repercussions such as the Ferenka closure and the long-drawn-out telecommunications dispute, when the Minister for Labour has no option but to intervene.</P>
    <P>I am gravely perturbed, as are many other people, by the apparent failure of the present Government to face up to the reality of modern industrial relations.  I do not know whether or not the Minister for Labour, his Department or the Government have learnt anything from the Ferenka debacle.  Following the announcement of the closure I and other people called for a public inquiry into the reasons for the closure.  I would like him to say what assessment or <Col N="1854" /> analysis of the cause of the closure of Ferenka has been carried out by him or his Department.  Surely there are lessons to be learnt from this. Surely we cannot close our eyes and ignore the facts and the difficulties that gave rise to this industrial disaster.  There is need to allay public anxiety about this situation and to allay the anxiety of many potential investors and industrialists about the industrial relations climate here.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the closure of Ferenka was an appalling tragedy in my constituency where 1,400 people were added to an already high number of unemployed, but the real tragedy and the real repercussions of this closure is the bad image that the whole episode gave to Ireland as an attractive base for new industries.  The IDA are well aware of this and I am sure the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy who is at present abroad on an industrial promotions mission is well aware of it.  One of the first questions that will be asked by potential industrialists will be &ldquo;what happened to Ferenka?&rdquo;.  This question of industrial relations difficulties, of inter-union rivalry and the other unofficial actions that were taken to which the Minister adverted in his speech, were contributory factors.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written about it.  All I will say now is that the air should be cleared.  Apart from seeking scapegoats or head hunting in relation to the Ferenka disaster, it should be studied and lessons should be learned from the reasons for it and the problems and the difficulties which led up to the closure.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about his extreme reluctance to intervene in industrial disputes.  I know as much as anybody about the Ferenka disaster and it is my considered opinion that it was a classical example of where timely, appropriate and proper intervention by the Minister for Labour could have averted the final catastrophe.</P>
    <P>One dimension of the Government's handling of the industrial relations crisis in Ferenka gave rise to a lot of discussion.  Many people, including me, <Col N="1855" /> do not understand why the Minister for Labour handed over responsibility to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at a crucial stage of the negotiations, the interventions and the overtures.  I am convinced that had the Minister for Labour, of course in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, sought the assistance of at least three other Ministers in that general region, he would have found it possible&mdash;he would also have had the expert advice available to him in the Department&mdash;to avert that appalling tragedy.  However, as I have said, there are lessons to be learned from a study and an assessment of that catastrophe which could result in non-recurrence of such catastrophes in future.</P>
    <P>The whole field of industrial relations is probably the most discussed and most frequently written about topic nowadays.  The Ferenka dispute which led to such a disaster was followed by the appalling telecommunications dispute. In order to create a proper industrial relations plan it is necessary that the Government should show proper leadership, appropriate understanding of situations as they arise and then take action.  How can we expect the private sector to react reasonably, and how empty sound the appeals of Ministers for industrial harmony, when we find one Minister guilty of the most appalling industrial relations practices in respect of a Department employing thousands of people over which he has control?  The PO dispute threw the whole telecommunications system into chaos and as late as yesterday Aer Lingus and another body had twothirds of their telecommunications systems thrown out of order.  The reservations section of Aer Lingus was completely disrupted.</P>
    <P>The Government must show an example and the Minister for Labour cannot ignore or opt out of the vital role he has in this respect.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs opted out of his responsibilities.  How can we expect leadership in this field from a Government, from a Minister who suspended workers for refusing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;your very acute definition of the whole thing.  I am talking about industrial relations for which the Minister for Labour has final responsibility.  I say, as one of my colleagues said, that there is an obligation on the Minister for Labour, given certain circumstances, personally to intervene in industrial disputes. Therefore, the Minister for Labour has overall responsibility in relation to the dispute I have been referring to even if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has direct responsibility for it&mdash;in other words, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs must consult with the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that the entire industrial relations situation would be given a new approach.  There should be a clearer understanding of the vital role industrial relations play in modern economic development.  Harmonious industrial relations can only be achieved on the basis of mutual goodwill by the Government, the employers and the unions.  The challenge facing the Government, and the Minister for Labour in particular, is to use every means at their disposal to ensure that <Col N="1857" /> an industrial relations plan is created that will ensure we will not have any more Ferenka or PO disasters.</P>
    <P>AnCO policy is another major aspect of the operations and the responsibilities of the Department of Labour.  To me the most interesting part of the Minister's opening speech is his reference to the importance of a manpower policy and his promise to look at the question of the labour market. It comes under the general heading of manpower policy.  I spoke about career guidance, the role of AnCO and of the IMI and also the role of our educational institutions.  I agree with the Minister that it is necessary to have a proper manpower policy.  I cannot envisage the achievement of the aims and objectives of a full employment policy in the absence of a correspondingly suitable national manpower policy.  This is a vital element but there are major psychological difficulties to be overcome.  Career guidance is a vital element and could be described as the take-off point in the formulation of a national manpower policy.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government I had the privilege of opening a number of careers exhibitions and I was greatly impressed with the way the Department of Labour, AnCO and the National Manpower Service developed with regard to their presentation of career guidance.  I was most impressed by the stands in the exhibitions and by the informative leaflets that were available.  This question of career guidance is vital.  The creation of full employment is not merely a matter of creating any kind of jobs.  They must be of a range and a variety that will satisfy the job aspirations of our young people.  These aspirations can be formed and moulded during the formative years of school.  A proper career guidance system must be introduced to ensure that the natural talents, brains and ability of our young people are channelled into areas that will be suitable to their ability and qualifications and also it must be geared towards those areas that will provide the best employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>There was the old traditional system in which many of us grew up where the bright children were sent to the <Col N="1858" /> local secondary school and the not so bright to the local technical school. This was the traditional practice throughout rural Ireland and I grew up under that system.  There must be greater emphasis on technical education and career guidance and this will have to be integrated with the AnCO training courses into a comprehensive industrial training set-up.  I recall the case many years ago when two young men who had their pass leaving certificate came to see me in my office in Limerick one Saturday.  They asked me for my assistance in finding them jobs and I referred them to the industrial estate at Shannon.  They were re-directed to an industry that was recruiting workers and they filled in an application form stating that they wanted office jobs.</P>
    <P>In those days if a person had a pass leaving certificate he or she expected to obtain at least a clerical job.  The two young men were informed that there was no clerical work available and were offered jobs on the factory floor.  One of them accepted the job and the other refused.  The person who accepted the job on the factory floor got on very well and after five or six years he was made assistant manager and is now a very successful factory manager.  However, the parents of that young man did not speak to me for 12 months after he got the work.  Their grievance was that their son who had his leaving certificate was going to work with other young people who went to the local technical school. There is a moral to that story.  Career guidance is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>I had very close associations with AnCO, go háirithe le Gaoth Dóbhair i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall sna ceithre bliain a bhí sé do onóir agam bheith im Aire na Gaeltachta, agus ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt go poiblí do na daoine atá ag obair in ionad na Comhairle Oiliúna i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall.  Thug an tionad sin cabhair mhór do Ghaeltarra Éireann chun forbairt thionscailíochta na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an Chomhairle Oiliúna ó thaobh fhorbairt eacnamíochta, ó thaobh postanna agus ó thaobh eacnamíochta na tíre go hiomlán.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1859" /> I have had personal experience of the operations of AnCO in the Limerick-Shannon region.  AnCO have shown flexibility, initiative and understanding of the problems of training young people, many of whom come from a rural environment where there is no industrial background and where the families have no association with industry.  During the years AnCO have succeeded quite well in training young workers and in acclimatising them to the psychological change of working in an industrial environment as compared with their traditional farming and rural environment.  We had the same problem in relation to industrial development in the Gaeltacht regions and I want to pay tribute to AnCO for what they have done.  However, their role in relation to the future training and educational needs of the potential industrial workforce must be looked at.  I am not too sure that as they are at present constituted and having regard to their terms of reference they are geared adequately to meet the enormous challenge of providing the educational and training facilities for what we hope will be a rapidly growing labour force.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will again examine the position of NBA houses at Letterkenny, County Donegal for which £1,000 grants have been refused, and which first time purchasers were led to believe would qualify when purchase was being negotiated; and if, in view of the particular circumstances, he will allocate the £700 balance to purchasers who qualify in all other respects.</P>

      <P>I understand from the National Building Agency Limited that no assurance was given to purchasers of these houses regarding their qualification under the £1,000 <Col N="1860" /> new house grant scheme.  Grants of £325, which were allocated to the agency in 1975, were paid in whole or in part before 1 January 1976, and credit for these grants is being allowed in the sale price of the houses. It is a condition of the £1,000 new house grant scheme that where any payment was made under the old schemes, the application must continue to be treated under the old schemes and an application for the £1,000 grant cannot be allowed.  I might explain also that it has always been the position that one new house grant only may be paid in respect of any house.  Accordingly, additional new house grants could not be allowed in these cases.</P>

It was only after they committed themselves and negotiated loans that they discovered they would not qualify for the £1,000 grant.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 1977 Meath County Council submitted a proposal to my Department to increase the pay of a foreman on direct labour schemes.  The increase proposed exceeded 1½ per cent of basic pay, the limit imposed by clause 10 of the Employer-Trade Union National Agreement 1977; a Labour Court recommendation would be required for any increase which exceeded this limit.  My Department advised the local authority of this on 28 September 1977 and stated that the claim should be processed in accordance with the national agreement.  No further communication was received in the Department from the local authority until 15th instant when a letter was received enclosing a copy of a letter stated to have been sent to the Department on 24 November last and which proposed adoption of a Labour Court recommendation. My Department have now inquired whether the consent of the council has been obtained in accordance with section <Col N="1863" /> 6 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  Assuming that the consent of the council is forthcoming, the proposal will be sanctioned by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister has said that there are two issues involved.  The first is that he is doubting that a letter which was sent from Meath County Council was in fact sent because he used the words &ldquo;purporting to be sent&rdquo;.  Secondly, is he suggesting that even though the case was processed in the normal way by the Labour Court and accepted as being within the terms of the employer-labour conference agreement, the Department still challenged the right of the council to pay it unless they knew something which had to be done had in fact been done?</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that there is absolutely no record of the November letter in my Department. The first that my Department knew about the Labour Court recommendation was in the enclosed copy of the letter which they received on 15 May.

    <P>Decisions as to locations in which parking is prohibited or restricted are matters for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the local authorities&mdash;in this case Dublin Corporation&mdash;acting in consultation.  I have no power to effect changes of the nature suggested by the Deputy.  Representations received in my Department some time ago on parking restrictions in the Rathmines area were transmitted to the responsible authorities for their consideration. I understand that following re-examination of the area by officers <Col N="1865" /> of the Corporation and the gardaí, a deputation from the Rathmines Traders' Association were informed by the Dublin Traffic Sub-Committee that the existing parking restrictions could not be relaxed without serious interference with traffic flows but that consideration would be given to acquisition of a site for a car park in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister may have no powers in the area but he is not without influence. Would he consider expressing to the local authority his concern for the way in which this particular inner city suburb is experiencing the effects of substantial suburban growth?  Would he ask the local authority, on behalf of the traders in the area, to expedite a serious study of the area because that has not been done to date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister cannot be expected to understand the details in every case, but a meeting with the group does not necessarily mean that the item is substantially studied.

I am reasonably confident that the counties which have not operated it&mdash; and there are not too many of them&mdash; will be operating it by that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if it is the policy of the Government to encourage an increase in the number of building societies in this country; if the proposal by the Irish Life Assurance Company to establish its own building society was specifically approved; and if, with a view to rationalising the societies and eliminating unnecessary duplication and waste, he will take steps to amalgamate all existing societies into a single State-owned building society, possibly under the auspices of Irish Life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the Government to allow the Registrar of Building Societies to decide, within the powers conferred on him by the Building Societies Act, 1976, whether or not to register a proposed new building society.  The registrar may refuse to register a proposed society if, in his opinion, the registration would not be in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business.  Provision is made for an appeal to the High Court against any such decision by the registrar.  I understand that the registrar has under consideration an application for the registration of a building society by the company to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to a similar question on 8 November 1977, as reported at column 363, volume 301, of the Official Report, I do not consider that, in present circumstances, there would be any advantage to be gained by the amalgamation of all existing societies into a single State-owned building <Col N="1874" /> society.  The Building Societies Act, 1976, provides adequate powers for the regulation of unions or mergers of societies or transfers of the engagements of one society to another.  It is not open to me to take the initiative in these matters and I do not see any present need to seek such power.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the whole question of house purchase, the cost of house purchase for young people and the difficulties of raising the money is becoming a national scandal?  Would the Minister not agree it is absurd for the Government to permit another company to add to the multiplicity of costs already existing which must be paid by the consumer? In the circumstances, would he decide either to allow Irish Life to go ahead and form a State company and use it to absorb the other companies, or else not to add to the absurdity of the many costs already existing which must be paid by the consumer?</P>

      <P>It is not a function of mine or my Department to allow or disallow a new building society.  That is the function of a different Department. It would be very difficult for anyone to say that in principle a new building society should not be allowed because of the amount of money being made available by building societies. Last year £120 million was made available for housing.  Another building society might be helpful.  I am just expressing my opinion.  It is not my function to allow or disallow it.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there are appalling housing conditions in the Ringsend-Irishtown area, or that many tenants of Dublin Corporation houses in the area are experiencing extreme hardship.  A scheme of 149 houses is being built by the corporation at Pigeon House Road and I understand that the local authority is now considering the provision of more houses in Ringsend-Irishtown.  It is a matter for the corporation, in accordance with their scheme of letting priorities, to allocate the tenancies of dwellings provided by them.  Existing tenants in the area who wish to transfer to other corporation dwelling will be considered for such rehousing, due regard being had to their relative needs and their position on the housing list.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not aware of the appalling housing conditions, would he be willing to come and look at them?  Is he aware that people are living in conditions of extreme damp, with walls running with damp and with water on the floor under the linoleum?  Is he aware that 12 people are living in two-bedroom accommodation in the Ringsend area and have been doing so for a long time past?  Would the Minister withdraw the note of complacency in his reply which <Col N="1877" /> is due, I am sure, to the fact that he has not been properly informed on this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We would be very grateful.  Is the Minister aware of the problems existing because this area is unique in the south-east quadrant of the city in that in the hinterland of it there are no housing schemes accessible to the people?  It is this that has led to the accumulation of overcrowding. Would he consider, therefore, giving priority to additional housing in this area because only a fraction, something like one-fifth, of the housing demand in the area is being satisfied by the schemes mentioned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that only a portion of those houses, something like one-third, will go to people from the area and that this is catering for less than one-fifth of the total demand for housing in the area which remains unsatisfied, leaving the people living in the conditions I have mentioned?</P>

      <P>With regard to the 149 houses, I understand that 35 of them have already been allocated, some of them to tenants from the Pearse Street area who were affected by a CPO. The allocation of the new houses to tenants is proceeding steadily as the houses are being handed over by the builder.

Is the Minister aware that a minimum of 43 to 44 points is required to be housed in those houses as distinct from approximately 33 points in the Blanchardstown or Tallaght suburban sites?  In view of this demand and this increased preference in terms of points for inner city housing will the Minister give an undertaking to the House that he will favourably consider an application by Dublin Corporation for additional capital funds to extend the scheme which is undoubtedly needed as expressed in terms of points preference and in terms of its advisability?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the wide-ranging criticism of the national house building guarantee scheme made recently to the Dublin <Col N="1880" /> Solicitors' Bar Association; whether he will amend the scheme accordingly; and, in particular, if he will introduce a scheme which protects house buyers against a builder going bankrupt during the construction of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the recent comments of the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association on the national house building guarantee scheme, which, in addition to some criticisms of the scheme stated that: &ldquo;It cannot be denied that the scheme is indeed a very welcome step forward&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This scheme was approved by the Government on the basis that it would give satisfaction to new house purchasers and that it would be subject to review after two years.  At this stage, I do not propose to suggest any amendment of the scheme, which is operated by the National House Building Guarantee Co. Ltd.  My Department are involved in the scheme through the inspection service of houses covered by the guarantee and also by two observers who attend the meetings of the guarantee company.</P>
      <P>As regard the final part of the Deputy's question, house builders who apply for registration under the scheme are subject to a searching examination of their financial situation and technical organisation by the guarantee company in order to ensure, as far as possible, that registered builders have the resources and expertise to build houses to acceptable standards and the financial capacity to complete the construction of the houses and honour their obligations to purchasers for the six year guarantee period.  It is hoped that this strict examination will obviate the danger of bankrupcy of registered builders before the houses are completed&mdash;after which the guarantee company will accept the liabilities of the builder under the scheme.  Unless it becomes clear that the scheme is not achieving that objective, I think it is premature to suggest any modifications of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather disappointed at the criticism made by the Dublin Solicitors' Bar Association.  The scheme is a genuine effort to provide a cheap, <Col N="1881" /> speedy and more certain solution to the major problems of house purchasers in relation to the structural stability of their houses than had existed previously.  Prior to the introduction of the scheme, purchasers had to pursue their complaints through court action.  It has never been claimed that the guarantee scheme is a panacea for all the structural problems of house purchasers.  Instead, its primary purpose is to ensure that purchasers are given an assurance of reasonable protection against any serious structural defects which may arise and which would be expensive for the purchasers themselves to rectify.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the scope of the scheme shall be kept under review with a view to introducing any improvements which the experience and resources of the scheme would warrant.  I would like to assure Deputies and others that constructive comment on the scheme will always be welcomed by my Department and by the guarantee company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everybody agrees that this is a welcome advance in relation to the dilemma of the house purchaser.  Arising out of the complaint made, has the Minister any advice to offer to house purchasers which might substantiate or deny the claim made? Has he any advice that might enlighten future house purchasers as to any dangers they may face which he is now aware of as a result of the criticism by the solicitors?  Has he anything to suggest to purchasers what they should watch out for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the association when they made these comments relied to a large extent on the working paper relating to the liability of the builders, vendors and lessors for the quality and fitness of premises which was published on 6 July 1977.  That paper commented on the then draft guarantee scheme. Accordingly, their comments are inaccurate and misleading in relation to several matters.  I should like to give the Deputy a few examples.  They felt that contract houses would not benefit but all houses built by registered members <Col N="1882" /> must be brought into the scheme and this includes houses built under contract for a client.  That was inaccurate. It was also stated that the purchaser must show that he had exhausted his remedy against the builder before he could claim from the registration body but rules 25, 26 and 27 of the scheme specify the purchaser's remedies which are dramatically different from that which would be achieved in law.  A builder is required to investigate and reply to the guarantee company within 28 days of the receipt of a complaint.  Those are some of the inaccuracies.  They arose because the criticism was based on a working paper dated 6 July 1977 and not on the actual scheme.  I do not think there is any necessity to correct anything but if there is I will certainly do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is of the unease among people who had what they now feel is a false sense of security in the scheme.  Can the Minister categorically say that the guarantees given by him, or intended by him, under the scheme are realisable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the average length of time taken to process a compulsory purchase order on land required for building purposes in (a) Dublin city, (b) the rest of Ireland; and if he will introduce the necessary legislation to expedite this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the time taken to process compulsory purchase orders varies very considerably and the number of such orders is not very great in Dublin city or elsewhere, average figures are not very meaningful. Furthermore, acquisition of land for housing purposes normally involves a public local inquiry in the case of Dublin orders, whereas about two-thirds of the orders relating to other areas do not and have been processed in periods of between two and six months.  For what it is worth, in recent years, housing orders in these other areas have taken an average period of about eight months when an inquiry was involved and about twice that period for orders relating to Dublin city sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1886" /> I have been having the question of legislation examined as some improvement in compulsory purchase procedure may be necessary.  However, as I have explained in reply to a previous question, the possibilities for introducing a more expeditious procedure are severely limited, having regard to constitutional requirements and unavoidable procedural processes.</P>
    <P>The fact that Dublin housing orders take longer than housing orders elsewhere is not surprising.  Even small parcels of city land raise complex issues and may involve numerous plots and interests.  In other areas, processing orders does not usually take as much time because, although there are exceptions, the issues tend to be simpler and the interests fewer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is clearly another defect in the Constitution, but is it likely that a CPO could take anything up to five years in the city?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not evident that there is a necessity for a new procedure where there are a multiplicity of owners of plots of land, many of them not knowing the plots of land? Would the Minister be prepared to introduce legislation which would enable these plots to be acquired where the owner is not known on the basis that the necessary money is set aside and can be subsequently claimed, or otherwise we will never get through this? In so far as any such legislation turns out to be unconstitutional, would the Minister not agree that it should be tested and that the advice consistently given in his Department that actions of this kind are unconstitutional should not be left lie preventing development, that we should test whether it is constitutional or not, and if it is not constitutional, initiate the necessary change in the Constitution to prevent the public interest being inhibited in this way?</P>

Is the Minister aware that, for the last six to seven months, a CPO in his Department is being delayed purely on the basis of small technicalities?  I am talking about Portland Place.

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will establish a public inquiry to examine the state of the fire services in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement relating to the fire service which I made in introducing the Estimate for my Department in the House on 15 March 1978.  I indicated then that all local authorities had been asked to conduct a review of the operation of their fire services to determine how those services match up to the needs of today.  The reviews are comprehensive examinations extending to all aspects of both fire fighting, and other operations, and of fire prevention work.  They cover 11 separate aspects under 65 sub-headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I do not see the need for an inquiry into the state of the fire services&mdash;that stage was completed in the Report of the Working Party on the Fire Service which was laid before each House of the Oireachtas in July 1975.  The report made wide-ranging recommendations on the operational service, fire prevention, structure and qualification, training and miscellaneous matters.  Work is in progress in all of these areas and, in particular, on the recommendation that for each local fire authority area there should be a separate assessment of the strength and adequacy of the service. These are the reviews to which I have referred and according as the fire brigade authorities submit their reports they are being considered in my Department and being followed up <Col N="1889" /> with such inquiries, advice or assistance as may be appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why it is that there appears to be such disquiet amongst the fire officers in relation to the fire services?  As I understand it, they have been anxious that there be some sort of inquiry into these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief fire officers seem to have a certain amount of disquiet from some public statements and so on.  We have asked for a review of each local authority in relation to fire services and what is required in their areas.  There are quite a number of these reports already in my Department being processed and examined. There are some still to come, but we are treating it as a matter that should be dealt with as quickly as possible. On the reason for there being disquiet amongst the fire officers I will make more inquiries and try to let the Deputy know what are the specific reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must know when this is shown by people in their position&mdash;they are the authorities on this subject and know more about it than any of us&mdash;that, in these circumstances, the Minister must accept that the process he is using at present is not one that satisfies them, is probably not going to be an effective one and that is why they continue to be disquieted despite all the things he and his predecessor said they were and are doing?</P>

      <P>In contacting the Assistant City Manager as to whether the proposals for housing development at Baldoyle could be re-examined I was considering the urgent necessity for job creation and also the need for providing residential accommodation in the Dublin area.  I would bring to the notice of the Deputy that under the provisions of section 22 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended <Col N="1894" /> by the Act of 1976, the Minister for the Environment has specific powers in relation to development plans. These powers have not previously been used to any extent because of the inhibiting effect of the appeals function.  The fact that appellate powers are now vested in An Bord Pleanála enables me to take the initiative to ask for a re-examination of the possibility of development in a particular area, especially where job creation and housing needs are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was referring to the role and the performance of AnCO and I expressed the opinion that this organisation had made a very important contribution to the vital area of industrial training.  There should be close cooperation and understanding between the Minister's Department and the Department of Education in relation to AnCO's training schemes.  I understand that different areas of conflict have already presented themselves and I envisage the natural evolution of AnCO's role and responsibility as being very much tied in with the technical education branch in particular of the Department of Education.  I am sure the Minister is aware that with the growing intake of trainees, apprentices and so forth by AnCO and the rapid development of AnCO in recent years there is need to ensure that there is no duplication between the facilities in training schemes and courses offered by the Minister's Department through AnCO and those offered by the Department of Education in the technical and technological field.  I do not see why there should be any conflict.  The educational and training resources available in this small country are small enough, so it is vitally important that there be no conflict of interest between the Department of Labour and the Department of Education.  We must ensure the <Col N="1898" /> optimum utilisation of the resources of both Departments to evolve an appropriate national training policy for employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the question of management training, which indeed is very relevant to the role of AnCO. He referred to the increased State subvention for the Irish Management Institute.  I had experience of the IMI during the four years I had the privilege to be Minister for the Gaeltacht and I was very aware during that time of the vital importance of the availability of properly trained managers for new industries.  The farther away one goes from the capital city of Dublin the more difficult the problem of unavailability of trained management becomes.  In the Gaeltacht development, the area in which I had personal experience, the first major problem confronting Gaeltarra Eireann was the difficulty of getting suitably trained managers for industrial projects; second, and more important, was the difficulty of retaining them in remote, peripheral isolated regions. Therefore I support any steps that will be taken to accelerate and upgrade the training of managers.  We were so concerned some years ago about this lack of managerial skill in the Gaeltacht region that the Department of the Gaeltacht and Gaeltarra Eireann had to initiate a scholarship scheme at the Regional Technical College in Galway where young people from the Gaeltacht are being trained in business studies and basic managerial sciences with a view to having a pool of skilled and trained managers available.  I endorse what the Minister has said here in relation to the vital importance of the managerial dimension in economic development.  He rightly said that there is huge expenditure on industrial training and on the imparting of skills of various kinds to the work-force to prepare them for industry and that parallel with that there should be appropriate managerial training courses which should keep pace with the acceleration and increase in the number of training courses being offered by AnCO at the worker level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience of the IMI I have been very impressed with the setup <Col N="1899" /> there and with the commitment, skills and expertise of their key executives and their various training personnel. Relevant too is the organisation known as CERT who are responsible for the recruitment and training of personnel for hotels, catering and the tourist industry.  I have always held the view which I have expressed here in the House down the years, and nothing I have learned since leads me to change my view, that the tourist industry with all its offshoots&mdash;the hotel and catering industry, the travel business and so on &mdash;is a vital industry for the economy and that it should have available to it the same educational training facilities as are available to industry through AnCO.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the recurring question of whether CERT should be hived off from the overall umbrella of AnCO.  I am aware of the type of work carried out by CERT and I am glad that the Minister has set up a review body comprised of representatives of CERT and of AnCO as well as of the other relevant organisations&mdash;Bord Fáilte and the Department of Education, for instance.  However, this review body should not confine itself to examining the question of whether it would be preferable to hive off CERT totally from the umbrella of AnCO but that this review body would make an in-depth study of the education and training needs of all aspects of the tourist industry.  This is an industry which by reason of its seasonal nature presents immense problems in relation to the recruitment and to the retaining of staff.  I do not know precisely what percentage of the industry is seasonal, but a substantial part of it is likely to be on the basis only of between three and six months per year.  The staffing problems resulting from this situation are of great concern to hoteliers because they find it necessary to recruit new staff each year.  Very often these people are school-leavers.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I recall considering this problem.  At that time there were six or seven hotels in tourist areas under the auspices of Gaeltarra Éireann and we were considering the possibility <Col N="1900" /> of providing offseason employment perhaps in craft work, in the manufacture of souvenirs and so on during the winter months, so that in this way each hotelier could retain the nucleus of a permanent staff who would be available to take up work in the catering industry each summer.  It is necessary that CERT be strengthened and reorganised. The review body that has been set up may be a step in the right direction in this context.  I would prefer CERT to be an independent body having wide terms of reference and being able to formulate imaginative programmes of training, education and off-season employment in the hotel and catering industry and for all people involved in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his responsibility for implementing the European Social Fund.  He referred to the difficulties that have been encountered in relation to the social implications of EEC transport legislation for this country.  The question of the tachograph has been mentioned.  This question was adverted to also during the recent debate on the Road Transport Bill.  I am glad the Minister appreciates that the introduction of the tachograph has major implications for the Irish road haulage industry and to the whole question of transport costs.  The EEC Commission and the Council of Ministers recognise that we have certain problems and because of this situation a breathing space was allowed in our case.  However, I urge the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that the EEC are fully aware of the special problems of a small country like ours when there is a question of the tachograph or of any other transport regulation being introduced. There should be special consideration for us having regard to the fact that we are the furthest removed from all the European mainland and that our industrialists must transport their goods much greater distances and share a much higher element of transport charges than is shared by their competitors in the UK or on the European mainland.  I urge the Minister to continue his efforts to ensure that the maximum breathing space is given in regard to the implementation of the <Col N="1901" /> tachograph or of any such legislation.</P>
    <P>The two areas that I considered to be of the greatest expectation so far as our joining the Community was concerned were the social fund and the regional fund, but four or five years later I must confess to being sorely disappointed with the failure of the EEC to evolve a realistic social or regional fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are interrelated to the extent that the Minister referred to the question of getting special recognition so far as the social fund is concerned for depressed and disadvantaged areas in the weaker areas of the Community.  Therefore, this is tied in with the whole concept of regional policy.  I am highly critical of the failure of the EEC to implement realistic social and regional policies and in particular their failure to formulate and implement policies which fail to take into account the special circumstances of small countries like ours, particularly the special circumstances of the peripheral and remote regions such as the western seaboard and the off-shore islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Social Fund is making special provision this year for youth employment.  That brings me to the final and perhaps the most important aspect of the Minister's brief.  I refer to the input of the Department to the whole national strategy of employment creation.  At the time the Minister set up the Employment Action Team I thought the idea was good and I expected great results but let us face facts.  In the various areas in which <Col N="1902" /> the team were told to examine possibilities of creating employment for young people there was not required a great deal of initiative or imagination to think of ways and means of spending money on worth-while community schemes, amenities and so on.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this Employment Action Team have taken so long&mdash;ten months now&mdash;to come up with anything worth while.  Muintir na Tíre, the outstanding local community development organisation in Europe, every local authority, every chamber of commerce and every youth organisation has schemes and programmes which could be implemented if they had the funds.  I cannot understand what this team have been doing.  Their progress and performance have been unimaginative, uninspiring and incomprehensible. The sooner the Minister disbands them the better.  In one scheme recently the corporation in Limerick took on 30 people.  What will be the effect of 30 jobs when there are 6,000 on the live register?  There has been an improvement of only 100 during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I recognise as much as anybody else the daunting challenge of creating employment. I submit that it can be done only by the formulation and implementation of radical new employment creation policies, embracing new ideas and new attitudes.  Since this Government took office there has been a remarkable lack of initiative and new thinking and results to date have been appallingly bad.  My reaction to the purpose of the Minister as revealed in his speech is one of grave disappointment. His speech was unimaginative at a time when we need bold, imaginative ideas and strategies, where action should be the key word and not action teams.  I hope the Minister and his Department will tackle their responsibilities in relation to this question of employment creation with much greater vigour than they have shown during the past 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>At the heart of this Estimate is a question which needs some attention.  It relates to the actual function, concept and defination of a Minister for Labour.  To the casual <Col N="1903" /> observer it is quite difficult to identify the face and function of the Minister through perhaps the fact is becoming more familiar.  What precisely is his job?  What should the Estimate for his Department be about?  What parameters should it have and what basic vision should it embrace?  It seems that the task of the Minister for Labour embraces a number of areas.  Undoubtedly the question of job creation comes into it, as also does the question of industrial harmony and goodwill. The question of economic planning in a wider sense than job creation must be involved in his brief.  Straight away there is a degree of confusion and misunderstanding of the role.</P>
      <P>I have been reading the contributions to this debate and the Minister's speech places strong emphasis on all the areas I mentioned.  Yet, in each of these areas with the exception of the industrial harmony dimension, we already have people who have committed themselves to certain goals and ambitions in these areas.  With regard to the industrial and commercial aspect, the area in which the jobs are created, there is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and I am sure that there is close liaison between him and the Minister for Labour.  It is not clear in Government thinking where precisely the ultimate responsibility rests for the job creation programme. This grey edge on the functions and definitions of Ministers may be partly responsible for the lack of cohesion and lack of drive in the way in which the Government are tackling some of the major tasks which they set themselves in their manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt that job creation, which is too simplistic a concept as embodied in those two words, is one of our major challenges. I would imagine that the primary responsibility of the Minister might or should be that of ensuring industrial harmony and peace.  If that be the case, the Minister for Labour could be seen to be a referee acting between the organised workers, through unions and other organisations, and the employer bodies, such as the FUE.  If he is cast in the mould <Col N="1904" /> of referee, it sometimes appears that the whistle does not have any pea in it, and I hope the Minister will not take that disrespectfully.  His role does not appear to be very relevant. As often as not, it boils down to rather vague and general aspirations towards the common good and a reluctance to intervene or interfere because of the processes which endeavour to ensure industrial peace.  The Minister's role in relation to retaining and ensuring industrial harmony is a little bit askew.  I would question whether a Minister for Labour is merited at this stage in carrying out this function.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of economic planning generally, there is also confusion.  The Minister is one of those involved in creating an economic infrastructure for the future.  How can the Minister speak as he did about job creation while the Minister for Economic Planning and Development tell us&mdash;I suspect without a great deal of consultation&mdash;that he is proposing cutbacks in major areas which he chooses to call &ldquo;non job producing&rdquo; areas.  This is a tragic oversimplification and perhaps it is a symptom of the way in which the Government and many others in our society are misjudging the whole basis of the unemployment problem as it is afflicting the so-called civilised western economies.</P>
    <P>These so called &ldquo;non job producing&rdquo; areas are very valid job areas.  Merely because they do not have at their end a tangible physical product, often a product which is essentially wasteful and usefully geared to the short-term economics of the consumer market, does not mean for a moment that the jobs therein are not very valuable, dignified and important and possibly one of the ways in which this problem could be solved.  I am suggesting that the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy are saddled with an outmoded notion based on the thinking of the industrial revolution and an industrial society, according to which jobs are irrelevant to our problem unless they create product at their end.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour has a <Col N="1905" /> difficulty.  When opening his newspaper, he is hoping not to read another speech from one of his colleagues and seeing the area in which he envisages developments being whittled away. The Minister for Finance could make certain valuable sounds in this area, as could the Taoiseach.  It must be a very difficult job.  One never knows precisely who one's friends are.  I would imagine it must be a most unhappy experience to try to encourage the job creation area and find one or more of one's colleagues getting the public mind ready for major financial cutbacks, despite their expectations that the Government had the answers to the job problem.  I do not gloat over the fact that the Government Party are failing lamentably to achieve even the modest job targets they set&mdash;those targets were based on an accepted level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies here from all parts of the country and most of them travel to this assembly every week.  As they do so they must see the vast potential need for jobs in all the towns and villages they pass.  Yet we turn our hand on the human services and on this social need.  We tell our young girls that if they want to do nursing they must go abroad because we do not have room in our hospitals while, at the same, our old people are dying alone.  These are the areas that are being frowned on by some members of the Government.  I do not believe that this is the thinking of the whole Government, but if it is it shows a very narrow and unhappy social wisdom with major inbuilt implications not just for jobs but for the peace and harmony of this country in the future. That very limited vision must be radically revised and overhauled.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the area for which the Minister is primarily responsible, industrial harmony, is very important. I do not attribute to him exclusively or even largely the area of job creation. I suspect he would not be unhappy if the Opposition and the public generally did not do that over the next number of years either.  He is the Minister for Labour, and that implies to any normal thinking person <Col N="1906" /> that labour relations, industrial peace and harmony and the fostering of an industrial relations environment which is conductive to high productivity, happy employment, fulfilled workers and all associated ideas, is the area for which he should accept primary responsibility.</P>
    <P>We continually moan about the low productivity of an Irish worker.  We talk about our high absenteeism rate and say we suffer from all kinds of industrial problems.  We recognise and accept there are difficulties in this regard.  We have a responsibility, and the Minister for Labour has a very challenging responsibility, to ask ourselves the basic reasons for this malaise.  Is there a reason why the Irish worker is less productive?  Of course there is a reason, if it can be shown that he or she produces less than his or her neighbours.  One of the main reasons is that we have not really accepted in our thinking that we should have real industrial democracy. I do not mean the nominal placing of a statutory director from the workshop at boardroom level.  I mean a genuine industrial democracy which would allow for sharing of real wealth, real profits and real responsibilities of companies, which would encourage and foster a major new leap-forward in ensuring that the now out-moded attitude of the industrial scene as being workers versus management or <i>vice versa</i> was killed once and for all.  In that direction industrial chaos looms more and more.  A great deal of that thinking&mdash;the thinking of them and us&mdash;is responsible for much of the real problems we are experiencing.</P>
    <P>We still have incredible conditions attaching to our employees in this day and age.  As late as three hours ago I spoke to two young ladies employed by Dublin Corporation as playground managers.  Their jobs, like many others, are part time, temporary, with no sick pay.  Their jobs can be terminated at an hour's notice.  They have no pension rights and no status.  These jobs give no respect to the workers. These people have been employed for the last seven years and their work is not part time or temporary.  They have been employed for nearly a decade <Col N="1907" /> and work on average up to 40 hours a week.  There is no excuse for retaining employees in the undignified and dissent-breeding conditions in which these workers are employed, and it is only symptomatic of many other similar type employees around the country.</P>
    <P>For example, library assistants in some cases suffer the same fate.  I know one library assistant who was employed as sole libarian in a country town and has been employed on a temporary and part-time basis for 3 years.  Two years ago her salary was £16 a week and she worked five evenings a week until 8 o'clock.  Her young niece started work in the local supermarket and came home with more money.  I suspect this type of approach is rife. It should be noted that in the two examples I have quoted the employers were local authorities, not the private entrepreneur who often, in some people's eyes, is like a horned toad and can do no right although they, too, are responsible for a fair amount of exploitation.</P>
    <P>On the Industrial Safety Bill earlier this week we heard that there were enormous numbers of people injured every year because their employment conditions were extremely unsatisfactory, injurious to health and could not be tolerated.  How can you expect people working in these conditions, who have been conditioned to believe that unless they are employed they are parasites, who accept a job as if it were a charity and who are reluctant to complain about conditions in case they are dismissed, to give everything they have, to believe it is one for all and all for one?  The first response of a major company to any suggestion of economic contraction will be that workers will be put on protective notice. They are pushed nearer the ledge, to be pushed over if the company wills it. In other words, they are seen as a temporary economic asset which can be dispensed with if the mood catches the board of directors, many of whom are not even resident in, or knowledgeable about, this country.</P>
    <P>If we are to make any progress in industrial relations and I did not see <Col N="1908" /> a new approach to this in the Estimate &mdash;we must have a gigantic leap forward in relation to genuine industrial democracy, real sharing, not the nominal figurehead stuff we have been seeing in recent years.  We will have to ensure that workers are intrinsically a part of a company sharing in all the rights, responsibilities and perks.  It must be infuriating to the young girls employed as secretaries in some of these jobs and doing the jobs of the directors, while these directors are enjoying conditions of employment including expense accounts and other perks which would be all right if they applied to everybody, and as often as not they are not in their offices.  It would be scandalous if a secretary, one of the junior employees or one of the shop floor people, were in two or three minutes late, but when the boss is not back from lunch at four o'clock nothing is said.</P>
    <P>This attitude of seeing industrial society as two nations must stop.  There is no point in the bosses who are in that situation pretending that they will include a nominal director to ensure worker representation.  That is only a charade.  It shows no respect for the worker.  To carry on this attitude will achieve nothing and will increase industrial disharmony.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of our State and semi State organisations such as CIE, surely it is possible to ensure that the workers have a real say at board room level instead of their being dictated to and instead of their hearing about new conditions too late to allow for minimum consultation.  The day has gone when the workers will accept that type of action.  They are entitled to a share of this earth and management should be restructured to ensure that they get their rights.  If we continue in the old way we will continue with enormous numbers of unofficial strikes and so on which betray not that workers are irresponsible but that they are working in a situation which, because of the regular provocation, is liable to sudden eruptions, which do not allow for tedious negotiation.  In relation to the post office situation we found that minor requests were being discussed over a period of years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> If the Minister considered having a full investigation and a funding of research for a totally new and wide dimension of genuine industrial democracy he might come closer to ensuring a generation of industrial peace.  Anything less will not work. The worker is intelligent and responsible and is as often as not a married person with a family to support and he is not liable to fly off the handle at the slightest provocation.  The person who goes on strike does so only after serious consideration.  The workers should be treated with respect.</P>
    <P>We are all workers but standards are different depending on what level one operates at.  The differing standard is an indication of an attitude to class and to society which is no longer consistent with the enlightenment of the age we are now living in and it will not work.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of jobs and unemployment there is a clear lesson to be learned from the international and domestic unemployment tragedy which so far has been almost universally ignored.  Because of the social and economic basis on which the Government operate they are the party least suited to making progress in this area.  The old <i>laissez faire</i> approach to economics, hoping that independent economies will in some spontaneous way by their interaction create enough jobs on the day, is no longer adequate and is increasingly failing.  Particularly vulnerable in this ailing tradition of massive Government incentive, which is basically a form of subsidising labour and profits, are the smaller economies such as Ireland's.  In the Minister's constituency the IDA were willing to put forward £50 million to try to win about 800 jobs in the Ford factory but it did not work because somebody else bid higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The jobs in this case, based on a policy of industrial incentive to companies abroad and to local entrepreneurs, did not materialise for one reason or another.  I can only surmise that the reason was that the price paid elsewhere was higher.  With the increasing technology of the age this will become more and more evident. Yet the irony is that with a relatively small economy and population we cannot provide the basic needs, jobs, housing and proper conditions of employment. The Government of the day are responsible for all those things.</P>
      <P>We have a major employment problem and the Minister for Labour is one of the Ministers responsible. Apparently, from the figures and facts that I spent hours trying to garner it transpires that we have the worst employment record in Europe.  Young people account for approximately 42 per cent of the unemployment, the average incidence being three times as great as among the 25 to 64 age group.  In the seven largest OECD countries there are almost six million young people listed as being unemployed. In the EEC alone there are three and-a-half million people in a similar predicament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is feeling the brunt of this, like every other country.  I am not trying to pretend that in the last nine or ten months since the Government came into office things have deteriorated because of their coming into office.  I am not trying to blame any Government or any Minister, because I believe the pattern, the way of thinking about economics and job creation, is at fault.  But this Government are showing all the signs of not <Col N="1912" /> having the knowledge or the vision to revise their basic thinking in this regard.  If we are to comprehend the new social order which is emerging, the primary characteristic of which is a change from an industrial society to a technological one, we must learn that the old narrow thinking will have to go.  We will have to take account of the vast impacts of trans-global flows of money, of men and ideas. We will have to meet a total new challenge to our society.</P>
    <P>Providing incentives for employment is fine.  If you open a jar of jam or of honey in the summer, wasps will be attracted to it but if you provide the same incentive in the middle of winter there will not be any wasps because the climate has changed radically here and we have not realised it.  No matter how many incentives we provide we are doing so under false assumptions, first that it is the responsibility of the private sector to create jobs.  That is untrue. Their primary interest is to create profit and that and job creation by no means can be synchronised, and the sooner the Government realise that the better.</P>
    <P>The second thing is that profits of companies have increased substantially. The benefits they are getting from public funds in relation to schemes to create jobs has increased substantially.  But the numbers of jobs have not increased because, of course, the employer, and I do not blame him, at the first opportunity will turn to technology, to capital intensive industries instead of employment intensive industries, when he gets the opportunity.  That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>We have not realised fully that the old order is changing and that there will never be a return to the scene of hordes of workers heading like drones into the factories of the Industrial Revolution.  That has gone forever. That being the case, we should be asking many questions which we are not asking.  For example, is the future hopeless?  I do not think so.  There is an infinite volume of work but we should not rely on the private sector <Col N="1913" /> exclusively, whose primary concern is profit, and not people, to produce jobs which do not have high monetary reward.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves whether the prospect of creating jobs in the old traditional sense, the sense the Minister for Economic Planning and Development talked about, is a myth. We do not distinguish between creating a job and creating toil, and there is a distinction.  I have not heard any Minister expressing concern about creating the right kind of jobs.  The rush is to create the old type of jobs for the people now coming on stream, those leaving schools, those who are out of jobs, that is a futile exercise.  If such jobs were useful or necessary any longer they would not have gone out of existence.</P>
    <P>We had the clarion call about full employment in Fianna Fáil's preelection manifesto.  The Government party committed themselves to a certain number of jobs to be created. But no matter how they juggle with statistics or fiddle with the register of unemployed, the truth is&mdash;and the people on the dole now know it&mdash;that the jobs are not being created.  The saddest part is not that they are not being created but that the Government are not honest enough to admit it and to take the necessary remedial action.</P>
    <P>This using of the unemployed as election bait is a disservice to the unemployed, to the young who look with hope to the future of democracy, and a disservice to the rest of us because it degrades men.  If politicians looked into their hearts they would accept that the time has come to accept this and to consider an alternative to the full employment situation as we used to know it.  The Industrial Revolution is giving way to a technological revolution.  In my constituency the port of Dublin 11 or 12 years ago employed 160 men to move 20,000 tons of cargo.  Containerisation and fork lift trucks now ensure that the same cargo can be moved by 11 people.  Are containerisation and fork lift trucks therefore bad?  Should we call a halt, put our finger in the dyke and pretend this is not a good thing?  We should not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> We should understand that man was not born to be a beast of burden.  If technology and science show us a new way to do the old toilsome jobs, that is a good thing.  Where it fails, and where we are failing, is that we do not realise that the new challenge of the unemployed needs a new answer, but there is not an attempt being made to find that new answer.  The jobs in the traditional sense are not there and they never again will be.  Therefore a whole new definition of &ldquo;employment&rdquo; is necessary if we want to combat the traumatic social effects of increasing degradation and the stigma that attaches to people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister why it is that an unfortunate man who through no fault of his own but through the operation of economic market forces finds himself out of a job and does the daily dull grind of door to door, factory to factory looking for work, eventually winds up without hope, self respect or dignity should be considered a parasite, less than his peers, because he was not able to afford a white shirt or did not know a slick friend who would get him into a job?  We have more than 100,000 people of this order in our society and the future for them is a large vacuum.  If they were to believe the politicians and statisticians they have no future&mdash;they are a drain on the rest of us to be shunned by us. Their children will no longer have pride in them because they are not as good as parents down the street who have jobs.</P>
    <P>Why is that so?  It is because the way we have approached the whole job creation jungle traditionally has become outmoded.  These men are not parasites.  They are a resource but there is nobody who has the imagination so to regard them.  God knows there is enough work on which to use them. I do not refer to piecework, public work breaking stones, cutting wood, making roads.  I am concerned primarily with urban areas and our biggest need is to stave off from our people alienation, loneliness, isolation.</P>
    <P>Our answer is a massive programme of environmental standard improvements to get rid of the dereliction and <Col N="1915" /> the blight that are like cancers in our community.  People are the answer and people we have, but not jobs, imagination or vision.  That is because we have been thinking in terms of output, productivity, commercial profit&mdash;profit and loss all the time, a set of books at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I suggest a new definition of &ldquo;employment&rdquo; is needed.  Employment means that a person is used or employed in work which is noble, useful to society, fulfilling to the individual and which has the dignity of the human being at its base.  Many of the jobs that we are trying frenetically to create at any cost with a cricket score mentality are the opposite to what we should be trying to create and as soon as the first economic storm blows or as soon as the price is raised elsewhere they will collapse like a pack of cards despite the massive investment and the tax-free concessions on profits.  We will have to continue to improve the production of this kind of job because there will always be a need for the traditionally productive job.  The Government, the IDA, the Opposition and anybody else who try to help in this area are not to be commended if they can succeed.  I am saying that that narrow pathway and the fruits of this approach in terms of numbers of jobs will no longer suffice to answer the enormous demographic problems being created by the numbers out of work and those who will look for work in the future.  These young people will leave school and they will demand a stake in the community.</P>
    <P>Many of the top global companies have demonstrated that catering for the entire human family no longer presents a major technical problem.  It can be done fairly easily.  We are moving towards such a situation and I would ask the Minister to consider that fact.  Sometimes when we talk about long-term programmes we mean a fiveyear span.  What is long term about five years?  What about the future of our children and grandchildren?  We have a right to be concerned about that.  What will happen when 50 million people will be able to look after the rest of the population of 2,950 million because of improved <Col N="1916" /> technology and scientific progress? Will we be still in some corner of the globe trying to build outdated factories with warehouse-type jobs, on assembly lines that no longer mean anything, producing nothing except bored employees and monetary profit which has long since lost its meaning?  That is a relevant question and it is at the heart of the Minister's concern with job creation, although it was not spelled out in the Estimate speech.</P>
    <P>There will always be a need to create new jobs, both as we know them now and in a different way.  I want every resource of the State put in that direction.  That does not mean that we should exclude the possibility that the numbers we talk about will never again be there because science, the population explosion, demographic trends and technology indicate that this is not on any longer.  I am only asking for an honest acceptance that the scenario I have outlined is a possibility. I believe it to be a certainty. But, if we accept that, it may be a possibility at least of a beginning.</P>
    <P>The distinction between toil and work has not been clearly understood by the Government.  Toil is work that diminishes the human being.  Essentially it is exploiting because it treats man as a unit, as a number and it tosses him on the scrap heap when it has squeezed him dry, and sometimes even earlier than that if it suits the toilcreating entrepreneur.</P>

      <P>The picture I am trying to paint, which is fundamental, is that we are not facing up to the need to create jobs in a new way.  Nobody can deny that the job opportunities are there.  The present emphasis on industrial expansion is all very well, and it will yield some results, but at best it is only a partial answer.  We must encourage the move towards industrial harmony as well as we can to ensure that workers are as satisfied and happy as they can be.  We must also understand that it has certain obligations and responsibilities and part of these obligations is a new approach to industrial democracy that will employ profit-sharing and the ownership or part ownership of factories and companies by the workers.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the shift from the industrial society and the blue collar worker to the white collar worker has not been fully understood in the Estimate before the House.  This transition from factory to technology will have a major fall-out in terms of the numbers out of work.  I should like the Minister to concern himself in a new way with the dimensions of this problem.  Obviously he will have to do this in conjunction with some of his colleagues, notably the Minister for Economic Planning and Development whose recent soundings in this area have been most distressing.  In contravention of what the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour and other Ministers have said, apparently we are to witness cutbacks in fundamental areas of social and human need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Even in the fairly constricted dimension of job creation with which the Minister for Labour is concerned, I should like to quote from a book entitled <i>The Service Society and the Consumer Vanguard</i> as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continuous industrial growth is leading to unemployment and <Col N="1919" /> under-utilisation of people.  By contrast, growth in the human services will lead to the fullest such utilisation. A balanced ecological society does not call for lack of growth but rather a shift to the human services.</P>
    <P>In this area of human services&mdash;by which I mean an area that involves a substantial investment of people in the area of human need&mdash;would the Minister recommend this to his colleagues as an area of enormous job potential?  In our cities and towns there are old people some of whom will die alone, but yet there are young people on street corners waiting for jobs.  Young girls have to leave the country to go nursing.  We have geriatrics in old people's homes.  We have families under stress in a way that did not happen before.  There is a need for a social care network that is unprecedented.</P>
    <P>In the education area we constantly decry the pupil-teacher ratio.  We decry underinvestment in the housing area. In many other associated areas there is the exciting, exhilarating challenge of putting people into useful roles&mdash; not just the temporary, assembly-line type of jobs, which apparently it is now fashionable to talk about creating and which in a very short time will prove to be counterproductive, will lead to more workers being disgruntled and more problems for the Minister for Labour, who has enough problems at the moment.  The right kind of job and its usefulness to society is very important, but this is getting very little consideration by the Government and in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to draw up a national programme for the development of our resources&mdash;mineral, land and sea.  We are told fairly reliably that there are about three-and-a-half million acres of derelict land in the country, sites which are not being used.  Could the Minister not look to this area in relation to getting new jobs?  There is a need for decent services in our community, social services, innovations in education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I do that I shall have to do it on the note that the brief of the Minister for Labour is illequipped and ill-designed to deal with the major problems confronting us in the employment sector.  The structuring of government and the ordering of business in this House does not allow a trans-departmental approach to the question of creating jobs.  I am confined here to dealing in a very narrow way with a problem which is far from narrow and has its roots in many of the Departments of Government which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle says I am referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am saying to the Deputy that the speech he is making would be appropriate, for instance, to the budget debate or an adjournment debate.  When you are dealing with an Estimate you must remain with what that Minister is responsible for and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point, but I am trying to assist the Minister to find ways and means to create jobs.  If that is out of order then I think we should pack our bags and go home. When we consider that there are many people hungry and without homes, that there is a massive problem of social alienation of many kinds and that we still have a job problem, it is obvious we have not got the equation right.  I do not care what Department or what Estimate that is appropriate to.</P>
      <P>The Estimate of the Department of Labour does not embody a basic sense of philosophic vision in relation to employment.  It only deals with the economics of the Department of Labour and does not deal in a real way with its role in the community, its function in creating jobs.  If it did it would embody some thought relating to the kind of ideas I have been trying to put forward, despite the harassment I have been under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Wealth&rdquo; is an interesting word. What does it mean?  Why does increased <Col N="1921" /> production not lead to increased wealth among the ordinary people?  Growth around the world has been improving on an average of 5 per cent or 6 per cent.  This should mean that people would have real wealth of an increased order of 5 or 6 per cent per annum.  In the western countries the ordinary man in the street should be five times wealthier this year than he was last year.</P>
    <P>Is that happening?  Profits are going up, but is the man in the street, the man who goes on a lightning strike, the man about whom the Minister is concerned, twice as wealthy every 20 years?  Colleges and institutions, hospitals and schools should be twice as wealthy, but they are not because we have not grasped the idea that the wealth of our nation belongs to all the people.  The Department of Labour have a responsibility to ensure a very fundamental revision of thought in relation to the way in which wealth and resources are allocated.  As the Department of Labour are presently structured and with the limitations placed on them by other Ministers, who seek to be the dominant luminaries on the economic landscape, they are not equipped to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>We have an increasing number of people out of work despite the best efforts of everybody.  I wish the Minister every success in trying to combat the problem; but, for some of the reasons I have tried to hint at I do not believe we are on the right track. We face the prospect of millions of people unemployed.  It is not too much to ask the Government to face up to the enormous social implications of this for the health of our community, people in jobs, industrial relations and for the very order of our society.  If this vast pool of people are allowed to languish unemployed the result will be more people disgruntled and we will eventually have a situation leading to incipient revolution.</P>
    <P>I am sure strikes are a major concern of the Minister.  I do not have a monopoly of wisdom about that except to say that a strike takes place only after serious thought.  The impression is being given by the Government&mdash;I wonder if it is being <Col N="1922" /> deliberately fostered&mdash;that the source of trouble in regard to strikes is the unions.  I do not propose to deliver a lecture on the origins of trade unionism, even if it was in order.  The whole philosophy, the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the trade union movement is a reaction to the excess of capitalist exploitation.  The momentum is still there because the exploitation is still there.  The abuse of people still exists in our cities and towns.  As long as that continues trade unions will be healthy and will flourish.  I do not share the attitude of the Government to trade unions, seeing them, apparently, as a bit of a nuisance, the attitude of threatening that, unless they tighten their belts, remedial action will be taken.  That is a reasonable interpretation of the attitude of some Ministers in recent times, of the Minister for Finance and others, and the Minister for Labour will therefore have an increasingly difficult job if the big stick is now to be wielded over the trade unions.  I would ask him to consider seriously whether or not he is in a sense being set up because, if the present thinking and the present trend continue, what will undoubtedly happen is that there will be a major confrontation between Government and the unions in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that my colleagues on the opposite benches, having listened attentively to what I have had to say, will have learned something. The few ideas I have put forward were seriously meant.  I had no intention of being either provocative or unhelpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Members for their contributions and to say that the many serious and sincere points made will be seriously considered. Some political points were made and some of them I will have to reply to in order to correct the wrong impressions given by some speakers. The two main features referred to were employment and industrial relations.  Other functions of the Department did not seem to merit the same attention.  Undoubtedly unemployment is the greatest problem <Col N="1923" /> for us as a nation but, in the time at my disposal now, I could not deal adequately with the matter.  I shall do so when the debate resumes.</P>
      <P>I should like to correct an impression conveyed this morning&mdash;by Deputy Kerrigan, I think&mdash;because of certain inferences drawn from my speech, inferences which are without foundation. I endorse what he said about the majority of Irish workers.  It is something I myself have said many, many times.  The vast majority of Irish workers move along smoothly each day.  They make their contribution very quietly.  It is a most important contribution and, as I say, the vast majority working in Irish industry move ahead without difficulty.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kerrigan also referred to the importance of the personnel function. Again I endorse what he said.  It is a most important function.  I think it was Deputy Keating, in one of the few moments when he touched on the Estimate, who referred to instant solutions. There are no instant solutions in industrial relations.  Industrial relations are the result of hard work on both sides directed towards setting up satisfactory grievance procedures and good negotiating machinery.  The personnel function is deserving of more attention and it is now achieving the importance it deserves with the result that we now have the excellent performance to which I referred.  There is need for improvement.  Some speakers seemed to think there was no room for improvement. There is room and there is need for improvement.  I am surprised that only one speaker referred to the setting up of the Commission on Industrial Relations.  I believe this is a substantial advance.  The commission is manned by experienced practitioners who have served their apprenticeships and know the problems of industrial relations.  I look forward to this body improving in the long term our industrial relations structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the Labour Court.  Some people suggested changing the concept of the court.  I join with those who paid tribute to the Labour Court for the part it has played over a long period of years.  It has made a wonderful contribution to industrial <Col N="1924" /> relations.  However, after more than 30 years in operation, it is time now to review the functions of the court, and how it operates, to find out whether or not there should be some changes made.  I am asking the Commission on Industrial Relations to give me an interim report on the Labour Court and its functions</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that once again&mdash;this matter has been raised on several occasions in recent months&mdash;this party's spokesman on transport and communications has been compelled to avail of the facilities of this House to draw the attention of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the continuing serious situation in the telecommunications sector of his Department.  I sought permission to raise this matter because of a number of very serious problems which have arisen over the past few days despite the fact that we have just suffered a prolonged telecommunications dispute extending over several months, the longest in the history of the Post Office.  Despite the fact that that dispute terminated some few weeks ago, the situation as late as this week and as late as yesterday is worse in some cases than it was during the recent prolonged dispute.</P>
      <P>It was reasonable to expect that, in the weeks since the termination of the dispute, positive, determined action would have been taken to restore to normality the services which were put out of order or disrupted during the strike.  One would have expected that the Minister would have urged his Department to pull out all the stops, to get the maximum number of technicians working the maximum amount of overtime possible to restore the services.  What do we find?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to two very serious matters which have been brought to my attention in the past 24 hours about which the Minister is aware perhaps. I want to refer to the situation in Cork city and the situation in Aer Lingus. <Col N="1925" /> In the past 24 hours I received numerous telephone calls, but I will not give the gist of them.  I want to describe the situation in Cork as it is described in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> today:</P>
    <P>After one of the most frustrating days in the history of the telecommunications service there were mounting fears last night of a mass walk-out at the Cork telephone exchange where operators claim that they have been bearing the brunt of abuse from frustrated subscribers for a situation which is entirely outside their control.</P>
    <P>Subscribers in Cork found it virtually impossible to make trunk calls yesterday and there were instances where it took hours to get through to local numbers.</P>
    <P>Lines to Dublin, in particular, became over-loaded and operators could not be contacted due to faults at the exchange.</P>
    <P>At 1.30 p.m. 300 subscribers had calls booked to Dublin and there was a delay of up to two hours.</P>
    <P>I went to the trouble today to check out some of this.  The situation in Cork is very bad.  Equipment is faulty in the exchange and, apparently, necessary repairs have not been carried out.  What disturbed me most of all, and what led me to raise this matter on the Adjournment, is that I understand&mdash;and I want the Minister to clarify this; as I already said one would expect that all the stops would have been pulled out to restore services to normal as quickly as possible; that there would be unlimited overtime, and so on&mdash;there was no overtime the first week after the dispute, there was limited overtime the second week and, in the current week, there is still limited overtime.  Whereas normally workers could work as many hours as they felt they were able to, a limit has now been imposed on the amount of overtime technicians and engineers can work.  If this is a fact, it is appalling.</P>
    <P>I do not have to describe the frustration, the delays, the failure, and so on, of the telephone service in Cork.  I quote again from <i>The Cork Examiner:</i></P>
    <P>Equipment at the exchange is in a bad state of repair.  The telephonists' <Col N="1926" /> boards are defective and lines in are not lighting at all.</P>
    <P>It goes on to describe the various problems. I also have reports from the west, the north-west, and various other parts of the country.  I am particularly concerned about the computer bureau at Furbo in Connemara which was set up during my period as Minister for the Gaeltacht with a substantial State investment. Prior to my departure from office I approved a merger with a similar type computer operation in Shannon. We now have one of the most modern, most advanced and most sophisticated computer operations outside of Dublin with the marriage of the Galway and the Shannon computers. Modern computer services are heavily dependent on Post Office lines for the transmission of data and so on. The computer operation at Furbo, in which I have deep personal interest, was gravely handicapped, obviously, during the strike, and is still having problems.</P>
    <P>In addition to being Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the Minister is also Minister for Tourism and Transport. I was appalled and shocked&mdash;I could hardly believe it&mdash;when I was informed last evening of the situation Aer Lingus had to contend with over the past three days in Dublin Airport and in all their offices.  Due to a fault in the main cable linking the airport, they were compelled for the past three days to operate their computer reservation system, their telephone system and their entire telecommunications system on one-third of their normal link capacity.  I saw a statement in another paper, which I have not been able to confirm, that only one of the eight lines linking the airport was in operation. It was stated by a spokesman for Aer Lingus that only one-third of their links are in operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has responsibility for tourism and transport and also for Aer Lingus.  It is bad enough to have this breakdown but, up to last night, no effort had been made to repair the fault in a vital area in a vital service. We are now into the tourist season. We must also bear in mind that recently there was a fairly prolonged industrial dispute in Aer Lingus which <Col N="1927" /> caused obvious problems for the airline. I want the Minister to inform us what has been happening since the resumption of work.  Has there been a restriction on overtime?  What is the reason for the delay in rectifying the fault?  I understand 10,000 or 12,000 telephones are out of order and I do not expect every telephone to be operational in a couple of weeks after a prolonged strike.</P>
    <P>As I said, we have this appalling situation in Cork city, our second city, and the appalling situation in Aer Lingus where they have a reservation service linking their offices all over the world.  They are vitally dependent on this telecommunications link for their business.  I cannot understand why this has been allowed to go on for three days with no effort made to repair the fault.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious dimension in relation to Aer Lingus.  In addition to providing their own computer reservation system linked with their offices abroad and with tour operators and travel agencies at home and abroad, Aer Lingus also have very valuable contracts with overseas airlines. These contracts are very good revenue earners for our national airline. Aer Lingus are providing computer reservation facilities for at least two airlines of which I am aware.  There may be more.  What will those airlines think&mdash;having suffered through the telecommunications dispute for months &mdash;of this situation at Dublin Airport when we are almost at the peak of the tourist season?</P>
    <P>I understand some industrial action has been taken in the international telephone exchange in Dublin in the past few days.  I have not got the details.  As well as emphasising the points which have been brought to my notice&mdash;I feel I should do so, and this is the place to do it and have them discussed openly&mdash;I am gravely concerned about the overall situation and about certain signs, symptoms and indications which have been emerging over the past week of the possibility of another serious breakdown or another serious industrial relations dispute affecting the telecommunications service. This evening week I questioned <Col N="1928" /> the Minister about the Government's intention regarding the setting up of an independent telecommunications service and this matter was adverted to by the Taoiseach when addressing the Chamber of Commerce in Dublin the previous day.  The Minister did not give me any information but told me that the matter was being looked into.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis the Minister must take the major share of the blame for the prolonging of the telecommunications dispute and for the worsening situation that has emerged in the last few days.  The Minister and his Minister of State must pull out all the stops to settle this matter to ensure the restoration of normal services as quickly as possible.  Where an emergency arises, such as that which occurred yesterday in Cork, there should be a task force available to carry out the necessary repairs.  The restoration of normal service is the immediate problem and, consequently, I ask the Minister to indicate whether he made any progress in recent weeks or reached any decision with a view to implementing a new industrial relations structure in the Department.</P>

This problem has been with us for months and the Minister is conspicuous by his apparent inactivity in the matter.  No action is being taken to restore the disrupted services and there is no evidence of any new thinking on the part of the Minister or the Government in relation to this problem.  I urge on the Minister the desirability of setting up immediately an independent mission to examine the whole shebang.</P>

They are the relevant questions and we want the answers from the Minister.

Why has there not been any significant improvement in the telephone situation?</P>

      <P>The Minister of State will get his turn, if he is permitted.  Is the Minister preventing the technicians <Col N="1930" /> from working overtime?  Is that an attempt to further squeeze the IPOEU as we were led to believe he was trying to do before the strike?  Is the Minister trying to cause friction within the unions in his Department?  If he is he should stop in the interests of sanity.  The Minister should tell the House why there has not been an improvement in this service and what role he has played in keeping down the level of overtime.  We are not asking for overtime over and above the norm, although that would be justified in a post-dispute situation.  We are only asking for the observance of normal overtime in order that subscribers and those waiting for telephones are given back the service which they have been deprived of for so long mainly because of the refusal of the Minister to enter into consultations at an early date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first of all to say that I quite accept that the telecommunications services are not yet back to normal.  I much regret the difficulties and inconvenience being experienced by the users of the services.  I <Col N="1931" /> must, however, remind the House that the industrial action by the engineering staff lasted for some thirteen weeks during which normal maintenance attention could not be given to the telephone system in many areas, particularly in key areas such as the Dublin trunk exchanges.  During the period when normal day-to-day maintenance attention was not being given, it was inevitable that there would be a run-down of the system and that, when the staff resumed duty, there would be a big backlog of faults to be cleared. Additionally, of course, the system needs attention on an ongoing basis. In these circumstances, it must be obvious that it would take time to restore the system to its full working capacity.  This was made clear by the Department on the resumption of work.</P>
      <P>Despite this it was, I suppose, understandable that expectations of an early improvement in service should build up once work was resumed.  People who refrained from making calls during the strike seem to have resumed their normal calling patterns.  In any event, there has been a very substantial increase in call attempts.  This has been a major contributory factor to the heavy pressures experienced on the telephone system recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the ending of the dispute the main concentration of effort has been on repairs to the local automatic exchanges, to the trunk equipment and operator switchboards and to large subscriber cables.  In tackling the faults, top priority was given to restoring telephone lines to hospitals and other emergency services and normal working for these lines was restored within a matter of days after resumption.  The local automatic service has been restored to normal virtually everywhere. Progress has been made, too, with restoration of trunk exchanges and STD equipment and with repairs to operator switchboards but there is still a lot of faulty equipment to be repaired. The position as regards faults on subscribers lines and installations is that all the large subscriber cables which were unattended to at the end of the dispute have now been restored to service <Col N="1932" /> and, in all, over 50 per cent of faulty telephone lines have been restored.</P>
    <P>This is a very brief simple statement which does not fully reflect what has been achieved.  The reality is that a vast amount of detailed, time-consuming work has been performed by many technicians over the last fortnight or so.  As I mentioned earlier, there was a backlog of over three months work to be overtaken when normal work was resumed in addition to the current day-to-day work, and much work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>On the telex side, a considerable number of subscribers are still without service.  Some subscribers are experiencing congestion on some internal routes during peak traffic periods and on routes to Britain and other countries. The deterioration in the service to Britain and beyond was caused by a fault on a number of the trunk circuits serving the international telex exchange.  Work on repairing this fault is in progress.  For many telex subscribers, the service to Britain and other countries is normal.</P>
    <P>On the telephone side there are also some subscribers still without service, although substantial progress has been made.  The internal STD system is congested but, again, there have been significant improvements in some areas.  Operator services in a number of centres, including Cork, Limerick, Mullingar, Drogheda and Dundalk, and the central telephone exchange are under very heavy pressure.  There is delay in answering callers, and in some areas the delays are heavy.</P>
    <P>I am aware that telephonists in Cork and in some other centres have been concerned over their inability to give the public the standard of service the telephonists would wish.  I can understand the telephonists' feelings and sympathise with them.  We are all anxious to see normal services restored to the public as quickly as possible and I would like to assure the House and the public that the inability to provide a good service in these centres is not due in any way to lack of effort on the part of the telephonists.  They are trying very hard indeed in quite difficult <Col N="1933" /> circumstances and I would like them to know their efforts are appreciated.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that, over the next few weeks significant improvement in the quality of the service will become apparent, particularly in those areas where it is bad at present.  Unfortunately, repairs to individual telex and telephone installations will take longer. The best that can be said at present is that my Department are very conscious of the serious inconvenience which the absence of telephone or telex facilities cause, particularly to commercial and industrial interests, and that everything possible will be done to restore service to them as soon as possible.  Overtime is being worked and <Col N="1934" /> will continue to be worked to the maximum extent that will contribute to the restoration of service.
