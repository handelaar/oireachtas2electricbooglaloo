    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will consider issuing driving licences for category D to men who were in receipt of a full D licence when they were called up for military duty during the last emergency, in view of the fact that a licence was not needed <Col N="1596" /> to drive Army transport and that these men now find that they have to do a driving test before they can take up duties in civilian life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Road Traffic Acts, any person seeking a driving licence for vehicles of a particular class is required to take the appropriate driving test before a licence may be granted, unless he held such a licence within the preceding five years. There is no statutory provision for exemption from this requirement by virtue of Army driving experience. The matter has been raised on several occasions since the driving test was introduced and is at present the subject of further consultation between my Department and the Department of Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that some facility should be made available to such people in the Army periodically to afford them an opportunity of ensuring that they would have a licence when they come out?  On occasion, they miss a civilian job because they have not a driver's licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, my Department are at present having discussions with the Department of Defence.  When the Act was drawn up no provision was made for the exclusion of Army drivers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the regulations that are in existence governing the transport of hazardous chemicals on this country's roads; and if he is satisfied that county councils have the proper facilities and staff to deal with an emergency for the protection of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision for regulation of transport of dangerous substances is contained in the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, which is the concern of the Minister for Labour.  It it a matter for the individual local authorities to arrange to deal with any <Col N="1597" /> emergency that might arise involving them.  My Department have encouraged the making of suitable arrangements and have advised local authorities in relation to the transport of certain dangerous substances by CIE.  I might mention also that my Department are at present arranging for a seminar on the role of local authorities in incidents that might arise from transport of hazardous substances.  The seminar is intended for the senior technical officers of local authorities and is expected to take place next month.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Building Society Profits.</Title>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he considers that the 126 per cent increase in the recently announced profits of the only publicly-quoted Irish building society is in the public interest generally; and, in particular, if it is compatible with the needs of house purchasers; and, if he will examine the current financial affairs of all building societies with a view to reducing costs, profitability, and mortgage rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that in the interests of investors with, and borrowers from, the society in question, which is the only building society in Ireland whose shares are quoted on the stock exchange, it is necessary to put the position in proper perspective.</P>
      <P>The society was founded in 1864 and, for more than 100 years past its shares have been quoted on the stock exchange.  However, no investment shares have been issued since 1952 and the investment shares quoted represented, at the end of 1977, only £305,000 out of the total of £22,878,000 capital then invested with the company.  The dividend paid on the market value of the investment shares was less than 7 per cent, tax paid, in respect of 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other building societies, this company does not aim to make profits in the accepted commercial sense.  Surpluses accruing to building societies, after payment of interest to investors, taxation, management and other expenses, are put to reserve to finance further house purchase loans and to meet any unforeseen losses that may arise&mdash;for example, through default by borrowers or depreciation of investments.  The societies do not endeavour to maximise their surpluses but to maintain them at a reasonable level in relation to their rate of growth.  The grant last <Col N="1599" /> year of trustee status to certain building societies, including the company referred to in this question was subject to the maintenance of an adequate reserve ratio.  The increase last year over 1976 in the level of the particular company's reserves has to be considered in the context that the surplus at the end of 1976 would not have been adequate to maintain the necessary reserve ratio.  The balance transferred to reserves at the end of December last had the effect of increasing them by only 0.09 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that our building societies are operating efficiently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises out of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers to the profits of a specific company. The Deputy cannot raise the whole question of building societies on one question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that building societies are doing enough to reduce their costs, thereby giving a better service to people borrowing money from them, particularly in the line of interest rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that their costs are reasonable.  For example, if one takes management expenses the building societies compare very favourably with other financial institutions in the State, including some semi-State bodies, such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  So far as I am aware their costs are reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that their costs are reasonable would he be prepared to accept that it would be in the interest of borrowers that building societies should absorb costs, such as those which they pass on to borrowers, for example, in relation to their own legal fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now getting into argument on questions not pertaining to the original one.  Deputy O'Keeffe is developing a habit of asking supplementaries on every single question on the Order Paper, and his supplementaries are not always relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Does the Minister not agree that an increase of 126 per cent in profits is an alarming one in the business of providing finance for house-building?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The transfer of the surplus of £313,622 increased the Irish Civil Service Building Society's reserves from £1,017,147 in 1977 to their present level of £1,330,767 or 5.06 per cent of the society's total liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Does the Minister not consider that it is an alarming percentage increase in profits in this type of business, and does it not suggest that there is no real competition and that there seems to be something in the nature of a ring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is anything in the nature of a ring.  Surpluses accruing to building societies after payment of interest, taxation, management costs and other expenses are put to reserve finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the 1978 tenant purchase scheme, which I announced on 23 December 1977, a tenant purchaser of a local authority house will in every case receive a discount of £1,300 from the gross price of the house.

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will consider having the new house grant paid in two instalments (1) at roof level stage and (2) when completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The £1,000 new house grant can be paid only when a house has been satisfactorily completed and is occupied for the first time as his normal place of residence by a person (or his spouse) who has never previously purchased or built a house.  In the circumstances, it would not be practicable to pay the grant in two instalments as suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Is this not a complete departure from a long-standing practice over many years of paying housing grants in two instalments, one instalment of 50 per cent when the roof was on the house and the remaining <Col N="1602" /> 50 per cent when the house was certified as complete?  Why cannot this be continued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The £1,000 grant was introduced for the benefit of the house purchaser or the young couple who would build a house.  It is payable on completion and occupancy of the house.  It is a new departure in the sense that it is payable in one sum to the house purchaser or the person who is building a house in order that they would get full benefit of the £1,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I will not comment on that beyond saying that I am not satisfied that they are getting the benefit of it.  Is it not a fact that under the supplementary grant schemes in recent years, half of the grant was paid before the person went into occupation of the house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Am I correct in saying that the supplementary grant under the old scheme was only paid if the person was in need of housing and was going to take up residence in the house, and this £1,000 grant is payable in similar conditions?  If that is so there is no reason why it cannot be paid in two instalments.  It would be a great help to the people who qualify for it to get half the grant when the roof is on and the other half when the house is finished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In a big percentage of cases where this £1,000 is payable, the people purchase houses from contractors. There are not many who build their houses by direct labour.  On the purchase of any house final payment is not due until the house is completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the Low Rise Mortgage Scheme, as notified to housing authorities, provide that where a person surrenders a local authority dwelling and seeks a loan under the scheme to erect or purchase a dwelling in an administrative area other than that in which the surrendered dwelling is situated, either local authority may make the loan.  It is however a matter for each local authority concerned to decide whether to operate the scheme and whether to make it available to applicants either surrendering or seeking to purchase a house in an administrative area other than their own.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9-12 together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the benefit of domestic derating is passed on to tenants of rented accommodation. On my instructions, local authorities have ceased levying contributions in lieu of rates in the rents of their tenants as and from 1 January 1978.</P>
      <P>As regards private rented dwellings controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts, rates, following the abolition of domestic rates, will cease to be a lawful addition to the basic rent.  Where such additions have not already been removed, it will be open to tenants of controlled dwellings to consider availing of the procedure of serving a notice on their landlords under section 13 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960 reducing their rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of other private tenancies in regard to payment of rates varies a good deal.  Some tenants have been paying rates directly and in such cases the benefit of domestic derating will pass to them directly without the <Col N="1606" /> need for special administrative or legal action.  Other tenants have been contributing less directly to payment of rates.  Generally the matter will be dealt with by appropriate provisions in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1978.</P>

      <P>My reply was not confined to the two categories mentioned by the Deputy.  I referred to the position of private tenancies other than those governed by the Rent Restrictions Act or by local authorities.  The position of such tenancies in regard to the payment of rates varies a good deal.  Some tenants have been paying rates directly.  In such cases the benefit of domestic derating will apply directly and without the need for special administrative or legal action. Other tenants have been contributing less directly to the payment of rates but that matter will be dealt with separately in the Local Government Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1966, enables a housing authority to give financial assistance <Col N="1609" /> by way of a loan, periodic contribution or guarantee to a body providing housing accommodation for elderly persons.  Section 19 of the Act provides for the payment of grants by my Department to a body providing housing accommodation for elderly persons; the local housing authority may, under section 28, pay a supplementary grant of up to the same amount in such cases.</P>
      <P>A housing authority may erect, acquire, purchase, convert or reconstruct, lease or otherwise provide dwellings for elderly and other persons in accordance with section 56.</P>
      <P>Housing authorities are required under section 60 to make schemes of letting priorities which have regard to the provision of adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons, including elderly or disabled persons, who, in their opinion, are in need of but are unable to provide such accommodation from their own resources. While I am satisfied that, in general, housing authorities have availed of their statutory powers in connection with the accommodation of elderly persons in a reasonable manner, I feel that greater efforts will be required from both the private and public sectors to meet the housing needs of elderly persons.  I have been reviewing the various financial and other incentives which are available to encourage this form of housing activity, and I hope to make an announcement on the subject when my examination of the situation has been completed.</P>

They employ as an agent the county medical officer and his office to draw up a list of priorities, but is it the Minister's Department or the Department of Health that ultimately are responsible for the drawing up of the lists and for the allocation of the houses?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he considers that in some instances the now accepted custom of accepting minimum tenders in all cases for building and design contracts in the public and private sector tends to exclude buildings with character and design which might in some cases add to the character of a city or town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence to suggest that any custom which obtains regarding acceptance of tenders in the private building sector tends to exclude buildings of character and design.</P>
      <P>Regarding the public sector, the criterion now generally applied in the awarding of contracts, in accordance with the appropriate EEC directive in this matter, is the most economically advantageous tender, and not necessarily the lowest tender.  There is no reason why decisions taken in accordance with this criterion should operate to exclude buildings of character and good design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the practice of accepting economically advantageous tenders, which seems to be a very euphemistic way of saying the cheapest, does not the Minister consider that this will tend to discourage designers and architects who would be concerned about creating a certain atmosphere or character in their buildings which would not be consistent with the minimum standards appropriate to very low tenders?  I am not asking for a Pavlovian response but I would ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The lowest tender is not always accepted.  The local council have a major involvement in the design and character of buildings in their own area.  They have the principal involvement under the Planning Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The new national rents scheme for local authority houses and flats, which was approved by the Government and came into effect on 1 February 1978, applies to Dublin Corporation in common with all other local housing authorities.  Under the scheme, which has been accepted as fair and reasonable by the National Association of Tenants' Organisations, there will be some increases in maximum differential rents and in the fixed rents of older dwellings, but there will also be reductions in the differential rents payable by tenants in the lower income groups, especially those in receipt of social welfare payments and with dependent children.  All tenants will benefit also from the elimination, as from 1 January 1978, of their liability for rates, which hitherto were collected through an appropriate increase in their weekly or monthly rents.  The assessment of rent on individual tenants is a matter for the local housing authority and I have no information about the probable overall effect of the new rents scheme on tenants of Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>Statistics were not collected in the 1971 Census in the form mentioned by the Deputy.  However, Table 15D of Volume VI of that census classifies permanent housing units by nature of occupancy for every local authority area.  This classification distinguishes between the numbers of units rented from local authority, rented unfurnished other than from local authority, rented furnished, tenant purchase or vested cottage scheme, owner-occupied and occupied free of rent.</P>
      <P>Regarding the final part of the question, the coverage of the 1979 Census will be limited to basic demographic characteristics such as age and sex and additional questions of the kind required by the Deputy will not be included in the census.</P>

      <P>Domestic rates relief will not extend to guesthouses registered under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, save in so far as any portion of a guesthouse may be used wholly for dwelling purposes.  Local authorities have however been instructed that private dwellings which otherwise would qualify for full domestic derating should not cease to be regarded as so qualifying solely by reason of <Col N="1619" /> their being used also to provide tourist accommodation.</P>
      <P>This instruction applies whether or not the houses in question are included in the non-statutory lists compiled by Bord Fáilte of town houses, country houses or farmhouses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is no practical alternative to the building of new housing estates on the perimeters of cities and towns to cater for the demand for new housing in these areas.  Only a proportion of housing needs can be met by redevelopment within existing urban centres.  I have every confidence that planning authorities generally have full regard in the discharge of their statutory functions to the long-term social and environmental implications of the building of new towns and estate on the perimeters of existing built-up areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether the Government have a view about the population and the inner city area and whether the Minister would agree that this is a trend at present which is causing serious problems on the perimeter of cities in the so-called new towns which are totally unsuited to the needs of young families.  There are many questions one could ask but I should like to know what the Minister thinks about the problem.  Finally, does the consider that a little more could be done about acquiring land in the city for the building of houses and if his Department are willing to sanction local authorities doing this?  There are three parts to the question and I should like the Minister to deal with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last part first, I presume the Deputy is a member of the corporation and it is up to them to see what land is available, to acquire it and so on.  If it means loans I have to sanction them but the corporation are the people who know where land is available in their own area.  As regards the inner city, I do not know <Col N="1625" /> how much land is available&mdash; I have no question down about that&mdash;but I would hope that the increased reconstruction grants would help some people to reconstruct houses that may not be very suitable at present.

Though I would like to see an increase in the time given to such matters, I am aware that it might have to be at the expense of other items in the school curricula and I must recognise that the degree of emphasis to be given to community and environmental projects in schools is primarily a matter for the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has any proposals for greater and more meaningful involvement by the public in the planning and development of their environments; and if he considers a greater role could be and should be created in this process for the local public who bear the major impact of the evolution of planning policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, is the principal legislation governing the area of physical planning and development. <Col N="1630" /> This legislation has recently been reviewed and amended by the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976. I consider that the existing legislation makes reasonable provision for public participation in the planning process and I have no immediate proposals to amend this legislation.  Apart from the fact that draft development plans must be publicised and that any objections or representations must be considered by the planning authority, the public have the advantage that any person may appeal against the decision of a planning authority on any development proposal for which permission is sought.  These provisions enable the public to have a very meaningful involvement in the planning and development of their environments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the role which the public have to play is a purely negative one according to his reply?  Is it not purely obstructionist in the sense that it involves appeals only?  Would the Minister consider ways and means of involving local organisations at a much earlier stage and in a much more positive way?  These organisations might like to be invited to have a say in the kind of development and planning which would have a great bearing on their community and their locality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a say.  They can object at local level apart from appealing later to An Bord Pleanála. It is open to them to do so as it is for any individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but would the Minister in the future be agreeable to involving them in a much more positive role than just objecting. which is purely negative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he intends to encourage the creation and the fostering, where they do not already exist, of community associations and residents' and tenant representative groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of bodies such as community associations, and so on is primarily a matter for local people themselves.  It would not be appropriate for me to take any direct action in the creation of such bodies.  Under existing legislation, however, county councils and county borough corporations may declare a body concerned with furthering the general social and economic interests of the inhabitants of its area to be an approved local council.  Such local authorities may then assist approved local councils by providing them with land or buildings or by giving them financial assistance.  There are also powers, under the Planning Acts, enabling planning authorities to assist in certain circumstances development associations and bodies concerned with the development or preservation of the amenities of their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider drawing up and issuing to local authorities guidelines for the encouragement of this type of local leadership in areas which are particularly in need of it by virtue of the fact that none exists there, in order to foster community life in urban areas in particular?  Where there are organisations the need is not great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 14, 22 and 77 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 enable planning authorities to assist community facilities in appropriate cases. They may assist in money or in kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make, perhaps not very well, is that where there are requests from local organisations the need is already being met.  However, there are areas which are in decay where there is no local leadership and therefore no requests for aid.  Should we as a society neglect <Col N="1632" /> that simply because people are not organised sufficiently to ask for assistance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday I made some points on various aspects of the budget.  It must be re-emphasised that the budget is in line with the election manifesto produced by Fianna Fáil prior to the general election, following a lot of in-depth work, planning and consideration as to the most appropriate way to get the country moving again.</P>
      <P>There were many problems facing the incoming Government.  We put our plans to the people and they were accepted overwhelmingly.  It was generally agreed that the most serious problem facing the Government was unemployment; it was accepted by all the parties as our greatest problem. This time last year the official unemployment figure was in the region of 119,000.  Since Fianna Fáil came to office this figure has been reduced and the job programme to create an additional 20,000 jobs before the end of the year is well on target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the main issue before the electorate.  The people were satisfied that we had produced the plans to do something constructive about employment and we received a very strong mandate to govern accordingly.  As has been said by previous speakers, the budget is based exactly on the lines of the election manifesto.  It must <Col N="1656" /> be conceded by our most ardent critics that the people have given the manifesto wide acceptance.  The Government have delivered on their promises to date according to the manifesto.  If they had not done so the people would have been justified in criticising and condemning them. Throughout the country there is a definite air of confidence in the Government. No matter where one goes one can feel it.  Of course, there are many problems still to be solved but in the wake of the Government's performance during their seven months in office the country has the confidence that was so sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the improvements granted in social welfare benefits.  There has been criticism that the increases granted were not large enough.  One can understand and have sympathy with such complaints.  No doubt all of us are aware of cases of hardship in our community.  No Deputy would object to giving more to the really needy.  The budget has set out to achieve a real increase and a better standard of living for all, particularly the social welfare recipients who are always vulnerable in a time of high inflation and rising prices.  Price stability is one of the main objectives of the budget and already we have had some success in this regard.  For the first time in many years the inflation rate has been cut to a single figure.  It can be seen that the Government's plans are working, that the spiralling price increases experienced over the last few years have slowed down considerably to what might be termed a reasonable level, if one can accept that term so far as price increases are concerned. In those circumstances a 10 per cent increase to social welfare recipients means a real increase in money values.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been very critical of the Minister's plan for financing the budget.  A borrowing requirement of 13 per cent of our GNP is exactly as envisaged in the manifesto.  It appears to be forgotten or overlooked that the borrowing of a previous Government which did nothing for the economy or for employment ran at a rate of more than <Col N="1657" /> 16 per cent.  Regarding the additional public service expenditure, it is much more acceptable and reasonable to pay people to do useful and necessary work rather than have an unproductive dole queue.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has made clear, it is the aim of the Government to finance as much as possible of our borrowing requirements from domestic sources and to keep foreign borrowing to a minimum.  Borrowing has been a very strong feature of Irish life during the years but the important point is that it should be put to constructive use.  The Government are doing this.  They have committed themselves to reducing drastically the deficit on current account and to refrain from public expenditure as much as possible.  The Government are working to an economic plan, something that was absent during the previous administration.</P>
    <P>The budget has been described as a rich man's budget, but this is nonsense. It has been framed to benefit the nation as a whole and primarily to secure work for the unemployed and for our young people.  The budget was designed to assist those who through no fault of their own are disadvantaged. Above all, it will contribute towards maintaining real increases in take-home pay.  The budget will ensure additional value for social welfare recipients by reducing further the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised to the people generally the importance of buying Irish goods.  During the years there have been many campaigns to buy Irish goods but I do not think any of them was very successful.  This is an area where everyone can contribute in a worth-while and painless manner to help in job creation.  We are all involved in this.  If we go to the super-market or to clothing or footwear shops we must keep in mind that now is the time to support Irish industry by buying Irish goods.  The Minister has said that a switch of a mere 3p in the £ in spending from foreign to home-produced goods would yield about 10,000 additional jobs over a three-year period.</P>
    <P>The public must repeatedly be told <Col N="1658" /> of those facts.  The media, television, radio and the newspapers, can play a big part here so that eventually this must arouse an awareness in the minds of people that should make the vast majority of shoppers very conscious of their real patriotism.  Much has been said about the part of the public in the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Campaign but what about the stores?  On many occasions I have been told about well-known stores in this city where shoppers were unable to purchase Irish brand goods.  The Government's efforts must be directed to the stores and buyers should be made fully aware of the Government's concern.  The answer, ultimately, is in the hands of the shoppers but I do not think that a sufficient number of people at the moment are prepared to insist on getting Irish goods or, alternatively, to leave that particular store and search elsewhere where they can get Irish goods.</P>
    <P>The budget has also put an onus on the banks to shake off their conservatism, particularly in their dealings with small business.  I feel that support should be given to those with limited resources who have previously proved their ability to be successful and likely to expand.  A business, no matter how small or large, will have to take certain risks in its everyday operations. Over the years, banks have been inclined to stand aside and examine applicants obtaining facilities on the basis of the assets they actually held. The time has now come for the banks to look to their social contributions to helping Irish people to help themselves. Other financial institutions also, such as the insurance companies, should do a lot more.  Progress has been made by some of our leading companies in projects abroad as well as at home. Various projects which come to mind include additional finance for private enterprise, housing and local community projects.</P>
    <P>The new Irish Life Centre is on the fringe of very impoverished areas in my constituency, such as Corporation Street, Seán McDermott Street and Killarney Street.  If some Deputies do not know where those areas are situated I am sure they have read about incidents which occur in those areas or <Col N="1659" /> in the immediate areas very frequently. For years those areas have been run down.  As we all know, there is a great social need and problem for many of the people living in those areas.  The consequences affect everybody directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>Some of the inner city areas are in a shambles.  This is a priority which needs much money.  It is totally unbecoming for a capital city and it is time that somebody, at national or local level, put the wheels in motion to start some re-building and to do something about the situation.</P>
    <P>It is well to emphasise the importance of the measures taken in the budget to encourage savings.  We hope that more people will have higher incomes which should go back into buying Irish and saving in Ireland.  I would have thought, for the small saver, that the amount of interest before tax is payable is long overdue for an upward adjustment.  The budget also shows confidence in Irish industry and agriculture and is designed, above all, to show confidence in the worker.</P>
    <P>The Minister calls for a response from all sectors of our economy.  As I said previously, the Opposition parties are finding the going very tough.  The budget is on the lines promised in our manifesto.  It has been very well received. I was very disappointed, in checking through the speeches of those who criticised the budget, to find that Northern Ireland was dragged in the week before last.  I would have thought that after their first great mistake in standing alongside Neave, Paisley and West in criticising the Taoiseach&mdash;Deputy Kelly later made a gallant effort to rescue the situation&mdash;the Fine Gael Party would have been much more careful and selective.  This proves that the Opposition parties are really desperate now and prepared to sacrifice any principle.  When in Government they conveniently overlooked the existence of the six Northern Counties.</P>
    <P>The challenges over the next few years for the Government are tremendous. There will no doubt be problems and setbacks.  During the first seven months in Government much has been achieved.  The Government have responded positively in carrying out to the <Col N="1660" /> letter what they said would be done in the manifesto.  It is important that confidence has been restored and it is now up to everybody to contribute in his or her own way, no matter how small, to the future of the nation.  The Government have given every encouragement in the budget.  The leadership is back and the Minister for Finance has been honest and forthright.  He said that the budget is a &ldquo;once off&rdquo;.  The rest is now up to everybody, employers, trade unions, employees.  The reins of responsibility must be firmly tightened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget has, by now, been fairly well discussed with regard to the minutiae contained in it. I do not propose to go through it in any great detail.  I just want to take a few points which strike me as not having been particularly well emphasised up to this and which I believe are important.  I would like to take a much more fundamental view of the budget which I suppose was precipitated by the interaction of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto on the one hand and the recent  White Paper on the other.  It is largely, from my point of view, a budget of missed opportunities. If I could beg the cliché I could say that never really was so little done by so many&mdash;84&mdash;for so few people.  It lacks the sense of radical vision so necessary at the moment.  As the sick economies of the so-called developed world flounder about like islands of plenty in the midst of a sea of world poverty there are great challenges facing us at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely now was the time for grasping some of the problems, for looking at them and trying to find an answer? This opportunity was not taken.  Why is it timely now to look at the basic needs of our society and to hope that a budget statement would encompass consideration of the new directions we should work towards and the new challenges which are before us?  Surely there should be some time in the affairs of a nation when a major review should take place, not just of the way we balance our books, conduct our financial affairs or of the allocation of our capital programme but of the fundamental issues affecting the life of the nation?  I believe that now is the time <Col N="1661" /> because we are at an economic cross-roads.</P>
    <P>A new Government with an unprecedented mandate could have had the sense to say that it is time for a fundamental review of the way we have been doing things.  That opportunity was not grasped.  This budget should have been like all budgets, a major social statement.  It was, instead, just another fiscal document. It should have embodied a solid social view but it does not.  If one looks at the capital programme on which the budget was drawn up it can be seen that it is like all the capital programmes going back to the beginning of the seventies and probably before then.  There are 20 main headings, always locked in the same pecking order, frozen there and subject to merely sporadic increases in investment to give the impression, I suppose, that the Government are doing something about the state of the nation.  In fact, they are really a charter by which the Government have accepted the need in relation to the budget and are in a sense masters of the Government.  The Government did not accept the possibility that there could be a totally new opportunity opening up by reviewing the pro-portionality under these various headings, by seeing in some, as opposed to others, that there is need for a totally new visionary grasp of the opportunities therein.</P>
    <P>There are two examples which strike me immediately, and I have not gone to any great trouble in working on them, and those are fisheries and forestry.  Most of us would agree that in both cases there is total under-development, that there is almost infinite opportunity for investment, job creation and exploitation, in the kindest sense of that word.  What do we get?  We get the same as we got in former years&mdash;£7.5 million in both cases in the capital programme, implying that somehow the 3.5 million acres derelict would not benefit from a major investment in terms of forestry, implying we are on a planned programme of developing our marine industry, which we all know is nonsense, because we are really barely <Col N="1662" /> holding our own.  Again, opportunities are lost in these areas.</P>
    <P>I am not essentially attacking the budget.  It is a popular budget.  It is popular because we are getting now what we will not pay for until some years hence, but the fact that it is a popular budget does not mean it is the right budget.  Many speakers have made that point.  Making a budget popular is not the same thing as producing a budget that is wise.  The underdevelopment of land and sea resources is a major challenge that was not tackled in the budget.  Neither were other challenges that could have been looked at by a Government which can confidently look forward to a five year mandate, secure in the knowledge that it is a Government with the backing of the majority of the people in a way which was clear and unprecedented.  These challenges include the development of land and sea resources.</P>
    <P>A whole new programme of commitments could have been opened up here which would lead to less waste and more real production of appreciating value, more real jobs in food processing and so on.  It is important to stress real jobs as compared with the rather half-baked efforts at some of the piece type work we see increasingly in some areas of Government thinking.  We have, as I said, 3.5 million derelict acres which, I understand, is the worst record in the EEC.  Now, although I am a city Deputy, I have the opportunity of travelling all over the country and one sees in towns and villages the sad spectacle of young people, somehow hopeless, holding up street corners and pubs while, just a stone's throw from them, there is work, work that could be creative and valuable in a real sense, work that is useful.  Instead of doing something about that we wait for someone to come in and build a shed and put our young people in there to toil away their days.  We take them off the employment exchange and believe we have done our job.  There is a very sad lack of vision in this.  I am not blaming the Government for this. Our thinking down the years has been faulty in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> Take our sea resources.  We seek a 50-mile limit and yet the Government's vision of the industry is the old-fashioned one.  The implication given by these figures is somehow the old-fashioned attitude to the exploitation of our marine industry.  The fishermen can go out in the morning, come home to lunch on their bicycles and go back again in the afternoon to the sea.  That is not the kind of approach we need particularly when talking about a 50-mile limit.  In the context of a need for a radical new vision by the Government on our marine industry and the possibility therein of jobs, and the clear lack of hope in the budget in this regard, the events of last week when Commissioner Gundelach visited this island are important.  It appears the natives did not quite come to heel.  The fishermen who could ill afford the time from their arduous and dangerous labours were lectured and threatened.  The insinuation apparently was that, if they did not come to heel, they might have, and I quote, &ldquo;major marketing problems in getting rid of their catches&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair will bear with me for about 30 seconds, what I am trying to do is stress the need for a Government response and the need for a response is there because last week, when Commissioner Gundelach visited the island, he apparently lost his temper.  I do not know what the image of the country is abroad, whether the EEC and the Mr. Gundelachs of this world have a different view of us, but I would like them to take careful note of the fact <Col N="1664" /> that we do not bow the knee or touch the forelock to anybody especially when it comes to preserving one of the last few resources the nation possesses. We are citizens of no mean country.  We had many days of subservience to various powers over the centuries and this Government have an opportunity now to throw that image of Ireland as a poor nation grovelling in the dirt for its living aside.  What happened last week?  The fishermen were waiting like Lazarus at the gate.  What did they get?  They got a stern lecture and a threat.  That is not what we expect from the EEC and we should not tolerate that.  The Government have a responsibility to look again at the fisheries situation and invest a great deal more money and inspiration in it than the figures in the budget show they are willing to invest.  Apart from being the height of discourtesy to this nation and to the hosts, that particular exercise was a form of arrogance and condescension we should not and will not accept. I am disappointed the Government did not respond by rejecting the attitude adopted.  The marine industry is an industry to be protected.  It is an industry in which the Government must invest.  What indication of that have we got here?  The sum is very meagre. A great opportunity is being missed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another challenge the budget could and should have taken up is the urban crisis and the need for a policy there to correct and eliminate the mistakes of the past.  The evacuation of our city centres leaving behind the old, too poor, and too feeble to bring themselves and their belongings to the waste-lands created in the suburbs, the excesive office blocks in the inner city, the unbalanced urban development, the inadequate amenities&mdash;all these things are areas of opportunity for a Government with the interests of the people at heart, anxious to create for the people a properly balanced society.  I do not see any semblance of consciousness of the need for social direction in the budget.  In this capital city there is need for a special policy and a special authority.  It is time this was looked at but there is no indication of anything like that in this budget. <Col N="1665" /> Where jobs are concerned, the response to the growing problem&mdash;it is worldwide and has clear lessons to be learned by the Government&mdash;is to borrow and hand out to private enterprise massive sums and, on a wing and a prayer, hope when day is done there will be new jobs.  That is based on two false premises.  The first is that the volume of traditionally productive work is infinite, which it is not, and the second is the belief that the entrepreneur is in fact a patriot in disguise. One of the fundamental problems we have been experiencing is the re-distribution of profit and the reinvestment of profit into the social infrastructure to create work.  I do not see any reason to believe there will be any more of that than there has been heretofore.</P>
    <P>What about the cultural challenge to which the budget has not risen? Where is the encouragement of Irish music, dancing, songs and poetry? What about a specific cultural programme being part of Government strategy?  Is that too much to ask?  The epitome was last Sunday when I went in the afternoon to visit the Municipal Art Gallery and found it closed on a day when it should be busy.  That is a symptom of a basic paralysis and malaise.  It shows a lack of vision and ability.</P>
    <P>The Government are facing a very long term in office; it can be four and a half years if they wish.  They have wonderful opportunities and do not have to be hidebound by the old ways and obsolete economies of the past. What about all the other peripheral areas in the cultural field?  There is the question of a concert hall for our capital city.  Musicians when they come here have to play in a boxing stadium. What is disseminated by the media, particularly television, is for the most part, a diet of American garbage. It is totally passive and on the most superficial level.  Maybe politicians generally have a vested interest in ensuring that people are passive, unen-lightened and uneducated.  I hope not. I would not like to think that this is so, but these points are very relevant to the budget.</P>
    <P>It cannot be repeated too often that <Col N="1666" /> the budget is not fundamentally a fiscal document.  It is a social statement and it reveals the way the Government think.  There is at the moment a great barrenness about that thinking. Have the Government any thoughts on these issues I have mentioned?  If they have I have not seen them, and I have read carefully the statements of the Taoiseach and of the Minister with regard to the budget.  I have teased out the various proposals in respect of increases and so on, and all I find is the same again, a little more in some cases a little less in others.  The pattern which was established before I can remember is still the same.  In other words, we are foisting old solutions on problems that are totally new.</P>
    <P>Another challenge is education, with the pattern of resources, access and positive encouragement to it.  Is it not very sad that all our efforts seem to be bent towards discouraging people from getting into education?  There is restriction on third level, a tightening of finance on second level, and a silent hope in many people's minds that fewer people rather than more will get down to the job of educating themselves. That is very sad.  Thomas Davis said: &ldquo;Educate that you may be free&rdquo;, and he was not merely talking about territorial freedom.  That saying is still valid, but the level of investment in education in the budget shows that the level of thinking about education in the Government's mind is clearly deficient if the vision of an educated and fulfilled nation is to be realised.</P>
    <P>What about the dimension of North-South relations?  Where in the budget is there specific, concrete, financial realisation that if there is to be harmony on this island there has to be economic commitment in certain directions?  I will say no more about that except that the old, ambivalent, ambiguous attitudes of the past are not adequate.  The shadows that reach out to us from the graves of the people who gave their lives&mdash;in many cases wisely, in some cases perhaps unwisely&mdash;for what they thought was right have perhaps bound us too tightly to the old, rigid thinking. One of the major prices that this country is going to pay for progress will be in the economic sphere.  We will <Col N="1667" /> have to consider the economic implications of a new alignment on this island, and that is not in the budget.  That is particularly disturbing from a party who express themselves as strongly republican.  I am a little unhappy to see the sinister&mdash;that is the wrong word but a fair one&mdash;gesture to the War of Independence veterans just to show the party's followers that the heart of the party is in the right place. When it really hurts, when it would mean levying new taxes, creating new institutions, providing new sources of funds for cultural and other exchanges, what do we get?  Nothing.</P>
    <P>What about the public sector?  The Taoiseach spoke about the 55 per cent of GNP in 1977 which went into the public sector.  It was said that this was being continued more or less in a praiseworthy fashion.  The question about all budgetary moneys is: how and when is this money being spent? In other words, there is need for strong social goals in the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>I have never been employed in the public service, but I imagine it must be an area which a person enters full of optimism about the new job but very quickly becomes just another piece of the furniture because of the lack of a goal towards which to work. That is not in the budget.  There is strong need for a review of the goals towards which each Department operate.  This obviously would per-colate right down through the system These goals should be reviewed regularly, perhaps annually or every two or three years, to see to what extent this monolith of the public service is measuring up to what society and our Government expect of them.</P>
    <P>If that is not there the only other way is the policy of drift, which is what is happening.  People feel that there is not really need to do this to-day because nobody has said that tomorrow is not good enough.  A whole new dynamic could be implanted in the public service if someone said &ldquo;Let us sit down and work out piece by piece what each area of the public service is supposed to be doing.  Let us review that after a year to see where <Col N="1668" /> it has fallen short, and let us implant these goals in it&rdquo;.  The goals which would measure up to the realisation of the political policies of the Government are not there and therefore we have drift, and increasing and in some cases wasteful expenses in the public service.</P>
    <P>Allied to that is the concept of zero budgeting.  I ask the Government to consider this in so far as they will consider anything arising out of this debate.  This concept is a very worthy one.  It is a policy of reviewing occasionally all expenditure from the bottom up and not taking as a base last year's figures and adding on, perhaps, a little percentage for inflation, a little percentage for expansion, a little percentage for political gain and so on. The bases on which this budget has been estimated have never been seriously looked at.  They have evolved and developed over time.  Why are we estimating for 1978, for example, £22.71 million on roads?  The reason is not necessarily that we need £22.71 million for roads, but that the Estimate last year was £26.23 million and the year before £25.93 million and therefore it is a reasonable figure. &ldquo;Reasonable&rdquo; means that people go home and sleep in their reasonable beds in the belief that everything is all right.</P>
    <P>Maybe in order to help create the jobs we are talking about that figure needs to be doubled, or halved.  No one is questioning that.  The question being asked is how much more do we need over last year?  The basic figure has not been asked, and the concept of zero budgeting would look after that.  The same is true in other areas &mdash;for instance, hospitals and education. We accept the figure from the past and we add on a little bit.  Yet, ironically, we preside over a nation that has in many cases primary schools that do not even have a toilet, and our young people are being educated in these surroundings.  These questions are not asked because that would mean a major new dramatic investment in a certain area and the political will is not there to say to other areas &ldquo;We may have to take something from you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> That is not the only option.  Another option is to have the courage to say to the people&mdash;and this can be done particularly at the beginning of the Dáil term&mdash;&ldquo;In order to eradicate the evil of having young people in our schools without basic hygiene facilities, we need to tax you to a degree more than you have been taxed&rdquo;.  That courage does not seem to be there. It is not enshrined in the budget, and and that is very sad.</P>
    <P>What about the need for a policy with regard to the poorer nations? Over 700 million people in the world are starving.  Since I began to speak, hundreds of people have died of hunger. What is our response?  Our response is to spend even less than the minimum requested by the United Nations, in a country which is almost unparalleled in terms of food consumption. We are very good on apartheid because it does not hurt.  We can talk about that all night because words are cheap.  The weak politicians will always take refuge in the easy cliches. We are very good as well on various out of the way places on various matters to do with human and civil rights where it is words that count.  When it comes to putting our hands in our pockets and giving, even until it hurts slightly, we have a disgraceful record and no amount of political cowardice can excuse it.</P>
    <P>As a nation who have experienced famine and hardship and are supposed to be Christian, we should have a particular desire to establish good relations with these countries, to help them on their way and&mdash;Deputy Kelly also stressed this&mdash;to create the basis of good relationships in the future with these developing nations.  No, we stick to the easy ones where only words are needed.  Like the next person, I am opposed to apartheid, but a little more is needed than expressions of condemnation of totalitarian regimes if we are to have a meaningful policy.  I appreciate that asking people to put their hands in their pockets and pay more to other nations&mdash;although I have my own reservations about this &mdash;may not be a basis for popular and enthusiastic political success.</P>
    <P>Surely the whole point of being in <Col N="1670" /> Government is what to do with that power once you have got it.  It should not be the primary goal of the Government to retain a sufficiently high level of popularity in order to achieve re-election.  The Government should do the job which needs to be done as well as possible and trust to the maturity of the Irish people to respond in due course.  Our record in that regard, to say the least of it, is very weak.</P>
    <P>We appear to have no policy with regard to doing business with and attracting investment from companies who are involved daily in the exploitation of people in some of these far-flung places.  They are colonial powers in the most exploitive sense and yet, if they bring in two or three extra jobs, we welcome them despite the fact that we allegedly condemn in principle this type of operation.  As I say, when it hurts it does not wash in this country.</P>
    <P>These are some of the challenges which I as a relative newcomer to this august assembly, if I can call it that, see the need for taking up, but they are not taken up in the social document, the budget.  What are the guiding principles of the budget?  They are extraordinary.  They are compounding the mistakes of the past by giving a little more, or a little less in some cases.  Obviously the first need was to maintain the political popularity of the manifesto.  This had to be done in a way which would be palatable to those of us who are paying the price for it.  The answer, therefore, was to borrow massively.  Many of the provisions in the budget are designed explicitly to meet the price of the manifesto. When the Minister said this was a once-off operation I had a feeling that I knew what he meant.  He meant: &ldquo;Now we have honoured them and we do not have to do it again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The borrowing is designed basically to rely on private enterprise to create the jobs and the wealth alleged to be necessary in order to put our people to work.  In recent weeks we have seen an increasing trend towards threatening private enterprise that, if they are not good boys and do not do what they are told, action of an unspecified nature will be taken.  Presumably they <Col N="1671" /> are talking about taxation.  Who are the private enterprise to whom this appeal is made?  Who are the private enterprise to whom the Government have decided to hand over their responsibility for running the affairs of this State in the job creation sphere? Who are the private enterprise who will become the &ldquo;fall guys&rdquo; if and when the noble ideals of the manifesto and the budget are not met, as they will not be met because they are based on false promises?  Are they the small entrepreneurs around the country metaphorically or otherwise with their shirt sleeves rolled up, working hard and keeping a number of other people in employment?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting and extraordinary aspect of our society which would bear looking at by the Government and the Opposition.  There is a tendency to see the executive mandarins who wheel and deal with people's lives as being the real basis for economic and social recovery.  I believe a snowball in hell would have a better chance of fostering the kind of hopes we need than some of these people.  Their basic inspiration and motivation is acquisitive self-accumulation and, therefore, it is a rather native philosophy that places the whole burden on them to create the social structures which are the prerogative and duty of the Government to create. Naturally enough, I am not excluding the large private entrepreneur from the realms of being somewhat patriotic, but it is very naive if we hope that somehow this sector, which has failed already and that is why we are in the mess we are in, will now find answers to even bigger problems.</P>
    <P>It is time to reward the real producers, the real workers, the people who are involved in useful and productive employment, not the middle-men, the people who are engaged often in parasitic and peripheral areas of activity and who get a disproportionate degree of remuneration in many cases. These are the middle-men the Government are talking about when they talk about private enterprise, not the smaller person who is working hard and salving.  What wealth will these wizards who are the focal point of the <Col N="1672" /> budget create?  Wealth is dictated for the most part by the parameters of personal accumulation and acquisition. For these people in many cases, not in all cases, it is an end in itself, not a means to the end of creating jobs.  If jobs are created accidentally well and good, and obviously the Government will be interested in taking the political credit for that and more power to them.  I am suggesting, however, that the essential thrust of the budget in relying to the massive degree it does on a very select stratum of private enterprise is essentially cowardly and will fail socially.  It is cowardly because it passes the ultimate responsibility from the democratically elected Government to people whose primary motivation is profit, very understandably. That profit is not synonymous with the welfare of our people.  They are two separate things and to imply otherwise is naiveté or downright lies.</P>
    <P>The illusion of wealth creation fostered by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in particular is an illusion.  The national wealth exists already.  It is latent in the country.  It is not created.  Our wealth is the joint possessions we have whether under foot, or in the sea, or in the air, or otherwise, which we can use for the creation of the right kind of climate for living and working in. Wealth is not money.  It is not the illusory profit which is created and stowed away wherever the highest return is.  Increasingly the IDA are finding out that the highest return is outside our shores.  They learned that recently when they tried to get some hundreds of jobs in Cork, costing something of the order of £50 million, but our bid was not high enough.</P>
    <P>As a small nation, with the trend against us in relation to being able to bid and compete on the international money market in the face of transglobal companies, many of them with GNPs many times the size of ours, we are going to find that our bid will fail more often.  I say that with sadness. Therefore, why did the budget not look at the real wealth we have, the land, the sea, and the need for creating a massive food processing industry?  I am not expecting the Government to <Col N="1673" /> change everything in 12 months but had they hinted in the documents I referred to of the need for this kind of development I would have been happier.  It is simply the old policy of <i>laissez faire</i> which is not good enough any more.  The longer this Dáil goes on the clearer that will become.</P>
    <P>It is essentially and fundamentally due to our failure to see the breakdown of the old order.  We are trapped in the web of obsolete economic thinking moving into a super-industrial civilisation that will be technological but not industrial.  Industry, in the old sense, is on the way out but technology is in.  Technology is capital-intensive and not labour-intensive.  Therefore, any attempt by a government to create jobs that are merely designed to give people the therapy of feeling that they are involved in society through some type of work is essentially dishonest and diminishes them as human beings. It does so because it creates work, not because it is useful or socially necessary or good for the people but simply because it is a unit of work that gets them off the labour exchange.  There-fore, a whole new definition of &ldquo;employment&rdquo; is needed.</P>
    <P>It is also strange that this budget, produced by a self-acclaimed republican party, depends massively on foreign borrowing.  We should know by now that economic subservience to outside interests in the ultimate lack of sovereignty, not the territorial one which could be conceiveably changed in a relatively short time, but the putting in &ldquo;hock&rdquo; of our future is throwing away our sovereignty.  I find that an extraordinary philosophy for our Government who, according to themselves, possess a republican momentum.</P>
    <P>We have also been told that this budget is a gamble.  Were I not a Member of this House I would like to tell the Minister for Economic Planning and Development that I take a dim view of a government who told me eight or nine months ago that they could identify what was wrong with the country, had all the answers to our problems but in their first economic throw of the dice tell me that it is a gamble.  The people have not given to anybody the right to gamble with their <Col N="1674" /> jobs or the future of their children.  We should not be involved in gambling. Gambling is for people who have no other options and are certainly not entrusted with political responsibility. Gambling for people entrusted with political responsibility is irresponsible and not acceptable.  I was shocked by the use of that word.  No amount of subsequent dilution could conceal the essential idea that the Government were taking a gamble and a plunge and hoping to God it worked out.</P>
    <P>This lack of vision is shown in the Taoiseach's concern to eradicate abuses in the social welfare system. That was emotionally underlined at the weekend jamboree, the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis&mdash;I am not saying that the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis is any more a jamboree than any of the rest of them.  Perhaps there is reason for concern. I represent a constituency where I presume it will be alleged that substantial abuses of the system take place but I have scant evidence of that.  I have been told there is some and I accept that.  I have no hang-up about eradicating and agreeing to eradicate that type of abuse but I should like to ask the Government this question: If they are a nationally representative party seriously concerned about wastage of public funds why is it that there was no statement in the budget, or in the course of the Taoiseach's speech at the weekend, about the various other abuses at other levels or our social spectrum which are proportionately massive?  From the Government's own admission the figure involved here is something like £2½ million but the Government know well that there are companies, and individuals, engaged in evasion of various kinds which would put that figure to shame.  I am not saying that it is easy to get rid of it but it would have been right to accompany the ire about the need for eliminating abuse&mdash;an abuse practised by the poor in our community&mdash;with the express need to get rid of abuses at other levels.  We did not hear any concern expressed about that.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have to search too far for the reason why because, whether they like it or not, the Government <Col N="1675" />&mdash;this is one of the aspects of the matter which worries me, above and beyond politics&mdash;have too closely aligned themselves with sectors who will, when the time comes&mdash;in some instances there is evidence that it has come already&mdash;exact their price for their investment in the first case.  When I hear hysteria about abuses in the social welfare code from people who are, in many cases, involved in evasion of all kinds then I wonder.  I wonder all the more when I hear it echoed by responsible Ministers of State who should be sensitive to areas of public concern.  If a person abuses social welfare the possibility is that it is not because he is criminally inclined but just that some of these sums are already almost derisory in spite of the efforts of the previous administration and the efforts in the budget.</P>
    <P>I should like to show how the increase of 10 per cent granted in the budget will have the nett effect of putting a whole category of people into a position of relative poverty when compared to the rest of the community. It is reasonable to assume that wages will increase in real terms in the coming year by 6 per cent to 8 per cent, perhaps more.  An increase of 10 per cent over the 12 months, allowing for inflation, would probably result in no more than a real increase for the elderly, the poor and the under-privileged of something of the order of 3 or 4 per cent.  The likelihood there-fore is that the aggregate increase granted to workers across the board will be twice the increase for social welfare recipients.  Is that a just society?  If the Government had not borrowed £821 million, if they had to exhaust every domestic source of revenue, if they had to increase tax burdens, I might understand it but when they borrowed so massively and paid out with such <i>largesse</i> various sums for various reasons to some people then it is sad that the poor, people who still get no more than a nett £10 or £20 per week to live on, will get an increase of no more than half of what workers will get this year. It should be remembered that a pair of shoes cost £20 and that the price of heating, cheese and many other <Col N="1676" /> products went up in recent months.</P>
    <P>It is not even in line with inflation. Let nobody put it down my throat that this constitutes a real increase for people living in our cities, in environmentally bad areas, in damp housing without, in many cases, the finance with which to keep body and soul together.  The truth is&mdash;and I say this as non-politically as I can&mdash;we have a vast reservoir of real poverty, particularly amongst the elderly, who are not the beneficiaries of the higher incomes or of the pension schemes now existing, who have no income except social welfare.  In many cases they are illiterate, unable to ascertain their rights and live on assistance of various kinds doled out in a rather unstructured fashion.  Such people do not find a concerned response in the budget.  I can only hope that they will in future budgets.  I should like to think that this party&mdash;as it tried to do over a number of years&mdash;will continue to show a genuine concern in these areas. I find it rather anomalous that social welfare recipients have their pensions taxed whilst one of the grave acts of the Government in the budget was to abolish a tax on excess wealth.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Government &mdash;because with them rests the initiative for the way in which debates are handled in this House&mdash;that they examine new ways of handling such a debate as to make maximum use of it for the country.  Perhaps I am too pessimistic but I do not think the debate we have been having will have the slightest effect on government thinking.  I would not blame the Minister present if he were bored stiff; he says he is not and I accept that.  But I can understand that it would be seen by the Government as a ritual exchange in which people put their views on record in a somewhat cursory exercise.  It would be far better had we some kind of committee structure for teasing out various aspects of the budget rather than major speeches by some Members in the House.  Certainly I would not be too enthusiastic about being involved too often in what might appear to be a charade, although I am sure it is not.  I would ask the Minister present if he would sincerely accept my essential criticisms of the budget. <Col N="1677" /> They are primarily that there is no basic social vision enshrined in it.  It does not rise to, or even identify, many of the social challenges facing us.  It should because it is fundamentally a social document and not a fiscal one. My second criticism concerns social welfare recipients.  Perhaps stressing it again might draw the Government's attention to them.</P>

      <P>One thing that intrigues me most listening in this Chamber to some speakers in this budget debate, and listening upstairs through the intercom system, is how the Coalition could have gone out of power at all.  It amazes me how that could have happened last June because they have the answer to everything now.  I can remember, before 1973, hearing from both Opposition Parties the cry: give us a chance, we will bring the just society into being; we will revolutionise our whole social structure.  The electorate gave them that chance. What was the result?  During that period there was rampant inflation here.</P>

      <P>There was unemployment at the most unprecedented levels ever experienced in this State.  There were disillusioned workers, uncontrolled arrogance on the part of Ministers of the Coalition, so much so that even some of their most ardent supporters were glad to see the back of them.</P>
      <P>It was suggested to me also some years ago before I came into this House that Fianna Fáil were the natural rulers of this country and Fine Gael and Labour the natural Opposition. We have reverted to that state again.  On this occasion Fianna Fáil are making a wonderful contribution in government and, as I shall demonstrate over the next few minutes, the Opposition have not been living up either to their promises whilst in Government or to their tradition of being a good Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sat here while the Minister for Finance read that wonderful document. Members on the other side of <Col N="1678" /> the House listened with eager expectation of what would come next hoping and praying that something would evolve with which they could embarrass the Government.  There was no question of doing anything in the national interest.  Rather they were merely waiting and hoping that the Minister for Finance would make a slip or in some way go back on the promises given the electorate last year.  However, that did not happen. At the conclusion of his contribution we had a reassured public and a disgraced Opposition.  We have been given the same old thing in the past couple of weeks since we discussed this budget&mdash;the hypocritical sabre-rattling of the Opposition, the dutiful genuflecting to the age-old Minister bashing, all of no avail.  I want to assure the House that the master document survives intact.  The 1977 manifesto remains, as it was purported to be, the greatest single document ever offered this nation.  I suppose somebody might suggest that it could be regarded as the Fianna Fáil Bible of 1977.  But since I came in here, it appears that it is the Opposition's Bible in that every member has one tucked into his briefcase to be consulted further on every Bill introduced in this House.</P>

One of the prosecuting counsel in the political back room I referred to in the west made the point that it was well known during 1973 to 1977 that the Leader of the Government of the day took instructions every morning at 10 o'clock from a certain other nation across the water before business was instituted in this House.  I would hate to think that that was the kind of thing the Irish people had to endure over a long period.  The people in the west saw through it.</P>

      <P>The statement of the Minister for Finance showed imagination and courage.  The Minister has taken the initiative on behalf of the people in the package that was brought here on budget day.  People realise what is the road to economic recovery and full employment and they realise that greed will hinder economic recovery.  Greed can commit us to perpetual recession.  The wage earners realising the efforts of a caring Fianna Fáil Government to provide the 11,000 jobs in the public service, to provide schemes for youth employment and to provide business incentives, wish to let the healing process of economic recovery get a fair chance.  The executive committees negotiating on behalf of the workers must recognise the limitations of the national cake, and they must let the interests of the common good triumph over short-term advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If wage claims are excessive this year, and if they continue to stifle our ability to compete, those who will suffer most will be the workers. Fianna Fáil won the support and trust of the majority of workers last year with their policies as outlined in the manifesto.  Nobody could suggest that the same workers will now oppose the measures being undertaken to implement the proposals in the manifesto. Part of the deal in June, 1977 involved wage restraint in return for the stated improvements of tax concessions and price control.  Our side of the bargain has been honoured and I <Col N="1681" /> believe the workers will not be found wanting this month or next month when they must fulfil their side of the bargain.  In June the workers did not buy the traditional pig in the poke.  Our pig was on display for a considerable time.  We have brought home the bacon and the workers will have a fine meal of it.  No matter what the workers are advised to do, they voted for a bargain in 1977 and they will fulfil their end of the bargain.</P>
    <P>When I was upstairs last night my colleague Deputy Leyden spoke in relation to decentralisation.  It pained me grieviously that I could not get here fast enough to speak.  Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick misled the House and Deputy Leyden was not absolutely familiar with the facts about decentralisation as far as it related to Castlebar.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach told the House that Fianna Fáil had a Castlebar Deputy in the House.  I am now here in person to answer Deputy Fitzpatrick and at the same time to educate my friend, Deputy Leyden, as to the true facts of the case mentioned last week.  Decentralisation has been a policy of Fianna Fáil going back to the time of the late Deputy Eamon de Valera.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle did and I fully agree that it is not really relevant, but in the interests of accuracy, Castlebar benefited from the policy of decentralisation when certain sections of the Department of Lands came to Castlebar.  The implementation of that policy, the contract documents attached to that policy and the staff negotiations attached to it, were negotiated by my friend ex-Deputy Mícheál O'Moráin who was a member of the Government that saw it through. The people of Castlebar know full well who to thank for the large building <Col N="1682" /> situated on Clarkesfield on the outskirts of Castlebar.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The enlightened approach in the budget in respect of taxation indicates a new awareness in the whole area of fiscal policy.  During the past few years there has been an enormous increase in the amount of taxation accruing to the Exchequer and there have been changes in the importance of the various sources of taxation in terms of overall revenue. During the sixties more than 50 per cent of total revenue was derived from customs and excise with about 25 per cent being derived by way of income tax.  There has been a dramatic change in recent years in the tax and in the sources of taxation.  This year, for instance, customs and excise account for about 35 per cent of total revenue while income tax has increased to about 36 per cent.  In addition, we now include VAT which replaces the turnover and wholesale taxes and which was responsible for about 20 per cent of the total tax revenue in 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of income tax has been <Col N="1683" /> increasing.  Although allowances were increased during the term of office of the last Government, the real value of the allowances had been decreasing and an increasing number of people were finding themselves paying taxes at the higher rates, while there was no adjustment to make allowance for the increased cost of living.  Consequently, the growth rate in respect of income tax has been faster than that of our GNP. However, the Minister for Finance realised that taxation on that scale could be regarded only as a penal tax and that there was no incentive for increased productivity if such increase would be the cause of transferring workers to the higher tax brackets. Who wishes to improve his work output when he knows that all that will be achieved is that the tax man will get a greater cut?  Any taxation system that allows for the payment of income tax at rates in excess of 50 per cent of earned income leaves productive work less attractive and is a real disincentive to development.</P>
    <P>The measures in the budget in respect of personal taxation are a clear indication that Fianna Fáil accept the need for such changes and are aware that the reduction in taxation will act as an incentive to greater output of productive work while at the same time giving more buying power to the wage earner in a situation in which there will be price controls.  Were these considerations not the main thrust of our manifesto?  Control in the area of prices means that it is not necessary for incomes to increase dramatically in order to allow for the maintenance of the buying power of the wage packet.</P>
    <P>Sudden changes in the rates of direct taxes have acted also as disincentives to the productive capacity of the community. I am glad that the Minister was not tempted to use the age-old vehicle of indirect taxation by increasing the duty on alcohol, cigarettes or petrol.  Any further major increase in these areas would result inevitably in unemployment at all levels of the industries from manufacture to distribution. As one of the witnesses called in the political courtroom where this <Col N="1684" /> budget statement was tried I had no doubt as to what the Minister was about when he did not increase the price of the pint, of the half-one or of the cigarettes.  He was ensuring that the wage earner would have more buying power.  When one considers the net increase as a result of the derating of domestic dwellings, the abolition of tax on all but the bigger cars and the reduction of £1 per week to the lower-paid workers in the cost of the social welfare stamp plus the 8 per cent increase that we hope will be agreed, the worker is being offered a real bonanza.</P>
    <P>The worker recognises all this.  The only opposition to the budget is that heard in this semi-elliptical Chamber. The man in the street is full of praise for the steps the Minister is taking.  He knows that they constitute a revolution in financial and fiscal thinking.</P>
    <P>I welcome particularly the removal of wealth tax.  What possible use could there be, in a country where the lack of risk capital is so evident, for a tax on the limited resources available for investment?  Was this lack of risk capital not the main reason for the failure of so many companies in recent years?  In addition, the wealth tax was difficult to administer and produced a miserable return in revenue to the Exhequer.  It deterred outsiders from investing here and it killed job opportunities. It was a tax that removed wealth from the very people on whom we are depending for investment in Irish business and, consequently, for the creation of employment for our youth.</P>
    <P>The wealth tax put further demands on the State funds to take up the slack of risk capital thereby increasing the tax burden on the only source of revenue&mdash;the taxpayer&mdash;and forcing the Government into further borrowing. It has never been the policy of Fianna Fáil Governments to borrow in order to pay the lads.  The purpose of borrowing so far as this party have been concerned has always been to create jobs and job opportunities. That, too, is what the borrowing is all about on this occasion.  It is the essential difference between Fianna Fáil's borrowing and the borrowing <Col N="1685" /> engaged in by the Coalition.  But the Coalition borrowing was a Labour-Fine Gael borrowing policy and not the other way around.  However, that is something I shall be dealing with later.</P>
    <P>The wealth tax must have been the worst piece of legislation to come before this House for a decade.  Any tax that limits the availability of capital for investment in Irish business should be scrutinised carefully.  Irish business has not been served well either by the capital gains tax or by the capital acquisitions tax.  These taxes have resulted in risk capital being very scarce, so scarce that we could very well see the decline of some of our prosperous privately-owned Irish businesses. That would be a tragedy on a national scale.  The emphasis now is on the other side of the coin.  We want people in Irish business to have the courage to take their capital and use it in a risk way to provide the extra investment necessary to keep Irish industry and business alive and to provide job opportunities for the youth.  That is what the programme is about which is outlined in the statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>More than anything else, this budget shows the deep concern of the Government for the unemployment situation of our young people.  We are not ashamed or afraid to tackle that problem in 1978.  This budget provides the finance for job creation premiums and new employment programmes in the public sector, together with new initiatives in the construction industry.  I take it that new training schemes for school leavers will be undertaken and that more attention will be given to the qualitative aspects of this problem.  Matching young job seekers to the type of jobs offered has become extremely difficult and, unnoticed, a contrast has emerged between, on the one hand, the development of our educational system and higher levels of education and, on the other hand, the relative stagnation of working conditions and responsibilities offered to young people.  Positive steps need to be taken and will be taken by Fianna Fáil to adjust our training <Col N="1686" /> and educational systems to cope with the needs of modern society.  We must improve working conditions to meet the needs of our youth and to increase the motivation of our workers.  There has been a lack in this area for some years and new initiatives will be necessary. The Government will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>Another witness in the courtroom said to me: &ldquo;I do not mind what you take from my wages or salary as long as there are jobs for my son and daughter.&rdquo;  That is national patriotism of the highest order, unheralded and unheard except by the rest of the witnesses in the courtroom that day. I would ask the House to contrast that with the statement of the leader of the main Opposition party when addressing the House on this budget.  That is the reason for the charge of national sabotage to which I referred earlier. Deputy FitzGerald did all in his power, and would appear to be doing so still, to get to the trade union members to sell out the package being offered to them.  He could not see how they could accept the provisions offered in the budget.  Is that national patriotism? The charge was well founded.  He stands indicted for irresponsible opposition and surely the verdict was right&mdash; opposition forever.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government and of the budget is to put us in the position where we can offer our young people the possibility of work or the opportunity of undertaking training that will lead to gainful employment.  Every effort should be made to get as much as possible from the EEC Social Fund and we should use the vocational training programmes as outlined by the Commission in the summer of 1977 to ensure an adequate, practical training for all our young unemployed.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence that the economy is recovering from the deep-seated recession which afflicted it over the past few years.  This expansionary budget, with personal tax cuts, reductions in other taxes and increases in social welfare benefits, has acted as a strong stimulus and this, together with the confidence engendered by the Fianna Fáil economic proposals, has been a significant factor in the performance <Col N="1687" /> of the economy during the past six months.  The rate of consumer spending and investment is at an all-time high and exports have reached an unprecedented level.  This augurs well for a substantial growth rate this year.  Even the conservative bank estimates indicate that the growth rate will be sustained and if the target of 7 per cent is reached it will be the highest since 1968.  I do not have to tell the House who were in Government in 1968.  The only trends during the past four years were those of rising inflation, rising prices and rising temperatures because the Fine Gael fellows were not getting the support from the country which they thought they had.</P>
    <P>To achieve our aim there are certain necessary fundamentals.  These are outlined in the budget, which must be allowed to run its natural course.  The tax cuts, job creation measures and other reflationary proposals are vital to the well-being of our economy and no demands for personal gains or sectional aggrandisement will deflect the Government from the full implementation of the manifesto arrangements. Following the British Government decision to allow the £ to float freely, we must assume that it will remain reasonably stable in relation to other world currencies.  This is an integral part of our statement and this will be necessary to enable the proposals to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The question of pay restraint is currently in favour with the media and in this House.  It was part of the deal offered in our manifesto that pay restraint would have to be exercised. Which is better: more money in one's pocket buying less and less because of increasing prices or more buying power from one's existing wage packet?  The witnesses in the courtroom were unanimous in their decision that the latter would have to be the case. Prices have been stabilised.  There will be a slower rate of increase in consumer prices in 1978 and the abolition of rates on dwelling-houses will reduce the CPI by about 1½ per cent.  The upward valuation of sterling resulting in a slackening of increases in import <Col N="1688" /> prices together with the tighter price control measures of the Government will bring inflation down to a manageable level in 1978.  Disposable income will be much increased because of the lowering of inflation and the significant tax cuts of this budget.  This will further boost consumer spending and it is the first real improvement in our standard of living since 1973.  If pay restraint on the part of the Irish nation can achieve that why is there talk about not giving a fair crack to the Government to get on with the job?</P>
    <P>Something else that I suppose will have a great bearing on the success of the budget and the implementation of its proposals concerns the Northern Ireland situation.  I am very disappointed about something that happened recently and I know that you, Sir, must also have felt it deeply. Because of the financial arrangements of the Minister for Finance our expert personnel in Bord Fáilte have been mounting a wonderful campaign in Britain, costing almost £1 million, to entice people from Britain to join us here during the summer holiday period as tourists.  That was in stark contrast to what the leader of the Opposition said about the people of Northern Ireland last week when he said that they would be bloody idiots to join us here, are fools or whatever words he used.  That kind of vulgarity is unbecoming to the leader of the main Opposition Party.  We want them to join us&mdash;our hands are out to them&mdash;as tourists and as regards the people of the North, we want them to join us as one so that we can go forward in peace&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot permit the Deputy to move into discussion of the Northern Ireland situation. That would be a dangerous precedent. He should keep to the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  However, it is hoped that there will be no escalation of the level of violence this year and that this very valuable programme which is being financed by the Minister for Finance to encourage tourists to come here will not be hindered by irresponsible, loose statements by one <Col N="1689" /> whom I always regarded as a very responsible politician.  Deputy FitzGerald fell, as a politician, with that statement, in my eyes and I believe he also fell in the eyes of his own party supporters. Those in the political courtroom have led me to believe that it could be the cause of a change in the leadership of the main Opposition party.  I would not know about that.</P>
      <P>Manufacturing industry will play a major role in our revitalised economy. Our exports have been expanding strongly in recent times and the rate of increase&mdash;faster than the current increase in world trade&mdash;indicates an improvement in our competitiveness which can be maintained given fair play as regard wage increases this year. The Government are committed to providing support for export growth.  This is reflected in the incentives they continue to provide for export-orientated industry.  To attract overseas investment is much more difficult of late as many countries now have their own unemployment problems; they are all in the market place for foreign investment which they need for their own purposes.  However, the IDA, refurbished and refinanced by the Government, have an expertise that is envied by many and it is confidently expected that at least part of the new job total to be created by this administration will come from overseas investment and overseas industry locating in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Advance factory building was a wise policy provision and it is hoped that there will be increased activity in this sector during the year.  The whole range of incentives from restructuring of existing industry, financial aid to entrepreneurs, right through to assistance for mergers and acquisitions must be the most comprehensive programme ever offered by any State similar to ours in modern times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to note that the infrastructure necessary to maintain this impetus has been uppermost in the mind of the Government and so that we can get the whole matter in perspective let it be said now that for the first time since 1973 there is an increased allocation for the provision of the infrastructure necessary to develop <Col N="1690" /> this nation.  I refer to water and sewerage schemes and amenity grants; everything from roads to the provision of extra facilities in towns and villages has been provided for in the budget which is the first expansionary budget in four years.  Any local authority in the past four years found that instead of grants for all this type of work going up to cover the cost of inflation, on the contrary they were nose-diving. That trend has been reversed and we are aspiring to new heights as instanced by the huge investment in the provision of new water and sewerage schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This is the policy of a caring Government, with the promises made to the people in 1977 being honoured now in 1978.  I am sorry for only one reason that next year our members will have to come together again and prepare a new manifesto.  I want the Opposition to note carefully that when this new manifesto is written we shall not wait until the next general election to produce it.  We will have it on display next year and they will all get copies so that they can go throughout Ireland quoting from it trying to embarrass the Government.  What they are doing, of course, is showing the people that this is the greatest Government ever elected in the State.</P>
    <P>When we consider the social services and the benefits given in the budget we must also think of the amount available from public resources.  Then we must agree that the budget has been very generous.  With stabilised prices, the increases given will have real meaning. A weekly payment of £28.50 to an old age pension couple will have real value, unlike the small increase given twice a year by the Coalition Government. In those days old age pensioners could count on a weekly budget: every Friday morning they could read of 200 items whose prices had been increased. This time old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients can honestly say they have been given real increases in buying power.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will never allow a situation to develop like that at the last election campaign when we had Deputy Liam Cosgrave going around asking pensioners if they had got their pensions. <Col N="1691" /> It was the laugh of the nation. They had drawn so far away from their people that their supporters did not want to be seen in their company during the campaign.  Only a blind man would not have realised then that their game was up.  Once again, Deputy Lynch and Fianna Fáil had to come to the rescue of the nation as his predecessors had to do on two previous occasions when the people had the sense to say: &ldquo;Send for Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is not in the House but I should like nevertheless to bring to his notice something that I think should be changed.  I may be saying something that may be interpreted as being against my own side, but so be it. I was told early on: &ldquo;Deputy Flynn, if there is an improvement that you think should be carried out, go into the House and say it.  It will not be an embarrassment to the Government&rdquo;. My concern here is about the old age pension means test.  I am not satisfied that the method of calculation of income is fair.  I cannot understand why a capital sum cannot be reckoned in a fairer way, whether that capital be in a bank, a building society, a trust or in stocks.  The simple interest on it should be calculated for the year in question.  The present system is outmoded. Pensioners are allowed £25 and the reason for that goes back to a time before I was born and it was to cover funeral costs that might be incurred. In these days £25 bears no resemblance to such costs.  A pensioner who might have £5,000 capital accumulated it throughout his life from hard work.  I should like to see that system changed.  I should also like to have the £6 allowance changed to £10 or more.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that a small farmer's income should be assessed for tax in a different way.  There should be some simple regulation in this respect which would be clear to everybody and we should eliminate the notional system. One State official could tot up an income attached to certain capital and another official could come along and reckon it at an entirely different amount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> Deputy Keating referred to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis as a jamboree. Let me put the record straight for him: it was the finest gathering of Fianna Fáil men and soldiers of destiny ever seen in this State.  There was no back clapping there.  On the contrary, all matters were openly discussed. In spite of what Deputy Keating thinks, the matters discussed there carry weight with the National Executive, the Parliamentary Party and the Government. All of the matters are discussed subsequently at meetings of the Parliamentary Party and the best ideas are implemented into legislation.</P>
    <P>I was sorry that reference was made to a concession offered to the veterans of the War of Independence.  Was Deputy Keating speaking on behalf of all his colleagues in that matter?  I would have thought that was not part of his party's national policy.  A great debt of gratitude is owed to the veterans of the War of Independence and Fianna Fáil will be glad and proud to make any little extra comforts available for them.  Fianna Fáil will not follow the tradition of another section of the Opposition in the past four years where our modern history would have been removed from the history books and from the curricula of the national schools so that our young boys and girls would have grown up not knowing anything of our patriots and the people who fought and gave their best for this country.</P>

      <P>After listening to that speech I am not too sure whether to address the Chair as &ldquo;a Cheann Comhairle&rdquo; or as &ldquo;Your Lordship&rdquo;. The reference to a courtroom came into the previous speech from time to time and I am a little lost as to where we are.  The act was good and most of us enjoyed it.  I am not sure whether it would be good for the Gaiety or the Abbey&mdash;there was a good mixture of both in the speech.  I admired the brilliant act of the Deputy but I think we should get back to discuss the budget.</P>
      <P>The budget was somewhat like the manifesto in that it contained many promises but very little action.  There was talk in it of a radical approach to job creation&mdash;I emphasise the word &ldquo;radical&rdquo;.  There was mention of 10,000 extra jobs in the public service, a very radical approach.  There was mention of 5,000 jobs in the building industry&mdash;there is nothing very radical about that&mdash;and they promised 5,000 jobs for young people.  They have no policy with regard to that matter.</P>
      <P>As everyone knows, when something is put on the long finger the procedure is to set up a committee who are told to work on that particular aspect.  The Government are bereft of any idea on youth employment.  They have no policy on that matter.  Certainly the 10,000 jobs in the public service are jobs but one must ask if the public sector is not large enough?  Can we continue to sustain such a wage bill for the public service?  Perhaps we can, but we should ask ourselves would it not be wiser to invest that money in a positive growth industry that would pay off in the long term.  What the Government propose is not a solution, it is merely a stop-gap.  The cost is estimated at £50 million this year.  This is something we could invest in a positive growth industry.  I am disappointed that the budget did not spell out new ideas in job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that our budget last year gave a positive upturn to the economy.  The inflationary trend was on the downturn and the Government benefited from that.  However, they do not appear to have taken any <Col N="1694" /> real advantage of that fact.  Their philosophy is to borrow now and pay later in the hope that we can get out of our troubles by borrowing, that things will turn out all right.  The Government have not thought out their policies.  We examined their election propaganda&mdash;I cannot call it anything other than propaganda and gimmickry. It is becoming more and more like &ldquo;The Little Red Book&rdquo;.  It is taken out and waved about as the saviour of the nation.  It is worth examining to see how it will save the nation. If it is the forerunner of future Irish politics it will damn the nation.  Is this the price that has to be paid to get elected every time?  If so, how can we instil in our people the will to work?</P>
    <P>There was no demand for the removal of car tax but Fianna Fáil considered it was politically opportune to remove the tax, to buy the votes with the people's money.  That is not the way to build a nation.  It is not the way to instil in a nation the moral fibre to develop its own resources.  The rates were an iniquitous tax.  Our party are not without fault.  I believe the first £20, £25 or £30 should have been taken off the rates.  That would have been of benefit to most people.  It was unwise to remove rates altogether. People with large houses who can well afford to pay are now free of paying that type of local taxation.  I believe that this will eventually kill local government.  If people have not got the power to regulate their affairs and spend their money as they wish, they become tools of central government, rubber stamps, and are told what they should and should not do.  It would have been much better to put some threshold on the rates than remove them completely.</P>
    <P>We were caught up in political gimmickry because in 1972 the White Paper issued by the Government said that rates could not be removed without a tremendous burden of taxation on people.  In our 14-point plan in 1973 we said we would remove health and housing charges from the rates, alleviating in some way the burden on the people.  Rates could be abolished overnight by the Government without <Col N="1695" /> thinking about it.  They followed through that policy because they committed themselves to it.</P>
    <P>Are we to have dutch auctions prior to every general election?  What will be next?  Is PAYE the next carrot to be held out to the people?  I believe the people want leadership.  I believe that buying votes with the people's money is not leadership.  The previous speaker said that there were no increases on infrastructure since 1963. If he looks at the public capital programme for 1978 he will see quite clearly on pages 16 and 17 the increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government set a pattern for house building.  There is no talk now of any house building programme except, as they said in the White Paper, that they propose, basically, to cut back on local authority housing without putting anything in its place.  People will suffer greatly if there is a cutback in local authority housing. One has only to look at the Dublin Corporation housing list to see what I mean.  Do the Government intend to cut back on centre city housing?  The previous Government were very concerned about this when they came into power.  They appointed a housing coordinator for Dublin, Dublin County and Dún Laoghaire Borough.  He set about acquiring land for housing in the centre city area.  We now hear that this type of housing is expensive and that the nation cannot afford it.  I believe the nation must afford it.</P>
    <P>Dublin has been allowed to degenerate over the years.  When we talk about cost are we taking into account the infrastructure already there, the services, churches, community halls, libraries and all the other facilities already there?  The only thing needed in those areas is housing.  This, for some strange reason, does not seem to be the ideal thing to do.  I believe we must continue with housing in the centre of the city, not alone on the local authority side but the private sector should also be brought in.  There is a need for private housing in the city but because private developers cannot compete with office developers it is almost impossible for them to get in and make a reasonable profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> The Government should look at the tax mechanism with a view to making it attractive for private developers to build houses.  They should be given a tax free concession or a 50 per cent allowance on their capital to make it as attractive for them to build houses in the city as to build offices.  Insurance companies and others, who engage in office development, can charge this money against their companies so that they are paying no tax on it.  Housing is neglected because we are not looking to see what can be done to develop housing in the city.</P>
    <P>I believe if we have not private house development in the city area it will not be done.  I ask the Minister for Finance to look at this aspect of house development to see what can be done. I believe the Irish Building Federation will take this up and the private builder will come in and give Dublin a new face.  This will give employment which we are all very concerned about.</P>
    <P>The family was ignored in the budget.  The Minister at the Ard-Fheis said that working women were well heeled.  Perhaps they are but they are a very strong organisation and well able to look after themselves.  I am more concerned about the housewife, the woman who remains at home and makes life tolerable.  I believe when the housewife remains at home there is much more stability in that home. No incentive, unfortunately, is given to her to remain at home.  We should examine the question of the marriage allowance for the housewife who remains at home.  That woman should be given a special allowance.  The first step in this regard was taken when the children's allowance was made payable directly to the housewife.  The tax free allowance for the housewife and the children goes directly to the husband.</P>
    <P>Is that right?  Are we satisfied that is the kind of thing we want?  I say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That increase should be paid directly to the housewife.  That suggestion doubtless will create a great hue and cry about administration costs. That is always the excuse.  Remember, we pay these people an allowance by way of children's allowance and so there is a direct payment made to them already.  The mechanism is there.  There <Col N="1697" /> should be no great administrative difficulty.  What is there is a lack of will.</P>
    <P>I have a few facts and figures which are worth quoting.  A survey was carried out by the National Prices Commission and the results of that survey were published in May 1974 and those results show that only two out of every five women receive a formal household allowance from their husbands.  The remainder have to rely on an <i>ad hoc</i> payment or even the uncertainty of receiving nothing.  Wide variations existed.  That is a shocking indictment.  If this allowance were paid directly to the housewife we would be formalising for the first time a really meaningful income for the housewife in the home.  What arguments can there be against this?  Some men may object, but this is one way in which I believe we could stabilise the cost of living because, when the housewife gets money, it is generally spent on the home in one way or another.  We should recognise now the role of the Irish housewife.  For too long she has been in the wilderness, left there by some of the great exponents of women's rights.  For some reason or other they ignore that sector.  It surprises me.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is no increase in children's allowances.  This is disturbing.  There could have been an increase on a selective basis.  The family is the bedrock of the State and the family has been completely ignored in this budget.  That must be rectified. It illustrates the type of thinking that has gone into this budget.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the 10 per cent across the board and it has been argued that this is better than getting it in two bits, one bit in April and another bit in October. Perhaps it is.  The idea of two increases was an innovation.  Every year during the time of the National Coalition there was some innovation in social welfare.  What is new in this budget? Nothing.  The whole area of social welfare should be looked at and some innovation introduced.  There are many innovations.  One could be introduced every year.</P>
    <P>There is no social commitment on <Col N="1698" /> the far side of the House.  Surely there could have been supplementary rent benefits for old age pensioners living in private accommodation.  The old age pensioner in a local authority house is subsidised.  Prior to the abolition of rates she enjoyed a waiver of rates.  The old age pensioner living in private accommodation could be forced into one or two rooms at a rent of £5, £6, £7, £8 or £9 a week. She gets no consideration.  This is something we should examine if we call ourselves a concerning people and the Government regard themselves as a concerning Government.  Some innovation should be introduced every year.</P>
    <P>It is very disappointing when one looks at the social content of the budget. We heard of all the great monetary benefits people were getting as a result of certain policies being implemented. &ldquo;You would not really be getting 6 per cent, you would be possibly getting 15 per cent and perhaps more, and were you not doing very well, and were we not very good to make life such a Utopia for all of us?&rdquo;  It is good to think about that, because one could easily be taken in by it.  The rates are off, car tax is off, there is the £1,000 grant; it is tremendous. The only worry is that we have to go to work at all.</P>
    <P>In my constituency car ownership is rather low, so consequently a large number of my constituents would not benefit from this great bonanza of the car tax removal; far from it.  It is removed now and they will pay in another way.  So much for that.  These people live in low-rated accommodation. Their rates would not be high, so where is the big bonanza for them in the abolition of rates?  Again it is a reasonably good con trick.  In my area many people with large families in a reasonably low income group do not come into the tax net, so what does the great tax incentive that we got do for them?  These are the people who are going to be asked, as we all are, to accept 6 per cent on the basis of all the great promises of the hand-outs they are getting.  They are getting nothing.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that a Government <Col N="1699" /> govern for all the people, not for any particular group, and their concern should be for the people who are least able to look after themselves.  The low income groups with large families are getting no extra children's allowance to compensate for the large families, no extra tax allowance because they are not in the tax net, and no claw back for their car because they have not got a car.  They get the rates remission today and two weeks afterwards the rent man tells them &ldquo;Your rent has gone up&rdquo;.  That is what happened.</P>
    <P>Then we are unpatriotic, according to the last speaker, if we question the national wage agreement.  National wage agreements are all right provided they are fair and reasonable, but is this type of gimmickry honest?  If people put this case before this House is that being unpatriotic?  I can say it is not. Let us look at it again and let us be honest with one another, because we have an obligation here to ensure that we treat people fairly, that we are honest and seen to be honest, and that we are not concerned with smoothing it over with nice, glossy talk, as was the Minister across the House when at the Ard-Fheis he spoke about £20 million to service the national debt and said that would be 5p or 6p on a packet of cigarettes, that you would not object to that and anybody who did had no right to belong to that party.  That is insolence and arrogance. Of course they have a right.  If, because of mismanagement, tax on cigarettes or other items goes up the people do not benefit from the great false promises that were made.  Why should they not complain?  Would that be branded also as being unpatriotic?</P>
    <P>The Government party, as was noticeable at the Ard-Fheis, appear to be more Irish and more nationalistic-minded than anybody else, particularly anybody on this side of the House. The risen people, the soldiers of destiny, were out at Ballsbridge.  That is dangerous and it stinks of nationalism of the worst type.  We should be talking in this House about getting the three parties to find a common solution on our problem.  We <Col N="1700" /> should not be playing politics or exploiting nationalism.  We should be working as one and seen to be one, with unanimity and the same purpose, and not trying to suggest that: &ldquo;I am a better Irishman because I am in another political party&rdquo;.  That is a scandal and disturbs me very much. The sooner the people on the far side of the House forget about that kind of carry-on and get down to building an economy, the better.  We have quite a task ahead of us, and no gimmicks are going to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The sad feature is that there is no easy solution to our unemployment problem.  Setting up little groups or committees does not solve it.  Youth unemployment should be coupled with general unemployment because that is the only way we are going to draw up what is a new document.  There is no policy, no in-depth study of any problem, just a lot of gimmicky promises. The Minister borrowed an enormous amount of money which must be repaid and in doing that he will be using a lot of money that could be put into job creation.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget that pleases me or gives me any comfort. The sad thing is that when a man over 40 years of age looks for a job nobody wants to know him because he is considered to be a bit old.  The Government have a responsibility to bring positive policies in relation to that and other problems before the House.  They have not produced a positive policy on job creation.  Since Fianna Fáil took power many jobs have been lost.  We all know about the Ferenka affair.  When we highlighted the difficulties in that concern we were told by the Government that delicate negotiations were in progress and we should not hinder them. Nothing was done by the Government to solve that problem.  It drifted on until it reached the stage where negotiations were useless.  The Dutch threw in the towel and told the workers that the match was over.  The Ministers responsible did little or nothing to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>We all thought the Government would have learned a lesson from that dispute but today there is serious unrest <Col N="1701" /> in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  There is a dispute in the communications section of that Department, a vital link for our business community.  As a result of that dispute jobs will be lost.  Is that the Government's policy on job creation? In order to save jobs the Government should grasp the nettle of industrial relations.  Unless they do we will drift into an abyss of unemployment.  There is little point in talking about the future if positive steps are not taken to improve the situation that exists now.  The problems I have mentioned can be solved now if the Government have the will to do so.  It may not be protocol to do certain things and the Government may want to stand on their dignity when all around them is crumbling.  That is a crazy mentality. The Government must look into this problem.  The Minister for Finance devoted a lot of his budget speech to job creation, job development and so on and it sounded well, but when the Government are confronted with industrial disputes they must make an effort to solve them and stop pussy-footing. It appears that there is a deliberate attempt to break the union involved in this dispute.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us what he intends to do in relation to the handicapped. I accept that something is being done, but I wonder why the allowances being paid in respect of handicapped children being kept at home was not increased.  It has been £25 per month for some time.  It was a first-class innovation but it should not be left at £25 per month.  We must all remember that a mother has to endure a lot of hardship to rear such a child and that a lot of additional money is required. The fact that no increase was given in that allowance is another indication that there is no social commitment in the budget.  The Minister should increase that allowance, even if it means introducing a supplementary budget.  I accept that he may have overlooked the matter in preparing the budget. Minority groups like those caring for handicapped children are often ignored because they are not part of a vast pressure group but such allowances must be examined annually.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement about <Col N="1702" /> the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and I hope it is supported.  If we do not have confidence in our own products we can throw our hat at any hope of attracting foreign industrialists or investors.  In this regard the Government should carry out a comprehensive programme in our schools.  Such a campaign should be discussed regularly at civics classes. If that is done the children will encourage their parents to buy Irish goods.  We must get through to the young people to ensure that the programme of encouraging our people to buy Irish goods is a success.</P>
    <P>A number of ladies clubs are in vogue now run by committees who should be contacted and spoken to. They should be told the types of jobs that can be created if this happens and, if it does not happen, the possible job losses.  This is a positive aspect.  It will have goodwill, but people often forget.  There has been a history of some products not being the best and that can lead people to think many Irish products are not the best.  For one reason or another, some large supermarkets sell manufactured products which are not Irish but, if the customers demand Irish goods, their attitude will change.  There is a reasonably big selling job to be done here. Greater emphasis should be placed on advertising.  Television advertising is good, but word of mouth is better.  In the long term, this will have a tremendous effect on our industry.</P>
    <P>On the question of job creation I should like to see a new look taken at our natural resources.  We do not seem to have a properly related policy. We should get moving on the development of a smelter as soon as possible with the possibility of spin-off industries. We should not waste time.  If we are borrowing money, it should be borrowed for areas like that.  We know the real potential.  We should cut through the red tape.  If we do, I have no doubt that in the eighties we will be a prosperous nation because we will have done the right thing.</P>
    <P>Nothing in this budget gives me any great hope.  It can be claimed that there is a 10 per cent increase in social welfare and that the price of drink and cigarettes did not go up.  That is not <Col N="1703" /> what our economy is all about.  Our economy is about creating and developing wealth, and improving our standard of living.  Talking about wealth, I was amazed at the wealth tax being removed so quickly.  I am not saying it was good or bad.  It did not yield any great revenue but I do not think it had the effect of driving it away either.  Its removal was a political gimmick, a sop to tell people: &ldquo;We are taking off the wealth tax.  You cannot be caught on that, but we will put a bit of tax on you in another way&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was premature legislation but I believe it will have to be re-enacted. It operates successfully in most European countries.  It could have been left there.  It was rather innocuous but it was there in the event of its being necessary.</P>
    <P>I am rather disturbed that there is no great development in education. There is an increase in the student grant as promised, but there is no new idealism.  There is no thought about restructuring primary education. If we are to develop as a viable economy we must restructure our educational system.  Far too many people talk about second and third level education. You rarely hear people talking about first level education.  Most people go from first level into second and third level, but the minority without a voice are left behind.  Who cares?  They have not got a voice and we are not really concerned about them.  We must be concerned.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to raise the school leaving age but what does it mean if we do not restructure the whole set up?  If we raise the school-leaving age to 16 years, what does it really mean?  It means pupils have to stay on until they are 16 years but that is not what education is about.  It is a question of equipping them for life. National schools cater for pupils up to the age of 12 or 13 years.  At that stage some children drift away and do not go on to second level education because of social environment or family circumstances.  If the primary schools were structured to take them until they were 15 or 16 years, they <Col N="1704" /> could benefit greatly, but we have not thought that one out and that is sad.</P>
    <P>I do not see any dramatic increase in money for that level.  There is a commitment to lower the student-teacher ratio to 40: 1 and then to 32 : 1.  It is a matter of urgency that this should be done in the city centre. If there are any impediments the red tape should be cut.  It might cost a little, but it would be money well spent. Generally where there is a decline in student numbers it is in deprived areas where you want smaller classes so that you can reach the pupils and have a personal teaching relationship with them.  That could be done if we lowered the ratio to 20 : 1.  We should be generous about this.</P>
    <P>If we looked at the grants paid to primary schools and the grants paid to second and third level schools we would be ashamed of ourselves.  The grant in primary schools is not very much.  This is sad.  There is an imbalance here which should have been rectified in this budget.  I said that pupil numbers fall in centre city areas. We should be concerned about these areas and ensure that the educational structure is right for the pupils.  Perhaps the authorities read the White Paper and saw there is no great hope for inner city housing development&mdash; apparently the Government will turn their back on inner city development&mdash; but two secondary schools on the north side of this city are going to close and possibly a third.  That is disgraceful and I would ask the Government to examine the situation.  I believe it is because there is no future foreseen for these schools in the city centre.  Obviously they have taken the message from the White Paper that moneys will not be expended on city centre development. These people have seen the light, knowing the history of the Fianna Fáil Party and their attitude towards city centre development and have thrown in the towel, which is regrettable. Some urgent action is needed in this respect because otherwise it will constitute another nail in the coffin of urban renewal, to which we pay lip service.  Let us rather examine what can be done constructively.  Private sector housing would cost the Government <Col N="1705" /> little or nothing.  The public sector requires housing in the city centre.  The infrastructure exists for the implementation of such housing requirements so that the overall cost would not be what it might appear at first sight because the costs of roads and other services are not taken into account.  If we do not pay attention to urban renewal then all we are doing is building soulless towns, allowing the core to rot.  When that happens it tends to degenerate society as a whole.</P>
    <P>I repeat my plea to the Government to give a commitment to urban renewal and city development through the provision of housing and retention of schools.  If they do so they will find they will not be spending as much money on law enforcement, on the building of jails or detention schools in Cavan or elsewhere for young offenders.  That would constitute a positive approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has already been spoken and written about the budget. It is true to say that much of what has been said and written has been ignored.  When one listens in the House here to a contribution one becomes acquainted with the language used and seeks to find the basis and reasoning behind that contribution.  In that regard I was interested to hear Deputy F. O'Brien, at the beginning of his speech, questioning the need for 10,000 extra jobs in the service of the public proposed by the Government. At the conclusion of his contribution he urged that extra teaching personnel be made available as a matter of urgency in some of our schools.  Education is one sphere of our national affairs in which extra personnel are badly needed.  I am sure any teacher faced with an over-crowded classroom, or any parent of a pupil being educated in such a classroom would not question the need for extra teachers.  In these times of increasing incidence of serious crime neither would the public question the need for extra gardaí any more than would people awaiting admission for hospital treatment question the desirability of providing more hospital staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for <Col N="1706" /> Finance on introducing this courageous, imaginative budget which tackles, at the one go, so many of the ills besetting us at present.  We find ourselves in a desperate situation. There is the need to provide more employment, thereby reducing the unemployment queues, offering some hope, in turn, to our school-leavers of obtaining a job at the end of their education.  There have been few more disturbing developments in our history or with more sinister implications for the future than that of the increasing numbers of young people unable to obtain employment at the end of their education, having studied hard to pass examinations, having been sustained in their study by the legitimate expectation of finding a job suited to their talents and abilities.  To watch this undesirable trend escalate would be unpardonable.  Indeed it would constitute a crime on the part of any Government.  It would be folly and wasteful of our manpower resources.</P>
    <P>One of the main aims of the budget is to take corrective action in this sphere by generating more employment. It will be welcomed by all, particularly by the young people themselves and their parents who have suffered so much anxiety in the past three or four years watching their children seek employment in vain.  This aim, together with the twin aim of reducing and controlling inflation, explain the whole fiscal approach of the Minister in his budget.  There are those who disagree with it and who harshly criticise his proposals.  But much of the criticism levelled springs from a desire to criticise rather than to be constructive or offer alternative proposals. Much of the criticism comes badly from spokesmen of the last Government who allowed the unemployment problem to grow to such alarming proportions without attempting corrective action or even planning to do so at some future date&mdash;and this despite the many hundreds of millions of pounds borrowed during their term of office.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is important to distinguish between the money borrowed for productive purposes, as the Government now propose to do, and <Col N="1707" /> that borrowed for unproductive purposes, as was done extensively during the term of office of the last administration. Understandably there has been no great effort made by Opposition speakers to bring out this distinction but I am sure it is not lost in the public mind.</P>
    <P>In June last the electorate showed their displeasure at the ineffectual manner in which the last administration conducted the nation's affairs.  One of the aspects of Government administration they were displeased with was the unemployment situation.  The proposals in the budget come to grips with this scourge.  I heartily welcome them and hope they will be successful.  The evils of unemployment are most evident in the cities because of the numbers out of jobs and the attendant social problems arising from unemployment. For this reason I expect many of the new jobs will be provided in the cities.  But I plead that rural constituencies like mine, where there has always been unemployment, will not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Infrastructure has been provided in rural areas over the last number of years and efforts have been made by the IDA with increasing success to attract industry.  Since the regionalisation of the IDA there is a yearning in constituencies like mine to attract new industry and to make it succeed. In the past emigration provided the outlet for many people who could not find employment.  In later years, due to the success of our native industry, migration provided the outlet.  While it is infinitely more satisfactory to have our people find work in Limerick rather than in Leeds, the hope remains that some day more job opportunities will be provided in the local towns which in many cases can cater for small or medium-sized industries.  I hope that the claims and hopes of the rural communities will not be ignored in the pressing need to cater for present city requirements.  I trust that the claims of provincial towns which can accommodate small or medium-sized industries will continue to be sympathetically considered and met as far as is humanly and economically possible. <Col N="1708" /> The employment incentives and increased grants in the capital programme of the budget are specially geared to stimulate increased employment and I have every confidence that they will do this.</P>
    <P>The increases in the income tax allowances afford the wage and salary earner a welcome respite from the burden of taxation which was being continually added to budget after budget. It is something to be thankful for that this trend has been halted before the last backbreaking straw had been added.  Besides the financial benefit that will accrue from the tax allowances there are benefits of a psychological nature to the individuals concerned in that this section of the community can now see that they are no longer looked upon by the State as a group to be plucked repeatedly of an undue share of the fruits of their labours whenever a new increase in revenue is required.</P>
    <P>The budget translates into action what Fianna Fáil promised in their election manifesto.  Listening to some Opposition speakers one would think that it was a crime, or at best some kind of despicable political act, to deliver what was promised rather than a performance to be commended.  This is not surprising in view of our experience of the famous 14 point programme on which the Coalition were elected in 1973, most of which they promptly forgot when they assumed office.  The electorate can rest assured that this is not the Fianna Fáil way of doing things.  Our motto is and will continue to be, as quoted by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech &ldquo;Beart de réir ár mbriathar&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil promised the abolition of motor taxation and delivered on that promise.  Rural constituencies greatly appreciate the fulfilment of that promise. Most of the electorate in rural constituencies have not the benefit of a public transport system and they depend increasingly on cars to get to the towns, shops, markets, church, doctors and so on.  Added to that is an often inferior road system which takes more than its due share out of the vehicle with consequent high maintenance costs to the motorist.  The relief <Col N="1709" /> offered in the abolition of motor taxation is significant and is appreciated.</P>
    <P>The manifesto promised a £1,000 grant to people building or buying a house for the first time.  This has been a great encouragement to young people starting in life with the problem of providing a home for themselves.  It has also helped to give a much-needed lift to the building industry which was virtually in the doldrums when the present Government took office.</P>
    <P>There is a section of the community with which I have much sympathy in relation to the £1,000 grant.  They are the people who were caught by the income limit for any grant from 1 January 1976 until May 1977.  Many young people embarked upon building a house during that time confident that they would get the old grant, but for some reason, sometimes because they went through an agent, an engineer or a building society rather than sending their applications direct, their applications arrived late and as a result those people have been deprived of any grant.  It was a great blow.  It is a burden to them even yet, because the loss of £500 or £600 is a significant loss to people who fully expected that they would qualify for the old grant but subsequently discovered that, due to the technicality of their being late with their applications, they did not qualify.  I have the greatest sympathy for these people but unfortunately nothing can be done about their plight now.</P>
    <P>The abolition of rates on domestic dwellings is much appreciated especially in a county like mine where the rate had been approaching a frightening figure and where, indeed, only a few years ago we were in the unenviable position of having the highest rate in the country.  It is to the credit of Fianna Fáil that they have delivered so promptly on these promises.  Our manifesto was in no way a gimmick as we have proved.  It represented solid proposals and these were accepted by the electorate.</P>
    <P>In relation to the creation of jobs, the budget proposals are proof that Fianna Fáil are determined to deliver on their promises in this area too. <Col N="1710" /> The young and those who have had the misfortune to lose their jobs can take heart that now they have a Government who not merely express concern for the plight of the unemployed but are seen to be doing something to alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent increase in social welfare payments considered in the context of reducing and controlling inflation compares more than favourably with anything granted to social welfare recipients during the term of the last Government who boasted about their concern for this section of the community.  But there is little use in giving a 20, a 25 or any other percentage increase to people in this category if prices are allowed to increase at an almost equally fast rate thereby gobbling up any increase in payments.  Unfortunately, that was the situation while the Coalition were in office due to their failure to take positive action to control inflation and to bring it within reasonable bounds.  I welcome particularly the increases being granted to old age pensioners and to all others who, because of age or infirmity, are no longer able to fend for themselves.  A worth-while change, too, is the extension of unemployment assistance to women.  It was very difficult to justify the discrimination that existed in this area.  In these proposals Fianna Fáil are reaffirming their pledge to the weaker sections and are ensuring that they obtain their share in whatever prosperity prevails.</P>
    <P>The budget lays the foundation and charts the course for future economic progress for the next few years but the achievement of that progress will require more than the budget proposes. It requires the co-operation and the work of every section of the community.  In this context acceptance of the national wage agreement is vitally important and it is hoped earnestly that those who will determine the fate of that agreement will be motivated by wise and prudent counsel and will give the proposals a chance.  No one section can accomplish the task of economic recovery.  It will not be possible for the country to begin moving again without the help of all sections.  Our future success requires <Col N="1711" /> the total dedication of all.  Without this co-operation and dedication there is no point in relying for help on the EEC or any other outside body, regardless of how well meant this help might be.  While aid from such sources as the EEC can be of great benefit it cannot be successful totally if there is squabbling within the country among various sectors and if there is only half-hearted application to the task of economic recovery.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  I trust the campaign will be pursued with perserverance.  The public need to be educated in regard to the implications of not buying Irish goods.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the prospect of a serious gap in our future energy resources, aware of the need to acquaint itself with up-to-date knowledge of the economic, technical and environmental issues associated with nuclear and other sources of energy and in view of its need to determine an appropriate energy policy for the country in the future, deems it expedient:</P>
      <P>(1)  That a Select Committee consisting of 12 members of Dáil Éireann be appointed to be joined with a Select Committee appointed by Seanad Éireann to form the Joint Committee on any proposal to construct a nuclear power station in Ireland, to examine such proposals and programmes and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas;</P>
      <P>(2)  That the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such reports, proceedings and submissions together with such related documents as it thinks fit; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  That the Joint Committee shall be empowered to hold public <Col N="1712" /> hearings and commission expert evidence on such proposals, including national energy resources and alternative sources of energy supply to the nation.</P>
    <P>The motion is dated February 20 and has been circulated to Members.  I note that in recent days the Minister has tabled an amendment to it but our motion is self-explanatory.  We in the Labour Party, supported by Fine Gael, have suggested to the House that a select joint committee be established to examine proposals of the nature outlined in the motion and the respective programmes of the Government and the ESB and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The proposal is eminently reasonable and we are perplexed, to say the least, that the Minister has decided to table an amendment negating, in effect, the proposition contained in this motion. We suggest that this motion is an acid test of the policy statement made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy at the weekend that the Government wish to see the maximum public debate on the question of the development of nuclear power in the Republic.  He waxed eloquently at the Ard-Fheis about issuing directions to the ESB to make the maximum possible amount of information available to responsible opinion, yet he denies Deputies and Senators the opportunity to get together around the table.  They should be able to sit down with experts and with their own secretariat and receive submissions from interested organisations.  This would enable them to consider in an objective and impartial manner the issues involved. I am, therefore, very surprised at the content of the amendment suggested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I suggest that responsible opinion, whether it resides in the political parties or in the ESB or elsewhere, would not support the Minister's amendment.  All political parties are concerned about economic growth and industrial expansion and these twin objectives are the cornerstones of the policies of all the political parties.  Inevitably, these policies mean that we require massive growth in energy consumption. <Col N="1713" /> We are all aware that since the Second World War the energy demands of the world have risen by about 8 per cent per annum and in the past eight or ten years the energy requirements in this country have practically doubled.  Some 80 per cent of the energy production here is dependent on imported oil.  Even with conservation measures and even if the industrialised nations were to moderate substantially their demands, the demand for energy is likely to increase.  Growth in world population is about 2 per cent per annum, and we must bear in mind that the expectations of the developing countries are immense and that they will require an increasing consumption of energy.  I do not profess to be an expert in this field but it appears in the context of the tremendous demands for energy that nuclear energy will have a role to play in the future.</P>
    <P>We should also note that Ireland's current electricity consumption <i>per capita</i> is the lowest in the EEC.  Even if we accept the ESB projections, Ireland will still be the lowest <i>per capita</i> consumer of electricity in the EEC in 1980 and up to 1985.  Despite the massive reserves of coal and the very substantial natural gas production in the UK, their resources are still relatively scarce and they have utilised nuclear energy in diversifying their general resources capacity.  I do not want to belabour the point but I would simply say that the stark effects of the Irish energy situation are well known to the Minister and to the House.  The Minister has received a submission from the board of the ESB, though I have not received a copy.  It is a 79-page document giving the various options, projections and alternatives in terms of energy production up to the end of this century.  This document has been in the hands of the Minister for a number of months. I am surprised, because it appears he will take a rather precipitate and arbitrary decision in that regard in the immediate future.  If one can read between the lines, he seems to have come down firmly, without any public debate or White Paper or very much explanation in this House, on the construction somewhere in Ireland of a <Col N="1714" /> nuclear power station.  This House is entitled to a joint committee to review this imminent decision and to act as a watchdog.  Even if the Minister announces tomorrow morning that we are to have a nuclear power station, it will take the best part of ten years to have it commissioned and in operation. This is common knowledge in the context of the construction of nuclear stations.</P>
    <P>The basic suggestion in the Labour Party motion that we should have a joint committee which would have a parliamentary role in relation to such massive development is eminently fair and reasonable.  I would point out to the Minister that we have an antiquated system of debate in this House, whereby we have a conventional exchange of opinions across the floor such as we are engaged in this evening. That kind of exchange is totally inadequate to consider in any depth the issues involved.  It does not permit extensive rational discussion or policy formation and it does not provide the opportunity for Deputies to hear expert opinion.  A joint committee would constitute the most objective method of Oireachtas evaluation and I strongly suggest this to the Minister.  I had hoped that he would accept our motion.</P>
    <P>I had hoped this joint committee would act as a dispassionate and impartial parliamentary forum to evaluate the issues involved.  Indeed, I had hoped and would have thought that any Government approach to energy policy would have as a prerequisite the publication of a White Paper on national energy resources.  The Minister might rightly say that the Coalition did not do this while in office. He might even say that we were seriously remiss in not doing so and, regretfully, I must agree with him. But surely Fianna Fáil should not compound that error.  It seems that the Minister is bowing to the conventional wisdom such as he now possesses with just the ESB report in his hand and bowing also perhaps to the conventional wisdom of his Department. From my experience of nearly ten years in the Dáil I have never regarded that Department, with no disrespect <Col N="1715" /> to the distinguished public servants present, as having a great reputation in terms of innovation and energy policy and therefore I had never expected to see a prospect of a White Paper; if it did not happen under Deputy Barry, it is not likely to happen under Deputy O'Malley.  White Papers seem to be something that that Department run away from.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of serious concern that a very arbitrary Government decision involving massive capital expenditure and investment is about to be taken by the Cabinet, rather than by the Minister, with the absolute minimum of public discussion and with no publication of a White Paper.  I doubt if that situation would be tolerated by public opinion in any other west European country.  It will be impossible for Deputies and Senators to feel adequately informed on these issues even after extensive reading on the subject because of the absence of a joint committee.  We shall be dependent on public relations handouts from the companies concerned, on Press releases from the Minister and on our own very limited resources in trying to evaluate the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to postulate that a nuclear power station in any part of the country is necessarily a Pandora's box containing the prospect of all dangers for the country.  Neither do I believe that a nuclear power station will be the ultimate means of saving us in any future economic depression in the event of oil prices rocketing. The truth tends to lie between these extremes.  In that context, I have never regarded myself as an extremist but anybody with a serious interest in nuclear energy will be aware of the very strong conflicting opinions that exist about the expansion of nuclear energy in this country, in western Europe and America, in the Soviet Union, China and the sub-continents. There is a strong responsible body of opinion here, and more particularly in Europe, which holds the view that any such expansion will in the long run prove detrimental to health, environmental structures and the very survival of mankind.  Equally, there is a very <Col N="1716" /> strong body of opinion which holds that economic prosperity and social progress here and in Europe depend on the further utilisation of nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a very common myth that the ESB, in evaluating these issues, have said to the Minister: &ldquo;Nuclear energy&mdash;we want to build a power station at Carnsore Point&rdquo;.  I understand that is not so and that the ESB laid options before the Minister namely, coal stations, a series of coal power stations, fuelled with imported Australian coal with the alternative of conventional nuclear power stations.  I believe the ESB have said to the Minister that the decision should be his because there are other variables in the problem. There is the problem of natural gas.  The full information is available to the Minister.  We do not know if the Minister is about to decide that the ESB allocation of natural gas in Cork is to be chopped or not. If it is, a different problem faces the ESB as regards future power generation. We do not know what is in the confidential files of the Department in relation to oil development and bringing it ashore.  The Minister has the most up-to-date information in that regard.  I would stress that the ESB do not know the situation as regards natural gas and oil resources off the Continental Shelf because the ESB are not in that business.  I share the school of thought that the ESB should have been in that business long ago but that is another argument for another evening.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the country has the alternatives of coal or nuclear power.  They appear to be the most reliable sources of power and it is up to the Minister to make up his mind.  Unfortunately, it seems that he has not only made up his mind but that he has dived headlong into the situation of saying: &ldquo;We shall have a nuclear power station.&rdquo;  In this House we are in no position to assess whether the Minister is making up his mind on an arbitrary basis or on the basis of the fullest possible information.  We shall give him the benefit of the doubt in that regard.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of <Col N="1717" /> public comment and discussion about alternatives to coal and nuclear power. I assume that we want to reduce our dependence on imported oil and I am all in favour of diversification in that context.  I do not know a great deal about these alternatives such as solar energy which has been mentioned from time to time.  We have had alternatives in relation to wind, waves, tidal propositions, suggestions in relation to alleged underdevelopment of hydro capacity and so on, and it seems to me that the majority of authoritative opinion in Europe is of the view that these alternatives will not be likely to contribute any major significant addition to our total energy requirements in the next 20 years or so.</P>
    <P>Having read as much as I could on the subject in the last few months I am inclined to that view.  I appreciate there is a body of opinion in favour of what we call the clean renewable energies, but although not denying the potential of such systems it seems to me we will have to depend mainly on fossil fuels and nuclear energy to meet our future energy requirements. I have come to that not very firm view and if a joint committee were set up I would relish the prospect of having my information expanded and possibly my views changed if I found the information convincing.</P>
    <P>The alternatives that have been mentioned have not yet reached the stage of development which coal, oil and nuclear energy had already reached ten or 20 years ago.  We must bear in mind in Ireland that we are talking about the general prospect of a future full-sized commercial nuclear generating station-one or two or three such stations as we decide on general energy strategy.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that a joint committee would also have been given the opportunity to take into account the reports of recent initiatives of the EEC in organising public hearings on nuclear energy.  There have been two such hearings, one last December and one in January, and I had hoped that the proposed joint committee would have been given an opportunity to review the evidence presented at those hearings.  There is a large volume of <Col N="1718" /> other evidence available, such as the report of the Windscale hearings, and I would have thought the proposed committee would have been given an opportunity to consider such evidence in detail.  Apparently this is not to be and we shall simply have to badger the Joint Library Committee to spend a great deal of money purchasing copies of this data so that it will be available to Members because the Minister apparently is not disposed to consult any further with the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>There is also available from the various nuclear energy authorities in Europe, the UK, the US, the OECD and many multinational selling agencies, a great deal of information which could have been made available readily to members of the proposed joint committee, but unfortunately the Minister and the Government, by refusing to set up that committee, have in effect deprived us of that data, a matter of considerable regret.</P>
    <P>I feel that even at this late stage the Minister should have sufficient confidence in Deputies of all parties to permit the setting up of the joint committee to enable us to review the situation.  There are increasing numbers of nuclear installations in Europe and an increasing number of associated nuclear industries.  We have had a number of technical incidents associated with them, a number of which have been publicised.  It is alleged that a number have been covered up: the CIA in America have been accused of this by responsible opinion in America, but we will not be able to assess that, apparently. There have been problems associated with the proliferation of atomic weapons but apparently the House will not be given an opportunity to consider these issues.</P>
    <P>We have the long standing policy of neutrality, non-alignment, and inevitably if we import a nuclear capacity, even of conventional power generating status, the issues of non-alignment and neutrality will arise, particularly in relation to other countries with nuclear capacities and in relation to multinationals, but apparently the Minister does not want to consult <Col N="1719" /> with the House in that regard.  I find his attitude in that respect amazing; it is a policy that would not be followed by any other European Minister responsible for energy.</P>
    <P>There have been major problems in many countries associated with the reprocessing of waste nuclear fuel and of course there is the overriding problem of long-term storage.  I have read reports in which the ESB have stated that in the event of radioactive waste arising it would be exported.  I must confess that I take that with a pinch of salt in the long-term because whereas many of the multinational companies will sell fuel readily, they are not disposed at this stage to do any great research into or to devote any great expenditure on the disposal of radioactive waste.  I do not know the precise submissions the Minister may have received on that respect but I am concerned about his parliamentary response.</P>
    <P>I am not for a moment suggesting that we should not have a power station at Carnsore Point which, apparently, is the senior option of the ESB, marginally as the Minister said, but if people raise questions such as those in relation to the disposal of radioactive waste&mdash;as we know, several tons of this have been disposed of off the various continental shelves in steel containers&mdash;I suppose the Minister is not unduly worried, but it is not very constructive for the Minister simply to come along and say: &ldquo;We know people are concerned&rdquo;, and then to indulge at the Ard-Fheis in the usual republican rhetoric of saying: &ldquo;Well if they do not want it at Carnsore Point we will transfer it to Mayo or Sligo or to County Clare and the people there will be damn glad to have it.&rdquo;  That level of Ard-Fheis contribution on a serious issue of this nature is not conducive to an orderly objective public debate on the real issues involved.  I was surprised at the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, who is usually well briefed in matters such as this, descending to that kind of transferred retrospective rhetoric.  I do not think such a proposition was contained in the ESB report which he had received.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> The Government amendment to the Labour motion points to the need for urgent decisions by the Government on the ESB generation programme.  Even if one accepts that need, the Minister is well aware that it would be eight to ten years before a nuclear plant would be commissioned.  I presume a series of coal plants could be commissioned at a much earlier stage.  I see no reason why there should not be in operation a joint committee of this House. Members are going to be kept in the dark by the Minister with regard to the Government's considerations in connection with health, safety and the environmental issues associated with nuclear energy.  Apparently we will not have any consultation with or information from the Minister other than the occasional Press release.  It appears that any future review by Dáil Éireann will depend on scarce Government time or on ministerial convenience.  There will be no research or secretarial assistance given to Deputies, even Fianna Fáil Deputies, to review the issues involved.</P>
    <P>All of this is in stark contrast to the situation in parliamentary energy committees in Britain, France, Sweden, Holland or the United States.  I am a member of the Economic Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe.  We have had before us a number of reports on nuclear energy and at nearly every one of the meetings we have had Members of Parliament who are expert in at least one or two of the major disciplines.  Many of them have a basic qualification in engineering or science. Some of them have technological expertise or a background in medicine. On the other hand, not one single member of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet has even the slightest competence in the engineering, medical, scientific or technological disciplines.  I do not think any of the Ministers of State have such a background.  While they may have some economic expertise in evaluating the cost involved, I doubt if the Fianna Fáil Cabinet have the capacity to absorb all the implications involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he had instructed the board of the ESB to make available to responsible bodies all relevant data and I want to take the Minister up on that matter.  I would ask him <Col N="1721" /> to place in the Library a copy of the submission he received from the ESB. Presumably Members of this House are responsible people.  This will be a further test of the Minister's concern that the public should have the maximum amount of information.  I want the Minister to tell us if we will have available here a copy of the submission by the ESB regarding energy requirements to the year 2000.  Will he put that 79-page document in the Oireachtas Library so that we may read it and make up our minds on what the Minister is up to in this matter?</P>
    <P>I do not know what kind of reactor the ESB may have in mind in the event of their getting a nuclear option from the Minister.  I do not know what conventional system of coal generation they have in mind and, therefore, there is difficulty in commenting on this matter.  I am sure of one thing, namely, that the scale of capital investment involved will be massive.  I do not know the current cost of having a 1,000 Mw nuclear power station&mdash;perhaps it is in the region of £500 million to £600 million.  Two or three years ago some people said the cost would be £350 million.  Let us take a figure of £400 million to £500 million&mdash;I do not think it would be less than that; probably it would be nearer to £550 million. Investment of that magnitude will probably be the largest single investment in the history of the State and it is entirely appropriate that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have a prior opportunity of considering the question of such investment.  There is no doubt that many members of the public are genuinely concerned about the safety of nuclear power.  Many responsible industrial safety experts are genuinely concerned about the long-term effect of low-level radiation to which workers in nuclear plants, and the public generally, may be exposed.  A useful way to allay those fears and of ensuring that the national interest is served would be the setting up of a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another major concern is the question of the escape of radioactivity to surrounding areas.  Such concern must <Col N="1722" /> be taken into account by any joint committee.  Therefore, it is essential that persons expressing this concern should have the opportunity of coming before the joint committee, of making their case and giving us an opportunity of examining the situation.  The single most intractable problem is the disposal of radioactive waste and that is a matter that the committee should examine carefully.  Unfortunately it appears now that the only prospect of examination that the country will have will be an oral planning hearing by An Bord Pleanála to examine the implications involved.  That will be totally inadequate and will not ensure that the matter is dealt with adequately. Therefore, I urge the Minister to let us have a joint committee as I have outlined.  Even an oral expert hearing by An Bord Pleanála is not a suitable forum to discuss the wide-ranging and major issues involved.  My understanding is that the ESB are not opposed to a public hearing.  In fact, I think they would welcome a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope the Minister will give us an opportunity of dealing with the matter on a co-operative basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; in line I and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;has full confidence in the Government to determine an appropriate energy policy for the country, having regard in particular, to the necessity, because of the long lead times involved, for the taking of urgent decisions on the ESB's generation plant programme to meet the expected demand for electricity throughout the 1980's, and the necessity to diversify as far as possible energy sources while at the same time, giving adequate consideration to health, safety and environmental issues associated with nuclear and other sources of energy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech which Deputy Desmond has made, probably with his tongue more in cheek than he ever had it in his life, is slightly amusing to someone <Col N="1723" /> who looks at what was decided in November 1973 without any consultation with anyone.  There were no committees, joint, single or any other kind, no public debate, no consultation of anybody.  The then Minister for Transport and Power got a decision in principle from the Government, to which Deputy Desmond was the Assistant Whip and which he supported through thick and thin.  He has voted for their contraceptives Bill.  He never queried their energy policy in any respect whatever.  Now, four-and-a-quarter years later, we are encouraging open debate of something which is no different to what was decided then.  It has officially been pointed out to me by the Department of the Taoiseach that I need only go to the Government to have this matter considered if I want to change the decision of November 1973 because in the absence of a Government decision changing an earlier decision the earlier decision stands for all time.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to me that unless I want to go back and change what was done in November 1973 I need not go back to the Government at all.  However, as a matter of courtesy to my colleagues and because the matter is important, I propose to do that in any event.  I am delighted to learn that Deputy Desmond was tuned in to the debates over the weekend.  I hope he did not just tune in for the energy debate because he had the benefit of valued views expressed on many topics.  As I announced at the weekend, the Government propose to publish a Green Paper on the whole energy question, the options which are open to the country and, more importantly in many respects, the options which are not open to the country over the next ten to 12 years in meeting the energy demand which will arise.  As Deputy Desmond pointed out, it is many years since we had a White Paper or a Green Paper on energy policy in the country.  I am glad to tell him there is one on its way which will be delivered to him shortly, which he can browse through to his heart's content and get all the information he wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only half-an-hour. I know that some of what I am saying is not too pleasant for Deputy Desmond, but I will have to ask him to bear with me in that respect. This decision of 1973 was made at a time when electricity demand had been increasing for quite a number of years at 10 per cent per annum.  It was found necessary for the then Government to make that decision.  Not very long after they made it the electricity demand decreased from 10 per cent per annum to zero per annum and remained at zero for two years. The decision was not activated any longer by the ESB because obviously there was no need to do so and it would have been wasteful in the short term to have gone ahead at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now back in the situation that electricity demand increased last year by 10½ per cent and it is projected to increase annually over the next decade at 8½ per cent on average. That will result in the ESB having to increase their generating capacity to double their present figure in eight-and-a half years time.  That is a major undertaking for the ESB or any electricity authority.  There are few, if any, in the world who have to meet such a rapidly rising energy demand as it appears we will have to meet now over the next seven-and-a-half to ten years.  If we do not plan for those increases in demand we will do something <Col N="1725" /> that happily has never happened in the country&mdash;we will leave ourselves short of electricity.  There will be a serious effect on our economic and social development if for the first time since the 1920's we are short of the most useful form of power.</P>
    <P>The Government do not propose to let that happen.  I do not believe any responsible Government would allow that to happen.  I include the previous Government, so far as their energy policy was concerned, in that.  They made the right decision and they did not consult Deputy Desmond about it, or the Friends of the Earth or the recently distinguished winner of the Lenin peace prize, who feels very agitated that we should have a nuclear power station, and some other people like that.  The previous Government did not consult anybody but went ahead and did the right thing.</P>
    <P>This is a more open Government. Deputy Desmond has been asking me for some time to publish documents. I have generally been able to accommodate him in that respect.  He asked me to publish an agreement some months ago which I did.  He has asked me now to consider publishing some further documents.  I will certainly consider publishing those because, unlike my predecessor in this respect, I believe in having as much public debate as one can reasonably have.</P>
    <P>Those are the problems which face the country and the ESB over the next ten years.  I believe that if this 8½ per cent per annum projected growth in electricity continues&mdash;we hope for the sake of the country it will&mdash;then we will reach a stage where in 1986-87 we will need a very substantial power station coming on stream in that year. That is assuming that we already have at least one very substantial one coming on stream in 1984 and certain other smaller ones in 1982 and 1983. Assuming they have been built, we will have to have, whether we like it or not, in 1986-87 a very substantial power station coming on stream.  It does not have to be nuclear; it could be oil.  Oil is in this particular context the only reasonable alternative.  It will have to be imported oil or a nuclear <Col N="1726" /> station.  We are already 80 per cent dependent for our energy needs on imported oil and 67 per cent dependent for our electricity needs on imported oil.  When the decision of the previous Government was made in November 1973 we were then 65 per cent dependent for our electricity needs on imported oil.</P>
    <P>We have since then been going in the wrong direction.  The EEC have made it very clear to all nine members how extremely unwise it is for countries like the nine of us to continue to build up our dependency on imported oil. They are right and I accept they are right.  I believe that anybody listening to or reading what they have to say will have to agree.  We have essentially an option to start planning now a major station to come into operation in 1986-87, which will either be on imported oil or nuclear.  I do not think that as a nation we would be wise to further unbalance in favour of imported oil our already very unbalanced energy picture here.  It would be extremely unwise to do that.  Most countries which are at least as advanced as we are have nuclear energy in one form or another.  In the context of nuclear energy we are not talking about some of the unconventional or unfinished types of nuclear technology. We are not talking about fast breeder reactors.  We are not talking about the kind of thing in which Windscale in Cumbria is involved.  Windscale has absolutely nothing to do with any form of nuclear power station that may at some future date be built here. Windscale is a reprocessing station.  It was proposed last year to expend it very considerably to reprocess imported fuels from other countries, primarily from Japan, whereby Britain could make a very substantial amount of money on that reprocessing in which plutonium is removed out of the uranium and certain other things are done none of which would be done in the conventional nuclear station built here.</P>
    <P>Nuclear power, therefore, has to be seen in the context of what our needs will be for the next ten years and the ways in which we might meet them. One of the facile suggestions made from time to time is that there are <Col N="1727" /> things like tidal power, wind power, biomass and solar power which could fulfil our needs in eight years' time, namely, in 1986.  I have tried to assess all the scientific assessments of what the likelihood is of these alternative forms of energy meeting our needs within the foreseeable future&mdash;say, ten to 15 years-and I am satisfied that the unanimous scientific view that they would not be capable of making any considerable contribution at all is one I must accept.  It has been estimated that by the end of the century, 22 years hence, these alternative forms of energy might then be in a position, if sufficient progress were made in technology, to meet about 3 per cent of world energy needs.  It is, therefore, clearly quite unreal to see these as possibly being able to contribute by 1985, 1986 or 1987 to our energy needs. I wish they could.</P>
    <P>I wish the technology was sufficiently in balance to enable one to think in these terms.  Unhappily we cannot and, in the case of some of these forms of energy, there are major environmental difficulties in relation to them, rather surprisingly in the case of some of them.  One of the points made by those who have experience of nuclear generating power is that in environmental terms it is the kindest and least harmful of all.  In proof of that one has only to see the stations dotted all round the United States, causing not the slightest difficulty, never having caused the slightest difficulty and, statistically, extremely unlikely ever to cause any difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting also that, whilst there is virtually no debate in the United States about the ordinary conventional nuclear stations, any debate there is centres around nuclear bombs, fast breeder reactors and so on.  It is particularly noteworthy that there is no debate at all about any kind of nuclear station in any country east of the Berlin Wall.  One often asks oneself why that is.</P>

      <P>The fact remains they are very keen to build nuclear stations at a considerable rate because they realise what good value they are. Even Poland, which has the largest supply of the cheapest fossil fuel in Europe, enough cheap coal to last away into the twenty-first century, is now building nuclear power stations because it realises the economic value of them and the fact that they do not create one tiny fraction of the environmental drawbacks frequently created by coal-fired stations.</P>
      <P>In this context, it is worth reminding ourselves from an authoritative source just how much radiation exists naturally in the air, how much radiation emanates from medical sources, for example-it is fairly considerable &mdash;and how much exists as a result of the nuclear power industry.  The nearest country to us is Britain and it is, therefore, the best with which to make a comparison.  I would like to quote now from the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, under the chairmanship of Sir Brian Flowers, chapter 2, page 16, paragraph 43, Table 2, where they describe the dose rates in the UK picked up from ionising radiation by the average individual in the year. The total expressed in a unit which is called millirems, is 154 and of that 0.25 millirems come from the nuclear power industry; 101 millirems, or almost two-thirds, come from ionising radiation naturally occurring from cosmic rays, the soil and airborne radiation and even within the body and, of the man-made radiation, by far the greater part of it, 46 as opposed to 7, comes from medical sources, in particular diagnostic x-rays, radio therapy and radio-isotope use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that some hospitals operate a great deal of equipment containing radioactive material.  In simple terms such material is, in fact, far more dangerous <Col N="1729" /> than a conventional nuclear-powered station is, and, if those who want to ensure that no nuclear power station ever opens here, because of its dangers, were consistent they should also want to close down St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar because it uses a great deal of equipment containing radioactive substances.  It has to have it. It uses it every day on many patients and nobody has ever yet suggested it is a source of danger to the residents in the locality, to the patients, or to anybody else.  It is used responsibly by responsible people and I can assure the House that the ESB, if it decided to change the decision of the last Government and go ahead with nuclear power, will be no less responsible than the authorities in St. Luke's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I have not yet mentioned, and neither did Deputy Desmond mention, the nuclear power board set up by an Act of the Oireachtas.  I do not recall the debate but I do not think the Bill gave rise to any particular controversy or opposition.  The Act was passed in 1971 and the board was set up at the time the previous Government made their decision to &ldquo;go nuclear&rdquo; in November, 1973, and the board consists of some of the most eminent people in the academic and scientific life of the country, people who know all that can reasonably be known about the normal peaceful use of atomic energy and radioactive substances, whether they are in conventional reactors in a power station or whether they are in medical equipment in St. Luke's, or any other hospital in the country.  These people are consulted from time to time.  They give their advice to me and the Government as, I am sure, they gave it to my predecessor and his colleagues in Government when requested.  They very carefully evaluate all proposals that have any radioactive or nuclear content, as it were.  They supervise and license all activities of this kind, and they will supervise and license each individual step to be taken in the establishment and building of a nuclear power station if it is decided not to change the decision of the previous <Col N="1730" /> Government and to go ahead.  They have, of course, specialist staff some of whom have very considerable experience of the nuclear industry in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I have quoted from Sir Brian Flowers' Report in Britain and I would like to make a brief reference to a recently published work by An Foras Talúntais on the Carnsore Point site which has been the one most talked about even though it is not the only site in Ireland that would be suitable for a nuclear power station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it is not the only one.  I am advised by the ESB that the job content in the building is between 1,500 and 2,000 for a lengthy construction period and the permanent employment involved would be between 400 and 500.  An Foras Talúntais, at the request of the IFA and the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture, undertook a study of the possible agricultural implications of building a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point, and in December 1977 they published an interesting and valuable study titled &ldquo;Nuclear Power Station at Carnsore Point; the Agricultural Implications&rdquo; by Doctor B.S. Coulter of the Johnstown Research Centre who carried out the work.  I cannot quote much of it, but, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am sure you have read it and you will agree with my assessment that it is favourably disposed towards the proposal of the last Government in 1973 that a nuclear power plant be built at Carnsore Point. The report does not see any major problems involved.  It does not see any major agricultural or environmental difficulties arising.  At page 35 of the report are tabled the accident risks in the United States which were calculated in the Rasmussen Report which was set up by the nuclear energy board there to assess the risk element in conventional nuclear stations.  The report of An Foras Talúntais transposes those risks to the Carnsore Point location, bearing in mind that a great many of the similar stations in the US are in cities like New York, Chicago, Boston <Col N="1731" /> and so on, and surrounded by hundreds of thousands of people, and in some cases millions, living within a short distance of them.</P>

      <P>It assesses the risks of nuclear accidents.  An accident with one fatality, of which the probable frequency of occurrence in US conditions would be one in 70,000 years, is corrected by Doctor Coulter for conditions at Carnsore Point and he brings it to one in 400,000 years.  The possibility of 100 fatalities which is one in 1,400,000 years in the US becomes one in 70,000,000 years at Carnsore Point. The constituencies will be redrawn many times before that 70,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  The position is, therefore, that in spite of what Deputy Desmond has said and in spite of what happened four-and-a-quarter years ago under the last Government when a great deal less was known about nuclear power and nuclear generation than is now known, we are actively encouraging not ignorant, foolish assertions but informed and useful public debate.  Towards that end I recently directed the ESB that they are to provide as much factual, scientific information in regard to nuclear power and the generation of electricity from nuclear sources as to them seems necessary and appropriate, to any responsible body or group of people who want to get it from them.  They have agreed very readily to do that. They are perfectly willing and anxious to do it, because it suits the ESB to have as much informed discussion as possible.  Unfortunately, there is no shortage of uninformed discussion, but the more informed discussion we have the better it must suit the ESB or <Col N="1732" /> anybody else who may be thinking in their terms, if the Government decide not to change the decision of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Many people in recent months have taken to quoting from evidence given at the Windscale inquiry.  Once again I want to make it very clear that Windscale has nothing whatever to do with any possible proposal at any time for any nuclear generating plant here.  Windscale was a totally different operation, set up and proposed to be expanded for the purpose of reprocessing used or waste nuclear fuel for foreign countries so that it can be used again in certain types of reactors or that the plutonium can be taken out of it and used by the British armed forces or by certain allies of theirs to whom they would supply nuclear weapon material of that kind for military purposes. That has absolutely nothing to do with the ordinary, conventional nuclear station we are talking about of which there are hundreds throughout the free and unfree world.  The inquiry which was set up last May into the proposal to expand for foreign purposes the Windscale processing plant is the only one that was held that I or my Department can find in relation to any kind of nuclear plant in Britain.  There were none held that I, at any rate, can discover in relation to any of the smaller stations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of the Minister's speech and of Deputy Desmond's speech bore on the safety dimension of the controversy surrounding nuclear power stations, and also on the general impact on the environment. The Minister went some distance afield in order to scorn concerns of this kind, speaking in one breath about The Friends of the Earth and &ldquo;the distinguished recipient of the Lenin Prize&rdquo;.  I want to emphasise in starting that the safety and environmental part of this question are not uppermost in the minds of this party to this extent, that we understand and recognise that the ESB and the Nuclear Energy Board are not maniacs likely to poison us all in a fit of absent-mindedness. We know they are not. For myself, I would be willing to make a very far-reaching act of faith in the competence and skill of the members of both of these boards.  I do not want it to be thóught that this party, in supporting in general the motion put down by Deputy Desmond, are necessarily associating themselves with apprehensions of an environmental or health kind which may or may not be substantial or justifiable. We realise and recognise that the people entrusted by law and convention with the running of our affairs in this regard are competent; they have never shown themselves otherwise, or anything less than responsible. I do not want anything that may be said on this side to be taken as reflecting on their competence.</P>
      <P>There are reasons why I should like to see an inquiry held and this decision delayed&mdash;and not necessarily then made in a sense hostile to what the Minister obviously favours.  I can quite well envisage that we may end up convinced to a man that a nuclear development is the correct approach to the very large increase in electrical capacity the Minister quite rightly says we will need.  The reason why I should like to see an inquiry held and this decision delayed somewhat is a much humbler reason.  It is a reason which once upon a time nobody would have been ashamed of advancing in the Dáil, but it has fallen somewhat out of fashion.  It is that the amount of money involved is stupendous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> The first figure I remember seeing quoted as the likely cost of the kind of station we would need was £250 million.  That was a couple of years ago.  I have used that figure myself in debates and called it a quarter of a billion, and so on.  The chief executive of the ESB has estimated more recently the cost in 1977 prices at £350 million.  He admitted eagerly and freely that that cost was certain to go up according as inflation went up, and that the end cost of the station would be a great deal more.</P>
    <P>We have got into the habit of tossing off enormous sums of money as though they meant nothing, and we have been encouraged in that by the kind of money we are now borrowing at a time when probably a retrenchment rather than an expansion in borrowing is indicated.  In order to put that figure into some perspective which will bring us back to earth, I want to tell the House that £350 million, give or take a few tens of millions, is roughly equivalent to the total amount of grants paid out by the IDA, the total financial commitment of the Industrial Development Authority, since they were established. It is a little less than that, but it is not far off it.</P>
    <P>To put it in another way, the Government are proposing to spend roughly £20 million on a job creation programme which will give them, they hope, 5,000 jobs.  That is £4,000 a job. That is the kind of calculation, money per job, which the IDA go in for.  I know this is a glib calculation and I quite appreciate that, even in the most favourable conditions, you cannot create more than a certain number of jobs all at once.  But it will put this figure of £350 million into some perspective if I tell the House that, on that basis, the expenditure of that amount of money on direct job creation would completely wipe out our unemployment problem.  I am not so naïve as to suppose that it actually would do so, but it gives the House an idea of the real size of the figure calculated as a multiple of the amount of money conventionally supposed to be required for creating a single job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> This is an enormous amount of money.  If we can get away with cheaper electricity generation, for example, coal fired stations&mdash;and I do not advance that as being a solution I am particularly in love with; I am not an expert; I want to hear the experts thrash this out&mdash;which will cost half as much, or less than half as much, we owe it to ourselves to consider that, particularly since the life of a nuclear station is limited.  A nuclear station like the one planned for Carnsore Point is due to run down in less than 30 years.  It will then have to be concreted over and forgotten. In other words, this immense sum of money, will be immeasurably greater by the time the station is finally built and finished, is being destined to an investment which has a very limited life.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister talking about the limited life of an investment in connection with mining.  Of course different economies are involved here, but a nuclear station has a limited life unlike, for example, hydro-electric stations or stations burning ordinary fuels.  These are factors which should make us very cautious before taking a final decision.</P>
    <P>In this context I want to contradict the Minister's assertion that the previous Government made a final decision. I think he did not use the word &ldquo;final&rdquo; but neither did he distinguish what he was saying from the truth.  The truth is that the previous Government gave the ESB a decision in principle in regard to the development of a nuclear power station and authorised them to seek planning permission on the site where they have now sought it; but the ESB were specifically not authorised to make any commitment in regard to the building of the actual station.  I would think that is beyond dispute; and I hope the Minister, perhaps through the mouth of one of his colleagues speaking later in this debate, will acknowledge that. Although the National Coalition Government made the right decisions&mdash; and I am glad the Minister gracefully acknowledged that&mdash;of a preliminary <Col N="1736" /> kind, they stopped short of making a final decision.</P>
    <P>The people in that Government who were most concerned with the development of power and its impact on industry and on employment are unanimous, and not merely because they want to embarrass the Minister, that there should be some more debate on this matter.  In an investment of this kind there are factors quite apart from the safety factors and the environmental doubts which I want to steer clear of.  I recognise that they are genuine and sincerely held, but I do not want to be associated with them alone.  I am concentrating on a humbler question, namely, whether we should spend this amount of money if it can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I agree, as the Minister said, that you could come up against a time constraint and you could find yourself in a jam.  Unless you make some decision quickly you may find yourself at a time when the expansion in the demand simply cannot be met by the existing capacity.  I see all these points, though I am not entirely sure if it is true that the absolute minimum time for putting up a nuclear station, even a nuclear station is ten years.  Certainly many stations on the continent have been built in much less time than that.</P>
    <P>I see some advantage in delaying this decision for some reasonable period to give the public and the people in this House and the other House an opportunity of satisfying themselves that there is no other option.  I am perfectly open to the possibility that I will be of that view myself when the day is over, and that everybody on this side of the House will be of that view, but I am very much against rushing into this commitment on the advice of even the most competent board or the most responsible board, before the public and their representatives have had a chance to convince themselves that no other option is open to us before we commit ourselves to this immense investment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the necessity for this station I want to offer the House a few tentative observations.  I am not an energy expert; the House would not <Col N="1737" /> expect me any more than they would expect the Minister to be an energy expert.  I want to report at second hand a couple of things which are relevant to this matter.  I was in Brussels last month at the time of the nuclear hearings to which Deputy Desmond referred. I attended an afternoon session and I heard one of the Commission's experts, the one chosen to conduct that day's proceedings on the Commission's behalf, being questioned by the Irish delegation from Wexford.  I had not travelled with that delegation; they travelled independently and I met them by accident.  That expert said that in Ireland's special case there was no clear necessity to opt for the nuclear solution.  Later that afternoon I spoke privately to the director of the nuclear section in the Energy Directorate General and he expressed the same view even more strongly.</P>
    <P>We all know that the Energy Commissioner, and I presume the entire apparatus of functionaries beneath him, are fanatically pro-nuclear.  The high functionary I spoke to said that in the case of Ireland he thought that a nuclear station was not necessarily the only option.  I did not drag that answer out, he volunteered it.  I do not wish to drag into this debate people who might feel that I was misrepresenting them, but I offer, in good faith, those two second-hand opinions from people who are at the absolute centre of these developments on the European scene.  I offer them merely as a hint that there may be something to be said for going easy here, for taking our time, perhaps for a year or more, until we see if there is any other way out of our impending very much expanded needs for electrical capacity.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether we could avoid this investment by means of coal-fired stations.  The Norwegians who have any amount of oil have decided to build a coal-fired station which will have such a capacity that it will be able to supply 8 or 9 per cent of their total electrical needs.  The Norwegians are rationing their extraction of the oil that is on their doorstep, very sensibly, but the building of a coal-fired station is not excluded merely because of their extensive oil <Col N="1738" /> resources.  The Minister spoke dismissively about suggestions of alternative sources of energy, wave power, tide power, wind power, biomass and so on.  I am sure I have heard the same opinions as the Minister did before he made up his mind about those sources but I have never heard it suggested that they are likely to contribute very much in the way of useable power.  However, I would not dismiss them, as the Minister has, as &ldquo;facile suggestions,&rdquo; an expression he may easily live to be ashamed of. There is enormous power latent in the waves, the wind and the sun.  It is true that technology is at a point where it cannot yet deliver that power in a shape which will run our industry or our houses, but it is not necessarily true once the idea has lodged and people are working on it that that is always going to be the case.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know whether the State is making any serious investment in research and development in these fields.  Yesterday evening on Telefís Éireann I saw a programme about a wave experimental project being carried on at University College, Cork.  The member of the UCC staff conducting it pointed out that it was only a small programme; he said they could do something more interesting if they had more money. I should like to know what likelihood there is that a Government on the brink of making this immense commitment, would, as a sign of their good faith, go out of their way to encourage and subsidise research of this kind on a larger scale, particularly when several of these sources&mdash;winds, waves and tides&mdash;are things we have in abundance.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what progress could be made in regard to energy conservation.  About 40 per cent of the energy we consume here is consumed at home.  That is an enormous percentage.  That amount of energy is burnt up in houses in space heating, electrical appliances, lighting and so on.  The waste in space heating here is immense because of poor insulation and poor house building standards.  Those standards were improved by the National Coalition, but only in connection <Col N="1739" /> with local authority houses. I should like to know what possibilities the Minister, or the people advising him, foresee in reducing the enormous explosion in energy demands by means of more rational use of this scarce resource.  For example, there is no such thing here as district heating and there is no such thing as the use of any electrical by-product. In some countries the waste heat generated by electrical generating stations is used not only for heating houses and plants but also for heating water at fish farms because fish fatten twice or three times the rate they would ordinarily grow in those conditions. I accept that they are small by-products; but I would like to be told authoritatively that cumulatively they would make no difference to our problem before I could face up to a nuclear solution which will cost roughly half the amount of money the Government propose borrowing this year for all their purposes put together.</P>
    <P>I did not like the Minister's nannyish tone when ticking off the people in Wexford for daring to question this necessity.  To tell the people in Wexford when he is on the brink of making this enormously important decision that these jobs could easily go elsewhere, that he is not short of people interested in them in Mayo, Sligo and so forth is no answer to a serious question.  I make allowances for the heat an Ard-Fheis might <Col N="1740" /> generate, although I understand it was perishingly cold there, but to deal with a serious topic along those lines was a mistake.  It makes people feel that the Minister is not really serious about this.  That was no reply to give to people who are anxious about this question.</P>
    <P>The Minister also told those people that the ESB&mdash;everybody knows that they want to press ahead with the scheme and know where their heart lies in this regard&mdash;are willing to hold a public debate; but what is the point of holding a public debate with people who have made their minds up?  I should like to make it clear that I have an unconditional regard for the responsibility of the people in the ESB, but I do not regard the ESB as the proper body to conduct a debate, because they have made their minds up on this question.</P>
    <P>I observe also that the first mention the Minister made of the Nuclear Energy Board was this evening although that board has been in being since 1973.  It is the job of that board, under section 5 of the Act establishing it, and not of the ESB, to promote knowledge, proficiency and research in nuclear science and technology and to act as an agency for the collection and dissemination of information on matters relating to nuclear science.</P>

      <P>In addition, the Ministers responsible for the pension terms of the Defence Forces, Garda Síochána, national and secondary teachers, local authorities and health boards, voluntary hospitals and the Labour Court have been consulted and have indicated general agreement with the draft scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, since the terms of the scheme have not been finally settled it is not <Col N="1636" /> possible to say that consultations have been completed.  However, at this stage it is clear that the scheme is acceptable in principle to nearly all the organisations concerned.  Certain problems, particularly in regard to the contributions in respect of transfers, have emerged in the course of the consultations. It is hoped to arrive at a general agreement with the bodies concerned on these points in the fairly near future when the way should then be clear to prepare a final scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the third part of the question, the position is that, pending finalisation of the scheme, civil servants are being allowed, subject to certain conditions, to reckon pensionable service in the Defence Forces, Garda Síochána and national and secondary teaching.  I would, of course, have no objection to any of the other organisations entering into arrangements for the reciprocal transfer of pension rights, provided the organisations concerned agree to accept the terms ultimately provided in the transfer scheme.</P>

      <P>The estimates of revenue from corporation tax in 1978 are based on company profits in earlier years, since this is the basis of the 1978 payments.  From past experience it is expected that a significant proportion of the payments will be made in the first quarter of the year.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. P. Barry</b> asked the Minister for Finance why he is allowing for a drop of over £3 million in anticipated revenue under the &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; heading of non-tax revenue; and if he will give a breakdown of the revenues involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The drop relates to accrued interest included in the issue price of tranches of Government stocks.  When these tranches are created and sold, the selling price includes an element for interest which has accrued from the date of the last dividend date for the stock in question up to the date of sale.  Quite obviously that part of the sale price which relates to such accrued interest cannot be treated as a capital receipt and so it is treated as an item of current income.  The amount of tranches created in the last quarter of 1977 and to be created in the first three quarters of 1978 is expected to be less than in the last quarter of 1976 and the first three quarters of 1977.  In consequence accrued interest in 1978 is expected to be some £3 million less than in 1977.</P>
      <P>Apart from accrued interest, fee stamp at £3.25 million account for most of the remainder of the 1978 estimate.  Given the uncertainty attached to these small remaining individual items it is not possible to give a further breakdown of what is essentially a global estimate.</P>
