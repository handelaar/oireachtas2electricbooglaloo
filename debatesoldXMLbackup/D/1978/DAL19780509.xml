    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will intervene to prevent building work at the junction of Briarfield Road, Kilbarrack, and Foxfield Grove, Raheny, Dublin, which would deny residents of the Briarfield Road area ready access to essential services in Raheny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation that in 1972 planning permission was refused for the erection of a two storey dwelling on this site which is situated between 211 and 212 Foxfield Grove.  An appeal was lodged against that decision and on 16 May 1974 permission was granted for the development subject to three conditions. A valid planning permission exists for the development of this site and in the circumstances there is no action I can take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Minister for asking him to involve himself in what appears to be a trivial matter.  In fact, although it is quite small the implications are quite large. Could the Minister ask that the access from one side of the estate to the other be left after this house is built?  I am sure he appreciates the difficulties of old people, mothers and school children. This will cause very great inconvenience. A very small pedestrian passageway would overcome the difficulties. Would the Minister not try to intervene in this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, full planning permission exists and at the time of the old hearing under the appeal the residents association were in favour of this development.  The chairman and secretary of the residents association appeared at the old hearing and were in favour of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is misinformed.  The residents association were in favour of this development on condition that pedestrian access was permitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister confusing the permission to build the house on condition that the pedestrian access was left?  Is there any reference to that in the Minister's brief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances, would the Minister refer the matter back to the corporation?  A very simple and small alteration in the present plan would create convenience for the local people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>They tried to.  The only reason this relatively small matter is being brought to the Minister's attention is because everything else has failed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment to what extent Ireland has complied with the 1975 directive of the Council of EEC Ministers responsible for the environment, under which the nine member states <Col N="503" /> must bring the bathing waters around their coasts up to certain minimum standards; and if the provisions of that directive have been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This directive calls for compliance with certain standards in bathing areas within ten years of its notification to member states. While only limited water quality sampling of the type envisaged in the directive has been carried out here, the position is that bathing waters generally in Ireland already have a much higher quality than the standard required by the directive.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were requested by my Department in July 1976 to examine the implications of the directive for their areas, including the identification of bathing places for which sampling in accordance with the directive might be undertaken.  My Department are at present considering, in consultation with the local authorities concerned, the arrangements for having such sampling carried out.  It should be appreciated, however, that the directive applies only to bathing places in which bathing is explicitly authorised or in which bathing is not prohibited and is traditionally practiced by a large number of bathers. This limits very greatly its application in Irish conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us, arising out of this directive and the consideration which his Department are giving to it, if any new finance or staff have been allocated to remedying the existing problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at this stage.  As I said in my reply, all local authorities have received a copy of the directive with a view to having it applied.  I also said that our standards are higher than those required by this directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in his answer that only limited sampling had taken place.  This gave the impression that the sampling was not as comprehensive as it should have been. How extensive was it?  Was it consistent with the kind of sampling which <Col N="504" /> would be a meaningful base for progress in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Sampling in accordance with the directive is to be undertaken by the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that over 3,000 dwellings in the Dublin city area are without bathrooms, that there are 2,419 with outside toilets only and that there are 707 dwellings which have no separate toilets at all; and the proposals he has in respect of this major sanitary and hygiene deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  It is difficult to reconcile the figures referred to by the Deputy with data available from the census and other official sources.</P>
      <P>Regarding improvement works to dwellings, I announced in December last a scheme of greatly increased grants which is designed to encourage the provision of improvement works, including the sanitary facilities in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="505" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a little surprising that the figures given by the Dublin City Manager have not apparently found a place in the Minister's files?  Is that oversight indicative of an attitude which does not seem to point at getting rid of this major sanitary and hygiene deficiency if the Minister is not even aware of the figures, which are the City Manager's figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, Dublin Corporation are unable to trace the sources for those figures which the Deputy has submitted. Dublin Corporation have not got the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously there is confusion here, because those figures were provided to me in a written reply to a question to the City Manager, so they are Corporation figures.  I will forward a copy of those figures to the Minister.  Does the Minister appreciate that the grant schemes which he mentioned, and which are obviously very welcome, do not apply to probably 95 per cent of the dwellings here because they are rented accommodation and a condition of the grant is that the house has to be in fairly good condition? By definition those houses are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A house can be brought up to good condition by way of the improvement grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is rented accommodation and it would be unrealistic to ask a tenant to build on a bathroom. There are a tremendous number of dwellings and people involved in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the proposals he has to ensure an adequate water supply in the Dublin area for future years; and whether he is aware of the difficulty being experienced in recent months in the operation of the Dublin water system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility for the provision and operation of an adequate water supply system in an area is primarily a matter for the relevant local authority.  I am aware that difficulties <Col N="509" /> are currently being experienced in certain areas in Dublin due to low pressures arising out of the necessity to ensure as far as is practicable even distribution of the available supply.</P>
    <P>The Dublin local authorities have undertaken several projects which when completed will result in an increase in the water supply for the area from the present 63/65 million gallons per day to well over 100 million gallons per day. Already the capacity of the treatment works at Ballymore Eustace has been increased by 20 million gallons per day. The crux is that the extra water cannot be taken to the city area until a new pipeline has been laid from there to Saggart.  Approval of the purchase of the pipes for this project was given by my Department as long ago as September 1973.  Unfortunately, the local authority encountered major difficulties when they sought to acquire the wayleaves for the scheme.  These difficulties were only finally resolved within the past few months.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides for the laying of over 16 miles of special 60 inch diameter pipe.  In order to speed up the completion of the project the work is being divided into three contracts. Even by this approach it will be some time before a fully satisfactory quantity of water will be available in all areas in Dublin.  It is, therefore, important that consumers should be aware of the need for economy in their use of water in the intervening period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the real seriousness of this situation? Is there no way that a compulsory purchase order can be put on a complete line of wayleaves in circumstances where people in Dublin city and indeed also in the expanding county, are often without water for long periods?  Because there was resistance to wayleaves since 1973 it is outrageous that this can happen in the circumstances that I am describing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Question Nos. 16, 17 and 30 together.  In the course of routine maintenance by Dublin Corporation it was discovered that there had been movement of roofing trusses and roof barges in some houses in section 2 of their South Finglas housing estate.  The affected roofs were investigated immediately by the appropriate structural experts and advisers of the corporation and the National Building Agency, assisted by experts of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The National Building Agency subsequently reported to me that immediate precautionary action had been taken to eliminate any hazard arising from the movement of the trusses and barges, that the various experts and advisers had established the nature and extent of the problem in the affected roofs, that the experts had agreed a permanent solution in the case of the three affected house blocks which would not involve detenanting of the houses and should not cause undue disturbance for the tenants.  Arrangements have been made by the agency with the scheme contractors for the carrying out of this work.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive a full report within the next few weeks from the agency on the finding of the technical experts and on their detailed evaluation of the probable causes of the movement of the roof trusses and barges, following their inspection of all the houses in this section of the Finglas estate.</P>
      <P>When the detailed findings of the technical experts have been submitted to me, I will have them evaluated by my own technical advisers.  In the meantime I do not intend to conduct a public inquiry into the matter.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell me&mdash;because apparently we will not make any progress along the lines I was pursuing&mdash;if, in view of the fact that these houses were built under what is called a low-cost housing scheme, it is reasonable to believe it would be worth carrying out a survey of other houses, not merely in this estate but in others built around that time under the prevailing economic conditions as applied to housebuilding at the time in order to ensure that this type of deficiency&mdash;because deficiency it is in some way or other&mdash;is not more rampant than we might believe?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is satisfied that the ownership of land by Dublin Corporation within the Dublin city boundary of approximately 70 acres in total for housing purposes is adequate to meet future demand; and, if not, the plans he has with respect to helping Dublin Corporation to fulfil the expected needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the latest progress report submitted to me, Dublin Corporation have acquired, or have available, sites for 15,756 dwellings, including 2,420 within the Dublin city boundary.  In common with other housing authorities, they have been authorised to acquire land which is needed for their on-going housing construction programme by way of overdraft or temporary borrowing, and to recoup the cost, including appropriate holding charges, in the normal way from their capital allocation as part of the cost of their new housing schemes.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the corporation themselves to decide the extent of such acquisitions within the city boundaries, or elsewhere, having regard to the requirements of their housing construction programme.  The corporation adopted this programme, which includes their central city redevelopment programme, having regard to their accumulated housing needs and anticipated future demand.  I am satisfied that the corporation are competent to make the necessary decisions and take any necessary action within available capital resources, which this year represent an increase of about 9 per cent on the generally acknowledged generous level of their 1977 capital allocation. I am also hopeful that their housing problem will be substantially eased by the current upsurge in new building and reconstruction in the private sector which has been stimulated by the increased financial aids provided by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 26 together.  Certain tenant purchasers of local authority houses who purchased their houses outright under pre-July 1973 schemes now qualify for a cash refund to compensate them for the higher price they had to pay, as compared with the July 1973 scheme.  The refund will be payable by the local authority on the following basis:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the price paid under the pre-July 1973 scheme was higher than that payable under the July 1973 scheme, the tenant purchaser will be refunded one quarter of the difference between the pre-July 1973 price and what he would have paid under the July 1973 scheme.</P>
      <P>(2)  The concession will not apply where the house was resold by the tenant purchaser before 1 March 1978.</P>
      <P>In addition, where a tenant purchaser is already entitled to a reduction in the repayment period by virtue of a higher price paid under a pre-July 1973 scheme, the benefit of the reduction in the repayment period will also apply where the amount outstanding is redeemed in full as and from 1 March 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that the capital allocation for the provision of houses to the Wexford Corporation is totally inadequate, having regard to the housing needs in the town; and if he will increase the allocation in order that Wexford Corporation may make preparations for the building of substantial numbers of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of the capital allocations made to date to Wexford Corporation for their local authority housing construction programme in 1978 is £820,000.  Of this amount, £620,000 was allocated in respect of the authority's on-going commitments at 1 January 1978, for which they had claimed £662,000.</P>
      <P>The balance of £200,000 which was allocated for new work to be started by them before the 31 July 1978, was the maximum which I could give them at this stage of the year out of their claim for £372,000.  Despite the sizeable increase in the public capital programme allocation for local authority housing this year, as compared with 1977, special overall allocations to Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, existing commitments and new work started early in this year pre-empted all but about £7.5 million of the capital available.</P>
      <P>Local authorities sought £23 million for about 5,000 new dwellings to be started before 31 July 1978.  In making the new work allocations I had particular regard to the comparative urgency of housing needs in each area and to the need to maintain a reasonable spread of employment on the programme generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> Wexford Corporation fared relatively better in this regard than many other authorities because I made special allowance for the housing needs' position in the town.  The corporation have been informed that a general review of expenditure on the programme will be carried out by my Department during the summer and I will be glad to make an additional allocation to them later in the year if I find that this is possible, following the review.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the corporation should be able to maintain a reasonable level of activity on their programme on the basis of the total allocation of £820,000 so far made to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the taxation changes announced in the budget as well as making some other provisions which I will explain as I go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> The budget which I introduced on 1 February was framed in the context of the Government's medium-term plans to reduce inflation and tackle the serious problem of unemployment by pursuing a policy of rapid and sustainable economic growth.  It was designed to give a stimulus to activity in 1978 and to set the economy on course for achieving our medium-term targets.  The cornerstones of this budgetary strategy were increased income tax allowances and a higher level of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The generous increases in the personal income tax allowances were a vital element in securing an orderly and moderate development of incomes.  As Deputies are aware, agreement has been reached since the budget on a national pay agreement to cover a period of 15 months.  The Government welcomes the ratification of this agreement by the employers' side and the ICTU.  Combined with the income tax concessions provided for in this Bill, the agreement guarantees significant increases in real incomes.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increases in personal income tax allowances, the budget also included a package of business incentives designed to encourage the spirit of enterprise and expansion in the private sector.  These include corporation tax reliefs for small companies, simplification of the arrangements governing a special reduced rate of corporation tax for manufacturing companies which achieve expansion, indefinite extension of the period of operation of free depreciation in respect of capital expenditure on new plant and machinery, free depreciation for industrial buildings and continuation of stock relief for a further year. Certain restrictions on interest relief are being modified.  This package of measures should provide a positive climate for the expansion which we require in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I will now comment on the various measures contained in the Bill. Chapter I of Part I contains a number of income tax provisions.  The proposed increases in personal allowances set out in the budget are provided for in section 5.  These increases are of unprecedented amounts and in themselves <Col N="553" /> will result in a significant increase in post-tax income for all taxpayers. The increases for married persons are proportionately greater than the increases for other persons. This derives from the decision to set the married person's allowance at double the single person's allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 2 changes the basis of division of their personal allowances and reliefs between spouses in cases of separate assessment.  The section provides that where separate assessment has been claimed or is claimed in future, the allowances and reliefs of the married couple will in general be divided equally between them instead of in proportion to their incomes as has been the case up to now.  Where reliefs relate to particular outlays, for example mortgage interest, the relief will of course be divided by reference to the amounts borne by each spouse.</P>
    <P>The right of each married person to choose to be assessed to tax separately from his or her spouse&mdash;without, of course, affecting the total liability of the couple&mdash;has long been a feature of our income tax code but this right has not been widely availed of.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that every married woman who has income of her own will become aware of her rights under existing tax laws, including in particular her entitlement to be separately assessed to tax and to make a separate return of income.  I have, therefore, arranged that the Revenue Commissioners will issue to married women with incomes of their own a leaflet explaining entitlements under tax law and a simple form by which a married woman may, if she wishes, exercise her right to claim separate assessment.</P>
    <P>Section 7, like several other measures in the Bill, is designed specifically to encourage business enterprise and investment.  It effects some modification to existing restrictions on income tax relief for interest payments, so as to remove disincentives to investment in business.  As announced in the budget, unrestricted relief is to be available for interest on borrowings for investment in private trading companies. Section 7 provides accordingly and, as an additional measure, <Col N="554" /> allows special relief for interest up to a maximum of £2,000 a year to a full-time employee or full-time director of a public trading company in respect of borrowings to acquire shares in the company.  The reliefs thus provided by the section are in addition to the amount of relief available to anyone for interest generally.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 provide a remission of income tax to certain workers and employees along the lines of that granted in the case of public service employees who became liable for PAYE in 1976.  Section 8 provides for a tax remission of one-half of the tax for 1976-77 to cross-border workers who became liable for income tax on the PAYE basis in the United Kingdom in April 1977, following the introduction of the new double taxation convention between the two countries.  This remission was announced on 12 August 1977.</P>
    <P>Section 9 grants a remission of a half-year's tax to certain employees who were transferred from a public service to a PAYE employment prior to 1976-77.  Section 10 effects a technical amendment to take account of the repeal of estate duty and the introduction of capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer briefly to a number of other income tax provisions to implement measures announced in my budget statement. Section 1 provides for income tax relief on a uniform basis for premiums on all new life assurance policies. Section 3 removes the cash limitation on the amount of premiums paid by self-employed persons on retirement annuity policies which qualify for income tax relief.  The percentage limitation of 15 per cent of net relevant earnings will remain applicable to these premiums&mdash;it corresponds with a similar provision for superannuation payments by employees.</P>
    <P>Section 4 repeals the provisions introduced in 1976 for the assessment of employees' motoring benefits-inkind in minimum amounts.  Those 1976 provisions imposed a minimum charge of £300 or 15 per cent of the cost of the car, irrespective of the amount of the employee's private use <Col N="555" /> of the car.  The effect of the repeal will be to restore fully the former long-standing basis of the assessment of these benefits by reference to the relevant facts of each particular case. These arrangements in future will therefore take full account of each employee's circumstances, including the amount of his private use of his employer's car and the relationship such private use bears to the working usage.  The effect of section 6 is to exempt from income tax the income derived by thalidomide children from the investment of the tax-free compensation moneys received by them.</P>
    <P>Chapter II deals with farmer taxation. In my budget speech I said that I would be implementing the manifesto commitments on farmer taxation in the Finance Bill.  These concern the retention of the notional basis as an alternative to the accounts basis, a single payment date at the end of the financial year, a deduction for contractors' fees on the notional basis and the granting of a credit against a farmer's tax bill for the preceding year's rates.  These concessions are designed to encourage agricultural developments as well as ensuring that farmers are taxed fairly.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the budget measures the Government also recognised the need for a more equitable tax contribution from the farming sector.  To this end, an additional 7,000 farmers have been made liable for income tax by lowering the threshold from £75 RV to £60 RV.  However, the majority of these newly liable farmers will not have to pay their full tax as marginal relief is being made available for those between £60 RV and £69 RV. Another measure designed to achieve a more equitable contribution from farmers is the raising of the multiplier from 65 to 90.  The need for these measures is clear from the low yield from farmer taxation in 1977-78. which is expected to be about £14 million.  The new measures are estimated to yield about £24 million from farmers in the tax year 1978-79.  Given current levels of farm income such a contribution from farmers cannot be regarded as onerous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> Sections 11 to 16 of the Bill give effect to the changes I have mentioned as well as to some other provisions. These are described in detail in the Explanatory Memorandum and I need only make a brief reference to a few particular points.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides, among other matters, for a new section 21 to be substituted in the Finance Act, 1974. This involves the granting of a deduction on the notional basis for contractors' fees in addition to the existing deduction for wages paid to employees who are registered for PAYE and social welfare purposes.  This basis for the allowance of wages has attracted the criticism that it represents discrimination against a farmer who employs a son or daughter on the farm, since employment by a father is generally not insurable employment and therefore not eligible for the deduction. There are two points I would like to make about this.  Firstly, this change was made necessary by the widespread practice among farmers of claiming to have paid wages up to the amount of the single person's allowance to members of their families. It is virtually impossible for an inspector to check the validity of such claims.  The second point is that any farmer who pays wages to a son or daughter who cannot be registered for social welfare purposes may obtain an appropriate deduction by opting for the accounts basis.  He would then be in precisely the same situation as any other trader or businessman who employs his children.</P>
    <P>The new section 21 also provides that, where all the partners in a partnership are already separately liable for income tax, the antifragmentation provisions of section 17 of the Finance Act, 1974 will not apply.  This means that in such cases only a farmer's proportionate share of the land occupied by the partners will be taken into account for the purposes of a notional assessment.  The new section 21A provides for the granting of the preceding year's rates as a credit against the tax bills of full-time farmers.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the situation which would arise under the Finance <Col N="557" /> Act, 1977 whereby certain farmers are liable for interest on overdue tax in 1977-78, which interest would be calculated by reference to a notional assessment later found on appeal to be an over-assessment.  The section provides for the calculation of such interest by reference to the actual tax due.  As announced on 21 October last, it also provides for the extension of the period before which interest is charged on tax overdue from farmers in 1977-78 from two months to four months, thus giving farmers up to 31 December 1977 to pay the instalment due on 1 September 1977.</P>
    <P>I now turn next to the sections of the Bill which provide for the corporation tax incentives announced in the budget.  The restoration of tax exemption for agricultural and fishery co-operatives is proposed by section 17 and the provisions are intended to operate from 1 April 1978.  These provisions have been formulated with a view to securing optimum growth in agriculture and fisheries through the best efforts of the co-operatives, while at the same time taking due account of the legitimate interests of other traders.  The implementing arrangements are set out in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that in 1978 and 1979 manufacturing companies will have to meet only one expansion target&mdash;that is an employment target of, basically, a 3 per cent increase each year&mdash;in order to qualify for the special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax.  The section also provides an option for such companies to have the 1977 test of increase in output gauged, if desired, by reference to the value of their 1976 sales increased by 19 per cent&mdash;rather than by the formula which was specified in last year's Finance Act.  The section also opens participation in the incentive to manufacturing companies which commenced trading in 1977 or 1978 in order that they too may bring forward new employment-creation in manufacturing.</P>
    <P>Small companies, because of their employment potential, merit a special incentive to spur them along the growth path and, so, section 20 provides <Col N="558" /> a significant and retrospective increase in the threshold at which the 35 per cent rate of corporation tax ceases to apply and in the threshold at which the normal 45 per cent rate of corporation tax begins to apply.  I trust that this valuable measure will help small companies to grow and thus lead to early new employment in such companies.  Small companies which are manufacturers can, of course, qualify for the special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing companies to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 27 is to maintain closely the relationship between the rate of corporation tax and the tax credit which attaches to distributions out of company profits, so as to match the position which obtained prior to the cut of 5 percentage points in the rates of corporation tax from 1 January 1977.</P>
    <P>By maintaining the old tax credit, thirty-five/sixty-fifths of actual distributions made by the companies, the Exchequer would be retaining a smaller percentage of the normal corporation tax rate than was the case before.  I have no grounds on which to justify that.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Exchequer is obliged in many cases to give to recipients of distributions the benefit of the tax credit attaching to those distributions even where the underlying profits bear little or no corporation tax because of stock relief or accelerated capital allowances, for example. The standard tax credit also attaches to distributions out of manufacturing profits which qualify for the special 25 per cent rate of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the rate of tax credit follows on the reduction of corporation tax rates, and the overall effect should not reduce shareholders' incomes.</P>
    <P>A further series of proposals also designed to promote investment and encourage business enterprise is contained in Chapter IV of Part I of the Bill.  These proposals&mdash;namely sections 21, 22, 24 and 25&mdash;deal with capital allowances, which are given for both income tax and corporation tax.  As <Col N="559" /> announced in the budget, free depreciation for new plant and machinery is now being extended indefinitely. This step should facilitate advance planning by businesses.  As a corollary, the shipping investment allowance, which has been suspended for several years past because of the existence of free depreciation, is being withdrawn; this allowance was introduced when free depreciation was not available and its retention would be superfluous.</P>
    <P>The introduction of free depreciation for expenditure by industrialists on their buildings was announced in the budget.  Section 24 makes provision accordingly and also extends free depreciation to hoteliers for expenditure incurred by them on their hotel buildings.  Section 25 removes a technical bar to the giving of capital allowances to taxpayers in respect of their contributions to capital expenditure incurred wholly or partly on behalf of traders by local authorities. Section 26 gives effect to the continuation of stock relief for a further year as announced in the Budget.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains one section, section 28, which confirms four orders relating to excise duty matters which were made by the Government under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957.  Details of these orders are set out in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned with stamp duty.  Sections 29, 30 and 32 are aimed at counteracting the avoidance or the possibility of avoidance of stamp duty in the case of various transactions.  The transactions in question are the transfers of leasehold interests in property, transfers on marriage, conveyances or transfers in contemplation of a sale and the making of gifts subject to the retention of a power of revocation in the donor.</P>
    <P>Section 31 revokes an order made last year which covered the matters now dealt with in sections 29 and 30.</P>
    <P>Section 33 abolishes the stamp duty on contracts for the construction of office buildings.  The purpose of this measure is to promote output and employment in the construction industry, which is one of the country's largest <Col N="560" /> employers, and is thus a continuation of the Government's policy of boosting activity in this sector of the economy which I referred to in my budget statement. Part, at least, of the stamp duty revenue forgone will be recouped by way of increased stamp duty arising from conveyances of sites and increased income tax receipts as a result of the new development projects which can be expected to materialise as a consequence of this measure.</P>
    <P>Parts IV to VI of the Bill contain provisions on capital taxes.  As Deputies will be aware, I announced on 5 April that a separate Bill will be introduced later this month to implement the changes in capital gains tax proposed in the budget.  Section 34 reduces by half the period of time in which a charge to death duties remains on real and leasehold property in the hands of purchasers or mortgagees.  This provision, which relates to taxes which ceased to apply after 31 March 1975, should be of considerable assistance to purchasers of such property and to practitioners.</P>
    <P>Section 35 is a relieving measure which provides for an adjustment of estate duty in certain cases.  It applies in the case of certain deaths occurring between 1 April 1972 and 1 April 1975 where there was a loss due to the decline in the value of securities between the date of death and the date when the securities were sold to pay the estate duty liability.</P>
    <P>Section 36 gives effect to the decision I announced in my budget statement to abolish the wealth tax. As a consequence of the abolition, the section provides in addition that purchasers of property after 4 April last shall not be affected by any latent charge to wealth tax.  The section also reduces the rate of interest on outstanding wealth tax and on repayments of that tax from 18 per cent to 15 per cent per annum as from the date of the passing of the Finance Act.  I might refer at this stage to sections 41 and 44 which make similar provision in respect of other taxes. The reduced rate of interest is considered reasonable in current circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> Part VI of the Bill deals with changes in capital acquisitions tax. Section 37 gives effect to the proposal in my budget statement to grant relief from capital acquisitions tax to gifts and inheritances of heritage houses and gardens subject to certain conditions being met.  One of these conditions is the provision of reasonable facilities for viewing to members of the public.  Section 38 amends the conditions for the granting of an exemption from capital acquisitions tax in the case of certain Government securities which are taken by persons who are neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>Sections 39, 40 and 42 relate to the changes in capital acquisitions tax which I announced in my budget statement.  The thresholds of liability for three categories of beneficiaries are doubled and the ranges relating to the rates of tax to be applied in the case of such beneficiaries are correspondingly adjusted upwards.  The relevant thresholds for obligatory delivery of returns are also doubled as is the annual exemption for small gifts.</P>
    <P>Finally, I turn to Part VII which deals with a number of miscellaneous matters.  Section 45 deals with two matters relating to the disclosure of information by the Revenue Commissioners. In relation to the scheme of £1,000 grants introduced by the Government last year to help first-time owner occupiers of new houses, Revenue staff will be empowered to disclose certain information to staff of the Department of the Environment.  I might mention that a similar authority in relation to pay-related social welfare benefits is provided by section 12 of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973.  The section also empowers the Revenue Commissioners to disclose information to rating authorities in relation to the occupation of agricultural land for the purpose of establishing the entitlement of persons with valuations at or above the valuation threshold for income tax liability when the system of national aggregation of valuations provided for in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1978 is brought into <Col N="562" /> operation.  Because of the administrative difficulties in applying national aggregation in 1978, aggregation this year will be on a rating area basis rather than on a national basis.</P>
    <P>Sections 46 and 47 have been introduced in order to overcome certain technical difficulties in relation to Government guaranteed debt and to the management of the national debt. Section 48 deals with the winding up of the Road Fund with effect from 1 January 1978.  The fund was originally based on the assigned revenue principle, that is to say that all revenue collected from motor taxation would be assigned to roads.  This principle came to be diluted from 1966 onwards when increases in motor tax were for general Exchequer purposes. The assigned revenue principle as applied to roads was further diluted last year with the abolition of motor tax on cars up to and including 16 h.p.  The fund has thus become something of an anachronism in our public finances.  Instead of the Road Fund the finances for roads from this year on comes directly from the Exchequer through the Environment Vote.  This does not mean any reduction in finance for roads.  In fact there is a greater investment in roads this year than for some years past.</P>
    <P>Section 49 is intended to give the Minister for Finance certain powers in relation to our official development assistance programme.  As Deputies will be aware, Ireland now makes a significant contribution to developing countries both directly by way of our bilateral programme and, indirectly, through the aegis of certain international organisations, for example, the European Communities or the United Nations.  The provision of loans by developed countries and their guaranteeing of loans given by a third party to developing countries are important instruments of development co-operation.  Section 49 will allow the use of such instruments as and when it is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 50 provides for the repeal of certain enactments.  The effect of one of these repeals is to abolish the remaining part of the rebate payable to brewers using home-roasted, homeflaked <Col N="563" /> or home-malted cereals.  This is being done in response to a formal complaint by the Commission of the European Communities that the rebate is incompatible with the EEC Treaty.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this Bill gives effect to the taxation changes announced in the budget and that is what a Finance Bill generally does but there are two provisions in this Bill that were not announced in the Budget and that are taxation provisions. One is section 50 to which he has now referred but no mention was made of it in the budget.  The other, and the more serious one, is section 27 which deals with tax credits.  Tax credits are matters that are normally the concern of accountants, solicitors and people of that type who are familiar with the very technical problems involved and the ordinary person does not realise that he also may be involved.  And to bring in this section 27 which the Minister says will have no effect on shareholders in the Finance Bill without making any announcement in the budget is dishonest on the part of the Minister because it will have an effect on shareholders' funds.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate this because you have to go through balance sheets of various companies to see how much was distributed and how much tax credit was claimed prior to that.  You have to make a number of estimations on the dividends paid and on the size of the stock market in Ireland and so on.  My estimate is that this will mean £2 million to the Government.  It is a form of taxation.  Smaller amounts than that were announced by the Minister in his budget speech.  This is a very technical matter but from the point of view of its effect on people it is a wide ranging form of taxation.  It will have an effect on all shareholders because they will be caught.  Even those not paying tax who invested their money in Irish companies will be 7 per cent worse off if section 27 is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people will express the view that the fact that such people are shareholders in a company means that they must have money and, therefore, such an imposition would not matter <Col N="564" /> because they are wealthy.  That is not so.  This will also affect every pension fund that invests in an Irish company. The income from investments by directors of pension funds will now be 7 per cent worse off.  It will also prove a disincentive to those anxious to invest money here.  Those who invest in a business in America, England or anywhere else will not be at the same disadvantage. Their dividends will be paid to them without this tax adjustment. At a time when we are seeking to help Irish companies the Minister is not doing much about it.  Many companies will pay the same amount out in dividends and there will be no option on the shareholders' part but to accept the loss of this 7 per cent.  Many other shareholders will be so organised that they will insist on a general meeting of their company and demand that their loss of income be restored to them through a higher dividend.  That in turn will reduce the amount of profit that can be retained in the company for investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this was consequential on the reduction from 50 to 45 per cent in corporation profits tax announced in last year's budget but if that is so why was it not included in last year's Finance Bill?  Why did the Minister decide to do it this year when his predecessor evidently refused to do it last year?  If this change was thought necessary it should have been made in last year's Finance Bill and not one year later.  I suppose in a narrow way one could say that what the Minister stated is correct, that the shareholders are no worse off than they were prior to the reduction but those whose shares are in companies affected by the new 45 per cent rate will be worse off than they were last year if this section is passed.</P>
    <P>If the amount of money involved is £2 million and it is spread over all the companies on the Irish stock market it will be a small amount but the way it is being introduced will affect business people and investors in Irish companies.  The measure should have been more carefully spelled out and should have been announced in the budget.  The Minister should have referred to the provisions of section <Col N="565" /> 50 in the budget also.  These two forms of taxation were not alluded to in the budget.  The taxation provided for in section 27 is so technical that it is probably only understood by accountants, stockbrokers, solicitors and such people.  The most serious criticism I have of the Minister in this regard is that he did not refer to this in the budget and he did not tell us how much he expected to get in 1978 as a result of its introduction.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in the course of his speech that the climate was right for industrial expansion in the private sector.  Since the budget was introduced we have heard a number of statements by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development of a threatening nature to the effect that the Government had done their bit, were now finished and if the employment targets were not realised the blame would rest squarely on the shoulders of the private sector of the economy.  This was not an off-the-cuff remark in the course of a casual conversation after dinner somewhere; it is a theme that has been constantly coming through the speeches of various Ministers over the last three months. If private industry accepts the role of being the most significant group of people involved in helping the Government to realise their job target then it will be blamed if the target is not reached.  They would be stupid to allow themselves to be put in that position.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the chairman of one of the biggest public companies here refusing, at the annual general meeting of his company, to allow himself to be cast in the role of villain if the targets of the Government are not realised.  That person, the chairman of Cement Roadstone Limited, in the course of the annual report of the company, said:</P>
    <P>At the same time, private enterprise is unwisely allowing a responsibility in the provision of jobs, to a measure that is impractical to be attributed to it.  We read&mdash;&ldquo;Private enterprise is on trial&rdquo; and&mdash;&ldquo;Private enterprise will be held accountable to society&rdquo;.  If this be <Col N="566" /> not countered now, will private enterprise be the whipping boy in a year's time?</P>
    <P>The chairman of that company was right to refuse to allow the private sector of the economy to take the blame if employment targets are not reached.  It is the Government's job to create the atmosphere in which the private sector can operate and make profits.  Profits are an essential part of the private sector of the economy because, without profits you will not have reinvestment and without reinvestment you will not have more jobs.  This is why the thin end of the wedge in section 27 will be a disincentive to that investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister listed a number of other inducements in the budget and in the Finance Bill to companies to expand their employment and their activities.  He listed corporation profits tax relief for small companies.  That was always there.  It is being expanded now, but the relief is not being expanded at the same rate as hitherto. It was at £5,000 with marginal relief up to £10,000.  That was changed to £10,000 with marginal relief up to £20,000.  One was 100 per cent more than the other.  Now it has been cut-back. The Minister has reduced the marginal rate.  A small company is now defined at £25,000.  On the basis of the previous two levels of corporation tax relief for small companies, the level of £5,000 and £10,000, the marginal relief was given for 100 per cent over that.  Now that is reduced to 35 per cent and, even though it maintains the 100 per cent differential, it is marginally less beneficial to companies above the level at which they can get the full relief.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>... simplification of the arrangements governing a special reduced rate of corporation tax for manufacturing companies which achieve expansion...</P>
    <P>The Government did not introduce that relief.  That was in the previous Finance Bill.  The Government have removed the sales qualification.  Two forms of qualification were necessary.  One was a 3 per cent growth in employment <Col N="567" /> numbers as measured by the social insurance stamps used by the company, and the other was a sales increase. They have removed that.  That is a good idea.  As I said earlier, private enterprise will create employment only if it is allowed to invest its profits and expand.  Part of that expansion would be in sales which would allow for the employment of more people. Therefore the Minister is right.  The increase in sales is superfluous.  It does not really make any difference.  No private company will increase its employment level without getting or anticipating an increase in sales from the extra production they will get from increased employment.  Therefore, the increase in the level of sales is superfluous in that regard.  Once you have the increase in the level of employment the increase in the level of sales will follow.  That relief was there already. It is nothing new.  This is just a refinement of it by removing the sales element.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an indefinite extension of the period of operation of free depreciation in respect of capital expenditure.  That is a good idea and I approve of it.  There is one point I should like to make to the Minister and it applies also to the abolition of the stamp duty on office blocks.  It is too late now because the Bill has been published, but it may come up in another context later on and the Minister might bear it in mind.  When stamp duty on the construction of office blocks was abolished, it was abolished for a period of two years. Anybody in the construction industry will tell the Minister this had a dramatic effect on employment in the construction industry last year.  People who had plans for the building of office blocks brought them forward to make sure they would qualify for the relief on the stamp duty.</P>
    <P>There is no such pressure on them now.  They do not have to build now because, since the stamp duty has been abolished, they need not build the office block until they are ready.  This is a question of hoping to lean on the construction companies to start work earlier than they otherwise might do <Col N="568" /> because there is no pressure on them since the removal of the stamp duty. I have spoken to a number of people in the construction industry and they believe an extremely important part of last year's budget was the lifting for a period of the stamp duty on the construction of office blocks.  It made people go ahead and build if they wanted to take advantage of the abolition of the stamp duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister says all this creates the climate for the confidence necessary for business people to expand their activities.  It needs more than that.  It needs some certainty about the future. There is an air of euphoria amongst business people now, but they are worried about what will happen next year.  They are worried about the level of borrowing the Government are engaging in.  They are worried about the level of taxation they feel will be necessary to finance that borrowing. They are resentful of the onus being put on them to increase employment. From their point of view, the climate may not be correct for increased employment.</P>
    <P>They have an obligation to their shareholders and to their employees. They see that as an obligation to protect their shareholders' funds and to protect the employment of those now in their firms.  After that, given the right environment, they want to see that stable environment extending over more than just 12 months.  They cannot recoup the cost of investment in 12 months.  Therefore, they want to see it extending two, three or four years into the future before they will risk more capital investment.  Understandably they are cautious.</P>
    <P>I want to bring another matter to the attention of the Minister and the House.  How soundly based is the present euphoria?  A book was issued recently.  I do not think the people who compiled it would attach any great significance to it because it is compiled from a series of questionnaires sent to a large number of firms right across the whole spectrum of Irish industry.  This is the <i>Business Forecast</i> for March 1978, produced jointly by the CII and the ESRI.  I am sure the Minister has read this report.  It lists <Col N="569" /> about 25 categories of industrial activity and gives the views of the people in those industries about the immediate past and the immediate future.  In about 95 per cent of these categories a warning is given.  In regard to textiles it is said that the level of orders has fallen sharply.  In regard to garments, the level of demand is still below normal; production and home sales are forecast to increase but exports are expected to fall.</P>
    <P>The section on the leather and footwear industry reads as follows:</P>
    <P>An upturn is apparent in this sector.  Employment has increased slightly but Home Sales, Production and Exports report sharp increases. The level of demand has fallen.</P>
    <P>The section on the wood and cork industries reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Although Production, Employment and Exports have increased sharply, Home Sales have fallen.</P>
    <P>The section on the furniture industry reads as follows:</P>
    <P>All firms report that Production, Home Sales and Employment were stable and Exports fell.</P>
    <P>In regard to the production and processing of paper it is stated that the level of demand has again fallen off slightly.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am being rather unfair because in each of these sections I am just quoting the warning given.  There are many good points too.  The full section dealing with the production and processing of paper reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The upturn in activity has continued. Exports and Employment have remained stable but Production and Home Sales record increases. The level of demand has again fallen off slightly.  Stocks of raw materials and Stocks of finished products are adequate.  Insufficient demand is reported to be the sole constraint to Production.  In the coming months Production, Exports and Home Sales are forecast to continue to increase and Employment to remain stable.</P>
    <P>In all these sections there are mixed comments about what is happening. The section on the printing industry <Col N="570" /> is one of the exceptions; all the indicators are good.  It is stated that the level of orders has fallen sharply in industries dealing with the processing of plastics.  The section dealing with the chemicals industry reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Production, Home Sales and Exports have continued to record increased growth and Employment has remained stable.  The level of stocks of raw materials is still considered to be adequate though the level of Stocks of Finished Products is now excessive.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with the building materials, pottery and glass industries reads as follows:</P>
    <P>There has been an upturn in activity in this sector.  Exports have declined though Production, Employment and Home Sales increased.</P>
    <P>In each section there seems to be a small cloud on the horizon.</P>
    <P>The sector which appears to be the most depressed is that dealing with domestic electrical appliances, radio and television.  I had thought this would be the most buoyant.  With a big sporting event taking place next month in another part of the world I had thought there would be increased sales of radio and television sets, but this does not appear to be so.</P>

      <P>I hope not.  The section dealing with this industry reads as follows:</P>
      <P>A less buoyant picture is apparent this month.  Production, Exports and Home Sales have remained stable and employment has declined.  The level of demand has improved but is still below normal.  Stock levels of finished products however are still reported to be adequate though stocks of raw materials are excessive. The sole constraint to Production reported is insufficient demand. In the months ahead, this picture is expected to deteriorate with Home Sales, Employment and Exports forecast to decline and with Production forecast to remain stable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> I do not want to read too much into this.  The people who compiled this survey will be the first to admit that it was compiled from the answers to questionnaires sent out around the country.  In spite of the air of confidence during the past few months, are we sure this is soundly based? The private sector are certainly resentful of the way various members of the Government are seeking in advance to lay the blame on them for any shortfall in the employment levels prophesied by the Government.  They are also unable to foresee the policies which the Government will pursue and they have not any idea what will be contained in the Finance Bill next year or in 1980.  Until these doubts are removed they will not risk the funds of their shareholders and the jobs of those employed at present.  They are entitled to adopt this attitude.</P>
    <P>This Government were elected almost 12 months ago and they promised instant action.  They had no doubt about what they wanted to do and how to set about doing it.  We now find the Minister for Economic Planning and Development saying in the May edition of <i>Magill:</i></P>
    <P>The Green Paper which will be published in June will provide a shopping list of job creation policies which we will have to debate and consider with the social partners and the people at large.</P>
    <P>Twelve months after the election of a Government who had all the answers we are to be given a shopping basket of policy options.  We must remember that the target from July 1977 to the end of that year was 5,000 jobs, with a further 25,000 in 1978.  Perhaps it was 25,000 all together.  We are now two-thirds of the way through that period and we are told that we are to have a shopping basket of job creation policies.</P>

      <P>Can any entrepreneur or businessman take seriously a Government who came into office with such a promise, not a promise identified by commentators outside their ranks but one that was trumpeted from the rooftops by themselves?  Can any investor take seriously these knights in shining armour who, two-thirds of the way towards their first set of targets, are going to present the people with a shopping list of job-creation policies? They were elected to govern but now they are going to ask the people to make the choices.  The social partners will be asked now to accept the responsibility. First of all it was the industrialists but now it is being broadened to include the social partners. If anything goes wrong, who will be blamed?  The Government will tell them that they made the choice.  However, the Government are there to govern.  We do not want a shopping list of job-creation policies.  We want to see a policy justified in this House by the Ministers responsible and pursued to its conclusion but we are not going to get that.</P>
      <P>Before Christmas the White Paper talked in terms of three years&mdash;1978, 1979 and 1980.  The Finance Bill must be passed, the Bill dealing with capital gains tax must be debated and other Bills must be dealt with.  In addition, the Green Paper must be published and that may not be debated before the summer recess.  A White Paper will have to be produced, legislation must be prepared, introduced here and passed.  Can all of this happen before Christmas?  We are one-third of the way through the Government's &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; programme but they are still telling the people what they want to do and how they propose to do it.</P>

      <P>I thought we would get something concrete but obviously we are not going to.  The old firm is back in business again&mdash;elect us and take the consequences yourselves.  This Bill has two measures that should have been introduced in the budget but it does not contain a number of other measures.  I would remind the Minister for Finance of a motion he introduced in this House on 19 February 1974. In Volume 270, column 1011 of the Official Report he called on the Government to provide by legislation that income tax and other allowances be adjusted annually in relation to movements in the cost of living index but such a provision has not been included in the Finance Bill or in the budget. In fact, the reverse has happened.  It is a strange thing that in the budget and in the Finance Bill there seems to be a strong anti-family bias.  Tax allowances in respect of children were not increased and neither were the children's allowances.  I do not intend to remind the Minister of remarks he made in another place on another occasion. I shall come back to them when we are on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>A married man with two children who is earning between £3,500 and £7,000 is worse off now than he was when the Minister in 1974 introduced the motion I referred to.  The allowances and the tax bands have not been adjusted upwards.  In addition, adjustments have not been made with regard to capital acquisitions tax even though the then Minister for Finance gave a firm undertaking three years ago that they would be adjusted every three years.  They were due for adjustment in the 1978 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking account of inflation and the extraordinary prices fetched by agricultural land, the value of the thresholds has been halved.  The vast majority of transactions with regard to the transfer of land involve farmers passing on their property to their children but the thresholds have not been increased.  Many of the landowners are reasonably well off but we do not want to get back to the situation obtaining when we came into office where small businesses and relatively small firms had to be broken up in <Col N="574" /> order to pay estate duty.  If the thresholds are not adjusted and if the land continues to increase in value, in a few years' time farms with an acreage of much less than 100 acres will be liable for capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat again that a Minister for Finance should not come here with a Finance Bill that includes taxation measures that were not announced in the budget.  I do not believe the Minister means this to be surreptitious but I am sure he understands that the House is the place where announcements of increased taxation should be made at budget time so that they can be identified as that and not brought in here in a Finance Bill in a section that to the vast majority of the people is double dutch and is only understood by solicitors and accountants but affects a wide range of people.  It is not consequential on the reduction of corporation profits tax from 50 per cent to 45 per cent in the 1977 budget.  If it was it should have been introduced then and not here today under this Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>In speaking on the Finance Bill I would like to take this opportunity of making a brief reference to the unfortunate announcement the House heard today from the Taoiseach. In the context of this Bill and in the context of the social problems which confront our society and with which this Bill attempts to deal, I believe all Members of the House are firmly committed to the democratic solution of those undoubted social problems which confront us and believe that democracy, through the courageous use of parliament and instruments such as fiscal policy, as indicated in the powers demonstrated by the Minister today, has the capacity to resolve the problems which confront our society.  In asserting my belief and my party's belief in the capacity of a society such as ours to deal with the social problems about which we are all concerned, to reject totally the assertions made by people like the Red Brigade and people who support them that democracy does not have the capacity to solve social problems.  I know that I have transgressed your indulgence in raising this point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the point is fundamentally very relevant but I accept the indulgence of the Chair on this point.  This Bill was introduced by the Minister in a comparatively brief speech in which he stated that it is the follow-up to his budget speech and that it gives effect, in financial and fiscal terms, to the taxation measures announced in the budget speech.  I submit on the Second Stage debate of this Bill that it is relevant, in order to review the effectiveness of those taxation measures proposed in the Bill, to have regard to the state of the economy as defined in the budget and in the document, to which the budget relates, the election manifesto, on which the Government received their massive mandate in June 1977.  That is not an attempt to widen the terms of reference of the debate.  I propose to stick very tightly to the taxation proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that the entire strategy on which the Government have based their claim to be able, uniquely of all the political parties in the country, to get the country moving again, is their capacity to stimulate the private sector to such an extent that they, stimulated by either direct capital investment or specific taxation proposals, having had the benefit of this Bill when it becomes law, will produce the levels of employment that are required to solve our problems.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that in the manifesto document and in the speeches leading up to the election the emphasis was much more on the creation of employment and on solving the problem of employment than it was on either boosting the profitability of industry or increasing the productivity of industry.  If it is suggested now in the House that the measures contained in the Bill will have the effect of boosting either the profitability or the productivity of industry in general we would not seriously argue with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many measures outlined in the very many sections of the Bill, in the area of income tax and corporation <Col N="576" /> tax particularly, which if they are effectively availed of by the private sectors will have the effect of increasing profitability and probably greater productivity particularly if depreciation and certain other clauses are availed of.  We do not see anywhere any claim that the hoped for increase in productivity or profitability will have either an overall affect on job creation in the enterprises which benefit from that profitability or productivity or that there will be anything even approaching a direct line proportion between employment creation and profitability and productivity.</P>
    <P>That, as far as we are concerned, is a very important point.  There has, in our view, in the Government statements from the time they democratically took office until now been a shift away, in the context of the private sector debate, from the emphasis on job creation within the private sector to the idea of allowing the private sector to get the country moving again. The emphasis, which was dangled like a juicy carrot before the young people last June, that those measures would have the specific effect of creating new jobs, has been shifted.  I would like the Minister to detail specifically how he and his Government colleagues see how any of the taxation proposals before us in this Bill will have the direct effect of creating new jobs in the private sector.  That sounds like a simplistic question but it is not intended to be so.</P>
    <P>Estimations, obviously, will be required in a lot of areas.  In so far as it can be answered in principle this side of the House would like to see an attempt made to answer it.  Why do I raise that particular question at the outset of an economic debate on the taxation proposals in the Finance Bill? I raise it on behalf of the Labour Party because we believe that the disastrous over-reliance on the private sector, in the terms that have been presented to the country by Fianna Fáil, is statistically and economically dishonest because they cannot, in our view, support their argument.  Consequently, because of its dishonesty it is damaging to the democratic process which will undoubtedly come under great <Col N="577" /> strain in the next ten or 15 years when the projections of population growth take effect.  It will undermine the dependability of Governments to analyse problems seriously and consequently to respond with measures that can resolve them.  Thirdly, let me be clear that the Labour Party have no argument in this context at this time in this House with the idea of a mixed economy, but in a mixed economy it is extremely damaging to the private sector because it hangs around the neck of the private sector a responsibility for delivering political promises for which the private sector neither sought nor obtained a mandate. Therefore, on three grounds it is damaging.  It is dishonest, it undermines the credibility of democratic government and&mdash;perhaps in the short term much more serious&mdash;it is damaging to the private sector itself.</P>
    <P>As politicians forced to catch the eye of the media or keep our listeners attentive when competing with the distractions in Argentina or with other forms of Muppet Show which happen to come on the screen, we tend of necessity to be forced to speak in slogans.  Being forced to speak in slogans, we are sometimes forced to concentrate and reduce our arguments to simplistic statements.  When we&mdash; I mean the Labour Party and the labour movement&mdash;talk about the private sector we do not have some caricature of a large anonymous company concerned exclusively with how they are going to exploit their workers and invest their profits.  That caricature is not true and does not exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, your right to intervene in this, but we are talking about a sector which is going to benefit explicitly from tax concessions, and I am trying, in order to assess whether that sector will take full advantage of those tax reliefs, to give something to the House of <Col N="578" /> what that sector is.  The private sector extends from very small companies to large companies.  With specific reference to how the private sector will respond to tax concessions and incentives designed in this Finance Bill it is relevant to refer yet again to what was said by a former public sector employee who is now chairman of the largest single Irish quoted company on the Irish Stock Exchange.  He stated that he on behalf of his shareholders&mdash; of which I believe the Government are one&mdash;very clearly and explicitly rejected any responsibility for delivering to the present Government jobs which that company never promised and for which they cannot consequently accept any responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On numerous occasions the Government have claimed that this would be the aim, that it must be encouraged and that taxation is the most direct way it can be encouraged. This Bill, as distinct from the budget speech, is the first tangible evidence in which we can measure that encouragement and in which we can look in detail at the provisions.  The Bill presupposes that if you give enough tax concessions to people either in personal income tax allowances or corporate tax or by abolishing tax on co-operatives and so forth, you will create the climate of enterprise and expansion.  That is an argument that can be very truly advanced.  If you do that, how can you guarantee that it will produce jobs?  It is purely, exclusively and totally on the basis of the creation of new jobs that the present Minister sits where he sits today while my colleague, Deputy Barry, sits where he sits today.</P>
      <P>It is legitimate and correct for us to look in detail at the measures in the various sections of this Bill and to assess them on the basis of how many new jobs they will create, where, how, of what kind and what stability and duration.  It is legitimate at this stage to look at the thinking behind the various concessions and inducements printed in this Bill which are designed to create this climate of enterprise and expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> In our view as socialists, there is a fundamental contradiction in the way in which the Government in the measures of this Bill have applied their own values to some sectors of the community and not to others.  Let me give examples.  One section of the Bill gives encouragement for employers and directors in certain companies to borrow money to purchase shares in their own company; in other words to take a stake in their own enterprise.  It is a proposal with which we would not have any disagreement.  Another proposal in section 19 states that a company&mdash; there are various ways in which this is calculated&mdash;which in effect initially increases its sales and in the long term increases its employment, will get a reduction from 45 per cent to 25 per cent, of its corporation tax if it can demonstrate that these sales have increased in the short term and that in the long term the payroll, social welfare contributions and so on have increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Without getting into technicalities on Second Stage, both the Minister and the spokesman for Finance in Fine Gael will recognise that the objective of the measure, which the present Minister inherited, was to encourage companies to create employment in the short term.  If the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party seriously wanted the private sector to be the exclusive generator of net employment in the economy the least we would have expected was that somewhere in section 19 there would be some proviso which would enable the employees&mdash;not the shareholders&mdash;in that company to have a say in how the new profits which will be generated in the short term will be invested.  Any company which has surplus capital to dispose of will consider a number of options, and one of those options may very well be to increase that company's <Col N="580" /> plant or to build new premises, both of which are very clearly encouraged in the Finance Bill before us.  Therefore the company in which profits have been generated and which has surplus capital to invest will, when either the shareholders or the board of directors, who are in reality in many cases the financial controller and the managing director, draw up the options for what to do with that investment, and may very well opt for an investment that will maximise other tax provisions in this Bill such as the free depreciation of machinery, without specific regard to the direct employment content of their decision on that enterprise.</P>
      <P>We would like to hear from the Minister how the present Government propose to ensure justice for workers who accept his patriotic call for wage restraint and who forego increases which their enterprise could legitimately pay because productivity, profit levels and growth generally in the manufacturing sector of our economy have been much higher than the norms established in the national wage agreement. Why should such a worker accept and continue to accept those constraints if the product and benefit of the surplus value of his labour is invested in such a way that it neither secures his employment in the short term nor in the long-term?  The provisions of this Bill are designed to give taxation effect to the economic strategy of the Government, the prime objective of which was the creation of jobs by the private sector.  We should like to see the rhetoric of the weeks of June last, the weeks leading up to the election, in fine print and legislated for by the party who now have such a massive majority in Government.  Until such time as this is done, we can only regard all those promises as rhetoric. There is a major issue of credibility involved for this administration and for the Minister for Finance, who has staked his claim as a senior member of the Government on being someone capable of creating the climate in which our social and economic problems could be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like some response in that specific area.  On Committee Stage <Col N="581" /> it would be in order similarly to go through other such provisions of this Bill and to make the connection between the gap that exists between the promises and the rhetoric of June last and the performance of the Government to date.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to give effect to the taxation policy of the budget and in so doing it must be measured against the effect of the budget.  In that context it is interesting to recall some comments that have been made about the economic climate in which the Bill has been introduced and to look at the capacity of the private sector, who will be the enormous beneficiaries of the provisions of this Bill, to deliver the jobs that have been promised explicitly by the Minister and by the Government.</P>
    <P>Both the budget and the provisions of this Bill have been used to give an enormous financial cash boost to the economy in the area of major tax concessions, whether in the form of personal tax allowances or the abolition of certain taxes, or additional allowances in one form or another&mdash; the non-collection of taxes because of incentives and so on which might otherwise have applied.  The result of all this is that there is a budgetary deficit for the year of £400 million, while there will be a deficit on the capital side of a similar amount. Although there is this injection of finance on this scale into the economy, let us consider what kind of economy the money has gone into.  One economist, Mr. Paddy Geary, writing in <i>Magill</i> of April 1978, said that during the years from 1975 until now the economy was in a healthy state.  He describes how, so far as Fianna Fáil were concerned in the run-up to the election, the economy was viewed as being in recession and that there was warranted a pump-priming exercise to renew economic confidence and hence the growth of investment, employment and output.  That was the official view before June.  The reality was that in some sectors the economy was doing exceptionally well.  Mr. Geary continued in that article and I quote:</P>
    <P>This view was seriously incomplete. In the third quarter of 1975, <Col N="582" /> there was evidence that the recession was coming to an end in the industrial sector.  In that quarter, the volume of output of transportable goods industries showed a small rise after five successive quarters of decline.</P>
    <P>The recovery continued in the final quarter of 1975 and gathered momentum during 1976, when the volume of production grew by 9.0 per cent....</P>
    <P>The writer then proceeds to point out one of the great ironies and contradictions that has preceded this apparent recovery of the manufacturing sector.  He continues:</P>
    <P>However one significant aspect of the recovery during 1976 and early 1977 was the failure of the unemployment rate to record a significant decline.  The level of employment in transportable goods industries did not begin to increase until the second quarter of 1976 but it rose by about 6,500 in the period June 1976-June 1977.  Despite this, there was little change in the number of people on the Live Register.  The level of unemployment failed to show much response to more than eighteen months of sustained growth in industrial output.  It was this failure that the manifesto concentrated on and made the reduction in the level of unemployment the central target of Fianna Fáil's economic policy....</P>
    <P>This is the first attempt to put into law the taxation progress and the economic policy put forward by Fianna Fáil.  Mr. Geary continued:</P>
    <P>These policies may be assessed from a number of standpoints.  The first concerns their implications for the role of macro-economic policy. As was noted above, the economy had begun to recover from the recession in late 1975.  Growth in industrial output and exports contributed to an increase in real GNP of 3 per cent in 1976.</P>
    <P>There we have a picture of the industrial sector, the area from which many of the new jobs are expected to come, but that sector had been growing <Col N="583" /> already.  It had begun slowly and painfully to recover from the worst economic recession in the western world since the thirties.  Against that background we now have, not an economy that was on the verge of collapse, but an economy which, despite this apparent health in certain sectors, was failing totally to deal with the problem of unemployment.  Mr. Geary goes on to assess what effect the budgetary measures as indicated in this Finance Bill will have on this problem and he says:</P>
    <P>First, the Government's budgetary measures were biased towards personal consumption, a bias due almost entirely to the various tax concessions. Increased personal incomes will lead to increased demand for goods and services; the extent to which it will be for Irish goods depends on the proportion of income increases spent on imports and on the extent of unused capacity in Irish industry to meet the increased demand.</P>

      <P>My respect for democracy is supreme.  I will move on to review what the Minister for Economic Planning and Development had to say with regard to the budget and the question of taxation, because the measures proposed in this Bill will have the effect of giving reality to this massive deficit and will confer on the private sector massive advantages in terms of taxation.  He states, in the same issue of <i>Magill</i>, in reply to the debate:</P>
      <P>Again I agree that the challenge to the private sector is unprecedented, that it will require a trebling of the growth rate here over the next few years.  But we are confident that this will occur.  In the first place there is an unprecedented influx of foreign investment here.  Secondly, we have got to maintain our competitiveness abroad...</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to say:</P>
      <P>But don't forget the psychological impact our policies are having in the private sector.  Here they have a Government willing to help them and to stimulate them.  This creates confidence, which is the sine-quanon for expansion.</P>
      <P>I know the Chair can again refer to the fact that I am not talking about taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing to do that.  We have in this Bill specific taxation proposals designed to stimulate extensively the private sector.  We are asked, as a House, to either agree with them or not.  As far as my party are concerned, we are not in the business of destructive opposition.  In fairness to policies which we believe have been at least well thought out and considered for some time by senior <Col N="585" /> politicians on the other side of the divide, it is reasonable to assess their likely impact in obtaining the stated policy objectives of this Government. We would submit that there is no economic evidence yet presented, either in the Minister's opening speech on Second Stage, in the manifesto, the White Paper or indeed in the budget speech that would suggest that, on the basis of this Bill and the action taken so far by the Government in the area of taxation, there is a direct correlation between increased productivity, profitability and the creation of new employment.  That is a central point and one could return to it over and over again until such time as the Minister for Finance and the Government can demonstrate that in this, that or another sector we can reasonably expect that availing of the tax concessions, so many new jobs will be created and therefore we can go ahead and say we are delivering these jobs on the basis of their manifesto.</P>
      <P>The effect of this Bill is to confer on one sector of the economy an enormous financial benefit at the possible risk of other sectors of the economy. Obviously the Chair is not in the mood for taking any more quotations from <i>Magill.</i>  Therefore, I shall paraphrase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If this is the effect of the possible failure of the provisions of this Bill, then the implications for some sectors are enormous.  I would suggest it would also indicate an extraordinary contradiction in the approach of the Government to industries such as the construction industry, which I believe is responsible for producing housing.  I should like clarification at some stage of the position outlined by the Minister's colleague in this regard.  If he considers that, in the event of the possibility that the taxation of this Bill are not availed of to the extent he would like, effect will be given to the options outlined by <Col N="587" /> the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  Perhaps he could continue and consider whether the creation of jobs in the private sector, which reaps great benefit from the taxation proposal generally, is considered to be productive and if the creation of jobs for local authority housing tenants is considered to be non-productive.  Perhaps he could explain somehow or other the Government's attitude in this regard because it is my understanding that it is the private sector that builds public authority housing.</P>
      <P>I should like to conclude on the section about the overall economic strategy of this Bill by saying that we view with considerable alarm the ideological dogmatism that runs right through the thinking of this Bill, that sets up the private sector in such a way that if it does not avail of every one of the provisions it cannot produce the jobs required.  Even if it does avail of the options in this Bill, it will have to exceed its previous performance to an extent that it does not believe it is capable of doing.  We have already heard what the chairman of the largest Irish quoted company had to say in that regard.  We have had some indications from various spokespersons for the industry, including the director general of the CII on a PM programme, that the primary objective of the private sector is its own survival. With this measure.  I would suggest that the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister for Finance in particular, are doing great damage to the private sector, a sector which they purport to represent.  They are doing it on the basis of political expediency which can only be considered dishonest.  Unlike them, we believe the private sector when it describes itself so.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes a number of proposals and I should like to refer briefly to some of them.  In fairness, I should refer to the ones which I welcome and which we will support.  I commend section 37 which recognises the heritage of building.  This is a positive move on the part of the Government, one that was long-sought by An Taisce, a move which we will support in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> However, we will be looking for some definition of what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;the provision of reasonable facilities for viewing to members of the public&rdquo;.  We should like this extended by the incorporation in some form or another of access to such properties within the development plans for local authorities and some relationship of benefiting from this provision with the local tourist development bodies and the local authorities themselves.  We do not believe that the proviso clause in section 37 is adequate.  I will be pressing the Minister for clarification of this matter and for some definition of what would be considered as &ldquo;reasonable facilities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The overall proposals in relation to personal allowances in Part I of the First Schedule could be welcomed in so far as they remove certain constraints and restrictions.  Section 8 removes tax remissions for certain cross-Border workers and people who find themselves in these anomalous situations, which can be extremely annoying.  These proposals are overdue and we welcome them in principle.</P>
    <P>Chapter II relates to the taxation of farming profits.  It is the Labour Party's view that no service has been done to the community at large by the artificial debate that has been exploited to produce some sort of divide between town and country, between farmer and industrial worker, on the assumption that all farmers pay no tax and all industrial workers pay too much tax. Politicians are sometimes forced to telescope their arguments into slogans in order to retain the attention of the public.  In so doing, we do great damage to our credibility and insult the intelligence of our opponents.  If one combines the proposals in this section for taxing farmers with the recent Bill that was introduced by the Minister for the Environment, and connects the effect of the Agricultural Rates Relief Bill, what emerges is a fairly serious attempt at taxing farmers which, in some cases, would be less than equitable. I regret that the Government had not the political courage to say to the farming community before and after the election &ldquo;Irrespective of what you do in our society, if you earn an <Col N="589" /> adequate income you should be liable for tax&rdquo;.  The form of taxation to be used should be equitable and administratively easy to collect instead of being based on outdated notions of valuations.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister for the Environment was forced to come into the House to collect money from the farming community, which is direct taxation on an unequal and distorted basis, when that job should have been done by the Minister for Finance.  One can only look at the provisions in this section in the context of what was promised in the past and what now appears.  On Committee Stage it is our intention to look in detail at the real effect of what amounts to nothing more than circular transfers, when all the juggling has stopped, between many of the provisions in this area.</P>
    <P>At the outset I referred to corporation profits tax and to the various proposals in Chapter III of the Bill.  The major one is in section 19.  It streamlines incentives that were established by the previous Government to the private sector.  In view of the Government's total dependence on the private sector for exclusive salvation in the area of productive jobs, and bearing in mind that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development does not regard jobs in social welfare, housing, health or education as real jobs, whatever they happen to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister may well have meant productive jobs.  If he considers that a Professor of Economics who is paid out of the public sector is not being productive, then I would be prepared to debate that point with him.  I would argue that the role of a doctor, a teacher, or a person in social welfare is a productive role and can increase the national wealth.  If he has another insight into the point it is a pity he did not see fit to write it into the article in <i>Magill.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> In section 19, Chapter III on corporation tax, in effect the incentives to the private sector have been increased dramatically and we should like to see some provision whereby the employees in the company would have some say in the investment plan of that company.  One has only to glance at the financial pages of the newspapers these days to see that companies are registering massive profits. It is reasonable to assume that these companies have gone through this Bill. Indeed many accountancy firms in the city have produced detailed and excellent analyses of the effects of the Bill, and reading those analyses companies will find that there are major incentives to directors and shareholders to invest the profits which they are publicly declaring in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>Is it unreasonable to assume that workers engaged in such enterprises and who had some effect in creating these profits should have some say in how that money should be reinvested? If the Government are to be considered as caring about the creation of jobs as distinct from the creation of employment, surely we would have seen some intent, some clause or some reference to that concern in this proposal.  I ask that question somewhat tongue-in-cheek because we have not seen anything to date from the Government.  Even in the area where they have power to give workers some representation, they have not yet availed of the opportunity. I refer to the seven semi-State companies to which workers, as a result of legislation passed by the previous Government, have a right to elect members of those boards.  That legislation has not been put into effect yet, and no elections have taken place yet in any of the seven companies.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not surprising that there is an absence of such a provision in section 19.  Perhaps the Minister overlooked it and I should like an indication from him whether on Committee Stage he will consider an amendment from the Labour Party on such a proposal.  If so, we would be more than happy to sit down to consider the wording and the structure of such an amendment prior to having <Col N="591" /> it typed so that we can get a constructive debate in the House and not impede this Bill being enacted.</P>
    <P>Taking this Bill with the contents of the business pages of various newspapers, exortations regarding wage restraint will be very difficult to put into reality unless people directly employed in enterprises are to be given some say in the way in which the profits which they helped to create will be invested to their benefit.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV deals with income tax and corporation tax and there are a number of proposals which I will refer to.  I will come back to some of them but at this point I will refer specifically to section 25 in respect of which the explanatory memorandum states :</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that where a taxpayer, for the purposes of his trade, makes a contribution to a local authority towards capital expenditure incurred by it on a scheme of effluent control approved by the Minister for the Environment, the taxpayer will be entitled, in respect of the contributions, to the same capital allowances as if the taxpayer himself had incurred the expenditure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick from Cavan and I have been attempting to press the Minister for the Environment for definitions regarding the environment and the role of the Department of the Environment since their name was changed in June.  We have been given a number of assurances by that Minister about the new concern for the environment that permeates this administration. However, in this provision in section 25 we have a major reversal of one of the most fundamental principles involved in environmental protection, of something that has been trumpeted by every conference on the environment, that is the polluter phase.  It happened in Stockholm and at other major conferences and throughout the US; the principle is quite clear in all the documentation. It is that if you mess up the environment you will pay for it; if you do open-cast mining you will pay to put it back; if you damage the environment <Col N="592" /> in one way or another you will pay for its restoration.</P>
    <P>What does section 25 do?  It gives tax relief for polluting the environment. It is unbelievable.  It gives tax relief if the local authorities incur expenditure to clean up the mess.  One cannot consider seriously the proposals from that side of the House when it appears on the one hand that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development does not consider jobs in health and social welfare to be jobs at all, and the Minister for Finance considers that the environment is fair game and that if a local authority have to clean up after you you will still get tax relief for having caused the mess.  Why bother with the pretence of making a contribution to the local authorities if you can claim tax from this?  Surely the Revenue Commissioners are not so under-employed that they need this to be added to their problems.  An industrialist should either pick up the cost of exploiting the environment for his economic gain and absorb it within the profitability or the viability of his enterprise or go out of business.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister seriously to consider this matter.  Another colleague of his&mdash;I presume they talk to each other from time to time&mdash;the Minister for Tourism and Transport has received a development plan from Bord Fáilte, an industry which they say will attract two million visitors this year.  What are they coming to see? Among 16 clauses or so, that Bord Fáilte document sets out that the primary resource of Irish tourism is the environment.  Now we are faced with the reality in section 25 that we will have to pick up the tab for an industrialist who will later get a depreciation allowance on the plant that will have created the mess.</P>
    <P>Somebody on that side of the House should have said clearly that there should be some cohesive comprehensive way to deal with this problem of the environment.  I can only wonder whether any account has been taken by the Department of Finance of the various reports that must have been produced by the officials who went to Stockholm a couple of years ago and <Col N="593" /> to Vancouver three years ago.  There is a section in this Bill which makes it relatively easy for us to do these things.  Does the Minister read the stuff that comes back from Nairobi and is he aware of the impact in real terms of these things on what is regarded by everybody as of prime economic importance?  If so there is no evidence of it in section 25, the implications of which are very serious in our view.</P>
    <P>In Part II, the excise sections, we are giving effect in legal terms to provisions regarding the abolition of tax on cars not exceeding 16 hp.  We regard that proposal as being extremely regressive.  Of course it is very comfortable for people driving cars not to have to pay tax and of course this provision was presented as a cosmetic package.  However, it is hard to see how this could be considered as part of an economic strategy.  It has implications for our overall economy and the environment which will have direct bearing on the Department of Finance.  I refer to a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Ken O'Brien.  I regret I do not have the specific reference, but we know from that article that the number of car registrations has dramatically increased and the ownership of cars is now at a fantastically high level compared with the 1960s.  Since we have virtually no car assembly workers left the result is we are now subsidising and underpinning employment in British Leyland, in Renault, Volkswagen and other car plants in Europe.  Secondly, we are adding to the riches of the oil moguls by consuming imported fuel and thereby adding to our balance of payments problems.  Thirdly, we are destroying our environment and clogging up our roads.</P>
    <P>Our roads are not capable of taking anything like the volume of traffic they are now required to carry.  The progress of transportable goods is impeded.  We suffer the impact of EEC legislation which has designed the axle loads, a decision taken in Brussels on the basis of a road system we do not have.  This is having a dramatic effect on the fabric of our roads.  Many major roads are in need, not just of resurfacing, but of total restructuring. The roads in many towns <Col N="594" /> and villages are virtually destroyed. In addition, there is almost chaotic congestion.  Buildings are being damaged through constant vibration. Congestion is affecting the time taken to transport goods from the factory to the port for export and that cost can be and has been measured by professional economists who have some sense of reality.</P>
    <P>One could go on, but that is just a rough picture of what this abolition of road tax has done.  Admittedly, it did what it was intended to do&mdash;it got the boys back on that side of the House.  In economic and physical terms it has caused untold damage.  More people are now transferring into the car section of the community.  That has a multiplier effect the full extent of which no official in the Department of Finance can fully calculate.  There is a blank cheque offered to people, whether they be Arabs or foreign car manufacturers.  Some benefit might result were the car manufacturers operating within the EEC, but I can see no sense in subsidising car manufacturers in South Korea or Japan.  As recently as three weeks ago our permanent representative in Brussels said the South Koreans are due to release a flood of cars on the western markets, so many cars that the Japanese will find themselves undercut in their penetration of the market.  We know the effect the Japanese car industry has had.</P>
    <P>This election gimmick was popular and, therefore successful.  But the effect is that, through a complex system of multipliers, the country is now being bled of many resources and we are being forced to spend money on areas of our infrastructure which would not have been necessary but for this gimmick. Extra cash will be required for roads.  Extra cash will be required for environmental improvements all over the country.</P>

      <P>The consequences of the abolition of car tax are enormous. I do not expect the Minister to reintroduce the tax before the next election but I would like the Government and the Department of Finance to do the sums to show what the abolition of this tax will mean from the point of view of our balance of payments and increased energy consumption. Answers to questions about energy consumption addressed to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy certainly do not come across the floor of this House.  The impact of this abolition will create a great many pressures on the infrastructure.  There will be a damaging effect on the economy in general.  The Minister is introducing measures the financial effect of which he does not know and cannot therefore calculate.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has said unequivocally that, if restraint is necessary, it will be those depending on social welfare, local authority housing and health who will have to bear the burden of such restraint. Anything like that would be totally unacceptable to my party and I am arguing now that, if the Minister for Finance insists on these provisions, he will have to implement measures for restraint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 (No. 44 of 1960) Dáil Éireann approves of the dispatch of a contingent <Col N="596" /> of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State as part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon which pursuant to a Resolution on Lebanon adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations on the 19th day of March 1978 has been established by that Council for the performance of duties of a police character.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to enable the Government to give a positive response to the request received by the United Nations Secretary General to provide an Irish contingent for service with the UN Interim Force in the Lebanon (UNIFIL).</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, UNIFIL was set up by the UN Security Council on 19 March last when the council called on Israel to withdraw its forces from the Southern Lebanon.  The force was given the mandate of &ldquo;confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security, and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area&rdquo;.  The force was established in the first instance for a period of six months and was initially authorised by the Security Council to have a strength of 4,000 men.  Contingents from France, Norway, Nepal, Senegal and Nigeria, along with French and Canadian logistical support troops, made up this number.  On 3 May, following a report by the Secretary General on his visit to the Middle East, the Security Council agreed to his proposal to expand the force to 6,000 men.  The Secretary General has now asked Fiji and Iran, as well as Ireland, to supply contingents to bring the force up to this level.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided, subject to the approval of the Dáil, to make available a contingent for service with UNIFIL in response to this request.  Under the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act. 1960, Dáil approval is required.  The present motion asks the Dáil to give this approval.</P>
    <P>I need hardly refer in detail here to past Irish participation in UN <Col N="597" /> peace-keeping forces.  I will simply recall that Irish contingents served almost continuously with UN forces from 1960 to 1974 in the Congo, Cyprus and, from October 1973 until the contingent then serving was withdrawn in May 1974, with the UN Emergency Force in the Middle East in Sinai.  Last July, as Deputies will no doubt recall, the Dáil gave its approval for the despatch once again of a full contingent to Cyprus.  However, in the event, owing to a reduction in the strength of the UN Force in Cyprus the UN decided not to maintain the initial request which it had made for an Irish contingent.</P>
    <P>Ireland's association with the peace-keeping efforts of the UN in the Middle East in particular is of long standing.  It goes back to 1958, when Irish officers first took part in UN observer missions in the area.  Our first involvement was indeed in the Lebanon in 1958 and later, when 50 Irish officers served with the UN Military Observer Group in the Lebanon. Soon afterwards, Irish observers joined the UN Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) established after the first Middle East war to monitor ceasefire arrangements between Israel and Lebanon, Syria and Egypt respectively.  In all almost 200 Irish officers have served with UNTSO since 1958 and 21 Irish officers currently serve in the area and hold senior posts in the organisation.</P>
    <P>In general I may say that the role which the UN can play as a peacekeeper and mediator in areas of conflict and tension is one to which Ireland has always attached the highest importance.  It is precisely the ability of the United Nations to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security by reducing the possibility of armed conflict that gives it an indispensable role in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently supported the peacekeeping role of the United Nations, both in principle in the deliberations of the General Assembly, and in practice by our active participation in successive operations.</P>
    <P>Our participation has also a particular significance from a national point <Col N="598" /> of view.  Countries like our own, which might be said to have developed some expertise in peacekeeping, can give practical support which is particularly valuable in the case of regional conflicts which are centres of tension involving great power interests.  Indeed, this can be seen as a particular obligation and responsibility under the Charter of the UN in fulfilment of its fundamental purpose&mdash;the maintenance of international peace and security.</P>
    <P>Having said this, I would not wish the House to be under any illusion as to difficulties and dangers of the task faced by the UN force in Lebanon. The situation in the Southern Lebanon is complex, and closely linked with the overall problems of the Middle East.  I would not propose to go into details in regard to the latter&mdash;I will simply recall that we have joined with our partners in the European Community on a number of occasions in outlining our views on the elements which should form the basis of a permanent peace settlement in the Middle East generally and have encouraged negotiations to this end.</P>
    <P>The current operation in the Southern Lebanon is delicate even by comparison with other UN operations in the Middle East.  As Israeli forces complete their withdrawal, the UN force must endeavour to prevent further outbreaks of hostilities in an area where these have been endemic since the civil war in the Lebanon, and to ensure that the area is not used as a base for hostile activities by any party. The force may also have to supervise and assist in the return and resettlement of the many refugees who fled the area during the fighting.</P>
    <P>The difficulties involved have already been evidenced by the fact that a number of men of the peacekeeping force have lost their lives and others have been wounded.  The Secretary-General has made it clear that the force will be able to carry out its mandate only with the agreement and co-operation of all the parties in the area.  The Government have noted the efforts made by the Secretary-General to secure this co-operation and we <Col N="599" /> share the hope which he has expressed that incidents which have caused injuries or loss of life will cease and that the force will be enabled to carry out its mandate free from interference or threats.  Our desire is that the force should be able to discharge the mandate which it has been given within a reasonable time and that, in helping to restore stability in this troubled area, the presence of the force will facilitate progress towards a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil should approve this motion, it is envisaged that a contingent of approximately 665, all ranks, will leave for the Southern Lebanon as soon as possible.  The practical arrangements will be a matter for agreement with the United Nations.  In accordance with the Secretary-General's request the contingent will be as self-sufficient as possible, so as to enable it to become operational without delay on arrival in the mission area.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that a contingent of the size requested can be made available without impairing the ability of the Defence Forces to carry out their tasks at home, given the increase in strength in the Defence Forces in recent years.</P>
    <P>The request for a contingent for UNIFIL is an earnest of the confidence that the United Nations has in the capacity, efficiency and morale of our soldiers.  I believe too that service in the cause of peace is a source of considerable, practical and moral encouragement to the Defence Forces generally.</P>
    <P>As in the past recruitment for service with the UN force will be on a voluntary basis.  I can assure the Dáil that, if the motion is agreed, there will be no shortage of volunteers and I am confident that they will display the qualities of courage and judgment that have in the past brought credit to themselves and to their country.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When it became necessary in May 1974 to withdraw the Irish UN force, it was a matter of <Col N="600" /> great regret to the Government of the day.  This interruption in the service we offered to the international community through the efforts of our forces in peacekeeping was regrettable. At that time it was necessary because the strength of our Defence Forces was not sufficient for domestic requirements. Since then the build up of the Army and the training of recruits has reached the point where it is possible for us to contemplate a re-involvement in this exercise.  I am very glad we have reached that point and that we are able once again to play our part. Our people took considerable pride in the role of our forces in various UN peacekeeping operations and are always glad to see our soldiers playing this role, a role they play so superbly.</P>
      <P>When visiting the Middle East in 1975, I found that among both the Israeli and Arab authorities there was a desire for our troops to return.  Both sides expressed great confidence in their impartiality.  It was nice to see there was something on which they were able to agree&mdash;the one thing they were unanimous about was that they both liked to see our forces holding the reins between the conflicting armies.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned about aspects of the present operation and seek some clarification from the Minister, although I have doubts as to whether he will be in a position to help me very much because, through no fault of his, the situation is so obscure. I note that the original mandate is:</P>
      <P>confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security, and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the completion of the Israeli withdrawal. The first question that arises is whether there is agreement on the part of the Israelis to withdraw from the Lebanon when the UN forces take over, or whether there is an indication that they do not intend to withdraw completely but only to within six miles or so of the frontier, as has been reported in some newspapers.  It is important to <Col N="601" /> know whether the completion of the Israeli withdrawal is something which is contemplated and accepted by the Israelis as being their intention. Secondly, there is the question of the precise role of this force.  I read out the words used in the original mandate, but since then the Secretary General has reported on what the functions of the force should be, and some of the Minister's words later on probably reflect this, such as when the Minister said that:</P>
    <P>As Israeli forces complete their withdrawal, the UN force must endeavour to prevent further outbreaks of hostilities in an area where these have been endemic since the civil war in the Lebanon, and to ensure that the area is not used as a base for hostile activities by any party.  The force may also have to supervise and assist in the return and resettlement of the many refugees who fled the area during the fighting.</P>
    <P>This does not leave me with a very clear picture of the precise mandate.  It appears from the original mandate which speaks of assisting the Government of the Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area, that the intention is that the only forces to be permitted in the area other than the UN forces would be the army of the Government of the Lebanon. That raises some difficulties because of divisions in that army, but is it clear from that, that the mandate excludes from the area any other forces either Israeli or Palestinian?  If that is the mandate, is it the function of the UN to ensure the departure of such forces where they are in the area or to prevent their re-entering, and are they entitled to use force for this purpose in the last resort?  The wording used by the Minister does not really help to clarify this.  One accepts that the UN forces must endeavour to prevent further outbreaks of hostilities and to ensure that the area is not used as a base for hostilities by any party.  The latter phraseology would seem to imply the exclusion from the area of either of the contending forces, that is the Palestinian armed forces or the Israelis.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> The force may also have to supervise and assist in the return and resettlement of the many refugees who fled the area during the fighting.</P>
    <P>This imposes a very onerous burden on the force of distinguishing between refugees who fled the area and Palestinian forces carrying arms who might use the area as a base for further hostilities.  Press reports in the last 24 hours or so have raised a considerable doubt about the mandate of the UN forces and what exactly they are doing. I have seen press reports which suggest that large numbers of Palestinians are re-entering the area and having reentered it are claiming to have been there all the time and are entitled to remain.  The report I read said that so long as the Palestinians were armed the UN forces let them pass rather than risk a further conflict in addition to the conflict which is already taking place.  If that is the case, it is difficult to see what the function of the UN forces is.  If anybody who is armed is let into the area, how can they fulfil the mandate?  If they are required to keep out people with arms, is this not being done, and is there a consistent mandate and instructions to the force as to what actions to take?  If units of the UN force are permitting the re-entry of armed people into the area, is this being done by all units, is this by instruction, or is there a clear pattern?  When our troops arrive will they be left with no clear instructions as to what course of action to take, when different units of the UN forces might take different courses of action?  Before our troops go we should be told precisely what their function will be and what action they are supposed to take in order to achieve the objectives set out by the Minister in his speech, in particular &ldquo;that the area is not used as a base for hostile activities by any party&rdquo; and that we ensure the return of the effective authority of the Government of the Lebanon in the area.  This cannot be achieved unless the UN forces are in a position to ensure the removal of Israeli forces from the area where they are not entitled to be and to prevent the re-entry of Palestinian forces to the area.  Nothing that has happened so <Col N="603" /> far suggests that the UN force has a clear mandate to achieve these aims or is in a position to pursue them.</P>
    <P>There are several dangers here. There is a broad danger for the whole international community that a UN peacekeeping authority might become discredited because of confusion in the carrying out of the mandate, because of ineffectiveness in carrying it out, and there is the danger that soldiers from our forces and from other countries going there in good faith to carry out this mandate may, because of the confusion, find themselves in unnecessary danger because it was not made clear what the mandate was and because that mandate was not acceptable to different forces in the area.  The situation in south Lebanon is one of the most dangerous the UN has faced, possibly the most dangerous since the Congo.  It is a situation where the very serious choice between acting ineffectively and not carrying out the spirit of the mandate, and entering into large scale conflict with very well armed forces, may have to be faced. We are entitled to know what is expected of our troops before they go and we should seek clarification of this in the most precise terms from the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>I am in no way reluctant to see our forces playing their part.  That our troops can play this peacekeeping role is a source of pride to all our people. Our people and our Army are willing to accept certain necessary and inevitable risks of interposing themselves between two bodies of armed men who have a long tradition of firing on each other with very little excuse. Everyone in this House and in the Army is willing to accept all reasonable risks, including the risks that arise from that delicate and dangerous situation, if we can be assured that the mandate is clear and that the parties involved accept that mandate and will not contest it in a way which is going to place the lives of the UN forces in unnecessary avoidable dangers.  I would ask the Minister to clarify so far as he can, what the position is, and in so far as he may not be in a position completely to clarify the mandate <Col N="604" /> at this stage&mdash;which I readily understand if he is unable to do so in view of the confusion that prevails&mdash;I would ask him to have the situation clarified before the troops leave, and to find some method of informing the House and the people of the task that our forces are to perform so that we can be sure that what they will be doing will be useful work, if carried out effectively, as it will be if they are given a clear mandate, and that they will not be placed at unnecessary risk. Subject to that qualification, which in these circumstances is necessary, we support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion which arises directly from the resolution adopted by the Security Council. As Deputy FitzGerald said, it is ambiguous in so far as nobody knows what mandate our troops will have in that area.  There is no doubt that this is one of the most sensitive and most complex areas in the world.  I would join with Deputy FitzGerald in asking the Minister to enlighten us if possible as regards the exact functions of the troops in that area.  It says here that it was decided in the light of the request of the Government of Lebanon to establish immediately under its authority a United Nations interim force for Southern Lebanon for the purpose of confirming withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security and assisting the Government of Lebanon to ensure the return of its effective authority in the area, the force to be composed of personnel drawn from states members of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings with it all the pitfalls Deputy FitzGerald mentioned.  It is necessary to have some assurance on what the functions of the troops are. Also, while everybody welcomes our renewed participation in United Nations peacekeeping forces&mdash;we accept the responsibility of membership of the United Nations&mdash;we should be under no illusion.  It is not on a picnic or holiday our troops are going. They are going into a very serious and delicate situation.  We should therefore ensure that in such an explosive area as the Lebanon we shall try to <Col N="605" /> prevent at least any grave risks to our troops in situations to which they may not be able to respond unless they know exactly what their functions are.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister's statement that there are more volunteers than are necessary.  This is to be welcomed but I should like to have his observations&mdash;perhaps it is from another Minister we should have the observations&mdash;regarding a report in yesterday's evening papers to the effect that there is a possibility that a shortage of middle rank officers could affect recruitment for the Lebanon. These are all officers and men who would have experience of previous overseas service.  There is also the question of the position of Irish troops in such world peacekeeping areas: usually, they have had the worst conditions and we should ensure if possible that they will have the best equipment and the best possible facilities where they are going.</P>
    <P>I think there was general satisfaction with the manner in which Irish troops served in previous United Nations peacekeeping exercises in Cyprus and the Congo and with the officers who continue to serve to the present day in the Lebanon itself.  They have been more than satisfactory and have been welcomed by every country.  They were recognised as making a fairly vital contribution to the effort to resolve any difficulties that existed.</P>
    <P>Our motivation is to assist at all times in the maintenance of world peace.  This is one of the practical ways in which we can serve that aim and nobody would have any reluctance on that score if it is shown that we at all times observe neutrality in this country and have a policy of nonalignment. For that reason I think we are trusted more than most countries would be and our Army ranks fairly high internationally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion but I should like a little clarification from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to the questions asked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the sentiments already expressed by Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Kerrigan.  Any obligations this country <Col N="606" /> ever had as a member of the United Nations were always met, subject to constitutional requirements.  I am very pleased that the Government have decided to respond to the request of the Secretary General of the United Nations in regard to the peacekeeping force for the Lebanon.  We have a very proud record of service with the United Nations.  This motion gives Deputies an opportunity of reinforcing the very high standard of morale existing in the Defence Forces.  It was regrettable that in 1974 our overseas service had to be temporarily suspended. I am glad that this request for Irish troops to participate in peace-keeping has been made.  I do not think men can be called on for greater service than the service of providing, encouraging, pursuing and guaranteeing peace.  It is on record that throughout the world the courage, devotion to duty, loyalty and, above all, the experience which the Irish Defence Forces have contributed to the United Nations are generally recognised with gratitude and appreciation.</P>
      <P>The first Irish personnel to serve overseas served in the Lebanon in December 1958 and 16,000 Irish soldiers have participated in overseas service.  All of them gained as well as gave experience.  It is good for our Defence Forces, officers and men, to have the opportunity of participating in overseas service.  It enables them to meet the cream of the defence forces of other countries also playing a part in this great role of peacekeeping.  The record of the Irish Army in the Lebanon, Middle East, the Congo, in the India-Pakistan contention, in Cyprus and the Golan Heights reflects great credit on the skill, training and knowledge of Irish soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that of all the professions one can follow, the profession carrying the greatest risk is that of a soldier. It takes a great man to be a soldier, because he must display bravery, courage, determination and, above all, be completely subject by way of obedience. I do not think that the average citizen has sufficient respect for or sufficient knowledge of the vital role members of our Defence Forces play. There is a risk in every walk of life <Col N="607" /> and every profession, but I have always felt that members of our Defence Forces run the greatest possible risk.  This has been borne out by the activities of members of our bomb disposal squad.  That courageous group of well-trained professional soldiers have endeavoured to master the skill of dismantling bombs, something which has not been mastered by many armies.</P>
    <P>There is general recognition that the Irish soldier who goes abroad on UN duty is of the highest calibre.  This has been proved on many occasions and I have no doubt that it will be proved again.  The leader of my party, Deputy FitzGerald, is right to refer to the grave risks involved in this mission. I had the pleasure in recent weeks of visiting the Israeli-Lebanon border. I should like to tell the House that when one arrives at a town called Matulla in the north of Israel one gets an extraordinary feeling of fear because of the rattling of machine gun fire across the border in the Lebanon. It comes from the participants in the civil war that has been raging in that area for a considerable time.  Because of what I heard and saw on the Israeli-Lebanon border I can tell the House that our soldiers will be involved in a serious undertaking in their efforts to act as peacekeepers in the Lebanon. I also visited the Golan Heights and I realise that, because of its geographical position, it is an area that spells danger.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Irish troops will be readily accepted by all fair-minded citizens of the Lebanon and Israel.  Realising the very difficult task which our troops will face on this mission I have no doubt that their contribution will be a generous one. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence should realise, as I am sure the Chief of Staff and the members of the Defence Forces realise, that the mission our troops will be engaged in is not a simple one.  It is full of dangers.  It is perhaps the most dangerous assignment our troops have had since 1958.  The fact that there has been such a response from members of our Defence Forces for overseas <Col N="608" /> service is an indication of the high morale that exists in our Army.  It is also an indication of the courage which is characteristic of our Defence Forces. They appear to disregard all danger in an effort to accomplish the task they are asked to undertake, assisting in the restoration of peace.</P>
    <P>I do not think that in a world in which there is so much groaning and grumbling, discontent and strife, one could undertake a greater role than that of peacekeeper or peacemaker.  All our citizens wish good luck and success to our Defence Forces in this difficult task.  It is correct to say that the National Coalition were committed to the policy of affording all possible support to the UN peacekeeping efforts. In the course of an interview with an Irish journalist on 4 March 1977 I was asked if there were any prospect of United Nations service for Irish troops in the near future.  As Minister for Defence I replied to the effect that the Coalition Government were fully committed to the policy of affording all possible support to the UN peacekeeping efforts.  I said that it would be the intention to respond positively to any request for troops that the UN might make to the Government in the future, subject to the needs of the home situation. I also told that journalist that since taking office as Minister for Defence I had expressed the hope that it would be possible in the not too distant future to release a contingent of Irish troops for service with the UN. I told that journalist that 21 Irish officers were serving with the UN truce supervisory force in the Middle East while a small number of personnel were still serving in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>I also recall speaking to young Army officers on my visits to the Curragh and to Galway.  They were full of zeal and devotion to their calling.  They were extremely anxious for an opportunity to participate in overseas service. It is a great source of pride to any Irishman to learn that members of the Defence Forces are anxious to share their skills with others and to meet members of other armies.  Not only is that very good, but it is very necessary for them.</P>
    <P>I remember being asked how efficient <Col N="609" /> our Army are in comparison with other armies.  Now that the Secretary General of the United Nations has made this request, many ordinary Irish citizens are likely to ask the same question.  There is only one way in which that efficiency can be measured. In their service with the United Nations peacekeeping forces they have appeared in a very favourable light.  I recall reports on officers and men undergoing courses of instruction overseas which indicated a much above average standard of performance.  This is to the great credit of members of the Irish Army.</P>
    <P>The equipment of the Defence Forces is up to date.  They have modern small arms, anti-tank weapons and mortars, armoured cars and armoured personnel carriers, explosives, ordenance demolition equipment and night vision equipment.  Communications equipment and transport have been improved. The facilities available to our Defence Forces are second to none compared with any other army in the world today.  No matter how superior the soldiers in other armies may appear to be, our officers and men are second to none compared with the mightiest armies in the world.  That is no exaggeration.  It has been generally recognised.  I have no doubt the 600 or so men who will go abroad to undertake this very dangerous, serious and difficult task will carry out their duties in an efficient, capable and courageous manner in accordance with the finest traditions of Irish soldiers.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question about the recoupment of the expenses involved in the participation of our forces abroad.  The United Nations are a reasonably healthy financial institution.  Because of that, I have little doubt the pay and allowances for our people will be of the highest possible standard.</P>
    <P>When this resolution has been passed by Dáil Éireann, the men who will be going abroad as well as having to face the dangers of the existing strife on the Lebanon-Israeli border, and perhaps elsewhere in the Middle East, will also have to endure separation from their wives and families. Therefore, one expects that there will <Col N="610" /> be generous pay and allowances for members of the Defence Forces serving with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>A problem arose in connection with our Army's participation in Cyprus. A claim to the extent of £4,600,000 was made and payments totalling £3,700,000 were received.  A substantial sum was outstanding early in 1977. Under the special financial arrangements governing the United Nations emergency forces in the Middle East with which Irish Defence Forces served from October 1973 to May 1974, a sum of slightly over £500,000 was received covering pay and allowances and personnel equipment. Claims in respect of stores and equipment were presented and were under consideration by the United Nations authorities at that time.  I hope the outcome of that matter was satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence will ensure that if the risk is there, as it is, funds will be available from the United Nations and that the financial accounts will be disposed of in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that Ireland's association with peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations in the Middle East is of long standing. It goes back to 1958, when Irish officers first took part in observer missions in that area.  I repeat that their participation there and elsewhere has done nothing but reflect great credit on this country and on the very high qualities of the members of our Defence Forces.  Courage, devotion to duty and loyalty are typical attributes of these men and I take this opportunity of joining with Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Kerrigan in wishing that all the efforts of the Irish Army in this difficult task will be crowned with the success and good luck they so richly deserve.  I am confident that their training and skill will reflect to their advantage and that this country will be proud of their contribution towards keeping the peace in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>That poses a certain problem in that a number of issues have been raised and I should like to have the opportunity to deal with all of them.  This is not the type of debate which should be left hanging and I will try to target myself for 7 o'clock.</P>
      <P>We all acknowledge that it would be better if the need for peacekeeping did not arise at all.  The very fact that a peacekeeping force is called for means that there is a serious problem in the area.  I share the concern of every Deputy in regard to this problem.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the remarks by the Leader of Fine Gael, the House will recall that the resolution giving effect to this arose very quickly after the Israeli invasion of the Lebanon and, therefore, the fundamental and primary purpose of the peacekeeping operation was to effect and expedite the Israeli withdrawal, so that this area would not be an area of active armed conflict.</P>
      <P>That takes me to the first point made by Deputy FitzGerald, namely, the guarantees which have been obtained in relation to the Israeli withdrawal. The purpose of the mandate is as follows:</P>
      <P>... confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security, and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important point is that the strength of the force is to be increased from 4,000 to 6,000 because it was recognised when the Secretary General had visited the area that another 2,000 troops would be needed to implement the terms of the mandate, the first point of which is the withdrawal of the Israeli forces.  As yet there is not any explicit Israeli commitment to withdraw, but consequent on the increase in the level of the force, which is in the course of approval here and elsewhere, the Secretary General will be entering into negotiations.  He is having <Col N="612" /> discussions at the moment in an endeavour to effect an Israeli withdrawal before the full force operates.  I cannot say at this stage whether this will be done before our troops are <i>in situ.</i> It is possible, though not definite, that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>The second point which Deputy FitzGerald raised is what is to happen at that stage.  As I mentioned in my speech, this mandate can be effectively discharged only with the co-operation of all parties.  The force will be under the command of the Secretary General under the authority vested in him by the Security Council.  The Secretary General has been to the area himself and has been in contact with the parties to the dispute in an endeavour to ensure that there will be maximum co-operation in enabling the mandate to be discharged.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald has rightly asked a question which has not yet been finally resolved: what will be the position of the UN force if guerillas resume armed conflict and try to enter an area?  This mandate runs out in September.  That is the first thing to recognise.  It is based on the assumption that there will be maximum co-operation. Should it happen that it would not be possible for the force to fulfil the mandate, the ultimate would be that the mandate would not be renewed.  In advance of that, we are satisfied that the Secretary General, in whom command is vested, is pursuing every possible avenue to ensure an Israeli withdrawal and to guarantee that they will not be subject to attack.  I should like to have dealt for a little longer with these two delicate and sensitive issues raised by Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>The report of the Secretary General, which was issued after the resolution, states that the force will use its best efforts to prevent the recurrence of fighting and to ensure that its area of operations is not utilised for hostile activities of any kind.  It also states that the force shall not use force except in self-defence.  Self-defence would include resistance to attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the <Col N="613" /> mandate of the Security Council.  It is important to recognise that the force is under the control, political and otherwise, of the Secretary General.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt as to the number of men ready to serve.  As of now, 2,600 have volunteered, of whom 450 are officers.  That gives the lie to any report that it is difficult to get recruits for this force from within the Army.  I cannot be responsible for reports that may be given from time to time.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Flanagan that the financing arrangements are fixed under the resolution of the Security Council.  This is a mandatory financing activity as distinct from the position in Cyprus which was voluntary. There will be no need for the Government to make a case to have matters assessed or examined.  They apply automatically under the mandate.</P>
    <P>There are dangers.  This force was established for the purpose I have mentioned.  I hope that between now and the arrival of our force in the area we will have further reassurances. I am sorry I have not time to go into a little more detail.  I shall certainly communicate with Deputies through their leaders or otherwise to give further reassurances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to give us any other clarification he may obtain before our forces go to this area as to the precise nature of their role and duties.  What he has said does not really answer the question as to precisely what action they are to take, though it is no fault of his.  This definition of self-defence does not really cope with the actual issues they face.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls for the immediate implementation of the comprehensive scheme for civil legal aid and advice recommended by the Pringle Committee; and calls on the Minister for Justice as a matter of urgency to take the necessary steps to ensure (a) that the remedies and procedures of the courts are simplified and made more accessible, and (b) that a broad review of provision of legal services and access to legal education in Ireland is undertaken without delay.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to seek the commitment of the Dáil to the removal with all possible haste of a glaring, deep-seated inequality in the society for which we are the legislators. That access to the protection and remedies that the law provides should be available only in proportion to the amount of money in one's pocket must strike anybody who has spared even a passing thought for social justice as a truly monstrous situation.</P>
      <P>Law is the fundamental, ordered basis of modern society and the legal process is the acceptable and practical means by which the citizen can protect his rights and by which he can seek redress when those rights are abrogated.  That it should be available and accessible to all citizens on an equal basis is surely fundamental to the whole concept of justice as we see it.</P>
      <P>In their submission to the Pringle Committee, the Free Legal Aid Committee had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our system of justice is an adversary system in which it is the function of courts and tribunals to dispense justice between two contending parties.  Where the contending parties appear before the courts or tribunal on fundamentally unequal terms, as is frequently and inevitably the case where one party has access to professional legal services and the other has not, the <Col N="615" /> whole system is undermined.  This gives rise to cases of grave injustice. It also creates a situation in which the law and judicial processes are regarded as hostile or unfair by a large section of the community.  This must be a matter for serious concern in a society such as ours which relies on the law as an instrument of social justice and stability.</P>
    <P>That view has been shared for many years by many people who thought seriously about social problems in society and by many Members of this House.  For my part, my concern in this area has not been governed by the change of Government and it has not been brought about by the fact that I have been given some responsibility for subjects relating to the Department of Justice.  I can recall a radio interview I gave when I was first elected to this House 13 years ago and I then instanced the fact that as access to the law was in proportion to one's capacity to pay it was a massive injustice in society.  That has remained my position during the years.</P>
    <P>The timing of this motion has been dictated by the publication of the Pringle Report.  It is not a motion designed to censure the Minister in any way.  It simply calls on him to implement the report in full.  It was obvious that the Minister would await the findings of the Pringle Committee and the same applied to anyone seeking improvements or reform in this area.  The findings of the committee were eagerly awaited by many groups, notably those fighting for women's rights.  Their natural impatience at some stage manifested itself in seeking an interim report to cover the areas of law with which they were specifically concerned.  Now that the report has been published and we can see the extent and scope of its work we must pay tribute to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Personally I welcome greatly the clear indication in the Pringle Report that the committee favour the implementation of a full, comprehensive legal aid and advice system.  It appears to me that only reluctantly and perhaps because they were asked to do so <Col N="616" /> they propose the possibility of an interim scheme of a more limited nature. I urge the Minister to proceed forthwith with the necessary steps to ensure the implementation of the full, comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice.  There may be a temptation to settle for a more limited scheme, perhaps to yield to more obvious pressures, but that should be resisted.</P>
    <P>I shall quote from the Fianna Fáil manifesto but not for the usual reasons.  I accept as genuine the statement in the manifesto which states that legal aid will be extended to civil cases where necessary but I am concerned that the manifesto goes on to say that as a first step it will be introduced in the area of family law. Family law is a very deserving area and nobody is more familiar with the special needs in this area than I am. I understand there is need for civil legal aid in areas that, for instance, deal with the ill-treatment of one spouse by the other, in maintenance and desertion cases, and in cases dealing with the custody of children because in the majority of such cases the wife and children are the victims.  In many instances the wife is the partner who has no income of her own and, therefore, she is at a disadvantage. On the other hand, the husband because he is the earning partner has the advantage.</P>
    <P>Although I am not dealing with the question of a means test just now, I wish to say that in cases brought before the courts where legal aid and advice is sought by the wife there should not be any question of taking the husband's income into account or of assessing the wife's need on the basis of her husband's income.  The Women's Representative Committee made that case very strongly and I wish now to reiterate what they said.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that family law must be covered in an early scheme for civil legal aid and advice.  The success of the case brought by the Cork woman, Mrs. Airey, at Strasbourg brings further pressure on the Government to make legal aid and advice available in such cases.  It is very important that the scheme should not be limited <Col N="617" /> to that area only, needy though it may be, nor should it be limited to the other areas recommended in the Pringle Report or in the interim report of the Pringle Committee.  It should not be limited to family law, landlord and tenant matters and consumer protection cases.  Confining it to those areas would defeat the whole purpose of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the 1978 Annual Report of the Free Legal Aid Committee they deplored such an approach, an approach based on the limiting of the scheme to specific cases.  They see that as creating yet further inequalities and they consider it discriminatory in nature and likely only to aggravate rather than alleviate the present injustice that exists.  It would be better to have a limited scheme.  Eligibility for aid would be restricted not only by the applicant's needs but also by the category into which the problem of the applicant fell.  Indeed, perhaps only part of the applicant's problem or the child's problem would fall within the prescribed category at all. The result would be confusion, frustration and dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>I submit that a lawyer acting on behalf of a legally aided client would be severely impeded in his duty to give the sound professional advice he would be in duty bound to give by the dictates of this scheme.  This, in my view, would defeat the whole purpose of the scheme.  I suggest that nine years' experience in providing voluntarily a scheme of legal aid and advice for those without the means to pay and nine years' experience in highlighting the need for a comprehensive State scheme puts FLAC in the best possible position to advise us at this juncture.  They have handled 23,000 cases of need in which successive Governments have failed to meet their responsibilities. The experience gained by the students and the solicitors involved in FLAC is of service at this point. We should heed that experience and that point of view.  I want to pay a very sincere tribute to them for fulfilling such needs in our society and for the devotion and the obvious zeal they have brought to their work under very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> They tell us that 43 per cent of the cases they have dealt with were family law cases.  They advance reasons for this, as the greater awareness brought about by recent family legislation and the growth of the women's rights movement.  That is one reason why family law cases are more numerous than others.  There is also a very interesting point made by them.  They maintain that it has been found that family problems are more readily identifiable and more easily received as legal problems than some of the other problems that people have in the circumstances in which they seek free legal aid and advice.  I submit also the urgency of the physical need involved in some places and an urgent need for help would prompt people to seek aid and advice from whatever source is available in this area of family law.</P>
    <P>I also submit that family problems may well be a manifestation of other problems for which there will also be a legal remedy and which may be causing friction in the homes and from which the family problems may be arising.  FLAC handled 477 cases of contracts, 138 cases of hire purchase, 697 cases relating to landlord and tenant law, 452 cases of tort and 296 cases of probate over their nine years in existence.  They recommend all those cases as meriting inclusion in a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice.  They see this comprehensive scheme of legal aid as the only solution to the problems in all the areas they have covered during their nine years in existence.</P>
    <P>Their view is very strongly reinforced by the Incorporated Law Society, who have made a very strong submission in this area for the implementation not of an interim scheme, but of a full comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice.  They make a very desirable suggestion also that the scheme, as well as being available to eligible people in the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and appeals from those courts to the Supreme Court, should also be extended to quasi-judicial cases, appeals boards and so on.  That is a worth-while suggestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> The Pringle Committee in their report suggest the establishment of a legal aid board and recommend that that board have responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the scheme of free legal aid and advice, that it be comprised of a chairman and 14 members, six of whom would represent the legal profession.  They suggest as part of their responsibilities that the board should engage in the dissemination of information about the law to the public in general and that they should evaluate the results of this work.  They go on to say that if this evaluation were to indicate a need for any reforms in the law it would be a matter for the free legal aid board to bring this fact to the attention of the appropriate body.  I regard this as a vital role for the free legal aid board.</P>
    <P>There can be no estimate at this stage of the depth of unmet legal needs in our society.  Constant research and review will have to be an essential function of a board established to administer the scheme.  I would be very concerned that the board would not become bogged down in day-to-day work which could perhaps be done effectively by properly constituted legal aid centres.  We have had experience of other boards, some recently established, such as the Planning Appeals Board, which already has long delays, a pile-up of work and which is coping with arrears of work.  It would be fatal in the area of free legal aid if delays occured.  They would constitute an injustice to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The report suggests that a panel system be established, that legal aid, advice and assistance be provided two ways, by a panel of lawyers in private practice who would opt for inclusion in the scheme and that that advice would be available at legal advice centres. I believe that the way to operate this scheme and to get it off the ground at an early stage would be to become involved in a panel system.  It is very important that the panel system get off to a good start.</P>
    <P>We have had the experience of the scheme for criminal law which is now in a shambles.  I ask the Minister and <Col N="620" /> all those concerned to ensure that the same problem will not arise with regard to civil legal aid.  The panel system should be so constituted that the law centres could refer the main body of the individual cases to the solicitors operating in the area, that they would have free facilities to do this and that they could concentrate on test cases and on a more general aspect of a community service in the particular community in which they would be operated.  I fear that a system like this could get bogged down in individual case work and could fail to focus attention on the need for social reform.</P>
    <P>The report recommends the establishment of six community law centres as a start.  I suggest this as a very minimum.  There is undoubtedly need for a total nationwide network of law centres.  I suggest that a legal aid board should give priority to the completion of this nationwide network of community law centres giving the greatest possible autonomy to each individual centre consistent with the whole principle of accountability.</P>
    <P>FLAC point out to us that the limitation of a panel system are that it would be designed to provide in the main the financial incentive for lawyers to take the cases of poorer clients and that it would not in fact be designed to take legal services into the communities of the people who need them.  They point out that solicitors traditionally have established their offices in business areas in the towns and the cities and have made their services available at business hours to facilitate their paying clientele.  In the present system they are unavoidably removed geographically in terms of opening hours from the people for whom the FLAC scheme of civil legal aid and advice has been designed.  In many cases they have little familiarity with many of the problems of the lower income groups.  As things stand the people who man such a system, as they do, exist for the middle and upper income groups.</P>
    <P>For the future lawyers must be encouraged to acquire the skills required to deal effectively with the cases of people of no property.  These are skills <Col N="621" /> in family law, housing, social welfare, employment and so on.  They must also be kept in direct touch with the social services and with the personnel and the agencies who operate in the field of social services.  I have heard very concerned solicitors complain of this vacuum in the social services scheme. They do not know to where they should refer their clients who may need advice from a marriage group, a welfare officer or a social worker.  There should be a direct link between and accessibility to the solicitors themselves, the law and advice centres and other social services.  It seems desirable that, in so far as is possible, the law centres, the social service centres and the community advice centres should be housed under one roof.</P>
    <P>The law faculties have in the main been the preserve of the middle and upper classes up to now.  This is unavoidable because of the high cost of legal education which limits it to those sections of the community who are comfortably well off.  The cost of third level education, and even second level education, is often prohibitive for those for whom we are hoping to provide the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, but that possibly is a matter for another debate.  Suffice it to say now that higher education grants are insufficient. Maintenance grants at second level may be necessary in certain cases, and definitely the position obtaining now under which higher education grants are not tenable at professional law schools makes law a very exclusive profession indeed.  That situation must cease for the future.  Law, like the other faculties such as medicine, exists for all the people and in so far as we can do it, it must be made accessible to all the people and more particularly to the section who need this protection most and who are the very cases who have been deprived up to now.  Access to it must be simplified and the veil of mystery must be removed. Very many people never dream of asserting their rights in law because of fear of the law and that must cease. Steps must be taken to make the law relevant for all the people.</P>
    <P>Coolock Law Centre in Dublin, established in 1974, is the only Irish <Col N="622" /> model we have.  It was established for three basic reasons: (1) to provide a full-time legal service for poorer individuals in the community, (2) to examine and organise with the local people in the area on issues arising from the case laws in the law centres where individual solutions to the problems would be either legally impossible or satisfactory only in the short term, and to adapt the services and resources of the centre accordingly, and (3) to promote the knowledge and awareness of legal rights within the community. The first community law officer was appointed in 1977, and to my knowledge the work that he has been doing since then has been of an excellent quality.  He has interpreted his role as a community law officer in organising citizens' advice sessions on matters such as social welfare, something which is very relevant to the community in the area; he has brought claimants together and enabled them to challenge their own cases and to help others with their cases.  He has done very important work in obtaining group support at meetings for deserted and battered wives.  He has run citizens' advice courses on labour, family law and social welfare law, and he has published leaflets on all these topics.</P>
    <P>These are the areas most relevant to the poor and deprived.  Social welfare may not readily be seen as an area in which the law would be relevant, but in that regard at present appeals officers make decisions arbitrarily which are final and from which the applicant has no redress.  They are based on material to which the applicant has no access and there is no question of revealing the basis on which the decision is reached.  This aspect of social welfare is in the category of wrongs which could be put right by group pressure and which may be challenged legally also.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for quoting FLAC because they are one group of persons with experience in this area. I quote from FLAC Report 78, page 30:</P>
    <P>The basic aims of a neighbourhood or Community Law Centre can be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> (1)  To bring lawyers out into the communities and the neighbourhoods to be available to act on behalf of the people of that community or neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>(2)  It would be open day and evening.</P>
    <P>(3)  It would provide programmes of community education and would assist with the relevant legal skills&mdash;community development projects of self-help.</P>
    <P>(4)  By specialising in areas of law of interest to their clients, the lawyers in the Law Centre would give their clients a very good service.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important, if the geographical and psychological barriers to equal justice are to be removed along with the financial barriers, that Law Centres are not regarded as an experiment; for example, one, two or three Law Centres run by FLAC will just not be enough.  The Law Centre in Coolock run by FLAC can only cater for the people of Cooklock.  There must be a sufficient number of Law Centres to serve each community, throughout the country.</P>
    <P>They talk about community identity and they say:</P>
    <P>A Law Centre which does not have community identity, community involvement and community management will not be perceived as a service for the individual and group every bit as independent and committed as any private lawyer, but with greater assets.  Unless this is realised we cannot hope to eradicate the justified belief that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.</P>
    <P>That is the only experience I can refer to in this country.  Regarding the experience in other countries, in so far as time permits.  I will refer briefly to the experience in America.  In their book <i>Dilemmas of Social Reform, Poverty and Community Action in the <Col N="624" /> United States</i>, Peter Marris and Martin Rein speak of the legal services programme in that community, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Legal Services Programme is difficult to evaluate quantitatively; not all the cases are taken up to courts; not all the judgements are in money....  It does seem certain, however, that both on its own terms of making available to the poor good law and good lawyers, and on the broader terms of breaking the institutional barrier to people getting out of poverty, the programme should be a marked success.  It was also the only programme to induce widespread institutional changes, both in the practice of welfare departments, and the legal profession itself.</P>
    <P>The inauguration of hundreds of new neighbourhood legal services.... had a far-reaching effect on the practice of poor law.  Many private legal defence organisations soon shifted some of their resources into the poor-law field....  The Law Students Civil Rights Research Council began to recruit hundreds of law-student volunteers to work with welfare rights groups and to perform legal research for attorneys representing recipients.  Moreover, OEO created a new kind of legal personnel&mdash;non-professionals trained in special facets of the law who were able to extend the reach of the neighbourhood legal services programme.  Hundreds of poor people were recruited and trained to perform various kinds of &lsquo;lay advocacy&rsquo; tasks.</P>
    <P>University law schools, too, responded to these changes, founding research and advisory centres on legal aspects of social welfare and housing policy. &lsquo;The ferment also affected law school curricula&mdash;new courses in poverty law were introduced in dozens of universities, and some two thousand law students registered for them in the 1965-7 academic years.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>We are ten or 12 years behind but some of these results could be achieved from the establishment of law centres <Col N="625" /> here and we could then look forward to a much more egalitarian future for the State.</P>
    <P>The Pringle Committee recommend that the scheme should cover hearings before tribunals as well as before the courts.  There has been a fault in the English system in this regard so I would suggest that it is something the Minister should pay attention to in establishing the scheme here.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the question of eligibility for the scheme so far as finance is concerned.  The report recommends that eligibility should be based on disposable income and the suggestion is that this income would range from £500 for full eligibility up to £2,000, beyond which there would not be eligibility.  There is mention, too, of contributions commencing at £1 for advice and increasing to £10 for aid and that the amounts would be graduated by reference to the level of the disposal income of the client.  It is very important that means tests in this area should be generous and related to real money values.  It is important, too, that the funds available for the scheme should not be squandered on an elaborate means test system and that use be made of the existing criteria.  Certainly, people who are medical card holders should qualify automatically under the sort of scheme I am advocating.  The Incorporated Law Society recommend that such people would make no contribution at all.  That submission is worthy of note.</P>
    <P>In addition to a means test there is a question of a reasonableness test.  I suppose this is to be expected in an area in which the expenditure of public funds is involved but in no way should this be a barrier to test cases, to cases taken for the purpose of challenging a practice or for establishing a precedent which would be of benefit not only to the individual concerned but to all those concerned similarly.</P>
    <P>The committee's reference to consideration being given to cases of possible social importance is an indication that this is the way they wish the scheme to be operated.  Consequently, I would ask the Minister to take note of that recommendation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> One-third of the expenditure on the British scheme has been spent on its administration.  We must do our best to avoid a similar situation here.  Therefore, we must set out to reform the procedures and remedies before the courts once the proposals of the committee are implemented, as I hope they will be very soon.  We must endeavour to get the best value from the money spent and to ensure that the public have access to simple and fair legal remedies and that they are aware of their rights in this area.</P>
    <P>The scheme should be comprehensive and there should be no effort to work it in conjunction with, for instance, the existing voluntary scheme. A partial State scheme working side by side with the existing voluntary scheme would produce an untenable situation in that some of the professionals working in the area would be paid for their services while others would be giving their service voluntarily, depending on the nature of the cases with which they were dealing. The voluntary organisation point out that despite providing full advice and assistance, many of their clients are faced frequently with other expenses, for instance, expenses involved in the subpoenaing of expert witnesses.  In that area there is no substitute for an effective State scheme that would meet all the expenses involved in the pursuit of justice.  The voluntary body have established effectively the need for a full State scheme and that call has been backed up by the Incorporated Law Society while the Pringle Report is strongly in favour of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of the Minister settling for an interim scheme or for a partial scheme, neither of which would bring about the situation we require.  The cost involved is surprisingly modest.  It has been estimated that the cost of a partial scheme would be £1 million while it would cost £2 million for a comprehensive scheme based on the recommendations of the Pringle Report.  In terms of present-day values and compared with the amount we are spending in other areas and having regard to such losses in revenue as £8.5 million this year by way of the abolition of wealth tax, the cost <Col N="627" /> of a free legal aid scheme is very small.  Consequently, the expense involved cannot justifiably be put forward as a factor for not introducing such a scheme.  It is only a comprehensive scheme of legal aid that will lead to a greater measure of equality for the citizens.  The Minister, in implementing a full scheme, has the power to bridge the gap that exists between the law as it applies to the poor and the law as it applies to the rich.  There must be no question of settling for a scheme that would mean only partial justice.  We must have a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;expresses its confidence in the Minister for Justice in relation to the exercise by him of his functions in regard to legal education, legal services, including legal aid in civil cases, and the accessibility of justice in the Courts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to comment first on what seems to me to be the most general issue arising from this motion, that is, that a broad review of the provision of legal services be undertaken without delay.  Then, I shall deal with the more specific issues&mdash;legal aid, simplified court procedures and legal education. I was not sure what the Deputy had in mind in seeking a broad review of the provision of legal services, whether it was a suggestion that the establishment of a commission such as the English or Scottish Royal Commissions on Legal Services is desirable.  It would be interesting to hear the point developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of provision of legal services I am conscious of the need to take a broad view, to look at legal services as a unit.  It is precisely for this reason that the examination of proposals for reform and development in a particular direction takes time. There is no doubt, for example, but there is an interrelationship between the three specific issues raised by the Deputy on this motion and a very <Col N="628" /> strong interrelationship between the two&mdash;legal aid and simplified court procedures.</P>
    <P>From time to time proposals are made in relation to particular types of developments of legal services.  These may be very strongly supported on the basis that their implementation would meet what is perceived to be an immediate need.  However, clearly this does not free those of us who have to make decisions on them from the task of considering the particular developments in the context of legal services generally and indeed in the context of the availability of public financial resources.  It may not be very popular to take the time necessary&mdash;I mean the minimum time necessary&mdash;to sift through the implications of the broader approach, but it is nonetheless the responsible approach given that the ultimate consideration is the public interest.  It is for this reason I welcome the approach adopted in this motion in that it perceives legal aid and improved court procedures as being elements in the wider issues of accessibility to justice for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>With regard to the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid and advice, which is the first of these specific issues raised on this motion, the position is that I am examining the recently published Report of the Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice and I hope to submit proposals to the Government on the matter in the near future.  Quite apart from the need to set civil legal aid in the broader context, to which I have referred already, it is quite clear to anybody who has read the very substantial Report of the Pringle Committee that the introduction of civil legal aid is quite a complex matter.  I shall mention some matters giving rise to this complexity in a moment but, first, I should like to draw attention to two general aspects of the Pringle Report particularly relevant to the motion before us.  The first is that the committee itself clearly had some difficulty in defining what was meant by a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  Because of this they stressed&mdash;and I quote from page 26 of the report, part I, paragraph 1.3.10:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> The fact that views differ as to the objectives of a comprehensive legal aid and advice scheme emphasises the need for flexibility and pragmatism in developing it.  There is no such thing as a ready-made blueprint for the ideal service.  Consequently, the basic structure and the legislation bringing it into being have to be such that they will allow for the speedy implementation of any changes which experience may show to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously we cannot lose sight of the committee's note of caution here.  The committee, having carefully examined the problem, had great difficulty in deciding exactly what services might come under a comprehensive scheme and indeed in the end appeared to have considered that its exact scope would probably remain somewhat indefinite.</P>
    <P>Neither can we lose sight of the fact&mdash;and this brings me to the second general point&mdash;that the committee's report outlines an interim scheme as well as a comprehensive one.  As the House knows, this is a limited version of the comprehensive scheme, but it is important to bear in mind that it is limited in more ways than one.  The committee have limited their interim scheme, for example, by way of category of case, by way of means test and, by reference to forum, tribunals would not be covered.  Any examination of the whole question of introducing a scheme must have regard to these and other possible limitations.</P>
    <P>With regard to particular issues giving rise to complexity in relation to the introduction of civil legal aid, I shall mention just four.  Firstly, there is the question of assessment of individual legal aid applications: does the applicant, be he plaintiff or defendant, have reasonable grounds for taking or defending the proceedings at public expense?  This involves a detailed examination of all the facts in order to determine whether the applicant has a case in law, the likelihood of success and so on.  Of necessity the assessment must be carried out prior to court proceedings and, for obvious reasons, cannot be carried out by the court <Col N="630" /> which is to hear the case.  This, in turn, leads to the question of setting up an independent administrative structure to make these assessments.  There arises immediately the degree of independence to be allowed to this body, given that there is public expenditure involved.  This raises the whole question of what I might call the mechanics of decision-making on individual legal aid applications.  For example, should the board recommended by the committee decide the merits of each application for legal aid?  According to the committee, at paragraph 4.16.3 of their report, in many cases there could be the question of issuing a limited legal aid certificate, and decisions as to such limitations there could raise problems. Moreover, delays could arise in individual cases in deciding what limitations to impose.  It is appropriate to consider what delays would be reasonably tolerable and what, if anything, could be done in advance from a structural point of view to reduce them to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are some difficult issues arising in connection with the award of costs and damages.  Quite clearly costs recovered should be used to offset the cost to public funds of providing the legal aid.  However, since the costs recovered would rarely cover the total outlay on legal aid, consideration has to be given to the extent to which a person in receipt of legal aid who is successful in proceedings and who is awarded damages should be expected to contribute from such damages towards the costs incurred from public funds in bringing his case to court.</P>
    <P>Thirdly&mdash;and this is a matter of major importance&mdash;there is the whole question of a means test and the contributions to be paid by legally-aided parties.  For example, at what level of income should applicants for legal aid be expected to contribute towards the service provided, what income assessment machinery is necessary and how should contributions be related to income and to the cost of the proceedings?</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there is the question of what balance should be struck between <Col N="631" /> salaried and private practitioner elements in the delivery of the service. The committee devoted a large section of their report to law centres, legal advice centres and to various other methods of providing legal services through salaried lawyers.  The committee saw a number of advantages in the establishment of law centres, which they referred to at paragraph 4.6.1 of the report.  It is obvious that they were impressed by this system of delivery. It is a matter for those of us who are now considering the report to assess how the salaried and non-salaried elements should be balanced.  One of the considerations would be the level of fees which private practitioners would expect for legal aid work.  This matter was specifically referred to by the committee at paragraph 7.4.7 of the report and they are of the opinion that it is a matter for negotiation with the profession.</P>
    <P>The Pringle Report deals with all these issues but that does not absolve the Government from the task of making their own decisions.  Indeed, some of the matters mentioned and others which have not been mentioned are matters which in the view of the committee must be left to the Government. Those of us who have to make decisions on specific proposals are invariably faced with a wider set of considerations than are those who make the proposals.  The committee recognised this when they were discussing the interim scheme.  Paragraph 6.1.1 of page 134 reads:</P>
    <P>Although we were primarily charged with designing a comprehensive scheme, we felt, from an early point in our discussions, that it might not be possible to introduce such a scheme immediately.</P>
    <P>They recognised that considerations which were not pressing on them as a committee would be relevant when it came to deciding the introduction of a scheme.</P>
    <P>The solution of the various issues to which I have referred will not be used as an excuse for putting decisions in regard to legal aid on the long finger. I mentioned them to indicate that there are complexities which will have to be <Col N="632" /> carefully considered if we are to end up with a just and workable scheme. I believe that we must heed those in other jurisdictions who have had the experience of providing and operating civil legal aid services when they advise of a need to plan carefully from the beginning.  In England the desirability of introducing civil legal aid was reported on over 30 years ago. The scheme has been in operation for 27 years but it is still in the course of development.  For example, it was not until 1973 that the present legal advice system, what is known as the green form scheme, was introduced. All of this suggests that it is well worth taking the necessary time to consider the Pringle Report in the detail which it deserves.  In this context we should record our appreciation of the very substantial and comprehensive task performed by the committee.  The committee and their chairman, Judge Pringle, all of whom gave their time freely for this work, are to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>The call in the motion for the simplification of court procedures so that access to justice will be improved is something on which I am sure there will be general agreement.  It is as well to mention that what we want is not a once-off clean-up of existing procedures. I believe that that would not be enough.  New laws are passed which require new procedures, usually following consideration by the courts' rule-making body.  The whole scope of court procedures must be kept under review by the various interests concerned. This is also a process which does not operate by merely waving a wand.  There is an obvious close relationship between the development of legal aid advice services and reform of the law.  This matter is referred to in paragraph 1.5.1 of the Pringle Report which reads:</P>
    <P>... reform of the law and development of legal aid and advice services are related in the sense that a common aim is to provide people with greater and more effective access to justice.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to comment on the desirability of reforming practice and procedure in the area of family law in <Col N="633" /> particular and of the close relationship between such reform and the ultimate cost of a legal aid and advice service.</P>
    <P>Law reform is a continuing process. The two main bodies operating in this area are the Law Reform Commission and the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  The work of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure is of particular relevance to the motion under discussion, as part of the committee's terms of reference is to inquire into the operation of the courts, to consider whether the cost of litigation could be reduced, and the convenience of the public and the efficient dispatch of civil and criminal business more effectively secured by amending the law in relation to the jurisdiction of the various courts by making changes by legislation or otherwise in practice and procedures.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I made some new appointments to the committee to replace members who were no longer in a position to act in the role to which they were originally appointed.  The committee are continuing with their valuable work and are currently examining, at my request, the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to be welcomed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase in the jurisdiction limits and possibly an extension of jurisdiction in other respects would have the effect of enabling actions to be taken at a lower level in the court structure with a resultant saving in time and overall costs.</P>
      <P>A matter on which the committee have reported and on which some work has already been done in the preparation of legislation is the introduction of a system of pre-trial procedures in the High Court which would be operated by the Master of the High Court. The principal object of pre-trial procedures is to have a thorough stocktaking beforehand relating to the issues in an action and the manner in which the evidence would be presented at a trial with a view to shortening the length of the trial, thereby facilitating a cheaper and more efficient disposal of litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> A matter on which the Law Reform Commission and the Courts' Committee will be advising is what is often referred to as family courts.  The term &ldquo;family courts&rdquo; can mean different things to different people, but the general idea is clear enough.  In our election manifesto we referred to the need for a new informal and less institutionalised procedure in relation to family law.  This is the objective which we are pursuing and there are different ways of going about it.  It is something to be achieved by a variety of interrelated measures rather than one single change.  Changes of this kind are complex and take time.  It is better that we should build securely than produce structures that would not stand the strain of practical day-to-day use.</P>
    <P>With regard to court facilities, the Government accept the desirability of improving court and court office accommodation so as to meet future needs of litigants.  It is expected that the new court accommodation in Ormond House will be ready for occupation in June and not, as had been hoped, in May.  It will include a chamber for the hearing of High Court and family law cases.  In addition, the Office of Public Works are planning a new office block on the site of the former Four Courts Hotel which will enable us to readapt accommodation for additional courtrooms.  It is expected this work will yield sufficient additional courtrooms to satisfy the needs of the High and Circuit Courts in the foreseeable future.  There will then be scope for improvement of the structural requirements of the judicial system, and the Government will continue to play their part in this respect.</P>
    <P>Professional legal education is at present in a state of transition.  Both professional bodies, the Society of Kings Inns and the law society, have announced courses of education designed to improve the standard of entry to the profession.  I am pleased to see that both branches intend that a university law degree should become the normal mode of entry to the profession. This is in line with the thinking of all of my predecessors who strongly advocated the advisability of <Col N="635" /> law teaching in the universities.  It is well recognised that the universities are best equipped to provide this type of teaching.</P>
    <P>However, the manner in which the proposed new changes are to be implemented has given rise to some public controversy.  As Minister for Justice I am anxious to ensure that the public interest will be protected and it is in the public interest that there should be a well-trained legal profession. At the same time it is important to ensure that entry to the profession will not be unnecessarily restrictive.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the plans of the law society to put a restriction on the number of students who will go to their new professional law school and the scale of fees to be charged have come in for very strong criticism. The proposed restriction on numbers in effect means that law graduates who wish to become solicitors will not be guaranteed places in the law society's law school and this uncertainty may in the future act as a disincentive to persons to take up law as a career.  I understand the universities feel that these changes under-value their law degree and question the law society's methods as being capable of producing the required numbers of solicitors in the future.</P>
    <P>My functions in relation to legal education are not precise, but I am concerned that any arrangement arrived at will have due regard for the public interest.  Future changes will involve amendment of the Solicitors' Acts and it would fall to me to sponsor the necessary amending legislation. For that reason it will be necessary for me to consult with the Minister for Education and, later, other Government colleagues, to look at this whole field.  The issues are extremely varied and complex and I will have to consider carefully how to proceed.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement can only be construed as a total rejection of the Pringle Report.  While considering this motion I thought it inconceivable that the Minister would oppose it.  Everything in it is recommendable <Col N="636" /> and I now put it on record that I recommend it.  The purpose of the Minister's amendment is to subvert the laudable purposes of the motion by a procedural ruse.  The motion asks for the implementation of a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid advice as recommended by the Pringle Committee, a simplification of procedure to make it more acceptable, and a review of the legal aid system.  Is there anybody with an interest in the improvement of our society who could with reason fault a syllable of that motion?  What do we find?  We have the usual type of Fianna Fáil Government amendment expressing confidence in the Minister.  The real effect of the amendment can only be to shelve the matters referred to in the motion.</P>
      <P>The Coalition Government did not set up the Pringle Committee for the sake of having their report filed in Fianna Fáil cobwebs or to have their recommendations ignored.  I ask the Minister what possible objection he can have to any of the proposals in the motion.  Why is an amendment necessary? The only conclusion I can possibly come to is that the amendment has been put down to enable the Minister, as he and his colleagues have done in many other areas, to avoid taking positive action.</P>
      <P>The House has been asked to express confidence in the Minister.  I would say to the Minister that there is a simple way for him to earn that confidence&mdash; and I am prepared to join in a vote of confidence in him&mdash;and that is by taking the practical step of giving an unequivocal undertaking to the House that the terms of the motion will be implemented immediately.</P>
      <P>What is the background to the situation from Fianna Fáil's point of view? This is nothing new as far as they are concerned.  We were led to believe all these matters had been considered before a certain event last June, almost a year ago, when a manifesto was produced which included some high sounding statements.  According to the manifesto, the Government party believed in the concept of justice and fairness, the dignity of the individual and equality before the law.  It included some specific commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> There was a commitment for the improvement and extension of the system of free legal aid in criminal cases.  Mark you, as is the case with most of the other items in the same document, we are still waiting.  We got a positive commitment that legal aid would be extended to civil cases, where this is necessary, coupled with a particular reference to family law.  As I say, this is not something sprung on the Minister and his colleagues overnight. This is something to which, we were led to believe, they gave careful consideration quite some time back.</P>
    <P>What has happened in the interim? This commission of worthy men&mdash; judges, civil servants, lawyers, members of different interested organisations&mdash;gave of their time freely and unstintingly to producing an excellent comprehensive document.  What has been the response by this Administration to this document?</P>
    <P>The response has been the usual response we get to any request for change, change for the better: &ldquo;There is no call for reform.&rdquo;&ldquo;We are having the matter examined.&rdquo;  Those are the responses to virtually every proposal. If the members of this Cabinet were facing examinations, as will many students one month hence, because of their experience in examinations, evidenced in all aspects of Government, every single Minister would get a maximum 10 per cent mark.</P>
    <P>The need for civil legal aid has been referred to.  The committee went to the trouble of canvassing opinions and views from all sections.  Views are published in their report.  We have the President of the High Court referring to the complexity of law and litigation resulting in inequality from the absence of representation to one party in an action where his opponent has legal advice.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>While, therefore, legal aid in civil cases has long probably been a desirable social objective it has now, in my opinion, become a necessity if the courts are to function justly and with the public appearance and  putation for justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> So says one of our most eminent judges today, the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>We have from the Incorporated Law Society a submission pointing out that it is essential, having regard to the number presently unable to avail of legal services, to establish such a system.  From the Dean of the Faculty of Law in UCD we have:</P>
    <P>This indicates that due to the lack of means, as well as to ignorance about the law, people are being deprived of the opportunity to enforce their legal rights.</P>
    <P>He expressed himself as totally in favour of a system of free legal aid in civil cases.</P>
    <P>I have here a quotation from the ITGWU strongly pressing for a civil legal aid scheme.  Finally, we have from FLAC, an organisation which has done such good work on a voluntary basis in this area over a number of years:</P>
    <P>We are acutely aware, however, of the inherent limitations and deficiencies of this voluntary service. In our opinion only a comprehensive and publicly financed programme can meet the need for free legal services in our community.</P>
    <P>Can there be any doubt in anyone's mind as to the need for civil legal aid, as to the need for the immediate implementation of the report of the Pringle Committee called for in this motion?  No doubt the Minister must accept all the arguments in favour of this suggested course of action.  He will, I suppose, have to count the cost. Here, as Deputy Mrs. Desmond said, he can get a great deal of consolation because the committee went to the trouble of examining the systems in operation in many countries.  They record the fact that a system of civil legal aid exists in virtually every western democracy.  They examined the cost involved and at page 148 of the report they say:</P>
    <P>The best estimate we can make is that the annual cost of a fully comprehensive scheme on the lines proposed in this report, excluding legal <Col N="639" /> aid for tribunals, would be £2 million.</P>
    <P>In the context of the huge sums now being bandied about in the Estimates, in the context of the enormous sums the Government find it necessary to borrow to run the country&mdash;we are not talking even in millions; we are talking in billions in the context of a figure of almost £850 million being borrowed this year&mdash;surely a sum of £2 million assumes its proper perspective.  In the context of the sums I have mentioned the figure must be considered a trivial one.  If we relate that trivial figure to the protection of basic human rights which a proper system of civil legal aid would provide, protection to a hitherto neglected segment of our society, can we hesitate?  Surely we cannot.</P>
    <P>Someone once said that the courts of law like the Ritz Hotel are open to everyone.  It is abundantly clear that the weaker sections in our community are no more at home in the courts of law than they are in the Ritz Hotel.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting there is any obligation or duty on the Minister to provide access for everyone to the Ritz Hotel but I am suggesting that in this day and age it is a human basic right that every individual should have free access to the courts.  If the Minister accepts that contention, if he sees that need, if he has any concept of social justice, how can he hesitate to implement this report?</P>
    <P>The Minister hinted tonight at the possibility of an interim report.  He quoted certain lengthy extracts from the Pringle Report.  He overlooked completely what is to me the fundamental recommendation.  I refer to recommendation No. 10 at page 150:</P>
    <P>Under a comprehensive legal aid scheme legal aid should be available to eligible persons in respect of all types of civil proceedings.  We do not consider that the phasing in of a legal aid scheme by reference to categories of cases is desirable, but it would be possible to do so.</P>
    <P>Can anything be clearer than that? The clear and specific recommendation <Col N="640" /> of these people who spent such time and energy compiling this report is that an interim scheme is not the answer.  Apart from the many valid reasons and arguments quoted in that report against the interim scheme, I should put on record my fear that if such an interim scheme were introduced, it would become a comprehensive scheme.  My feeling, as evidenced and supported by the lack of any ideas on reform on the part of the present Administration, is that if they got away with establishing a portion of a scheme that would be that, and anybody interested in seeing a comprehensive scheme would be waiting a long time for further developments. In fact, he would be waiting probably until the next election but no doubt people with a sense of social justice will not support the Administration which had rejected that report.</P>
    <P>It appears to be the Minister's intention to ensure that this report will gather dust.  All I can say is that if he fails to immediately implement the Pringle Report which clearly shows that legal aid is so necessary, he breaks another manifesto promise.  This is something which perhaps in the light of his performance in other fields he thinks can be done lightly.  I can only warn him that the growing sense of disillusionment about the performance of the Government in relation to the manifesto will receive a greater thrust.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated in a long statement the many complexities involved. Might I remind him that not alone did this commission produce a detailed report but they actually drafted a Bill.  This means that a draft Bill is already available to the Minister. For that reason I am not that impressed with the arguments of the complexities involved.  They were there before the commission was set up and was the purpose for setting up the commission. The commission sorted out these complexities, resolved the difficulties and produced a clear and definite recommendation to the Minister which it appears he is not prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>The effects of the Minister's amendment is a clear rejection of the Pringle Report.  It is a political tactic to deprive <Col N="641" /> the weaker sections of our community of the right to which the commission say they are entitled, as of right, immediately and without any dilution or limitation.  There are no proposals I can think of that would earn such whole-hearted acceptance across the political divide as the introduction of a comprehensive Bill for legal aid.  I would go so far as to say that in so doing the Minister would appear as a knight in shining armour illuminating the corridors of justice. On the other hand his rejection of this report as evidenced by this amendment or any attempt to water it down will indicate a total lack of concern on the part of the Minister and his colleagues for those sections of the community most in need.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this motion to which reference has been made.  It is clear that the implementation of the scheme as recommended in this report will be a first major step to ensure ready accessibility to the courts as mentioned in this motion&mdash; this would be accessibility for all.  In passing I should mention that it would to some small extent overcome the imposition already placed by the Government on the individual in an attempt to gain access to the courts by their increase in the cost of issuing High Court proceedings by almost 100 per cent in the last month.  That was the immediate response of the Government to the Pringle Report.  This was done without consultation with anybody and without any consideration for impecunious litigants.  The implementation of the report will help automatically in the question of accessibility to the courts as an immediate, urgent major step.  There are some other matters the Minister should consider. I would hesitate to use the word &ldquo;consider&rdquo; in the context of the response to all the proposals which have been made, but I will use it on the basis that consideration should be immediate and followed by action.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court. I would remind the Minister that I raised this point over six months ago. At that time it was as usual under <Col N="642" /> examination.  What is so difficult about increasing the jurisdiction of these two courts?  It has been done before.  I remember when the jurisdiction of the District Court was £50 and it was increased to £250 and correspondingly the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was increased to £2,000.  Since it is accepted on all sides that this is a very necessary step, why is there the delay in taking this step?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>From that legendary day on which the lovely red haired woman won the ladies race to the top of Slievenamon and thereby secured the coveted title as the wife of Fionn Mac Cumhall down to the present day, farmers have been rearing sheep on famed Slievenamon.  To many of them it is not merely a way of life, it is essentially a means of livelihood as well.  To my knowledge these men are independent, industrious, self-reliant sheep farmers and are essentially people of honour and integrity.  They seek nothing more than what they are entitled to, what they have possessed for the past number of years and what has been taken from them by this Government.  My purpose in availing of the Adjournment debate is to seek redress from the Minister concerning the flagrant injustice which was done to certain sheep farmers in the Slievenamon mountain area by withholding from them grants under the EEC sheep headage payments scheme for the year 1977, grants which heretofore were paid to these farmers.  They qualified for them for the past number of years, virtually since the scheme was introduced, and now their entitlement is being called into question.  For the first time these farmers have been refused the appropriate highland grant despite the fact that there has been no change in circumstances in respect of the four farmers to whom I refer. They qualified for the maximum sheep subsidy grants under the Coalition Government and before that under the Fianna Fáil Government.  They live in the very same homes and their sheep graze the same mountain area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> Why has their entitlement to these grants been denied on this occasion? One can only assume that the reason the higher grant has not been paid was simply that it is an economy measure devised by the Minister and his Department.  If that is the case it is a shabby trick.  It is the gesture of a Government who are in dire financial straits, if not on the verge of bankruptcy, that they should seek to economise at the expense of these unfortunate mountain farmers.  The Minister could not have picked a worse time to victimise these people by denying them the money they have been paid in the past because all of them have suffered heavy sheep losses due to the exceptionally severe winter. Many sheep farmers throughout the country are now losing lambs and sheep because many of the sheep are still weak and undernourished as a result of the sufferings they endured during the inclement weather.  Sheep losses are high and lamb losses are high, therefore, instead of taking money from these unfortunate farmers by this shabby device the Minister and his Department should come to their rescue with additional money and assistance to compensate them for the losses incurred.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a Dáil question on this subject and I hope that when it is dealt with by the Minister he will find it in his heart to be generous and will ascertain the extent of the sheep and lamb losses and will devise a scheme to compensate for them.  The withdrawal of the maximum sheep subsidy grants on this occasion could not have come at a worse time and to the farmers in the Slievenamon area it is really adding insult to grievous injury.  Before taking this ultimate step of raising the matter on the Adjournment I tried desperately to secure justice for the sheep farmers through the normal channels.  I made strong representations to the Minister's Department and received no satisfactory reply.  I raised the matter in the House by way of a Dáil question not once but twice and discussed the matter with the Minister and with his private secretary to no avail and that <Col N="644" /> is why we are discussing this matter here tonight.</P>
    <P>Any right-thinking person will agree that a grievous injustice has been done in this instance.  I express an ardent hope that the Minister of State, whom I respect as a man of integrity, has not come in here with a fixed file and a closed mind but that he is open to persuasion on the merits of this case. It is not just a question of money but a question of honour.  The integrity of these men has been called into question by the refusal to pay the grants which they normally receive.  If it was all right to pay the grant last year, why is it wrong this year?  If it was all right to pay the higher rate of grant to these men virtually since the scheme commenced why is it called into question now?  If these sheep farmers are not entitled to the higher sheep and lamb subsidies now, the clear implication is that they were not entitled to them all along and it is here that the Minister impugns the honour and integrity of these men.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister and the Department tread warily here.  There is a very high principle at stake.  I contend and assert that the refusals to pay these grants in these four cases that I will outline will not stand up to investigation by any fair-minded man or any tribunal which the Minister may establish. I assert that the reasons given by the Minister in reply to me are not true and cannot be substantiated.  The four farmers I speak for reside high up on the slopes of Slievenamon.  Few if any reside higher up that mountain than they.  I want the four farmers I represent to be identified to the Minister. They do not care to whom they are identified because their case is just, but rather than give full names and addresses I will refer to them by their initials.  In relation to TF of Glenaskough, his house has been gauged to be 900 feet over sea level.  When he stepped outside his back door, he stepped on to the wild, barren mountain of Slievenamon.  He possesses grazing rights over 182 acres of that mountain.  In case there is any doubt as to his right to graze there I shall quote the rates demand note which I am sure is on the Minister's file from South <Col N="645" /> Tipperary County Council, Account No. 03/0203, TF, Glenaskough, 182 acres 27 perches.  Is it seriously suggested that the upper regions of Slievenamon are not designated a disadvantaged area and that his sheep are not maintained on the grazing of this acreage?</P>
    <P>TF and his family have had a long tradition over many generations as sheep farmers.  He has a wife and seven children.  Having regard to the number of sheep and lambs he has he is entitled to a grant of approximately £230 under the EEC scheme of headage payments on mountain lambs and hogget ewes as heretofore.  The Department are denying him that grant and applying instead the lowland grant which applies to hogget ewes only, excluding all lambs and he has been paid a grant of only £66.  By a mean and shabby pretence he is robbed of about £164.</P>
    <P>I next come to HL, another sheep farmer.  He is old stock on the mountain and has been grazing this area for many years.  He would be entitled to a grant of £1,600 approximately.  Last year under this scheme, under the Coalition Government he got a grant of £1,400.  This year under Fianna Fáil he is being offered a paltry £504.  He has already sustained serious losses to sheep resulting from the snows and he is being deprived of his rightful amount of £1,096.</P>
    <P>Similarly, JL of Brenermore who should qualify for a grant this year of approximately £570 has to make do with a grant of £135.  He is being deprived of £435.</P>
    <P>Again, there is MS of Brenermore, a neighbour living high up in the mountain, who normally qualified for the maximum grant.  He anticipated a grant this year of £154 and received one of £33.</P>
    <P>The latter three farmers do not possess grazing rights as such but they are seed, breed and generation of farmers who have been grazing this part of the mountain over a long period and during that long time their right to graze in this area has never been objected to by any tenant, farmer, or <Col N="646" /> landlord.  It is a bit late in the day for an Irish Minister to object or to raise a question now on this matter.  I have referred to the higher slopes of Slievenamon as allegedly not included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  If that is so that scheme is a farce and a fraud.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to right this wrong, which is a blot on the Department and on his own good name.  It is a serious reflection on and an insult to the decent people I represent and must be rectified as quickly as possible. If the Minister feels that he cannot restore the full grants now, I appeal to him not to attempt to finalise this matter to-night.  Let him defer it and cause an impartial investigation to be held.  The wrong is so obvious and the damage so great that I would insist on an impartial investigation into the whole matter.  I have no doubt the outcome would be that right, truth and justice on our side and on the side of the people I represent would prevail.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, met the people I represent and they put their case to him.  He expressed himself as wholly on their side and expressed astonishment that a question should have been raised or that there was any doubt about their entitlement to the continuation of these grants.  He assured them of their full support.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Hussey, is in doubt about this matter I ask him to consult the Minister for Agriculture, if he has not already done so, because his views are vital as the Minister directly concerned.  He has merely delegated powers to his junior Minister, Deputy Hussey.  The irony, absurdity and hypocrisy of this situation are best illustrated and understood if I say that the type of grant I now seek for these sheep farmers is the very same type of grant paid to the same people in the very same circumstances by the same Minister, Deputy Gibbons, when he was Minister in the previous Fianna Fáil Government and continued by Deputy Clinton, the former Minister for Agriculture, and his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy M.P. Murphy for the past four years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> The House, the country and especially the men of Kickham's county and Slievenamon are entitled to have the truth of the whole matter as to why the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons has changed his mind, if he has done so.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister, or the Minister in charge of agriculture, to say how he feels about this mean and petty act done in his name to the sheep farmers of Slievenamon.  In particular, the views of Deputy Gibbons on this subject would be very illuminating and I ask his junior Minister to ensure that he is not pre-empted from giving that information to the House.  I conclude by saying that if the Minister feels that the farmers of Slievenamon would be content with the sop he has given them and the treatment he has meted out to them, he has another guess coming. In the words of a certain well known lady, so far as they are concerned, it is not &ldquo;bloody likely&rdquo; that they will accept this from any Minister.</P>

      <P>First, I want to refute the allegations made by Deputy Treacy that the present Fianna Fáil Government are depriving those sheep farmers of their grants because the main cause of the delay in having this matter clarified is a new clause which was incorporated in the scheme on 1 June 1977 during the term of the last Coalition Government which required herd owners to declare the townland and district electorate division in which their sheep were substantially maintained.  So, it is not true that the present Fianna Fáil Government are depriving those farmers of their grants because the new clause in the regulations was introduced by the Government of which Deputy Treacy was a supporter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seven flock owners in question have mountain grazing rights in the <Col N="648" /> district electoral division of Garrangiven, which is not designated as a disadvantaged area.  Three of the seven also claimed to have mountain grazing rights in other district electoral divisions, Cloneen, Kilcash and Kiltinan which are only partially designated as disadvantaged.  They have, however, been unable to furnish evidence of their stated rights in these areas.  Consultations with the Land Commission have also failed to establish that any of these flockowners have grazing rights in the area.</P>
    <P>The district electoral divisions concerned are located on the mountain of Slievenamon which reportedly is largely unfenced.  Sheep put to graze on the mountains effectively have access to the whole of the upper reaches.  It is proposed to have a general inspection of the area undertaken with a view to establishing once and for all to what extent the flockowners concerned have access to suitable mountain grazings for their sheep.  I suggest that perhaps Deputy Treacy arrange with the individual flockowners concerned to submit to the Department an authenticated statement indicating, first, the period over which they have traditionally grazed their sheep on the mountains and, secondly, the particular areas of the mountain to which their sheep had access.  If, as he claims these people have grazed their mountain traditionally unchallenged over a period of years they may well have legally established grazing rights for the areas of the mountain grazed by their sheep.  I can assure the Deputy that if he submits this evidence to my Department there would be no delay in having the grants paid.</P>

I understand that initial steps towards the holding of arbitration proceedings were taken by the corporation in the autumn of 1976. I cannot say when these proceedings are likely to be completed.</P>
      <P>Until the outcome of the arbitration proceedings is known, it is not possible to determine to what extent the cost of the remedial works proposed by the corporation would have to be met by additional borrowings, and consequently what additional costs would be entailed for the Exchequer. Obviously no decision on financing can be given by me until I can judge the financial repercussions of the proposal on the Exchequer.  Any decision which I might make regarding the acceptance or otherwise of liability for financing the remedial works could prejudice the outcome of the arbitration proceedings.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the carrying out of any urgent remedial works in individual houses is not dependent on a decision on financing.

      <P>There are several hundred applications for housing grants for improvement works to council houses at present in various stages of consideration in my Department.  The identification of these cases and the collating of the information would make inordinate demands on the staffing resources of the Department.

      <P>Most of the applications for improvement grants presently under consideration are related to the provision of extra rooms, bathrooms, water and sewerage facilities and so on and, provided that the conditions for the payment of such grants have been complied with, they will qualify for grants ranging from £200 to £600 for each dwelling. In some cases grants have already been allocated but not yet claimed.  If the Deputy wishes to have details of any specific proposal for such improvement works, I will arrange to let him have the required information.</P>
      <P>Only one proposal for remedial works to council houses is presently before my Department for consideration.

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I would ask for permission to make a short statement.</P>
      <P>It is with great sadness that I inform the House of the news given on the radio a short time ago of the death of Signor Aldo Moro, former Prime Minister of Italy.  The agony suffered by his wife and family and by his colleagues during his long captivity must have been almost beyond endurance. As a member of the Government of Italy, as its Prime Minister, we had a particular affinity with Signor Moro and this affinity was enhanced on our becoming a member of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>I met Signor Moro first when I visited Rome in the course of my tour of the capitals of the Six when I was seeking support for our application for membership of the European Communities. I can say that no person was more friendly or better disposed to our application than was Signor Moro.  In his capacity as Foreign Minister he attended the first European Council meeting that was held in Dublin and I know that before and since that meeting he had a particular interest in the progress of Ireland and its people, especially in our capacity as members of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By his death Ireland has lost a very good friend and I know Members will join with me in expressing our utter <Col N="550" /> condemnation of those responsible for his death.  At the recent meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen I had the opportunity of assuring my colleagues of our full co-operation in the attempts being made to stamp out terrorism and to rid Europe of this evil. On behalf of all Members of the Dáil and on behalf of the Government, I would like to express to Signor Moro's wife and family and to Signor Andreotti, the Prime Minister of Italy, and to all Signor Moro's former colleagues our deepest sympathy in their sad loss and bereavement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, as Minister for Foreign Affairs experienced the friendship and concern of Signor Moro for this country and his interest in what affected us.  The tragedy of his death at the hands of terrorists touches us all, whatever our political creed, our country or our religion.  He was kidnapped in an attempt to blackmail the democratic Italian state into perverting the course of justice by releasing before the completion of their trial persons charged with terrorist offences.  He died to vindicate the principle that freedom must be preserved against lawlessness and order against anarchy.  Democratic Governments cannot and must not betray their people's trust in them by conceding to blackmail of a small minority of violent men and women who seek to impose their political philosophy, if one can dignity it by that name, upon the majority by force.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my party and, in conjunction with the Taoiseach, on behalf of this State, we declare our solidarity with the Italian Government at this tragic moment in the history of that great country.  To Signor Moro's family we wish to convey our deep and heartfelt sympathy and our sorrow that their long agony has ended thus.  May God comfort them and help them to bear their loss.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to join with the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing our sincere sympathy with the family of Signor Moro.  I never had an opportunity of meeting Signor Moro but, <Col N="551" /> by all accounts, he was a most dedicated and highly respected statesman. It is very difficult for ordinary people to get any insight into the minds of the men and women responsible for this dastardly act.  The premeditation and savagery of the murder is something very difficult indeed for ordinary people to apprehend but the agony of Signor Moro and his family has, I think, been very deeply felt be everybody.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my sympathy, too, with the Italian Government and the Italian people.  To be faced with the decision that that Government were faced with cannot be fully appreciated by anyone who has not had to face such a decision.  It is an extremely difficult decision, a decision not to give in to this horrible type of blackmail which would seek to barter a fellow human being, particularly when the life of a colleague is at stake.  I believe that everyone in this House, in authority, those who have accepted the mandate of the people, will agree that in the interests of democracy it was the only decision, difficult though it was, that could be taken.</P>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and the leader of Fine Gael in expressing on behalf of the Labour Party our sorrow and our sincere sympathy with the family and relatives and colleagues of Signor Moro.</P>
